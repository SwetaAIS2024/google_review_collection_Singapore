The noodles are also very flavouful having soaked up the prawn broth and gravy. Quite strong umami taste.\nThe chilli is slightly sour and spicy, contrasts well with the noodle broth, pairs well.\n\nMust eat, will order again next time!",

Have tried their Fried Kway Teow, Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee & Chicken Fried Rice on multiple occasions (More than 20 times) consistency in flavour is always there!\n\nDid I not mention that the price has been $4 ever since pre-covid days and it still stands as such. The takeaway box is FOC as well, no such thing as 20 or 30 cents charge. Highly recommend everyone who sees this review to try it out!",
