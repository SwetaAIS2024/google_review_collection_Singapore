Jamie W,4,"Pizzas, Craft Cocktails and Craft Beers - you know itâ€™s going to be good. We had a great meal at Yeastside where we ordered their Cheese and Honey pizza, burrata salad, mentaiko mac and cheese and couple of craft beers. The pizza was pretty awesome with a good sourdough beneath. The place and food are all great but the location, ambience and atmosphere are quite substandard. The dining area outside, which is part of Lyf, feels like a cheap playground area or one of those places to hold a MacDonalds party. Perhaps good for families and big groups but wouldnâ€™t recommend it for dates. Will be back again to try more of those pizzas though!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111972747533251569870/reviews
Ashley GHQ,5,"This was my second time dining here, and I still love the food! Every dish was a hitâ€”the Foursome and Honey pizza was flavorful with a perfectly chewy and tasty dough. I ordered the Caulihummus again, and it didnâ€™t disappoint. The Smoked Salmon Salad was a refreshing palate cleanser.

They had a Wednesday deal on margaritas, so we tried the Yuzu Margarita. When Max, one of the staff, checked on us, we mentioned it was a bit too sour. Shortly after, he surprised us with another roundâ€”this time mixed with a touch of mangoâ€”on the house, and it was delicious!

Max also noticed my friend and me struggling to take a photo and kindly offered to help. Both of us agreed that the dining experience was amazing, thanks to the outstanding food and exceptional service.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106017791580800646792/reviews
Bert Grobben,4,"Lovely beers! I came for Craft, and I got what I wanted. Did not try the food but what I saw passing by looked good and smelled good.

The only downside is that the seating area is totally uninspiring and loud. Not inviting at all to enjoy the wonderful beer in peace.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112544204326995021121/reviews
Chris PJ,4,"Chill place for pizza and beer. Their thin-crust pizzas are made on the spot, so you need to wait a bit for your order to arrive. Extensive selection of craft beers as well.
I would have given five stars but the service really needs improvement. They served the truffle fries first and forgot to give me my beer until I asked for it. ðŸ¥² like if they really want to make money selling beer, they should serve beer faster, gosh. The pizza ticks all the boxes: fresh, generous toppings, and piping hot.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112833111090547804463/reviews
Katie Wichser,3,"Visited mid afternoon on a Sunday. I order my first beer and pizza at the counter. Found a table and sat down to get some work done.
My glass sat empty for over 10 minutes. No one came to see if I wanted another one. Eventually I went up to the counter and ordered another.

It was happy hour when I went in.  I thought the lady who helped me told me the 2 beers that were marked on the large menu hung over the taps were 50% off. Unfortunately when I got my check turns out it I must have misheard, it was a full pint for a half pint price (no great savings, only a $4 difference)

The food was delicious!  The service was not great. And I feel the prices are high. Not sure Iâ€™ll return anytime soon. :( $67 for 2 pints and a personal pizza
