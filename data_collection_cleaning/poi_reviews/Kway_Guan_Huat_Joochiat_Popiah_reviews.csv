Jaze Ong (ÁéãÂ≠ê),2,"I was really excited to hear my favorite DJ, Yasmine from Class 95, mention this store in the programme segment where Singaporeans rated it the best ‚ÄúBo Bian.‚Äù However, when I visited, I realized it wasn‚Äôt a place for chilling as there were no seats‚Äîit‚Äôs purely for takeaways.

In terms of the food itself, I can‚Äôt comment much since it‚Äôs meant for takeaway, so I couldn‚Äôt enjoy it fresh on the spot.

Additionally, the timing listed on Google stated that the store opens at 10 AM, but when I arrived, the signboard displayed operating hours from 11 AM to 2 PM.

After experiencing it myself, I personally wouldn‚Äôt rank it as the best in Singapore. It‚Äôs decent, but at $4 per piece compared to most places charging around $2 - $3+, it feels a bit pricey. Most importantly, I wouldn‚Äôt make a special trip there just for it‚Äîunless, perhaps, one day they offer seating for customers.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109714347397424012054/reviews
Dale Mac,4,"Best Popiah skin in my opinion and definitely worth the visit if you are in the area.

Not cheap at $4 per piece but don't be put off by the price as each one is huge and packed full. 1 of these is  more than enough for one person if you are the kind that can go through 2 of them at other Popiah stalls found in hawker centers.

The ingredients are well made and flavourful; and most importantly to me is that the vegetables are not overcooked and mushy. They still have good mouthfeel. The filling is very savoury and the sweet sauce is not sickly. For those of you who like chili...then theirs is very very spicy indeed. (Personally I ask them to put less)

Please be prepared to wait a little bit for your order.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113950514812482140406/reviews
Lay-On Le,5,"Hands down the best popiah in Singapore. From the fresh slightly chewy popiah skin, to the fruity not-too-sweet sauce, to the fillings that are all cooked just right and packed beautifully. Yes it takes a bit longer of time because they make it fresh when you order. The best way to eat is just put the whole thing in your mouth in one go. Yum! For $4 per huge roll that is burst with freshness and flavors, I don't know what people can complain about. No other popiah that I've tried that are cheaper can top this one, or making me keep thinking about it afterwards.  Thank you for keeping your family tradition and sharing with others. üôè",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116926301178081737294/reviews
SK Ho,5,"Finally got a chance to have this popiah for lunch today. Each cost $4, but it is huge! I actually feel full eating just one. But again,  i am a small eater.
The freshly prepared popiah skin is thick enough to hold the huge portion of popiah without breaking. The chilli is great for me, but could be slightly spicy for some. The turnip and carrot texture is just right, not the very soft type. I am a popiah person and this stall is where i will go back again.
The staff who served me was very kind and courteous. She highly recommended me the achar which i didnt buy as i already have one from another stall at home. I would be back the next time for the achar.
I am also thinking of ordering the set the next time for home party.
The stall also sell sweet sauce, kuey pie tee cups, and even fried garlic.
Do take note that they only accept cash. No paylah or paywave.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106052152130933399046/reviews
