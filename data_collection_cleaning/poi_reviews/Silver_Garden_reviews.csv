C,4,"Silver Garden at HortPark is one of the best highlights of this peaceful green space in Alexandra. Known for its striking silver, grey, and pale-green foliage, it offers a visually refreshing experience. A notable feature is the polished metal artwork displayed among the greenery, adding a modern, artistic contrast to the garden’s natural surroundings. A great spot for a leisurely stroll or photography—definitely worth visiting when exploring HortPark.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
