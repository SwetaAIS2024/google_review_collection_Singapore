Ivy L,5,"We wanted to build a laundry shelf and we found this place for chrome racks. We contacted them via WhatsApp and they even email us the official quotation. Once we confirmed the items we want, we drove down to self collect. Very nice uncle and aunty helping us when we collect our orders. Uncle helped us push to the Carpark as we didn’t know we could have just drove to level 2 to be nearer to their unit. Item was wrong in the box and the person we contacted even send down the correct item to change. Good price too! Support local business and buy direct from them!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116481361859991556004/reviews
Caleb Charles,5,"Writing this review as I am extremely pleased and satisfied with Jin Yu shelving company. Product quality is good (3-tier rack, posts and wheels) as well as top notch, professional, customer service.

They were also well prepared with extra sets of poles with 2 sizes so I could assess during instalment which fit better. Definitely recommending Jin Yu’s shelving service!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114336269150424905324/reviews
