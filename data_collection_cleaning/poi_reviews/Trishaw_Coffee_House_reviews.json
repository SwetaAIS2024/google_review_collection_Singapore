It might be because they were short staffed.\n\nSkip the Asian dishes like their rice and noodles. XO fried rice tasted too salty. Ordered laksa but unfortunately the gravy tasted closer to curry gravy than laksa gravy.\nThe western dishes tasted average.",

      "text": "We certainly enjoyed the food and service. Cutleries are clean. Laksa soup is well balanced, not too spicy. Curry chicken is also yummy, not spicy at all. Suitable for children and people who donâ€™t take spicy food. The accompanying rice is very well plated, even use banana leaf. Itâ€™s a delightful surprise for us. Hor fan can taste the wok hey, good. We think itâ€™s quite under-rated, given the quality of food that we tried. The billing receipt also quite nostalgic, hand-written old-school style.",

I had to rush to the washroom twice before the meeting ended.\n\nThat was my first time to Trishaw Cafe n certainly my LAST time there!!",
