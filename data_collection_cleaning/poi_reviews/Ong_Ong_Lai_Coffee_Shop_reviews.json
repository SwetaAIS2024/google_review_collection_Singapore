      "text": "I am a bit unsatisfied by the serving time from Mawar Thai Stall. It was slow simply because i requested for my pineapple egg fried rice to have no chilli and to replace the prawn with chicken (i am allergic to shellfish), so i think the cooks got confused by my requests.\n\nBut the food itself was actually really good. The rice was flavourful and fragrant. The egg yolk melts in my mouth and the juicy pineapple is packed with a burst of sweet and sour. However, the chicken tastes too ‚Äúchickeny,‚Äù if that makes sense.\n\nOng ong lai is also very clean compared to most hawker centres i have visited.",
