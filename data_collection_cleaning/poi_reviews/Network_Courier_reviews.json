      "text": "Had a good experience sending a passport overseas. Door to door was $46.90 from SG to Melbourne. Easy to communicate with via call and whatsapp. I was hesitant as I hadn’t heard of network courier before, but the staff at the airport info counter assured that they are well established and the airport uses their services regularly. Setting up the courier process was easy via whatsapp, and payment easy via paynow. I only had an issue with the pick up window being too long (consignment confirmed at 10:30am, and courier pick up was said to be before 5:30pm). I was on my way home when the courier guy called me to say he was at my house at 11:30am. He said he couldn’t wait 15min for me to come back which is understandable, but I was a little taken back by his abruptness “How?? You not home?? How??”. The service person on WhatsApp said that the window is usually 9am - 1pm and 2-5:30pm which would have been much better info for me to plan my time accordingly. Thankfully it was easy to reschedule the pick up at a fee of $5. I also had to amend the receiver address and the service staff on whatsapp was very attentive to make sure it was corrected. Zai followed up closely to make sure the document arrived safely. Thank you so much!",
