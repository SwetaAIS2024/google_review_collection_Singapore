The live music was lit, bringing on the crowd to sing and dance through the night.\n\nFriendly and attentive staffs made sure that our table is well taken care of and our bellies happy. The food and drinks we ordered, I particularly enjoyed the sticky chicken wings which were juicy and flavorful. We enjoyed the drinks, frozen margaritas, and signature cocktails.\n\nThe atmosphere was vibrant and lively, with a stunning view of the river that added to the overall ambiance.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Pulse Live to anyone who loves live music and good vibes. Great energy here, no doubt!",
