For 3 pax, we ordered 1 pot of da hong pao,  2 mixed ribs soup, 1 Mee Sua soup, 1 fried Ngoi Hiong, 1 tau gee, 1 cabbage and 1 fried you tiao. The only gripe is the white rice is too dry and of low quality. Other than that, service was good and soup was replenished.",

The server took notice of our soup and kept coming back to top up. Wished that the portion could be bigger for the price paid. Tau pok came only in a few pieces, but tau kee were more.",

I'd probably be here weekly.\nFinal photo says all.",
