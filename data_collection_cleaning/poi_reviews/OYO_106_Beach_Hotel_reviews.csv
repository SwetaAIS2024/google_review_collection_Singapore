Kurniawan Ibra,5,"In 2018 i was there having family vacation to singapore, the room is nice but in 11 at night the room's light was off. I feel its weird because i said to my mom "" dont turn off all the light"", my mom did but as i say it was off. Thats my story all the room are good and there is some park in the middle off the building (it was 2018).",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114200620727005569806/reviews

Sarah S,1,"The bathroom was horrendous, the beds were horrible, staff were sassy and the towels were threadbare. Good location is the only thing going for it.
The place obviously hadnâ€™t been cleaned in ages, with dust and mould clearly visible in the room.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117087983745728940455/reviews
sam morrow,4,"Location is fantastic. Very close to the Bugis MRT station  (exit D is the closest). Rooms have enough space and sockets. Decent beds and cleaning is good. Lift to get to all floors, reception desk is on level 2 with friendly staff that have good knowledge of Singapore. Very close to lots of restaurants and a couple of shopping centre's. Not a luxury hotel but very good for the price. Free WiFi (need a code when you check in) and air conditioning both worked well and were much appreciated, room has a small fridge as well.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110142073113483148207/reviews
