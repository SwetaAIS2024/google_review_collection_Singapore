      "text": "If there is a choice, I think I will not even rate them a star. The counter service was really slow. We have to spend 2 hours plus to get through an application.\n\nFirst of all, the forms found online are not readily available at the counter and we have to access the website from our phones to fill up the forms and email the branch so that they can print it out for our acknowledgement. Super inconvenient. Unlike other banks where there are iPads around for customer's convenience.\n\nSecondly the staff at the counter is the least helpful. She stared at us while we struggled filling up the forms in our phone. When asked, she will reluctantly advise the steps while looking at her own screen without even looking up.\n\nIt took us quite a while to do it. When we finally completed the forms and left, someone from the branch called much later to inform us that we need to go back again the next day as the signature is not similar to what's in the system.\n\nFrom the inefficiency to attitude and lack of interest in serving our request, I definitely will not want to go back to the branch again.",
