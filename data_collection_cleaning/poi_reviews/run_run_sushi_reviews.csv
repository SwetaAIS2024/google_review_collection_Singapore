Pudding -,3,"Bought the Expert level Sashimi Noodles at $69 (~550g) which came with two bowls of sauce (which is the same size as the sushi). It was nice and fresh but pricey. Plus the sauce was a waste, didn't even used half a bowl of sauce to finish the noodles. Not a huge fan of sauce as it was too sour to go with the noodles.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114962989664509681415/reviews
FoodMakesCalHappy,3,"Everything can be customized and pricing is reasonable. Like the sushi handroll the most - Easy to eat on the go.

Would be better if the vinegar taste in the rice is stronger. But overall not bad.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110963547316908128105/reviews
Serene Tay,4,"Had the DIY maki which comes with a wide variety of filling options. Wish they had more options for the base besides white rice though.

Ingredients are fresh, though taste-wise nothing too different from what you'd get at other sushi/salad bars. Still, glad to have a healthy option at Ion basement.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108715590544625720066/reviews
Grace,5,"One of my favourite go to places when I want to get a quick bite. Sushi portions are sufficient for a meal, and very tasty! Easy to eat on the go or even sitting down. I like that I can choose my own ingredients too! Super yummy sushi + friendly staff, thumbs up!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111925712493435370618/reviews
Li Yun,1,"Tl;dr overpriced and overhyped.
Ordered the sashimi noodle mukbang intermediate set at $58 ($6 delivery). Delivery was on time. However food portion was disappointing. It wasn't worth $56 for the amount of sashimi. The salmon is not as thick as I thought it would be. Dipping sauce is too much and taste normal too. Can easily get the same quality of salmon with bigger portion at other place at a cheaper rate.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107292018901792865359/reviews
