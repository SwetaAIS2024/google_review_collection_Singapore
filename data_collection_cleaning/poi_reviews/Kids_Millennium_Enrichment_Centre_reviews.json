They were guided well... both in their studies and personal development. I appreciate their assistance in helping me with my subsidy applications over the years. The teachers are loving and caring towards the children and easy to communicate with. Appreciate the fetching of the children from school etc.. Well done and kudos to your  hard work.",

      "text": "So unorganise. Was inform if i were to withdraw my son, it would take 1mth to process and payout is only by chq. I waited for 3mth and didnt receive any call. When i call to enquire a lady told my she isnt sure. I had to wait for the admin to return tomorrow. Next day no one return my call. I called at 5pm but the Admin told me she will need to ask the teacher who taught my son and will call me back within the same day but no one called. I called again next day. I was annoyed as It was a ball rolling experience. In the end not sure which lady spoke to me but she told me they overlooked and will process asap. Cannot tell me a date. The way she spoke was like she was rushing. She told me they will try their best. Didnt even ask me for my detail for the chq and all. Will see how long more i have to wait.",
