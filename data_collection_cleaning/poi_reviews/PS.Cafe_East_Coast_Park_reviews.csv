Debra T,5,"Amazing first experience! Warm and helpful service by Bernie and many on the service team, and amazing set up of the flower cart for mother’s day, by Stephanie and team! Delicious food as always. Only gripe is the honey milk latte didn’t taste as expected, not milky not honeyed, just quite strong coffee! A staff helped to bring it for more milk and honey to be added, though still can’t really be tasted.

Thank you, will be back!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102226782088253343842/reviews
Ruby Abdullah,5,"Had the most pleasant experience having breakfast here. Bernie was cheerful and smiley from the moment we walked in and throughout the entire breakfast service. She and her team were friendly, attentive, and helpful. We will definitely return for the wonderful service, which truly elevated the taste of the food and coffee for us diners. Thank you, Bernie and team!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105617608605095754404/reviews
lumirys,5,"Service was great - the staff were very attentive and friendly. Shoutout especially to Bernie, who asked if we needed anything and made dining here a pleasant experience.

The truffle fries' portion were huge - we got a half portion and it fed the two of us well. They were still crunchy in the right way even when the fries got cold, which is a big plus. The stew wasn't too bad either; the calamari's texture was nice and easy to chew :)

And finally the double chocolate blackout cake - it was HUGE. The portion is certainly generous; get this if you like chocolate cakes with lots of sponge.

All in all a good dining experience, will come again next time!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112156474488592129018/reviews
befreetofly,5,"Wonderful dinner on a Wednesday evening for 2. Kacy was very thoughtful, she split the tomato bisque into 2 portions for our convenient sharing, without us having to request it.

Service by all staff was prompt, food was served quickly and was delicious. Compliments to the chef! Had the barramundi with risotto and East Coast exclusive Southern buttermilk fish burger. Barramundi risotto sauce/gravy was slightly spicy but quenched with Wild Berry cooler drink :)

Warmly lit ambience with good use of cove lighting. We will be back!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104630128612178053493/reviews
Cindy Low,5,Lovely dinner as usual. Food portion at ps cafe is huge to us and we dialed back on our mains as we didn’t want to waste. Everything was delicious and service was impeccable as it’s a quiet week day evening.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113149827513229825918/reviews
