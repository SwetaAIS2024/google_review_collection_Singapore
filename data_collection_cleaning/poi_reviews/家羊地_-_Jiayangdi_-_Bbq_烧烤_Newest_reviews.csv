jayden,4,"Food is above average, there is 3 flavours to the skewers such as cumin, spicy and korea sweet suace. The portion is bigger compared to other places. Though the variety is not much, however the quality is there.
Quite a good place to chill and hangout.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
Yoshi,3,"We went on a Saturday night. The restaurant wasn't too crowded, but four friends of one of the staff and one staff member were having a great time at the table next to us, and it was quite noisy.

It was unpleasant to hear them shouting so loudly that it interrupted the conversations of the other tables. If the staff were going to join in, I wish they would at least control the tone of their voices.

It was a nice, reasonably priced restaurant, but the vulgar noise of the five people, including the staff member, ruined everything.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109180839141807756988/reviews

Wynne Soh Xue Qi,5,"the shop is facing the expressway. if you get down at NEWEST busstop, just walk towards the building and this shop is on the left. come in, find yourself a table, scan QR code to order and pay online. payment modes shown in photo. it is a thoughtful gesture to place candles under the skewers to keep it warm. first bite into the skewers, it made me put my phone down and enjoy the food, flavour and texture. i really really loved it, definitely returning and recommending. able to accommodate big groups, outdoor seating available when its not raining. variety of beer to choose from. clean environment, friendly staff, delicious food at affordable prices. what a gem!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116851124812785073296/reviews
