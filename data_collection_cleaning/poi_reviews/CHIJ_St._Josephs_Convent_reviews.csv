Germaine Lee,1,"I put this school as one of my top 3 choices just because of its proximity to my house (30 min bus ride). The best teacher is MR MARK CHAN hands down. He's the only teacher who connected the subject (Physics at that time) to real-life application, making it easy to understand instead of relying on memorization.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110577997626742457389/reviews

Law Chiu Charn,5,"My daughter says is quite good so far for term one, even though this wasn't her top school choice. The WA1 is quite unique as most subjects are project based.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100755643898902737784/reviews
Yukii_!!,3,"I got into this school Because it was my fifth choice (idk how many) This is my school now and although it is just the first year of school I don't rly like it
Students are kinda crazy maybe some of them actually have issues but I can't really say.
The teachers are all bad except for like 3 of my subject teachers.
And it's too strict whatsoever
Unless you are fine with being written done for being 5 minutes early
Everything is wrong and nothing is right
(Sure I'm not a popular kid maybe the ones that is average but you will find some friends)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105141151161584860730/reviews
