Park아쨘,1,"It was my first visit and I was told to eat after the service and then go, so I waited and I felt bad when they made me do this and that. Does a church force a first-time visitor to do this or that with their fingers? I don't care if you sign up and serve at a place you frequent, but I don't think it's a good idea to force church work like that on someone who went to see the atmosphere on the first day.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106392592786015403175/reviews
