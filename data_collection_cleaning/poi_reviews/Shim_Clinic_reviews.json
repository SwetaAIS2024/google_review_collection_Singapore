      "text": "Visited on 21/11/19 for the first time due to the good reviews online. To my horror, the doctor was extremely rude and sarcastic when I tried to clarify on my condition. He was also impatient and did not adequetly explain my condition to me. Felt humiliated when I probed more about the treatment and condition. I believe that a good and sincere doctor would not have treated his patients like he did. It was an unpleasant experience and i would definitely not recommend this doctor to anyone.\n\n* Reply to response from Clinic\n\nHi Jonathan Chu,\n\nThank you for your email.\n\nI am delighted to witness your incredible dedication to feedback and commitment to improve yourselves.\n\nI chose not to reply you as I do not see a reason to and im sure Doctor Shim himself knows what happened. However, in the event that he does not, he could always refer to the feedback on Google for a refresher. That is unless he does to this everyone and cannot remember which particular patient I was.\n\nI find it extremely comical that you brought up your suspicion of impersonation and identity theft. Your accusations and assumptions are as ridiculous as the service I received from Doctor Shim that day. That said if need be, please seek help from authorities should you suspect that I have impersonated someone when I literally gave you my Identification card. There should be no problem for you to find me, since for some reason your clinic keeps my Identification Card for registration till the point that I see the doctor without explanation given to me.\n\nLastly, calling the same person asking for the same thing isn't going to change anything. Clearly you have called the wrong person either because you couldn't read the numbers I've wrote or I've written it wrongly. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. I pity the guy you called for having to deal with your nonsense, thrice.\n\nPlease for the love of God, do not contact me anymore. I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nRegards,\nClinton",
