Anyway a very good experience at lot one uob. No wonder all the reviews at this outlet so bad.",

      "text": "I really think UOB should station mortgage specialists at each branch. None of the staff could offer any advice about my partial prepayment for my mortgage loan and while I contacted the mortgage specialist a few days prior, I still had issues with filling up the form. On 11 Dec, I actually made 2 trips to UOB, just to correct the form. To top things off, I received a text message saying my application for partial prepayment of my loan was rejected due to a signature irregularity a day later. This means I have to make yet another trip to get things sorted. This is really very poor service on the part of UOB and I'm appalled by such standards. I will probably not take up any loans of any nature with them. I have been asking to meet or speak face to face with mortgage specialists for the past year as well, but was told they are 'backend staff' and that these 'specialists' will contact me. Yet, when I signed a housing loan with them, they were willing to meet up with me. A housing loan is no small sum and to be cast aside as a customer after the the deal is done leaves a bad aftertaste.",
