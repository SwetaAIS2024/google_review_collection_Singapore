Crypto ExDee,5,"Very beautiful park that is connected to the Luxus Hill Park.

There are no fitness facilities here (you can find them at Luxus Hill Park), but there is a community garden, a toilet, a nature playground, swings, see-saws etc.

There are also plenty of shelter and places you could park your bicycle.

There’s even a big outdoor sheltered space where you can have indoor activities or picnic.

One full round from this park to Luxus Hill Park and back is about 1.2km.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110697649280498996686/reviews

Julian Chow,5,"Very wide and open park with numerous paths that can help add variety to your exercise route.  You can take a longer walk along the boundary and then choose to cut across the park if you need to make a beeline out of the park.

There are many smaller facilities like exercise stops and playground for different user groups.

Very nice environment to exercise.  Not flanked by overgrown trees, trailing spider webs like some older parks.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114457626465323361622/reviews
"Guan Hock, Marcus Tay",5,"Even though the original layout of the park makes it an ugly park or just a playground , through the use of “little hills”, it gives you a sense of wonder and as you cannot see what is beyond on the other side.  Through elegant design, it broke through its geographical constraints.

Lovely simple traditional swings, meditative pebbles are the icing on the cakes.

The downside is excessively hardworking landscape workers still working at 9pm!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113879754794059266679/reviews
