Joey C.,4,Quite authentic and very generous portion lean pork basil rice with egg. You can choose how spicy it is and you can add extras. I added a 2nd egg 6$ + 1$ for the extra egg. This a good option at this coffee shop.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117248916812976885999/reviews

Thomas Ford,4,"Came by today for a takeaway meal. Ordered Green curry and pineapple fried rice.
The pineapple fried rice was alright and the portion was big. The winner is the green curry. Itâ€™s really flavourful and well done. Good job!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100727929172218563373/reviews
