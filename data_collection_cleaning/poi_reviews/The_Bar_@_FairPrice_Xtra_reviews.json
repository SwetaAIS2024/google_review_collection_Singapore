Ching - The Cheese Shop was enthusiastic and lots of great information. Wonderful variety of cheeses. We enjoyed ourselves. Good work and keep it up!",

      "text": "Awesome find while waiting for my friend at Parkway Parade. This is an area on one end of Fairprice Xtra, and there are some food counters and a bar. Sat down at the bar which serves up a few craft beers, wine and simple cocktails. Prices are very reasonable. You can order food from other counters to eat at the bar counter too. Great way to spend a couple of hours if you're looking for a drink and not wanting the fuss and expense of going to a proper bar. Just don't expect ambience - you're in a supermarket afterall.",

His attitude was poor, characterized by uncalled-for remarks and a lack of engagement with customers. While other aspects were positive, his behavior detracted from the overall atmosphere. I hope management addresses this.",
