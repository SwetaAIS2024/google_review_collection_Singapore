just human,5,"Exquisite dining experience - possibly the best I’ve had.

With the price to boot, however saying that, nothing was not thought of.

The food was creative, tasty and full of flavour and incredibly beautiful.

The service was friendly, polite, not pretentious at all - very welcoming. It didn’t feel like you needed to be dripping in wealth like a lot fine dining establishments - it was down to earth friendly and authentic- yet second to none. Litterally 1:1 service ratio. The team explained each dish beautifully.

Highly recommend for a special occasion for small groups (2-4).",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106237723632291828803/reviews

Chan Leong Low,4,"Great service and a very high-end restaurant. I would definitely return for special occasions.  One thing to highlight: they forgot to serve my sourdough (on the second attempt), we found it funny as  the person who initially to offer us this but he forgot. They served the new spreads but then forgot the sourdough.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110504007628429787238/reviews
Tiffany Koh,5,"First visit, celebrating Valentine's Day during lunch.

Each dish was delicious in its own flavour, so different yet all very well balanced and flavourful. The omi beef was stunning. Melts in the mouth, yet not too greasy like others.  Can totally finish all without feeling sick of it.

A cosy place with 10 tables only (I believe). Great view of one of Singapore's most beautiful skylines.

I'm definitely going back to try out the different menus and for the night view.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103364360492811481209/reviews
Istinna Lim,5,"We had an enjoyable evening of specially curated modern French cuisine whereby Chef Emanuel infused it with some of our favourite Asian tastes whilst keeping the overall French dining experience a delightful one.
The beautiful wines selected under the Premium Pairing was marvellous.
Thanks for the window side table.  The wide glass window overlooking the iconic Marina Bay and Singapore skyscrapers was stunning.
To us, it was a night to remember and celebrate.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115642388605021112037/reviews
