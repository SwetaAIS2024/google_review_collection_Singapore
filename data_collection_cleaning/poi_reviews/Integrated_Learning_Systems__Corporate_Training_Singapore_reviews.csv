jiang jasmine,5,"The Influencing Others training from ILS was truly eye-opening for our sales team. Not only are they closing deals more effectively, but we've also seen a significant 15% increase in successful negotiations. This training has empowered them to understand and adapt to different influencing styles, which has been instrumental in building stronger relationships with clients.

What's equally impressive is how the Growth Mindset program has complemented this training. By fostering a culture that values continuous learning and resilience, our team is now more adept at handling challenges and embracing new opportunities. The combination of these two programs has been the key to achieving great results across the company. Our team members are more confident in their ability to influence without authority, and they're consistently demonstrating a growth mindset that drives innovation and collaboration.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106161765528938856399/reviews
