Ruth Sek Wan Ru,5,"I'm thoroughly impressed with Heguru Method Harbourfront! The teachers (Teacher Felicia, Teacher Michelle, Teacher Jiaqi, Teacher Stefanie) are caring, skillful, and truly dedicated to their students' success. I've seen a significant change in my child's learning, and the program is so effective that even adults can benefit from it. The intensive approach is fantastic, and I highly recommend Heguru Method Harbourfront to anyone looking for a top-notch learning experience. The staff's passion and expertise shine through, making it an excellent choice for families and individuals alike.

Not forgetting to mention that Michelle, Bazra and the other staff are really friendly and helpful! Their response time is fast on any queries that I have.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113742618463372299892/reviews

Joyce Ng,4,"Teacher Michelle and Teacher Fion are loving, kind and patient teachers and this motivates Evan to look forward to attending class weekly.

Teacher Michelle even took the initiative and extra effort of buying pencil cases for the children in preparation for their independent class.

Teacher Fion also provided helpful feedback and shared photos and videos to keep me posted on Evan’s first ever independent class.

Evan started Heguru before he turned 1 year old and has attended Heguru for over 3 years now. Heguru has helped Evan to develop a good memory, logical thinking / problem solving / numeracy and widened his vocabulary and general knowledge.

While Heguru classes are not cheap (compared to other enrichment classes) and there are no replacement classes for missed lessons, Evan has benefitted tremendously from Heguru’s curriculum and right brain training from a young age.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109671827477129830767/reviews
