Chris Chen,2,"I was at Sengkang blk 111 and the receptionist insisted an ART that was tested within 12hours instead of MOH regulation is within 24hours. Very disappointed with this move, this does comply to MOH regulation and this unnecessary incurred additional cost to those elderly whom require medical assistance. Management please review this point since you are all here to provide medical with minimum cost to the lower income group.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104155189302509614175/reviews
Joanne Loh,1,"Been to this clinic for years n 1st time encountered such painful acupuncture experience.

Was at BLK 111 Rivervale Walk Branch on 6 Dec 2021, As usual, the registration staff will assign any on duty Dr for us. I was group under Room 1 with one of the lady Dr.(1st time see this lady Dr).

Was given acupuncture treatment by the Dr.
After my treatment, suddenly I feel that there is a Qi flow inside my hand n the next moment, I was unable to move my fingers n immediately there is a big swollen lump on my hand.so,the Dr start to massage slowly for me n keep saying sorry to me n keep asking me whether I ever done acupuncture before or not.she request me to apply cold therapy once after I reach home.

On the next day, my hand was getting worst, it became more pain,more swollen. So,I went to Polyclinics n was referred to SKH A&E for further treatment.

With this incident,I tell myself to go for regular familiar Dr for my future visit n don't ever take the risk of allowing unfamiliar Dr for acupuncture treatment.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100296348618194104321/reviews
