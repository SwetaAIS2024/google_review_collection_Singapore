Lam Phung Le Quynh,5,"Right near the Bugis Junction. Very convenient. Huge place with loads of books below. Good for studying. Thereâ€™s a space for kids and short books, books for adults and the best part(for me) is they have comics and informational books about art and nature. There are events that maybe people would like.  Itâ€™s best to visit on the weekend to have more time reading and for kids to play.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110501513341102559851/reviews
