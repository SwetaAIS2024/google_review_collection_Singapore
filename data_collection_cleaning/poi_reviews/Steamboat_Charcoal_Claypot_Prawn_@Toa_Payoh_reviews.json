      "text": "First point: Halal, which is important for the Muslim friend I dined out with.  A claypot of prawn with broth set us back for $30+, while the hokkien mee that came with prawns was $8.80.  We were offered the choice of charcoal stove or the claypot being cooked at the stall itself.  We chose the stove and promptly regretted our bad decision because the fire was leaping out.  The stove had to be pushed as far away as the table could accommodate, as the fire was too intensely hot and scary!  Nonetheless it was an enjoyable experience.  The 2 of us couldn't finish everything.  The setting is a big coffee shop in the middle of an industrial estate in Toa Payoh.",
