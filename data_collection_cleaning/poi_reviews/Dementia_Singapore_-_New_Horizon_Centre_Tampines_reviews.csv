Daliah Moss,5,"My family is indebted to the Tampines Horizon Centre for the wonderful care they gave our mother Aminah Ahmad for the almost 10 years she attended your facility. I sincerely believe that  her regular participation at your centre had an enormous positive impact on the quality and enjoyment of her final years of life.  After her first few visits, she could not wait to get there each morning.  The gentle caring and professional attention shown to her was always greatly appreciated.  All staff, from the Director to the cleaning staff always exhibited such care and hospitality.  I have visited  many facilities in various countries ( including Australia where the model of care was originally adapted from) and while some other facilities may have more expensive surrounds and  gadgets and possibly more ""certification qualified""staff, your staff and volunteers constantly demonstrated care of the highest and exceptional quality.  I am sorry to have taken so long to write this but I have only stumbled on this opportunity to thank you publicly when helping a cousin to find support for her mum.
May you all be blessed for your compassion and care.
sincerely, daliah Moss ( Broome, Australia)",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112525256875528636743/reviews
Keith Chng,5,"To NHC Tampines team.  A sincere thank you from our family for the wonderful love and care showered towards my mother (Mdm Leow). Though the journey with her was rough but your team derived a strategic management plan for her. Not to mention the energy the team had shown.  During the time my mom was there, we learnt a lot too about the do & don't through the interaction with the team.

Most importantly, she was well taken care of these years at your centre. It had been our blessing to have had sent her to your centre. We are not sugar-coating as your centre had helped us tremendously, especially for my father, overcoming the darkest moment in caring for my mother.

The service that your team has provided to families with PWD(Patient With Dementia) is an integral aspect of the holistic care that cannot be substituted or undermined. Such support means very much to us (families with PWD) although appreciative words are not mentioned often, the gratitude is felt in our hearts. God will bless all of you for persevering in such meaningful but seldom appreciated or spoken job.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106284228676136642841/reviews
