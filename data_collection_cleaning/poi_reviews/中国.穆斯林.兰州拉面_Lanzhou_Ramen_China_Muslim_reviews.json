The cutleries and bowls are kept in sanitized cabinet with temperature controlled. The food are fresh and the portions are generous. I love the cooked lamb, so soft and succulent. The beef is amazingly soft and tender. I noticed lots of malay muslims patronised the restaurant. The home-made yogurt is incredibly delicious that you’ll want more than one cup! Definitely worth it and value for money! Wish the restaurant more success! Will definitely becoming again to be our favourite place for halal chinese muslim steamboat.",
