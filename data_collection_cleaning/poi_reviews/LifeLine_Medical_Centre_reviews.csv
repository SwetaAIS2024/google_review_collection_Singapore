Happy Pudding,5,"TLDR: Really good clinic and sincere service, kindest doctors with very professional diagnosis. Affordable and quality medical care. Very thankful for this clinic in the neighbourhood, West coast residents are lucky.

Writing my own experience of this clinic as I am shocked by the low ratings given by randoms for frivolous reasons. I have been visiting this clinic for over 10 years, its my family clinic. I rarely find another clinic so meticulous and caring for its patients, with a peace of mind and compassion so much more than the public polyclinics.

Both Dr Tan and Dr Lim are very thorough in their assessments,  in fact my grandmother got wrongfully misdiagnosed by another clinic, and got diagnosed correctly with Shingles by this clinic (that thankfully came at a early enough timing to prevent further permanent damage).

Michelle Robert,2,"Totally run down unhygienic looking place. As a doctor it's common sense to have hand-wash in the toilet. No handwash. It's post covid era, you would think hygiene is of utmost importance. And by the way a squatting toilet!!! Seriously? Can't lock toilet door. No place to hang handbag. Walls so dirty. Looks like a place from Malaysia. They need to learn from the One Doctor's group Khatib on what a clinic should look like and be run like!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106291198203036574560/reviews

A Tan,5,"Just came from seeing Dr Tan at this clinic. I decided to give the clinic a try after reading the good reviews here. It's true, Dr Tan, is a pleasant man and is very easy to talk to. More importantly, he's quite knowledgeable and I appreciated his good sense of humour. I will definitely be coming back here in the future.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114064789433909818552/reviews
S Foo,5,"I always see Dr Lee when I am unwell. She is very knowledgeable and her advice are also wise and practical.  I like that she is very careful, ask leading questions, do not over treat but yet careful.  My interaction with her tells me that she is a very smart person.  I feel confident treated by her. ðŸ˜Š",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113413033347703577076/reviews
