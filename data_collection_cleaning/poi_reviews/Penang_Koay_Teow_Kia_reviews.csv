Rion Toh,5,"Very unique. Unlike typical fish soup or fishball noodles that are commonly found elsewhere. Cooked with a lot of effort. Flavours are strong. Portion is well worth the price.
For those who dislike garlic, this might not be in your favour..
For garlic lovers, this is the go-to place..",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110397251785044004676/reviews
D L,5,"Really good quality mee pok. Noodles cooked perfectly. Well tossed in the delicious chilli sauce. The soup is flavourful, not your usual ikan bilis soup. Lots of ingredients, fishball, meat ball, minced meat, beancurd sticks...$4

I love the kway teow kia dry too. Special mention of the Mexican style salsa/cincalok condiment that you can help yourself with, add it to my noodles for extra oomph",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104966613744701231932/reviews
Andrew Chew,5,"Delicious,  value for money.
I ordered mee kia dry $4 add 2 meatballs for $1.
Noodles were cooked nicely the way I like, mixed with his special sauce.
Ask for more chilly but cook says that his chilly is not spicy, but if add too much will be salty.

The soup comes separately with add the ingredients. 2 fishballs, 4 meatballs, a few fish sticks, 2 reasonably thick meat slices, lots ot minced meat and garlic,  added spring onions and chives I think making it very delicious.
The soup is freshly prepared as you order.
Definitely a must try.
Will patronise this stall again when I'm in the area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116642685926868990385/reviews
Wilson Foo,4,"Koay Teow Kia is Hokkien for flat rice noodles. In different places, it has different meanings. Eg, in JB, Kway Teow Kia means Kway Chap. In Penang, it’s normally rice noodles with fishballs in soup, which they call Koay Teow Tng

So this stall caught my attention because the concoctions are not what I am used to in Penang. I ordered the #2 set (Mee Kia) and added three Fuzhou fishballs for $2.

Love the noodles. Al dente and well coated with dark sauce and chilli. Lots of ingredients and the sliced taro was exceptionally good, being the powdery type. At $4 a bowl, it’s a steal considering the runaway inflation in Singapore.

But the Fuzhou fishballs were disappointing. They were rather bland, borderline tasteless, even with the sambal ikan bilis sauce that they come coated with. Not what my experience with Fuzhou fishballs has been in the region and in Fuzhou itself. Can skip.

Expect longer queues during meal times.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114263857328212431619/reviews
