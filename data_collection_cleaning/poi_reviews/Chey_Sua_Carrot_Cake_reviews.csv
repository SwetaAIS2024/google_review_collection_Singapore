Leon Kwang,3,"Ok, it was nothing spectacular for a 45-60 minute wait.

I think it's pretty competent, it is crispy on the outside, a tad flat so you don't get a lot of the carrot cake, it can be salty/ spicy for some too.  And towards the end, you might find it a bit greasy.

The pricing is very low, and I think they could increase the price to manage the queue and for their own wellbeing too. They should take things easy at this age.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116326892362989736040/reviews
Dale Mac,1,"No! No!! No!!! ðŸ˜¡

Complete no for me because of the owner's impoliteness.

I understand that the job can be stressful and thankless...

... but mumbling something, rolling eyes and scratching my order off the pad like the paper was at fault is an absolute fail...all i said was that I'll have to come back another time to try because I didn't have the 45 mins to wait.

Alas, there will be no other time for me at this stall, and will spend my money elsewhere where the food might not be that good but the interaction will at least be palatable.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113950514812482140406/reviews
Siah Hx,2,"Their white fried Carrot cake is okay, nothing to wow about. Abit salty in my opinion. HOWEVER, the lady who is taking your order, her service is terrible. Not warm  Not friendly, Not helpful!

Portion isn't big and carrort cake is so flat. Like pancakes.

Stall does open before 7am.
Washroom is available on site.

Wld i try again - No.
Worth the 30mins wait - No.

Give this stall a miss (for the lousy service).",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103944670556353820143/reviews
Pak Soon Lau,4,"Always a long queue here. Expect to wait 30-45 minutes. Sold out by 1 pm usually. They serve only the ""white kind"" of fried carrot cake. For those who prefer the traditional fried carrot cake with sweet black sauce, there's one stall diagonally opposite, serving both black and white varieties.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107524637554500568527/reviews
Leslie Lim,4,"Pan-fried to crispy exterior, and soft moist small radish in the interior. At an affordable price of $3, this traditional carrot cake is definitely one of the more interesting ones I have eaten. While undeniably delicious, it can be a tad oily for some tastes. Long queues, often 45 to 60 minutes, are common, and the stall can sell out early, but the crowd proves itâ€™s a must-try at least once for any Singaporean food lover.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102169174463490278176/reviews
