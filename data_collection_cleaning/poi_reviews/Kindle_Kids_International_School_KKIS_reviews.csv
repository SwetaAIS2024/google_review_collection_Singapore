Preetha R,5,"I am very grateful to Kindle Kids school as they accepted to take most attention and individual care to my son who has Developmental delay and so a slow learner.
The Principal, the co ordinator and the team of teachers encouraged my son by giving him confidence and motivation to participate in all activities and also designed a reduced syllabus and a separate question paper just for him until he gains self confidence.  Also the revision papers given in each subject, 2 weeks before the exams help all the kids to prepare well and face the exams confidently.  Moreover the students in this school well behave with good moral support for each others. My son felt a safe and friendly environment in the school. As a mother I am very satisfied with this team .",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104180546779364151593/reviews
