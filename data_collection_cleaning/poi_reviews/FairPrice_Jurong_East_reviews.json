      "text": "I believe this Fairprice JE Blk 135 has the best aunty workers among all supermarkets. They are very knowledgeable about the food, discounts, offer, etc. At the checkout, they would advice you if there's offer, or only offer to members and ask if you have membership before payments. The aunty vegetables fillers can also discuss with you how to cook the vegetables if you are unsure.\nThis is what we call \"Ren qing wei (人情味）\"，only in Kampung you can find.\nOn the contrary Jurong Jem has totally lack of the warmth like these aunties. They are too urban, too cold. They insist to check on my IC if I am seniors for the mere 20 cents I saved. I am with full of grey hair. They said CCTV is watching, and many youngsters nowadays dye their hair grey. I took that as compliment!\nI think almost all of the JE 135 aunties have worked there for more than 20 years! I hope the company will keep them as long as they are willing to work.",
