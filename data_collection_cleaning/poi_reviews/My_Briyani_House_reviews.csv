jayden,2,"Below average briyani, came to try here as it was rather quiet and no people. Atmosphere wise definitely good especially after lunch hours I suppose, however for the other restaurants and food chains here is also rather quiet on weekdays.
The mutton biryani is not worth the price, 1 piece of bone with so less meat for $11? I was quite shocked to only find one piece of bone with little meat in the relatively huge pile of rice.
The whole plate of rice, meat, curry was totally lukewarm, not even a single bit warm. And the mutton is rather tough to bite too, it just makes no sense of just few chunks of meat on the bone with so much rice at the price. Just look at how small the mutton bone is in the rice......
Furthermore I was so turn off when being charge $1 for chilli padi?? Why do u need to charge $1 for chilli padi? No doubt it was quite a alot of chilli however there was only 2 of us and furthermore I was the only one eating the chilli. Why can't you just give a small plate or few pieces of chilli padi without charging like what usually restaurants does?
Chicken briyani is much more worth as at least it's a piece of chicken thigh with obviously more meat then the mutton, however it's also just all lukewarm for the chicken too.
Won't come back here ever again...",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
thelevitator,3,"Decided to try their prata because I wasn't exactly craving briyani. The prata left something to be desired for the price ($2.00/plain prata piece, $2.50 for Egg Prata). The display menu unfortunately does not show everything they have (at least for the prata) and there isn't a full menu in sight when I visited, so most likely you will have to enquire.

Maideen A K,1,"There's totally no customer service here. The guy taking the order was so grumpy. We were the only ones in the whole restaurant and the guy at the food collection area was saying the food was for somebody else. After awhile, he said it's for you. If you are not interested to work, just take the day off. You are spoiling your day and our day as well.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108140816530971150087/reviews

Teck Boon,4,Most popular item is the lamb shank briyani. Nice thick curry and drinks are good too. This restaurant is one of the long standing ones along with McDonald’s in the area. Food can’t be that bad if it’s been around for so long. Food quality has been reliable and more than good enough for what it sets out to be.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105978834231481267643/reviews
