Carmen Tang,5,"My son is autistic and non-verbal.  He started attending LittleFoot when he was four years old in 2022 until present.  I absolutely appreciate all the teachers and the therapists for their professional strategies and methods to help my son’s growth.  The techniques are individually designed to target different needs for each child and they are proven to be effective on my son.  It was a great team effort at LittleFoot who taught my son to accept new food and feed himself properly.  More than that, my son has shown a significant improvement in joint attention, communication, social interaction and self- help skills and cognitives development.  The teachers are so kind, caring, patient and supportive to all the students and the parents.  On top of that, I like how the school provides a full day all inclusive program, which includes in-house speech therapy, occupational therapy and optional ABA sessions.  School bus is available for the convenience of both students and parents.  Overall, LittleFoot provides an excellent support and learning environment which I highly recommend.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109540765145367089073/reviews
Vinodh Sudhakaran,5,"My child, Takshiv, has been attending LittleFoot Developmental services since October 2023, and I've seen a significant improvement in his overall development. The additional ABA sessions have also been beneficial, and he's made tremendous progress in his writing, speech, and cognitive abilities.

Takshiv was less interested in writing before joining this school, where as now he writes his name, letters, numbers, copy words and can do simple worksheets with less guidance which is a huge accomplishment. His speech has also shown significant improvement, and he's able to communicate his desires and express himself in simple sentences. The teachers, Ms. Sharanya, Ms. Rachel, and Ms. Muni, have been crucial in his development, and I'm grateful for their dedication and hard work.

Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the school and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a supportive school environment. The teachers are truly committed to helping their students grow and develop. I'm so glad we made the decision to enroll Takshiv in this school!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107404000685356456643/reviews
Wei Ling Lim,5,"My child joined the school readiness program at 2.5 yo and was under Rachel for ABA. He has made really good progress in terms of speech, communication, writing and reading by the time he was 3.5yo. He was also toilet trained by the team. Very grateful to Littlefoot for the progress my child made under Nicole, Rachel, Kemin and the rest of the team!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111388853051431595205/reviews
