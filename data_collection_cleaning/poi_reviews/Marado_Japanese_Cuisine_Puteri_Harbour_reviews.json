      "text": "After moving from KL to Iskandar Puteri, I struggled to find a Japanese restaurant that could meet my expectations‚Äîuntil now. This place truly stands out with its high-quality, fresh sashimi at reasonable prices. Every dish was flavourful, served in generous portions, and beautifully presented. The staff are incredibly friendly and thoughtful too. They even served miso soup for my children, offered a special treat from the chef‚Äîpremium-grade tuna belly sushi that was unbelievably fresh‚Äîand ended the meal with complimentary fruits and jelly for dessert. Highly recommended, and I‚Äôll definitely be back whenever I‚Äôm craving Japanese cuisine!",

I m much skeptical towards fresh seafood as I m allergic to those that r poorly handled n/or lack freshness .\nHowever , I really love sashimi , therefore I hv to b discerning in consuming them .\nI bought salmon n swordfish sashimi at a hot lunch hr . They carefully packed with care to ensure the temp n texture of sashimi were kept . The temp , texture , size of cut , n taste , it‚Äôs what I view impt in every pc of fresh sashimi .\n\nIn my opinion , Their prices might not be the cheapest , but very reasonable . As I note that every pc of sashimi i consume , should b of quality .\n\nTherefore , I definitely will visit soon again , as I m a vivid sashimi eater .\n\nThank you.\n\nI returned to this resto few days again .\nI was v impressed that the chef so kindly served me a couple of chutoro sushi while I was waiting for my takeaway . A classy act from a chef at a Japanese resto that touched my heart .\nKudos .\n\nThis will definitely b my fave resto in Puteri harbour . Will visit soon again .\n\nPls support this resto .\nYou will b as impressed and delighted .\n\nMany thanks .\n\nP.s I bought chutoro sashimi , but I feel the quality is close to the higher grade ootoro, n check out the portion . Chef gave a lot . For what I paid , it‚Äôs definitely v affordable .",

      "text": "Had an amazing dining experience at MARADO Japanese Restaurant. The food here is easily one of the best I‚Äôve had in both JB and Singapore‚Äîtop-notch quality and full of delightful, unexpected surprises. What really stood out was the great value for money‚Äîpremium ingredients and generous portions at a very reasonable price.\n\nWe dined in the private room on the 2nd floor, which was cozy and intimate, perfect for a quiet meal. It was slightly humid and could‚Äôve been cooler, but honestly, that‚Äôs the only minor issue in an otherwise flawless experience.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who loves authentic Japanese cuisine without breaking the bank! Btw, it is operated by Korean owner and it Korean style Japanese cuisine.",
