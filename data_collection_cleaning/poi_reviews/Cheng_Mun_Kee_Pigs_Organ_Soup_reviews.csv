MrJayquak,4,"Nice portion for SGD 5.50
Add 50c for a bowl of rice
Chill sauce is spot on, suitable for most taste buds. The salted vege is strong, so its suitable for those prefer their soup on the salty side of things.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102481553631965729687/reviews
Jayon See,3,"One of the famous Pork Organ Soup in the area.
Ingredients were fresh, the portion is pretty big for its price as well.
However, the soup has a bit of porky smell, and their Kiam Chai (Pickled Veggies) is not tasty.
To me it’s just average, plus the uncle is pretty sarcastic toward his other customers, not really friendly.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116724448114310213003/reviews
John Tango,4,"Decent service. Good price value. Taste overal for the mix pork soup with white rice is 7.5/10. Tau kwa (soya bean curd) too salty 6/10. Tau pok (spongy soya bean) 7/10.

The pork ball & pig’s stomach are tasty. Pork slices a little tough.

A repeat? Yes.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117082529878868496412/reviews
MC SM,3,"Regular size quite a huge bowl of soup. Broth not very flavourful, had better one at the outlet which has a similar stall name. Pork belly came with bone and quite tough. Tofu can see its not very well cooked together with the broth, flavour not infused. Picked veg very fiberish. Rice superrrrrrrr hard and dry. Pig organs clean and nice. The only good was the huge serving size for the price. Can try once la.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110245550123443528486/reviews
Tony Fong,3,"Flavourful soup. Generous portion given, definitely value for $$$. Braised pork knuckle, which is deboned.

But the order taker, attitude needs improvement.

Impatient for simple customise order “less rice and no additional small vege in soup”.

Raised voice to customers.

Deserve 5 stars.... unfortunately, due to the bad attitude order taker.... 2 stars removed.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111271234938422356089/reviews
