Hnin Myat Noe Oo,1,"I was craving for steamboat and looked for the neighbourhood store for Mookata/ hotpot. I found this place and ordered a set of steamboat for us. They served the cooking tray after wiping with kitchen washcloths which they are using for wiping tables!!!!! And I requested to wash the cooking tray, and yet another one they gave me had crawling animals after putting on stove which I dun even know what they are! The worst place ever to dine! And My craving on a rainy day just disappeared and lost appetite!!!!!!!! They need to close down!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106697451767632255668/reviews
