      "text": "For no better words! This nasi lemak is very delicious, at least to me. Food is subjective and what makes it better is the owner here! The aunty is super friendly and chatty! I am a business owner myself and I believe a kind gesture goes a long way. I requested for alittle more rice and she added for me without additional cost and even offered me tea to drink. I always avoid the heavy crowd during dinner as the place is packed with so many people! This is my go to supper nasi lemak! Keep up the good work and may you be blessed with good health!",

      "text": "This store specialises in Nasi lemak and is open at late hours.\n\nI usually pop by if I am craving for Nasi Lemak late at night.\n\nThey were at a different location and shifted to their current premises, which is air conditioned.\n\nThey have a variety of food items that you pick to customize your own plate of Nasi lemak. The kitchen is also constantly churning out fresh food so the food is constantly replenished and hot.\n\nI ordered the sayur lodeh (vegetables in a lontong gravy), stir fried brinjal with sambal and chicken wings. Their sambal is a must have too.\n\nOverall their food quality is good, though a little pricey.\n\nGood place for a nice environment for late night dining.\n\nRecommended!\n\nüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüòã",

      "text": "The coconut rice is fragrant, the dishes such as chicken wings, sambal petai, are so so. I expect the signature sweet sauce chicken wings to be great but not so. It's skinny and tasted average. The chilli was also so so only, 3 out of 5. Overall, I won't travel all the way there to eat the nasi lemak.\nRestaurant was clean but the ventilation was poor.",

Their system is advance too.\n\nFood: 8.5/10\nWhat is good about this Nasi Lemak place is that, they got alot of choice of dishes for nasi lemak. All cooks good, so far the one that i try are very nice and fresh. I did not try their fried chicken yet but i heard from friend that it is very crispy. The food is also very cheap compare to other place.",

The rice was fragrant and perfectly cooked, the egg and anchovies were fresh and crispy and the chicken wings that you must try‚Ä¶ But what truly stole the show was the sambal chili. It had the perfect balance of heat, sweetness, and depth, with just enough kick to wake up your taste buds without overpowering the rest of the dish. It tied everything together beautifully. If you're a fan of bold, flavorful chili, this nasi lemak is an absolute must-try.",
