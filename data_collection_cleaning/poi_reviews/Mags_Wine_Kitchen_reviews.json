      "text": "The place shifted to Keong Saik from circular road and has been around\nFor ages.\nThe kitchen is now helmed by a very young but exciting chef. The cuisine is modern French Japanese fusion. Try their tasting menu which is a reasonable $148++ which includes 5 courses. Trust me itâ€™s filling. The sommen and abalone risotto was really well executed. Loved the sauce that came with the asparagus. Sour dough is provided for u to lap up the sauce. Wines are reasonable for pairing.\nGood place to Relak. Worth a return.",

      "text": "We had an amazing meal at Mag's and felt so welcomed from the moment we stepped in! All the dishes were exquisite and had an Asian touch and flair to it that made it so unique and special.\n\nStandouts were the steak tartare that was so refreshing, not at all gamey. The somen texture was amazing and the sauce coated every strand evenly. The crispy sakura ebi and soft sweet ebi tartare provided the perfect textual contrast to the chewy noodles. Our favourite was definitely the pan seared pearl grouper. The sauce that came with it was impeccable!! Extremely rich yet not fishy at all. We mopped up every bit of it.\n\nThanks Mag and her team for making our date night so memorable ðŸ˜Š",

Fresh and a palette cleanser.\n\nThe desert caps off the evening. It is so good that we had two portions. Strawberry was fresh and lightly tart. The sweetness level was precise and not overly sweet.",
