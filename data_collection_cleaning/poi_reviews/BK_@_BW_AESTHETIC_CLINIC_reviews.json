      "text": "Utterly appalling service and highly unprofessional.\n\nI purchased a Botox package after being aggressively pushed by a hard-selling consultant Lily\n\nAfterwards, I repeatedly attempted to make appointments to utilise my package, but to no avail.\n\nThey are extremely unaccommodating. Despite my efforts to accommodate them by adjusting my work shifts and personal schedule, it was still impossible to secure an appointment. The doctor in question is unbelievably irresponsible, concerned only with sales and her own convenience, showing no understanding of customer service.\n\nIt seems that BK Clinic has little or no regard for their patients' time and welfare, merely wanting us to part with our hard-earned money without fulfilling the agreement.\n\nI have repeatedly reached out to them and provided options for dates and times but was eventually ignored. It seems I may be compelled to bring this matter to the relevant authorities.",

The staff would also personally check in on my skin condition a week after treatment. I came back for a second round for touch ups, and the staff and Dr. Chen were incredibly patient and kind. Highly recommend BK Clinic and will definitely come back for future procedures!",
