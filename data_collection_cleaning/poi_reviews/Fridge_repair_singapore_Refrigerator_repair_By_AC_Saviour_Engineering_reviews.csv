Doreen Ng,5,"I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Simon Tan for his excellent fridge repair service. He is truly honest, polite, and highly experienced. He was able to quickly identify the issue and fix it efficiently within just 30 minutes.

Not only did he solve the problem, but he also took the time to share helpful knowledge about proper fridge temperature adjustment, which I really appreciated. His willingness to come over and complete the repair on a Sunday morning, without any additional charges, speaks volumes about his professionalism and dedication.

The cost was also very reasonable, and I couldnâ€™t be more satisfied with the overall service. I highly recommend Mr. Siomon Tan to anyone in need of reliable and honest appliance repair services.

Thank you once again!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108273042268950410758/reviews

astri noorbaini,5,"Uncle Simon came within an hour of my enquiry on my faulty fridge. After assessing and identifying the issue, he worked on replacing the damaged part which was the defrost heater. As he was working, he explained what he was doing and all the parts that are required to keep the fridge running. I appreciated his transparency with his explanation. He was very friendly but yet remained professional throughout. He finished the job within an hour. 5 stars for the efficiency, affordability as well as his transparency.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101275783629975857519/reviews
