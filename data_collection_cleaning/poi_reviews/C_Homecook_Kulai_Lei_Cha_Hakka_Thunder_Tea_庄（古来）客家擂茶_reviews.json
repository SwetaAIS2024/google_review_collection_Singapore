The vege mix was good and pretty harmonious but just fall short of being great.\n\nThe cha wasn't very good. Very powdery and need to be well stired. Even then it was also not particularly tasty. While dipping the ingredients to the cha helps in enhancing the taste of the cha, it doesn't helps to elevate the vege. A pretty average dish by itself and below average when compares to others that i had.",

Taste is great and the brown rice they use is good and cooked to a good softness.\n\nThe Yong tau hu bittergourd is not bitter!  And the meat in it is nice and fluffy.\n\nFeels really like home cooked feeling. Well worth the $6. Dabao $0.30 as usual but I prefer to use their dabao bowl.  The Lei cha is arranged so nicely.",

While the soup isn‚Äôt the best, it‚Äôs still not super herby and maintains the balance well\n\nThe outstanding thing was how all the components of the rice bowl came together - the vegetables were all so well seasoned (which isn‚Äôt usually the case for thunder tea rice) and crunchy and not bitter. It‚Äôs a vegetable lovers dream.\nTofu was also good too.\n\nAlso really value for money as compared to other thunder tea places out there! (6 for brown rice and add 1 for more vegetables)",

The presentation was lovely and neat, while the broth was robust yet not overwhelming.\n\nOverall, it was a very flavorful bowl of thunder tea rice.",
