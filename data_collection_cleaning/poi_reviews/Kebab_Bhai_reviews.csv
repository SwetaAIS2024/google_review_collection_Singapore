Maxine Y,5,"I ordered lunch for my team (40 daily bowls), and everyone enjoyed it!

The bowls have the perfect balance of protein, veggies, and carbs, and the sauce the staff recommended went so well with everything. Plus, the prices were really reasonable.

Iâ€™m especially grateful to them for being able to accommodate my order with such short notice, as I only placed it the day before.

Highly recommend!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117790773411826875051/reviews
Natasha Tjahjadi,4,"Was pretty good! The portion was generous although a tad pricey, similar to stuffd!

Had the chicken with butter rice salad bowl, and I was really full! Struggled to finish, probably could share with another person or try the salad itself.

Chicken was not as shiok as stuffd, but does give the more original feel. The bbq sauce and hot sauce were great combo! Spicy sauce not as spicy as the habanero sauce so all good for those who just want a bit of spice.

Recommend to try! The shop is located beside Nam Kee Pau, previously tenanted by Shilin snack bar.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101744417641852989607/reviews

BNick Xavier,5,"Hole in the wall vendor (no seating) which serves reliably tasty food for those on the go. Food prepared fresh on the spot. Great value for money, especially now during their lunch promo period. Great kebabs, daily bowls and kunafas. Solid for a takeaway meal.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105967156033890199718/reviews
Mahadhir Mohd,5,"If you are thinking of kebabs then Kebab Bhai is the way to go.

The chicken is on point.
Sauces is not overpowering.
Vegetables fresh af.

Oh if you're looking for a cheat meal, their loaded fries are too good.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114251309897973828373/reviews
