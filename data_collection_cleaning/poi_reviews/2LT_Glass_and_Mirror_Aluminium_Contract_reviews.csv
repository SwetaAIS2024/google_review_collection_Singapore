Sanjeev,5,"I need to absolutely thank 2LT Glass & Mirror Aluminium for their top notch service. From the prompt responses to my queries to their efficient service installing two shower screens for our toilets. 2LT was able to resolve a mistake on my part where the measurement was taken before my toilet contractors laid the steel piping. However, the workers managed to workaround this by customising the frames so that it doesn’t affect the overall look to the frame. Both Hui Ru and the team of installers have to be commended. 5 ⭐️",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114794028407847802429/reviews
Randall Villasenor,5,Our 20 yo glass top for our desk broke and I walked around the AMK industrial estate looking for a glass supplier. Don’t visit the missing glass suppliers shown in Google and just head straight to 2LT Glass. They are efficient and provided great value for our replacement. Thank you Hui Ru!!!,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117815443117046014855/reviews
