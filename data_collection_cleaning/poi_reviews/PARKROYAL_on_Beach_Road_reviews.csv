Dinesh ED,5,"Travelling as a family in April, we stayed three nights at this lovely hotel.
Not too far from the airport and within a 5 minute walk to the Bugis MRT and perfectly positioned next to Kampong Gelam, this lovely hotel catered to all our requirements.
Being within a couple of minutes walk to Arab Street, Haji Lane and the multitude of cafes and places to eat, this hotel is very convenient for any traveller.
The hotel is well maintained and welcoming. The rooms and bathrooms were spotless.
I can't speak highly enough of the staff who were ever willing to help with anything we needed and made our stay as comfortable as possible.
We would have no hestitation is staying at the ParkRoyal on Beach Road when we next visit Singapore.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112398423566423132554/reviews
Isna Hadiya,5,"We had a great time staying in this hotel during our trip to Singapore. The location is strategic near Bugis street and the bus stop just right in front of the hotel. The room was comfortable and clean. The breakfast were good, every day there were different traditional food. The staffs were friendly and helpful, especially Mr. Joseph whom we met at 6th floor lounge. Although the swimming pool still under renovation,overall we enjoy staying in this hotel and hope we'll be back soon.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104003543809079347433/reviews
Sunny B,5,"I had a wonderful stay for a few nights at this hotel in March. The location was great, just next to a bus stop and 5 mins walk from a MRT. You had the bustling arab street just across the road full of restaurants & shops. The room was spacious, the bathroom was large in size & it had the road views which was fine. The decor of the reception & the in-house restaurant was superb as well. Overall, it was a fantastic stay and I highly recommend it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114078382829307336791/reviews
Zulhilmi Razali,4,"I can see how it gets its 4 stars. Really good suites and interior but the lack of professionalism in some staff really shows.

Overall pleasant stay, no complaints. The facilities were under renovation but they offered alternatives in the neighbouring hotel and other sister hotels further downtown.

Good connectivity to tourist destinations but you still have to travel a little to get there.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110269446741778410332/reviews
Faris Karsheh,5,"It was a pleasant 1 week business trip. The hotel is very practical for business trips, well equipped with all basics. Very clean and smells well, not surprising for Asian high quality standard. Staff is very productive and were very quick checking me in after an intercontinental long flight. The breakfast is amazing for 4 stars hotel, they offer omelette station and excellent coffee machine. Well located and accessible for public transportation.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110370541304346980764/reviews
