Ros Dayana,5,"Truly amazed by the takeaway packaging! It looked organized and unique!

The food itself was delightful. I enjoyed the nasi lemak and the sambal, which were both delicious, and the portion sizes were just right. The drinks also had a unique tasteðŸŒ¸",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107368185116676048271/reviews
Henry Hendo,4,"Pretty good, food quality is quite good. Itâ€™s a very small seating area, so seats are limited, especially during lunch hour. Online menu ordering and payment is easy. Nice place for a coffee or a quick meal.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103300698473058743380/reviews
Eileen Ew,1,"would you pay for nasi lemak (1 chicken wing) ayam mera for 12.90. My husband order nasi lemak (1 chicken wing) and I cost 6.50. The difference between mine and his is the sauce. So effectively, the sauce cost $6.40. It is a total rip off. I will never go back to them again. i can get the same nasi lemak with ayam mera chicken (which is bigger) in red ginger  (IMM) at about $8.

There is no doubt the price was clearly stated  but I was shocked I paid $6.40 for the sauce.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107323414557713567446/reviews
CHIN ANG,5,"Stars for value & location variety
New stall in place of old cafe
Muslim nasi, thosais & cakes
Attest to freshness you can see
Staff cook thosai / stir fry goreng
Steam raising from thosai home cooked style
Though lacks crunch of others
Oodles overcooked so softer
Plus constructions front & back
A bit sad
So 3 staffs man  Grabfood to go
Wasted opportunity currently",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106579944402663883280/reviews
