I often come here to eat and take away.
A little ðŸ¤” strange, the stall owner has not adopted the ""QR code"" payment method.
In the morning, this stall opens the earliest, only selling fried noodles, fried rice noodles and rice noodles, but no white rice, and you can't take away vegetables and rice. It has been five years, and it is still like this. I also found that other customers are a little disappointed. I don't know why the stall owner doesn't make some improvements? !

Same as before, there is still no PayNow QR Code printed for customers to scan and pay online. The waiter even said rudely: The boss didn't print it for me!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104017026296774707444/reviews
