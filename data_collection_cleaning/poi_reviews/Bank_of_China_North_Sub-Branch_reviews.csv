Tan Chin Huat,1,Only customer waiting in the bank but I need to wait a long long time for my turn. I drop the idea of opening an account here. The staff seems to have a good chat with the customer and delay the time for those who are waiting,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103726463218311978214/reviews
Calvin Bow,3,"The mobile APP is a disaster. So many options to choose. When I have successfully applied a new account with the APP, the counter staff says it is better to setup everything at the counter. The transaction took another 1.5 hoursâ€¦ wow ðŸ˜®. Super inefficient. They printed out so many paper and sign and chop and sign and chopâ€¦ three staffs handled my new account application!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107646070317849849864/reviews
Gwen Chopard,5,"I'm surprised that I didn't rate this before. It's the best BOC branch to go to. The staff are all very helpful, and they communicate well with one another. They are so patient and efficient, that I didn't have to wait long for my turn, for things to be settled, nor feel rushed to leave the counter till I was certain that no further help was needed.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106841846425871411291/reviews

Jacob Tan,4,"I like the service they gave me at 11am, very patient and help me. But I go home the internet banking I cannot login, but I can login via my phone.

If the internet banking has so much issue, I really rather have a bank book, and not this nonsense. It is cheaper than BOC having to mail me, and pay so much money for stamps.

I be honest compared to UOB and OCBC the graphics of your app is at least a 5 year gap. And if you can't give customers something they feel they can trust, provide an alternative. I do not feel safe when your graphics look the way they do.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103495554616935818854/reviews
