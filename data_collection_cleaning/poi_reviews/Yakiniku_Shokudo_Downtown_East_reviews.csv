Doraemon,4,"Kitty and I have been fans of other establishments under the same management, and we've always enjoyed their consistently good and fresh food. Kitty has been on a strict no-beef diet for the past few months, but her self-imposed restriction finally ended on January 1st. We were cycling through Pasir Ris on a recent outing, and we stumbled upon the Downtown East shopping centre. We hadn't been there in ages and were surprised to see how much it had changed. There was a whole new shopping centre. As we were exploring the mall, we came across Yakiniku Shokudo, and Kitty's eyes lit up. It was the perfect opportunity for her to indulge in her long-awaited beef feast, and we were both excited to try out this Japanese BBQ restaurant. We were ready to feast on their succulent Wagyu Beef.

We ordered a variety of dishes, including the Angus Steak Set ($18.90), the Chicken Tight ($5.90), Japanese Rice ($2.00), Scallop Corn Butter ($6.90), and the Shokudo Full Set ($25.90). We ended up with a hearty and satisfying meal for two, with our total bill coming out to $71.46.

The beef was beautifully presented, but we did find the presentation of the raw chicken a little less appealing. However, we did notice a slight service hiccup. The restaurant wasn't very busy, with only 2 other tables occupied, and we found that all the staff were huddled in the kitchen. We tried to flag down a waiter to ask for some extra yakiniku sauce, but even after waiting until we finished our first set of yakiniku, we couldn't get anyone's attention. We eventually got someone's attention when we went to order our second set and asked for more sauce at the same time.

Overall, the food at Yakiniku Shokudo was delicious, and the price was reasonable for the amount of food we received. However, the service could be improved, especially during less busy times.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112665277904119154671/reviews
Giselle Lim,3,"The food was pretty decent and price was affordable. However , it’s weird when making payment - understood there was a promotion from Citibank where we used the voucher of min spent of $50 excl service charge and gst (we spent 52.60)we should be able to get $5 off  but the cashier said Citibank promo is 50 and the company’s policy is 55 dollars which makes no sense since I’m also using a Citibank card. So the promotion is not valid. If that’s the case, then they shouldn’t advertise this Citibank promo if they are not going to honor it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110919047899020578921/reviews

Charles Ng,2,"I'm not sure why this place is rated over 4 stars. Long story short, horrible service received when I dined with my partner.

Before even sitting down, the staff emphasised no outside food and drinks and had attitude when we walked in 15 minutes before their last order. Halfway into eating, my partner choked on her food and was coughing badly, so she sipped her own drink to stop the cough but the manager (Joreca) came to tell her ""NO OUTSIDE drinks allowed"". Like bro, we know.. but you have a choking diner here and you are not offering water? Anyway we told her off and she walked off with attitude. Refused to be at the counter when checkout so the kitchen staff had to settle our bill.

The only reason why I am giving this 2 stars and not 1 is because of their service recovery. After many calls across all their branches I managed to contact the branch manager and escalated this issue, to which she offered a refund for the poor experience. Hope the service there is better now.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115418489842482801608/reviews
