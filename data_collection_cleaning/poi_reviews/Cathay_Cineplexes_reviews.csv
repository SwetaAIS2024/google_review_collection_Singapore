Benedict Correya,5,"Had a great movie experience here. The staff were friendly and welcoming, making the visit smooth from ticketing to seating. The cinema itself is well-maintained, with comfortable seats and good sound quality. A solid choice for catching a movie in a clean and well-run environment.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113292377967743781974/reviews

Diane Wang,2,"Bought the 10 tics for $100 to support Cathay cinema and decided to use 2 tics today. Was told by counter staff that they cannot be used for 4 movies showing currently and one of them was the one I wanted to watch (The Sinners). I understand that the voucher tics have TCs (eg exclude Tamil movies) but these movies were newly added restrictions. Reason given for not being able to use the vouchers are they are due to distributorsâ€™ TC. The cinema is already showing so few movies (maybe 6-8), so ultimately not much choice at all. I hope Cathay will review this as it is not fair to impose these additional restrictions on the vouchers. Otherwise, there is really nothing much to watch and it will leave supporters disappointed with Cathay. Staff are very friendly though.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113755342539259173098/reviews

Yeo Choon Kuan (Jackson),1,"1. Booking online means you MUST still go to self-ticketing kiosk to print out the tickets. Why?
Suggestion: Using the QR code from online booking, patrons should be able to use that to go into the theatres. Save cost of printing papers. Reduce queues.

2. DONT book seats at A row. Why?
The lights are very bright.
Suggestion: Can dim the lights after 1/2 hour. Sitting there was so uncomfortable.

So to all other patrons, do take noteðŸ˜ƒ",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105250364240796830392/reviews
