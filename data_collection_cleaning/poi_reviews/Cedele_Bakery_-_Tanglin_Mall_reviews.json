Owner should call for last minute gig workers rather than overwork the one person.\n\nAgain it's not the employees fault. More of the employer not getting enough labour to support.\n\nFood wise same as usual.  Won't win Michelin stars anytime soon",

The sandwiches and cakes are also very inviting. The lovely owner and  staff are extremely kind and welcoming. I found a little place I can call a local on my every visit in Singapore",

The quality of the food is a major concern. Moreover, the order took too long. The staff were too ignorant to understand the simple instruction that we wanted the coffee along with the food and not after, despite repeating it twice. The food was overpriced too.",

      "text": "Unfortunately this was a disappointing experience. The sandwich was drenched in the aioli sauce to the point I had to request napkins to soak up the sauce. Otherwise it was inedible.\nBut more inconvenient than that, their drink selection was not conducive to kids so we purchased some drinks at a nearby Boost.\nAfter receiving our sandwich and attempting to sit down, we were told “no outside drinks”. So we were kicked out and forced to deal with the sloppy and not very tasty sandwich.\nWill not return and don’t recommend. I should have seen checked the reviews first.\nWhat a waste of money and time\nUpdate. We threw the sandwich away. Such a bad experience we will never visit any Cedele Bakery ever again",
