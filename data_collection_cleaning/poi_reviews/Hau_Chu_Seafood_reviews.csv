CCS,2,"As many reviewers reported, the place had changed several times during and after the Covid years.

Ate here a few times, sometimes out of curiosity, sometimes out of seeking variety.

Somehow, the signboard may change, but the dining experience hardly differed.

The menu looks promising, but as a true-blue Singaporean, the dishes looked and tasted different from photos or expectations.

Nothing bad, but presentation and flavoring seemed ""distant."" Perhaps it could tge cook. Or maybe just my imaginations.

Dining here has always been so-so.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
Anno Vi,4,"Change management many times, but food is still good. Last visit in July 2017, fish-meat soup has dropped a bit in standard. However stir-fried eggplant with mince meat and mushroom is excellent, fried pumpkin with salted-egg is excellent, and fried fish skin is awesome. Will go again. For 5pax cost about 60sgd. Parking is a bit difficult, go before 11:45am for lunch to ensure space, otherwise prepare to wait for table.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102242682369641037519/reviews
