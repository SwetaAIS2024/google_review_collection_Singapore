Tze Neng Chua,5,"For most people, Joo Chiat is pretty much synonymous with the trendiest cafes, popular eateries, and vibrant hipster hangouts.
Yet, it’s a rather inconspicuous terraced house that’s been garnering attention lately. Nestled along an alleyway on Tembeling Road is Kopikhoo—a literal hole-in-the-wall takeaway coffee kiosk operated by 73-year-old. Age didn’t stop this 73 Y/O S’porean from starting a coffee kiosk from her kitchen window.
I am impressed with her healthy coffee and not so sweet.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104219894705865638823/reviews
Nadine Iris Bongato,5,"Just walking around the area and found this cute take away coffee shop in this clean and quiet alley, I’m so glad! Greeted by Auntie Paulin’s nice and warm smile, the barista/ owner. We even took pictured together! What’s more fascinating is that since it’s my first time, she asked me to write on her notebook, like a diary. Amazed indeed! Should I be coming back? Oh yes, with friends of course. Worth visiting! Second customer btw coz I want to avoid the crowd and I got oat capp. :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114901529769688092087/reviews
Dale,4,"Awesome find for coffee! Auntie was very friendly, asking for our names, beautiful coffee setup.

Hojicha latte seems popular as it was sold out when we got there.

Simon Ong,5,This place only sells coffee and tea beverages. It's just a window at the back of the house opening to the back lane. Paulin is a very nice lady and friendly. She even offered me a pineapple tart with the Americano I ordered. It was strong and well bodied flavour. You could sit at the chairs along the lane to have your drink. The experience was unusual and interesting.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110636878407076920288/reviews
