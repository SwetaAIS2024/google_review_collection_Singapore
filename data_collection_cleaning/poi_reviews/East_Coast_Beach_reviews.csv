Basil Chua,5,"Growing up in Singapore, the East Coast Beach is part of every Singaporean recreation venue. Over the years, it has evolved. What is most uncomfortable are the cargo ships and the litters, plastics, and foams. However, it is still a lot of fun for weekend surfers, kite fliers, family picnic, casual fishing, and a stroll that will take you to Changi Beach if you keep heading East. Happy weekend.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113248174520536231308/reviews
