Sykori Rygon,5,"Small Wonder YISHUN truly has the best principal. She has proven to many parents how great of a leader she is and just how caring she is to all the children and her staff. Not only is she able to handle tough situations, she also ensures the protection of her staff from undeserving and extremely unreasonable parents. Even so, she does not allow a few bad apple parents to affect her relationship with all the other kind hearted parents.

The teachers at Small Wonder Yishun are also loving and professional, despite all the nonsense some parents give them, they maintain mutual respect and do not let the innocent child be caught in any crossfire.

The company should reward these hardworking teachers and the inspiring principal! We need to appreciate such teachers and principals MORE.

Anyone who says otherwise about this centre probably does not know the TRUE heart of those who work here and the heart of the parents who send their children here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116236904700459444951/reviews
Matthew Lim,4,"Been to a friend's unit here. Close to a park, hospital and some air-conditioned food centre so it has good amenities. The studio apartment is a bit small for my taste but cosy.

It is located some distance from the main buzz in Yishun so it is quite quiet and peaceful.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106533400642481554523/reviews
Chunwei Spring Luo,1,"Someone in charge using her personal power gain and bullying others is a shame for Singapore!  That's also the big sadness of the next generation in Singapore! The famous saying of our founder father, 'Be prepared for danger in times of peace'. Likewise, such a person as a big rat in a  good soup of Singapore like to destroy and shame Singapores reputation and better life future ! !!
以权谋私，仗势欺人，新加坡的耻辱！新加坡下一代的悲哀！国父名言，居安思危，这样的人祸国殃民，是新加坡一锅好汤里的一只大老鼠！! !!
""Withdraw !"" It's her strong slogan as a weapon in threatening parents !!!  Never Will never.. couldn't forget the pair of eyes full of cold and fierce and staring at me like my every nightmare even just shouted ""WITHDRAW"" in few times even in front of the child.....
A Big confused that at that moment whether her behavior was a hooligan or a principal ! ?
That so, How can such a person be a Good leader?
Yes, She is ""Good leader"" !  Written a black and White on the broadcast to indicate all parents to request early fetch kids by 630pm because of teacher's wedding event ( looks like the parents no job description to be obeyed just flow over to fetch the kids, isn't? Such kinds of events will took as habits become natural?) That's why the teachers nominated you are ""Good leader"" because you can lead them to participate the happy event so that childcare could close early.
Secondly, She is"" Good leader 👍"" onwards, because she is the one of Strongly support closing on Saturday service for children and very early to held on parents survey and summit on this request actively.... Summarily, everything is beneficial for teachers to reduce work pressure and burden, and reducing responsibility for childcare management will be called this person is a truly ""Good leader!"" Definitely, all teachers as supporters like her as ""Good leader 👍"" ! ! !
As a principal with a heart harder than iron, whom said cheatting to parents, and NOT able to handle problems by her own and push the responsibility to the parents even with slanders, This kinds of be a principal who has standard, a role of  model could be well lead all teachers and educators ?  ? ? and could be well educate the next generation of Singapore? ? ?
God, that's Busy Bee's shame and Singapore next generation 's sadness  ! ! !",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112296819595046010600/reviews
