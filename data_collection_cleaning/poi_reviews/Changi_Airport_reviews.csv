Jon Vb,5,"It's Big, really big. Makes Tullamarine look small regionalairport. Lovely and clean with helpful staff.  A destination within itself.  You could easily loose 4 hours looking around and dining at some of the attractions.

Easy to get around,  Err when you know where you're going.

Mono rail is available between T1, T2, T3.
T4 is by bus.
All very efficient. üòÉ",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105246334346411428657/reviews
