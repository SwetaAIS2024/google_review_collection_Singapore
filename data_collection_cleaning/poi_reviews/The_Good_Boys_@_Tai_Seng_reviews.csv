Jaclyn Low,5,We ordered two lattes and we loved it. Definitely not the best we‚Äôve had but can‚Äôt complain! Small cafe‚Ä¶ unfortunately there was a table of youths who were rather loud and made our experience a tad unpleasant. We also tried the pancakes but regretted ordering it. Will prob drop by again for a quick caffeine fix.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105880595103136544185/reviews
