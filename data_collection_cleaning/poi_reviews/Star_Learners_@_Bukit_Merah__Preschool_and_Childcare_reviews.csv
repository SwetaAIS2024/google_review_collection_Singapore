Gabriel Ghor,5,"My son absolutely loves his time at STAR LEARNER @ Jalan Bukit Merah ! The teachers are incredibly friendly, kind, and patient, creating a warm and welcoming environment for all the children. I've noticed how quickly my son is learning new things, and it's amazing to see his progress every day. The kids are also very friendly, which makes it a great place for social development. I highly recommend this childcare to any parent looking for a safe, nurturing, and educational place for their little one!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117402900067241904381/reviews
