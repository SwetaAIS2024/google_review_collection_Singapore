Kayden Choo,5,"I must say this stall has 1 of the best noodles. Tried the Ee-mian Soup and QQ Noodles before, they were really good!

So far the staffs have been really friendly and polite. I find the food reasonably priced too.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111046245288496998971/reviews

Suzene Ang,4,"This is my go-to Ban Mian place around the area. It is simple, and it is cheap. I usually have the Mee Hoon kueh ($3.30) and sometimes the deep fried dumplings which is not too oily as they drain the oil well. They are 10 for $5. Nice broth for the soup and a good al dente bite for the kueh. They usually open till late. Maybe about 9+ to 10pm. 4 stars because not enough veg usually but I am sure you can always ask for more. The dumplings are a good mix of pork, chives and grated carrots.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104287929545160040762/reviews
