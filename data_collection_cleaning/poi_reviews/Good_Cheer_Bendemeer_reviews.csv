Lim En Yi,5,"Our favorite spot to unwind after work! With plenty of dartboards, karaoke and a great selection of drinks and food, it’s the perfect place to relax. The chicken chop spaghetti is a must-try—delicious and reasonably priced! The service is top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff who always make us feel welcome. Plus point for the atmosphere as the place is clean and cosy. Highly recommend!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111614905741254373599/reviews

Jason Willock,5,"Didn't try the food, but the beer is reasonably priced.

The pool tables are in good condition, and quite a few good players there. The pool is free.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108053369900561923091/reviews
nigel wee,1,"After writing my name and waiting for 40 mins to play pool, I had to ask the staff to help me check. She then told me the players started a game with cards and money of their own and it will take another 1.5 hours.

Waste of time this place.

Staff don't have a say in the pool table.

If you're not a regular don't bother, you'll be treated like 2nd class citizen.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115769328892044183211/reviews
