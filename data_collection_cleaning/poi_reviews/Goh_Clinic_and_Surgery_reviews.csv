Grace Colette,5,"I first went to Dr Goh a few years ago to seek help for my stomach issues and very poor appetite. After seeing him a couple times after starting on very routine and regular medication, Dr Goh has successfully helped me to regain my appetite (fixed my appetite and hunger timings). Throughout this semi-term medication to readjust my stomach’s acids, I have also learned how to have a better outlook towards eating. I don’t have an eating disorder but my hunger and appetite were very out of sorts. This in turn, eased my anxiety and helped me to get better. To this date, I am still doing very well!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107738994465819650246/reviews
