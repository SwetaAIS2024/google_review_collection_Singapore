Cheryl Chua,5,"We recently visited Turkish Lezzet House, and it was our first time trying Turkish cuisine ‚Äì what an incredible experience! The Lamb Iskender Kebab we had for our mains was absolutely delicious, with rich flavours and a generous portion that left us perfectly satisfied. The pita bread remained warm and  crispy throughout our meal. To top it off, we indulged in their Baklava for dessert, which was the perfect sweet treat to end our meal.

The service was equally impressive. Despite being a  self-service restaurant, the staff went above and beyond, having us sit while they will brought us our food. The chef, who takes his craft very seriously, greeted us with the warmest smiles and even cleared our plates himself before dessert. This thoughtful touch really stood out.

Turkish Lezzet House has set a high bar for casual Turkish cuisine, and we can‚Äôt wait to return for another delightful meal! Highly recommend for anyone seeking delicious food paired with warm service.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102077507673406342567/reviews

Faris L,5,"Visited again after april 2025 renovation!
Seems like the standard is still there and food taste good! Missed this place when it was under renovation, glad to have you back!

Tried the apple tea which was new on the menu. Sweet, but not too sweet and fragrant apple flavour and smell.

Always came back for the meat platter mixed. Meat is not dry and taste good with the bread. Eat with chilli would be best!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110869943626941709203/reviews
Ed Seet,4,"I tried the doner kebab a long time ago when my office was in Suntec. It was good. Tried the mixed grill rice last night, chef maintained the standard üëçüèª Except the taste of lamb was gamey even for someone who likes lamb. Will order chicken next time. Worth a try.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106443726830878088320/reviews
