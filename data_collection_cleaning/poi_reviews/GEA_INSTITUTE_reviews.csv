Jay Jay,1,"Just completed the course  . It was quite fast and officiant when it comes to study.
It was a hospitality  executive program with ""job placement"" after that. I was surprised  duo to the covid19 satiation   that ""job placement is even possible"".
Seems like I was right. After the study part was over, ""job placement"" is postponed till future noticed with regards to the current situation ""

I'm fine with the online study course  but  the other half deserves 0.
Since I did ask regarding the job placement in July when I was enrolling on!
