Chang Mui Fang,5,Brought my helper for teeth extraction! Dr Cheryl Goh was very helpful and patient. Explained the process very thoroughly before the extraction takes place. And told me the precautions my helper need to take note from now on.(her oral hygiene is really bad). Her assistant and counter staff are also very friendly. Their charges are reasonable too!
