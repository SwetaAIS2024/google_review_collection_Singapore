The thick and fluffy Buttermilk Pancakes are still very good and the scrambled eggs are beautifully done as well. Kudos to the chef and team",

      "text": "Puzzle Coffee, originally from Melbourne, has opened its new Dempsey outlet to showcase a laid-back brunch scene in a bright, open-concept space. Their burger—with perfectly crispy fries—steals the show, while the scrambled eggs with chili offer a fun twist on a breakfast staple. While I was hoping the coffee reflects Puzzle’s Melbourne roots, which spots a robust and flavorful brew, the iced coffees here were pretty diluted with ice and mild.\n\nService may feel uneven: there’s a service charge despite the need to order at the counter and fetch your own water. While staff are generally pleasant and accommodative, don’t expect the fully attentive table service you might be used to. Overall, it’s worth checking out for the spacious ambience and well-executed dishes, if you can tolerate a self-service setup.",

      "text": "We decided to visit this relatively new establishment to give it a try. Service by Gloria was great. Charming, knowledgeable and engaging. We had the pancakes, roast chicken and tuna melt. The pancakes were very good. With added crumble, fresh and stewed fruits, delivered a delightful experience in taste and texture. The roast chicken is outrageously good. ½ a spring chicken, brined and perfectly seasoned and cooked. It was a simple presentation but should not be missed. The dish was accompanied by a salad and fries, again beautifully cooked and prepared. I seriously could gobble up another order. The tuna melt was average. The cheese and bread was good and the filling generous, however it could be improved. Overall a decent experience and certainly worth a visit. We will return again, if nothing else, for the chicken.",
