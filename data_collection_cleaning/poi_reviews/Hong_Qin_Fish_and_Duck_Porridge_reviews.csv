Winston Ho,4,"Located at a bottom of a HDB block, this shop occupies the whole coffee shop unit.

They sell batang fish soup, fish head soup and a variety of braised items - pig trotters, pork belly, big intestines, small intestines, duck, tau kwa, egg, mei chai, kiam chye and more.

My usual order is a big bowl of sliced fish soup, pork belly, tau kwa, large intestines and mei chai.

The fish are fresh and the meats are braised well and tasty.

The soup is clean tasting and naturally flavorful with a hint of tee poh.

For condiments, they have cut red chilli and chilli dip.

Highly recommended! üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109087882208981210478/reviews
Fiona Ng,3,Nice fish soup but a bit more salty maybe due to the added fish crisps. And reasonably good braised duck and rice.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109958357946891654603/reviews

Adeline Too,2,"I just eaten today.
The food is superb, I love the fish soup and pork leg. However got 1 china woman staff has bad attitude, refuse to give me extra bowls and still dare to talk so loud to explain to the boss.
Although food is good, they have neglected what is called a good customer service which play an important role as well.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106645647946405525558/reviews
Christopher Koh,5,"Really good meal for a reasonable cost - ordered duck leg, pork trotter, large intestine, pork skin, mei cai, tau pok with yam rice and a bowl of sliced fish soup - all for $31.

The fish soup was light but flavorful, with generous fish slices that were fairly thick.

The pork trotters and large intestine were tender and tasty, while the mei cai had a mellowness to it that balanced the flavors.  The tau pok was soft and soaked up the sauce well and the pork skin had been tracked over with small punctures to let the sauce penetrate.

The drinks were sold separately. They had an interesting peach gum drink that was more cheng tng than anything else.

Definitely worth a visit.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104262271032362286480/reviews
