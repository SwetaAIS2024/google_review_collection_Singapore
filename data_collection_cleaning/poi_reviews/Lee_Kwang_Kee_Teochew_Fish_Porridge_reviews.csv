Angie Ho,2,"Tasty soup and it falls short in terms of providing a full meal for the average person. I think the menu should better reflect this so customers can make more informed decisions about their spending.

As noted in other reviews, even as someone with a smaller appetite, the meal felt insufficient. The fish was served in only a few small pieces, with just some lettuce and a lot of soup. While the soup was tasty, the portion of fish was quite meager, which was very different from the photos advertised.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114632119201744496240/reviews
K Tan,3,"First time trying this teochew style fish soup.
When ordering the standard batang fish soup,the lady taking orders will upsell you to order the more expensive grouper fish($10) .
Give it a try and find the soup base very tasty but they are stingy with fish portion and is miniscule. Small bits and pieces.
I give them thumbs up for taste but grouper fish is not worth it.
Stick with the standard. Tried once is enough.

Lyn Tam,3,"Ordered a $6.50 fish soup without rice, had around 8 pieces of fish. The fish does taste as good as I imagined. Soup is ok and I liked the fried stuff added to it.

Seng Hock Chang,3,"$4.50 for small batang fish soup, 5.5 thin slices, at least the soup was plentiful and tasty.

$1.50 for lu ruo fan - not even close to the real thing! Absolute false naming and advertising....

Unless you die die must have fish soup, this is one of the two stalls in Kovan food centre (the other at wanton mee row).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113899372880642892393/reviews
