Andras Varsanyi,5,"Loved this yearâ€™s edition of S.E.A Focus. Well curated works, showcasing a diverse set of artists and various art forms. Also enjoyed seeing works of experimentation by different artists like Wong Keen and Ong Kim Seng. Loved the coffee and great service offered by the Burnt Ends team and last but not least the friendly and welcoming demeanor of every member of the security staff.. the only thing I wish would be different is to allow for some time for Q&A during the talks. Overall still awesome event! Until next year!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104601719864647052797/reviews
