      "text": "Lucky plaza is quite an interesting mall. It has a few grocery shops that sell products from Philippines, beauty salons, money exchange, employment agencies, clothing and foot ware stores. Lots of busy eateries especially Indonesian restaurants that are packed around lunch time. One snack shop that had a long line- serving desserts (cash only though) and another that had fried hot food, both are stand alone shops that aren't part of the food court. Floors are all accessible through escalators and elevators. If you are looking for snacks and food items from the Philippines then this is probably the place to go to.",

Don't forget the small food court on the top floor. Also an interesting selection of Filipino shops, eateries and bakery serving authentic Filipino bakes and desserts.",
