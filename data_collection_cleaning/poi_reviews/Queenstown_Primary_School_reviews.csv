Kyra Teo Shu En (Crescentgirl),5,"I am a sec 1 student now and I just graduated from QTPS. The teachers in this primary school is very kind and patient. They really played a big role in my primary school journey, making sure everyone understands before moving on. They will take the effort to know all our troubles and difficulties, letting us know that we are not alone. When I was in primary 6, they really stood by us and went the extra mile to help us.

Chen Yujing (Crescentgirl),5,"I am a sec 1 student now and i just graduated from this primary school last year. From my experience, all of the teachers in this primary school are very patient during our learning journey especially towards the Primary Leaving School Examination(PSLE). They definitely played a big part in my primary school journey, making it memorable while making sure that every students strives to do their best in their exams, cca, etc. They will also take the initiative to help us with our troubles and difficulties, making sure that we can all feel safe in school.
