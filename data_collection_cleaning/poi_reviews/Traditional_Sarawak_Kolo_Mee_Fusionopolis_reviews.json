      "text": "The picture looks nice, but not the actual presentation. The noodles taste average and slightly bland compared to the original Kuching Kolo Mee, the noodles were overcooked, nowhere near as authentic or traditional as claimed. It may have adapted to local preference. The curry was bad for the price, with one big chunk missing from the drumstick with a lot of potatoes. Pricing may be due to the location and not the portion, not worth coming back.",
