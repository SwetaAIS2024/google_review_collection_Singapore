      "text": "Sharing specifically the store from SG-MY. On 4th Mac 2025 approximately 10.30am, there's an Indian lady cashier with extremely rude attitude. She had problems scanning a credit card from a group of foreigner customers. Seeing that there was another empty cashier, I just went aside and scanned the bank QR, cashier machine ringed \"Rm5 received!\" but she yelled at me, demanding to wait without given reason. When I ignored her and left, she again yelled at me to go back and give her the drink and scan. I told her she could have said so nicely but was greeted with another scream from her. This should not be the standard of ur convenience store as it shows unprofessional behavior. Pls take necessary action and discipline ur staff.",

Despite long queue, they open one cashier with 2 people in the counter. One is the cashier dealing w faulty machine, another will pretend busy like unpacking, cleaning table, looking up the ceiling if got lizard, dropping pen n picking up again and keep repeating instead of opening another cashier. You really can observe the Dilbert managers here. 1 worker w one manager!",
