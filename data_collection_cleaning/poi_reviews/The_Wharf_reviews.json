The food was above average, the prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere was good, except that it is an open-air restaurant and not air-conditioned. The service was excellent.\n\n[Edit 8 months later] The food was disappointing. The beef in the Beef Bee Hoon Wokhey was too tough to eat, and the Chengdol was not good.",

When asked, she said she forgot and after half of my meal is finished I got my egg.\n\nWhen reminded about egg, I also requested for some chillies. She asked me what exactly I want, but it was never delivered. Very bad service.\n\nDefinitely think twice before going there. Very late delivery and missing items for such  a restaurant is not good.",
