The coffee is good and robust.\n\nOnly downside is the price, as it costs me $1.50. This is the price at a coffee shop, not what I expect at a hawker stall.\n\nThe pricing is similar to another stall at the same food center, which charged me $1.40 for a Kopi o.\n\nCoffee is rather expensive in Tampines Round Market and food center. üò∞",

The line moved swiftly as both the boss and worker could be seen hard at work taking the orders and preparing as quickly as they could. Even though they were busy, their service was not compromised. I ordered the set ($3.80) and they made sure the individual items were served as they were ready.\n\nLove everything about the kopi, toasts and eggs! Will be my staple from now on.",
