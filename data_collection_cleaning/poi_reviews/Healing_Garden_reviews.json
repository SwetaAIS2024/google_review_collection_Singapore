I was expecting just a few plants, but there are very many here organised in groupings based on what body system the plant is supposed to help, eg, respiratory & circulatory systems, Reproductive system etc. Information boards tell you about each plant and its health benefits. This is a very interesting garden, the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't have the beautiful visual impact which you get from the colourful Orchid garden.",
