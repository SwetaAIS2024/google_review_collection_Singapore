      "text": "Toto was my podiatrist and helped treat the warts on my foot. My treatment required three sessions in total, and now that my foot has fully healed, I couldnâ€™t be happier! :)\n\nBefore starting, Toto and his team reviewed a photo of my condition and provided helpful information. I thought it was corns at first but they explained that it was warts instead. During the first session, he thoroughly explained what warts are and how the procedure works, which reassured me and boosted my confidence. His calm and friendly approach made the entire process smooth and stress-free.\n\nI highly recommend him to anyone in need of a podiatrist!",

Ee Laine was very patient, detailed and explained a lot of things to us. Ending off with very useful exercises for her to do at home. Also teaching us on things to look out for before deciding on the next step.",
