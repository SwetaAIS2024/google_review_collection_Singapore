Denise Watt,5,"I've had such a positive experience here to remove two moles - one that required cutting and stitching, and the other through laser. Both required injections too. I was initially worried and scared out of my mind, but Dr Joyce is so experienced, the whole process for everything was so quick and painless! Dr Joyce really knows her stuff, and she makes quick diagnoses and decisions, and there is no time wasting! What would have possibly taken me 6 months to get sorted out elsewhere, was done in two weeks, and at a reasonable price too. In addition, she waived some procedure fees, which was truly a blessing as it was unexpected. How lucky am I! Thank you, Dr Joyce! :D",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118308874504437622168/reviews
Martin Nathanael,1,"I visited Dr. Joyce Lim’s clinic for acne treatment and underwent nearly a year of care (including six months on Accutane). While my acne is now under control, post-acne redness and scarring remain. I proceeded with several laser sessions costing >SGD 5,000, but saw MINIMUM to NO IMPROVEMENT

I understand her busy schedule, however, consultations were brief (5–10 minutes for SGD 130) and often felt rushed, with different topical medication prescriptions and diagnoses at each visit. When I raised my concerns, I was accused of mistreating her staff—an allegation that I strongly deny and found highly unprofessional.

Considering the significant cost and lack of clear results, I expected a more patient-focused and respectful experience. I hope this feedback helps improve care quality for others.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117137892727376167749/reviews
Laura Morandi,5,"A friend recommended Dr Lim to me and I have seen her twice for acne related issues recently. My experience has been wonderful so far!

She saw me on the dot and spent time listening to my concerns, explaining the possible causes of my acne and the course of action she was recommending. She is highly professional, straightforward and really caring. She did not ridicule my acne or belittle my feelings about the issue, like all the other dermatologists I saw did. Her staff are also helpful and very responsive by email.

My acne is improving and I would recommend Dr Lim to anyone!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102507320921791222112/reviews

veggiexplorer,3,"Bought a cream around 80ish sgd that apparently need to use finish immediately… I did not know nor remember being informed (disclaim: could also be I forgot),  resulting in it turning color as shown in pictures (hence if you buy cream from them, remember to use fast despite expiry is long later)…

I messaged them and they allowed exchange. Headed down but on the spot, another staff told me no exchange.. luckily text messages have proof of another staff allowing exchange so I got an exchange…

Decided to give a review after awhile cause technically after few hundreds (can’t rmb how much) spent, had one laser treatment and another one follow up >>> it did not resolved my problem of scar / raised scar … but I also did not want to go again despite being promised of “free follow up if issue not resolved”. This is because my problem has persists despite multiple laser elsewhere (before going to them) too… leap of faith in their laser but now I simply understand whatever laser which clinic offer, simply can’t flatten my raised scar issue.

Dr joyce is nice.
Staff are responsive.
Issue not solve.
Cream hmmmm
Hence 3 stars.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108260711630543879149/reviews
