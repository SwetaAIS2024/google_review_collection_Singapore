Pulicat Ettikudiappan,4,Bought Olive Rice and Tom Yum Soup. Both were huge portions and had very good taste. The lady who served the food was courteous and pointed out upfront the items on the menu that were not available.

Lucie Moinvaziri,3,"The bar has the merit of being there, since it is the only one. Cocktails and mocktails are sweet, full of syrups, I didn't really enjoy it. But at least you can have a drink before going to a recital, which is nice.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116397420428102018276/reviews
Kerwin Chia,5,"Bar Bar Black Sheep offers a relaxed and inviting atmosphere, perfect for a casual meal with friends or family. The chicken dishes are truly exceptional, juicy, and perfectly seasoned, whether you choose the grilled or crispy fried variant. The mango salad is a standout, bursting with fresh, vibrant flavors, and the sweet mango pairs beautifully with the tangy dressing. Both dishes create a delightful mix of textures and tastes that complement each other perfectly. This spot is a must-visit for any food lover, leaving you with a satisfied palate.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107161572084517734503/reviews
CK C,3,Had an iced lemon tea on a scorching hot afternoon as the bar opens only at 6pm. It was very refreshing but contained more ice than drink. Not much to complain as it cost $3.50. Friendly staff.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
