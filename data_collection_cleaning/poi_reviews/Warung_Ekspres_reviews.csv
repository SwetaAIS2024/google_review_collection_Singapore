Gator,3,"I recently visited Warung Ekspres, a local cafe in Malaysia that serves traditional dishes like nasi lemak and lontong. Unfortunately, my experience was a mixed bag, leaning more toward disappointment. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my visit:

**Ambience and Seating:**
The cafe was completely empty when I arrived after 8pm, which was a bit surprising. They offer both indoor and outdoor seating, and the space itself is clean and simple. However, the lack of customers made the atmosphere feel a bit dull and uninspiring.

**Food and Drinks:**
I ordered a few items to try:
- **Chendol:** This was okay‚Äînothing outstanding, but decent enough. The flavors were balanced, though it didn‚Äôt leave a lasting impression.
- **Kaya Toast:** This was a letdown. The cafe used Planta margarine instead of butter, which significantly impacted the taste. The kaya (coconut jam) lacked fragrance, and the bread was very ordinary. It felt like a missed opportunity to deliver a classic Malaysian favorite.
- **Iced Coffee:** The coffee tasted stale, as if it had been sitting for too long. It lacked the freshness and richness you‚Äôd expect from a good cup of iced coffee.
- **Iced Lemon Tea:** This was the highlight of the meal. It was refreshing and well-balanced, with just the right amount of sweetness and tanginess.

**Price:**
The total bill came up to RM33.10, which felt quite expensive for the quality and portion sizes. For context, this is on the higher end for local cafes, especially given the mediocre food and drinks.

**Overall Impression:**
While the cafe has potential with its local dishes and comfortable seating, the execution fell short during my visit. The Kaya Toast and iced coffee were particularly disappointing, and the prices didn‚Äôt justify the quality. The only saving grace was the iced lemon tea, which was enjoyable.

**Rating:** 3/5
- Pros: Comfortable seating, decent iced lemon tea.
- Cons: Overpriced, mediocre food quality, stale coffee, disappointing Kaya Toast.

Would I return? Probably not, unless they improve their food quality and offer better value for money. There are plenty of other local cafes that deliver a more satisfying experience at a reasonable price.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
Anne Lau,4,"2nd visit, still love the ambience here. Quiet and clean. Our cirst visit there were many flies but this time round there was no fly. Very impressed. We ordered a nasi lemak with fried chicken and lekor. Portion is generous, very yummy! My kids love coming because there is a kids section with simple toys and books.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104617899808659440891/reviews

Quiet, clean and peaceful with plenty of parking space. Service was quick and fast and friendly staff.
