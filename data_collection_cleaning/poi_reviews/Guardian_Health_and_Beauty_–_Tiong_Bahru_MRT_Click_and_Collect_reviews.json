      "text": "Partially my fault cause I ended classes late so I only reached the shop at 9.55pm, 5 min before closing.\nBut I went in there wanting to get 2 things, Panadol and neuflo because I was sick and just so happen to run out of those 2 medications that I needed. So I went in there and calmly asked for the 2 medications, the cashier rudely snapped at me that they were closed. There was technically still 5 minutes before closing so I was confused. I tried to explain that I really needed the medication but the cashier just kept on snapping at me that they were closed.\nI understand that I came in very late, but your shop has not closed yet and the medication I needed do not require prescription. Overall was a very bad experience for me.",
