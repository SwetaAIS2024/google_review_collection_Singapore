Both were tasty except that the curry was a bit oily. Will return to try their other dishes if I'm nearby.\n\nI've visited other Shu vegetarian outlets and based on the 2 above dishes, I have the impression that the food in this one is better, though the dishes offered in their menu are similar.\n\nThey have a air con area with round table sear for a larger group, though I took the non aircon table. The open car park is a few steps away.",
