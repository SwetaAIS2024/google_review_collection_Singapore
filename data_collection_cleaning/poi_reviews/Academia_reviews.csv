Qingsheng Peng,1,"Recently, the building management banned bicycle parking in unused and out-of-sight areas outside the building. Employees are now forced to park in an open, unsecured area where locking bicycles is impossible. The location is also on a slope and without proper support, making it difficult to keep bikes upright instead of falling on ground, especially in windy conditions. This decision disregards the needs of employees who rely on cycling for their commute and shows how little the management cares about the working class.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112298537590806965339/reviews

K a l 1 S S,4,"Review : August 2022
Great building to talk about medical adventures and play sick 😷 🙂 for others to learn how to work 🙃 🙂 professionally.  Fees and charges are charged according to impressive set-ups. That's the vital importance of such infrastructure
Have witnessed good medical care in the past decades unlike now with huge impressive infrastructure but unlike the past modest professional work 👏
