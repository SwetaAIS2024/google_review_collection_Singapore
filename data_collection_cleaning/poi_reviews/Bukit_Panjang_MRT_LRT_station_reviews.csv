William W,4,"Bukit Panjang MRT/LRT station
The mrt is just beside Hillion Mall the shopping mall in Bukit Panjang is the West of Singapore.  Together with the Hillion Residences condominium that sits above the mall, the property is integrated with the Bukit Panjang bus interchange and LRT and MRT stations. According to the website of Sim Lian Group who is the developer of the project, the mall has 240,000 sq ft of gross floor area and more than 100 retail shops spread over 4 levels.   We don’t like to shop but we love to eat, so what we were really interested in is what to eat at Hillion Mall.  We took a quick tour and compiled a list of the Hillion Mall Food Places and Restaurants.  This is not a complete list as there could be some that we missed out – we suggest you refer to the official tenant directory at Hillion Mall for a full list of shops and restaurants.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110898291687894247770/reviews
Edmund Rodriguez,2,"Many times the display monitor of train arrival not reliable.

I hope management will look into it because public will sometimes opt to take taxi if interval displayed are not correct.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105585619793653650116/reviews
Ms. Suchi Singapore,5,"Bukit Panjang MRT/LRT station is a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT) station on the Downtown line (DTL) and the Bukit Panjang LRT line (BPLRT), at the triple-point boundary of Bukit Panjang, Bukit Batok and Choa Chu Kang. It is located at the junction of Upper Bukit Timah Road and Petir Road in Singapore near Bukit Panjang Plaza and is part of the Bukit Panjang Integrated Transport Hub.

Hillion Mall and Junction 10 will be the nearest malls from here.

There is a 7/11 store, POSB machine and a shop named Rosyth selling snacks and breads  etc.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101222089436758795522/reviews
dylan kyaw thu,2,"Don't know if anyone higherup will see this review, but general impression after 3 visits to the counters are that service is quite poor (especially at the mrt ticketing counters.)
Staff speak in a patronizing tone and look at you as if you're troubling them over a simple issue.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116894846083945149134/reviews
Candice,1,"SMRT please do something about the LRT. Having already only one way during off peak hours for repair works since 2019, yet we are still experiencing delays during the peak hours now in 2023. It doesn't make sense to take almost 30mins to get from Segar LRT to Bukit Panjang LRT. It's not even an one time off event. It's consecutive days/weeks. We should be moving forward with time, not deteriorate as time passes. Please buck up. Do deploy buses if required.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104761931369781691455/reviews
