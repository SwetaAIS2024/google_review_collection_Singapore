I order soup ban mian to takeaway and the noodles was not packed separately. When questioned, the Chinese lady said I never request. I see all other grab orders were packed separately. She even argued with me that they have been doing this le not packing separately for many years. I just went through the facebanmian website which indicate that all soup noodles are packed separately BY DEFAULT! The service staff are simply cutting corners.\n\nBtw, The face ban mian website do not have anywhere for feedback. That also shows they do not care about customer feedback.\n\nI would suggest customers do not patronise them. We deserve better! Money better spend elsewhere.",
