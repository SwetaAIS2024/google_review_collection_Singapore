Teh C Gao Siew Dai,4,"Visited again on 1 August 2023. There wasn't a queue for ordering, but there was one for collection. Paid via the Grab app.

Date of visit: 31 May 2023. There was a queue when arrived during lunch time, however it moved along quite fast. Due to outlet being near a smoking point, you can sometimes smell the faint cigarette smoke. Drink wise, the Teh C tastes a bit diluted.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102646679801920717610/reviews
