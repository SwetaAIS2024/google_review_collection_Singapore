Patrick Lau,4,"Was there for a football club fundraiser and the first interaction was with the security personnel at the gate gantry.  Absolutely impressive! Very professional, friendly and articulated directions clearly.

The ballroom: layout with a narrow foyer limits networking activities prior to the dinner.  Cocktails were so so and limited standing tables.

The ball room itself is right sized for a 30 table banquet max.  Food was decent and service crew was great

Looking forward to my next event there",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106881591692184457438/reviews
Nicole Yang,4,"Enjoyed my evening, atmosphere was fantastic and place was spacious! Enough space to put 30 tables of 10, a stage and 2 projector screens. Definitely felt grand and suitable for wedding. My only complaint is the food - while still good, it wasn't very stand out (could be to do with the dishes served and not the overall standard of the kitchen). Dessert was also very sweet and fish very tough. My friend having halal food also commented that the food was not fantastic taste wise. The platter and scallops were good though!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107660172885999064218/reviews
Jaclyn,5,"Had our kidâ€™s birthday here. Raymond, Andy and team were amazing and made sure we had everything we needed before, during and after the event. The food and stage were set up on time, the AV systems worked great and they were very accommodating towards our vendors.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104978816706597358571/reviews
Eugene Khoo,5,"Attended wedding lunch at SICC ballroom.
Nice ballroom, plenty of space between tables. Banquet food (Chinese) was good, better than some hotels.
The only cautionary advice for others : do remember to ask for complimentary parking. The carpark rates are ridiculously expensive!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113597575884662262145/reviews
