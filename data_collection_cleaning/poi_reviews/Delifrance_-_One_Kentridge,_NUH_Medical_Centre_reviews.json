      "text": "Had a very disappointing experience here. I was queuing up by the pastry fridge outside the shop for a good 15 minutes, right in front of an elderly person. I was patient at first as I understood there seemed to be a large Grab order. But what triggered me the most was that no one took the initiative to direct us to the counter to order. Instead, they prioritized walk-in customers at the counter and completely ignored us. No apology was given, and to make things worse, the staff showed us a black face as if we were the ones at fault. Ended up walking away — extremely poor service and very disappointing.",

Been eating Delifrance since young age for many years and must say their standard/food quality dropped significantly despite the increase in price over the years. And the counter staff need to be more pleasant with customers instead of being grumpy. Will be better if they improve their service. Especially at this outlet (NUH) where the customers mostly are hospital staff and patients who seek some comfort in food despite their illness.",
