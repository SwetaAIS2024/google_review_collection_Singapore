It sells a fusion mee pok.\n\nThe seasoning is made with miso, giving it a more fragrant flavor, and slight spiciness from the chilli. The noodles were cooked to a good doneness and the toppings were generous. The pork chashu were very tender. The soup broth is also very tasty.",

We ordered both the Shoyu and Miso variations.\n\nThe rich, savory flavors of Japanese soy sauce combined with the chewy texture of Mee Pok make the Shoyu variation truly unique.\n\nThe Miso variation is pretty much a run-of-the-mill Mee Pok, but give it a shot if you have the stomach space!",

But having had the previous versions - which was a 5 for me - I can only give it a 3 for now. \"Re\"-opened for about 10 days; so maybe still new and the new owner still trying to adjust. The \"chef\", a young local boy, seemed to be in control of things. Will I be back? Maybe give it a month or two.",
