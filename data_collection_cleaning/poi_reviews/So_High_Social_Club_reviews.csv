Eugene Tan,4,Went with a couple of my friends on a weekday. The staff are friendly and the place does have a fun concept. The place is decent and tidy but do not expect it to be extremely lavish or provide bougie service. Overall great place to hang out but attentiveness of waitress could be slightly better,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116381232694631724838/reviews
wtjong79,1,It's a very lousy club.. People go there for celebrations but they not enough budget to cathering the foods for every1.. So some of my friends keep complaining that they had no enough foods to eat as they can only take 1 time for their 1st anniversary.. Same for singing only can sing 1 time until their all their own friends sing 1 to 2 rounds already then can let customers sing which is 3 hours later.. Best part is they said will insert the song for U but they will delete customer songs for no reasons a several times & let their friends sing 1st.. Next time just open family ktv better.. No need celebration Cakes also for own family or BFF .,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107233735895051586519/reviews

Gregory Sim (Pwaggygreggy),1,"Staffs keep insert songs for their friends & family, had to wait 2 hours just to sing 2 songs when the same guy was singing 6 songs straight. Aircon is weak & had smelly toilet smell.

Only good thing has ah lians dress revealing asking to buy ladies drinks all the time",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113172202438931282425/reviews
Jerome Cheok,5,"Had one of the best times in my 30s here! The vibe and people were really cool!! You probably wouldn't feel like this is one of those boring pubs!

Their karaoke ðŸŽ¤  system is solid as well!! Also, for those wanting to enjoy good vocals or showcase your vocals here's really a solid place!

Will come back soon!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112352474806893428099/reviews
