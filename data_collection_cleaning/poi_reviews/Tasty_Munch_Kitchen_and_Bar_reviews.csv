Na Di,5,"In every dim morning, when the first ray of sunshine penetrates the clouds gently and touches the earth, a carefully prepared breakfast is like the prelude of love, quietly playing; it is not only a pampering for the taste buds, but also a pampering for the taste buds. It is an affectionate confession to the soul.

The exquisite tableware and colorful food are as pleasing to the eye as works of art. They not only nourish the body, but also awaken the soul that has been sleeping all night, making every ordinary day shine with this sense of ritual. Hui.

Thus, a beautiful day slowly kicked off with this delicate care and romantic expectations.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111758847942959680862/reviews
