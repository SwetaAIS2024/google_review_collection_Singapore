Bryan Fang,5,"Came here wanting to try the buffet but after discussion felt that a buffet of only oysters and highball would be too much for us. Decided upon having ala-carte instead.

Ordered a variety of dishes to try. Can see from pictures. Skewers were great, chicken skin and softbone good. Hyogo oysterd were fantastic, big, fresh and wholesome. Truly recommended to get the oysters even if you are not there for the buffet. They are at $22 for 3.

We ordered some alcohol to go along as well. Guiness, calpis highball and kirin beer.
Really good combination.

Staff were friendly and prompt in action.

Music was good, environment was comforting. We had a great chat and lots of laughter. Went at about 6pm on tuesday, no crowd.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114490699769830179262/reviews
maggie tan,2,"Disappointed, the food mostly not nice and pricy. Highball taste like fruit soda fizz.
We did not take the oyster n highball buffet and weekend cost $68+ and half of us dun drink.
Oyster is really good but it cost $22++ for 3 pcs only. So it makes more sense to go for buffet if u can eat at least 9 oysters.
Chicken skin, pork belly with asparagus, mantou and unagi is good too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105264546029925007365/reviews
She Chan,4,Tried out the Changi branch since Bali Ln is closed on Sundays. Equally good and reasonably priced yakitori sticks and drinks. Kudos to the service staff who single-handedly managed 5-6 tables. Highly recommended. Would be great to try their oyster and highball buffet soon.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100105400422210682159/reviews
Rachel Ooi,2,"Dined in yesterday and had a couple of Yakitori Skewers along with oysters. Oysters were very good and fresh! - but that's about it for this place....

The Yakitori Skewers tasted poor for the price point. I could spend the same or cheaper at Tori-Q and get much tastier yakitoris. We ordered the Wings and it was extremely salty - i'm guessing it was because of MSG? We felt really dry and had headache after the dinner. The Calpis Soda that the staff made was also very bad...

Aside from comments on the food, there were alot of mini flies flying around our food and table as well....

Won't come back again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115768416430278537559/reviews
Sera // IG: diningwithsera,5,"Loved this retro-chic bar !! you can indulge in UNLIMITED fresh, plump oysters & a wide highball selection for just $48+ (Tues-Thurs) or $68+ (Fri-Sun), with no GST! Just order a minimum of 5 items to enjoy this buffet promo — their buffet promo is exclusive to the Changi outlet.

My top picks were: rice cake bacon, asparagus bacon and Japan A5 Wagyu ribeye beef skewer (30g), which was so richly seasoned, tender, & melt-in-your-mouth. Their grilled unagi, cold tofu century egg and fried mantous are also must tries!

As for their highballs, we tried almost all but we enjoyed these 2 the most: Calpis Highball 9 and their Gin & Tonic.
Their modest entrance may not catch your eye at first glance, but step inside, & you’re transported to a cosy space with impeccable vibes. Definitely worth a visit :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118301436723641326928/reviews
