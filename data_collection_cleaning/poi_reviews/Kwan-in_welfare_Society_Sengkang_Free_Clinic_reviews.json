Very disappointed with this move, this does comply to MOH regulation and this unnecessary incurred additional cost to those elderly whom require medical assistance. Management please review this point since you are all here to provide medical with minimum cost to the lower income group.",

I was group under Room 1 with one of the lady Dr.(1st time see this lady Dr).\n\nWas given acupuncture treatment by the Dr.\nAfter my treatment, suddenly I feel that there is a Qi flow inside my hand n the next moment, I was unable to move my fingers n immediately there is a big swollen lump on my hand.so,the Dr start to massage slowly for me n keep saying sorry to me n keep asking me whether I ever done acupuncture before or not.she request me to apply cold therapy once after I reach home.\n\nOn the next day, my hand was getting worst, it became more pain,more swollen. So,I went to Polyclinics n was referred to SKH A&E for further treatment.\n\nWith this incident,I tell myself to go for regular familiar Dr for my future visit n don't ever take the risk of allowing unfamiliar Dr for acupuncture treatment.",
