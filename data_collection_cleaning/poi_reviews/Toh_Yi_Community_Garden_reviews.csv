Flo Yeow,4,"Nice little garden hidden in the midst of Toh Yi Drive! It's open to general public, and it's located right by the multi storey carpark. Not sheltered, so take note especially if rain is an issue. There's nothing much beyond just an entire stretch of plants.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
