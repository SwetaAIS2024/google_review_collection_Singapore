      "text": "Noticed that this stall selling fishball noodle constantly having long queue while I was there.  The queue doesn't seems to finish. This stall sell fishball and fishball minced meat noodle and prices starts from SGD$3.50 onwards. There was at least 7 people infront of me when i joined the queue, thankfully it move pretty fast.\n\nOrdered their fishball minced meat noodle. it came with ingredients like fishcake, fishball, minced meat and pork slices as well as some braised mushroom. Noodle was nicely cooked, texture of noodle was springy. What really stand out was their chill sauce. The chili was savory and not too overly spicy. Apart from that, their ingredient tasted like those factory product.\n\nOverall, very decent bowl of noodle, wouldn't mind eating again!",

My only small problem is that the hawker centre that it is situated in is quite dirty and smells a bit. But this place definitely sells one of the best fishball noodles I would say! Definitely going back again and queueing again!",
