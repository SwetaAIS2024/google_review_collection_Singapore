nur faiza,2,"I had a very disappointing experience at Kenangan Coffee, Sunway Bigbox branch. We arrived at around 12.20 pm, planning to order at the counter since the app was down. Shockingly, a male staff member told us they only start taking orders at 12.40 pm ‚Äî even though the store‚Äôs operating hours clearly state they open at 10 am. His excuse? He arrived at 12.15 pm and said ‚Äúice pun tak ready lagi.‚Äù

This is completely unacceptable. The staff‚Äôs attitude was rude, and there was no apology for the late opening. The way he insisted on making us wait felt like he was blaming customers for his lateness. It‚Äôs not our problem if he just arrived late or if they weren‚Äôt prepared? Customers should never be made to feel like a nuisance.

Thankfully, when we returned at 12.35 pm, a lady staff member attended to us politely. But the earlier male staff member did nothing to rectify the situation or apologize for the poor service.

This kind of behavior reflects badly on your brand. Staff need to be trained not only in operational readiness, but also basic customer service, especially in how to communicate politely and professionally, even in difficult situations.

Really disappointed. Will not recommend this outlet.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100875746082207788471/reviews

reb beycca,1,"Good water.

But, open the shop on 22/4/25 late. The shop opens at 12 o'clock. Should be you know, issue a notice if the shop opens late due to an event or something else. We came to the store at LUNCH TIME, the staff just arrived, we want to order first Pon can't wait for 12.40. Frustrated Gile, because the staff at other branches are ok. But here, I'm sorry I don't have Pon, I can't order. Tell me to sit first Pon, don't you give me a reason Pon, don't you. Keep repeating the newly opened shop.

I don't understand why all the staff opened the shop late yesterday, but no notice.

Bad service. And should be no star.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104588924116283469851/reviews
