I enjoyed a lot and it was bit crowded once i go there because itâ€™s a weekend. You can watch the light show in several view points. Definitely this a nice attraction you need to visit once you come to Singapore. Hopefully love to visit this place agin in a day time to have a different experience. Cheers !!",

Great place to take pictures and enjoy the view! The walk itself is not long, but you'll be outside, so it's probably good otherwise would be risking a heat stroke! Highly recommended to visit especially as a tourist!",

We had a nice view of the Supertrees, with Marina Bay Sands framed in the background. The tree nearest us only lit up occasionally during the show, but we had a clear view of three main trees. Note: you'll be sitting on lumpy rocks, so you may want to plan ahead and bring something soft to put under your bum!",
