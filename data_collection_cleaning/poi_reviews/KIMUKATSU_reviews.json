Ordered 2 pax of the original tonkatsu (there‚Äôs a discount on this meal now costing $14.90 each).\n\nThe rice came in a big Japanese rice container for us. Scoop the rice into the bowl provided. The rice portion was filling for us.\n\nThe tonkatsu was tasty. There‚Äôs also 1 sweet and 1 salty sauce provided to dip the meat into.\n\nMiso soup was also nice, I finished the whole bowl of it üòÇ\n\nEnjoyed the meal with good company overall.",

      "text": "Had a great dinner after shopping. We tried pork katsu set, both original and black pepper. I personally like the original, the black pepper is very suitable for pepper lovers.\n\nMeat is tender and portion is just nice (not too much). Sauce also good, but i feel like better giving a salt for dipping is better than soy sauce.\nFree flow cabbage. I could easily eat at least 2 servings of cabbage at one go.",

      "text": "Garlic flavored pork katsu tastes good but somehow, the layered pork meat texture is too dry and tough. Kinda difficult to chew.\n\nThey served each portion with miso soup, side dishes, and a decent amount of dips. I personally feel the rice was a bit of a waste as they served too much of it in the bucket.\n\nIt was very crowded during the weekend's lunchtime, so it‚Äôs better to visit a bit early.",
