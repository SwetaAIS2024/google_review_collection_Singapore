Marcus Nah,3,"Average western food, had the half spring chicken with cream spaghetti.

Cream Spaghetti taste ok, portion quite acceptable good.

Fried spring chicken too small and dried until the little drumstick and wing also meatless. Maybe will try out others dishes next time.

Over heard my next table also complaining on their fish and chips.. flour too thick.. No comment on this..

Service still pretty good for the staff at the moment.. But food need to keep it up.. as their price also not cheap.. for $8.90 per set.. additional $3 for small bowl of salad, fries, and soup.

Sitting spacing as usual tight spacing, especially diners trying to squeeze their way through in-between the chairs and tables..

After the management does their arrangements replacing the table stand.. it's become very messy to dine in.. with the untidy arrangements of table and chairs around..",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108851483842225070997/reviews

Giang Nguyen,3,"The reason I rate 2 stars is not because of the food quality (food court standard), but because there was a tiny bit of bone in my beef steak, and it caused a big chip in my front teeth. It was an unfortunate event, but no diner would want to lose a bit of their teeth.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112582745497518598922/reviews
