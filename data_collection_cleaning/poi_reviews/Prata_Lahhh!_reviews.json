Enjoyed the Bull's Eye Prata and Plain Prata, both fresh and fluffy, and the milk tea was great too.\nOne suggestion: dry plates before serving would enhance the experience.",

Only suggest is for the Nasi Goreng with Chicken Tikka best is separate instead of mixed in together. But overall food experience is really good.",

The mutton briyani was excellent, fragrant, flavorful, and the rice had a great texture, not too wet or dry. The mutton was tender and not gamy at all. What stood out was the service. The staff noticed we were sharing and thoughtfully brought over a few extra pieces of mutton for us. Very attentive and generous. Will definitely be back.",
