Auror Yin,5,"My daughter attended playgroup and N1 here, only changing schools cause we have shifted. We are very happy with how she turned out - could see that she enjoyed school and her teachers (special shout out to Sing Mei Lao Shi and Teacher Sam) also provided a warm and loving environment which allowed her to thrive. We could feel the love for my girl and she keeps talking about them at home! Ms Angi is also a great administrative staff who helps us with the paperwork - she is very detailed and love her post its and little reminders. Thank you Twinklekidz @ Bendemeer for this great start to her schooling life!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109563154620994446695/reviews
Alex Chen,5,"Thank you Teachers and staffs of TWD @ Bendemeer. They lived up to their vision and mission by providing constructive feedback, safe and genuine love to the children. I was fortunate to have both my children schooled in an environment where there is strengthened positive learning, putting in effort to ensure young children is always engaged with outdoor activities, library trips, and even overnight camp. Being art based school, I have seen my children blossomed and developed art interest in various genres. Truly a holistic experience.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112556717356673720004/reviews
Noor Jahan Nas-Kunkel,5,My son has benefitted significantly from TwinkleKidz for his EIPIC. He has shown significant improvements which his Kindergarten teachers have raved about. A BIG thank you to the principal and teachers for making this happen. You go all the way out to help our children by being patient and gentle with them. Every child is different and it's not an easy job handling them. Kudos to you for the great job you are doing.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111675843486563201032/reviews
Shermeen Cheang,5,"My child has been with Twinklekidz for 5 months and the teachers in infant care has been nothing but wonderful.
They provide updates all the time (when he sleeps, how long he sleeps, when he eats, diaper changes, poop color etc) and are always so cheerful during morning drop off & evening pick up.
My child is always happy to go to school and never once cried or reject any teacher. I think the kids are the best spokesperson for the teachers. The best thing about the place is that there is a see-through glass so you can see your baby interact with teachers and other babies before picking up. Full transparency.
They provide weekly photos of the babies doing different activities too! Thank you teachers for loving the babies!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104362216045807669304/reviews
