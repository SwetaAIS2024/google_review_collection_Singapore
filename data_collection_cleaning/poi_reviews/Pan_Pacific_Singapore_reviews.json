The staff are attentive, friendly and extremely helpful in looking after all of your needs, especially when attending the vast and delicious  breakfast buffet which accommodates all eating idiosyncrasies. The rooms are extremely modern and spacious with fabulous views.\nHighly recommended!",

Every night at 6 you would go to the top of the building to the restraint only for the most expensive rooms and it would be cocktail time . You can have as many cocktails as you wanted in the evening . Sohan and I were tipsy every night . It was great . We really had a great time. The service was outstanding . All the staff   were lovely and made friends with us and would get us anything we wanted . They all treated us like we were royalty. We felt very at home their .. We stayed in the studio room level 34 . The food was great .  Their is enough entertainment  in the Hotel . It's a 5 STAR . I do recommend  going their.",
