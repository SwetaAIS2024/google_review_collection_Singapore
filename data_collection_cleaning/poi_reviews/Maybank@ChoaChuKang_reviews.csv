Tan Kim Huat Adam,5,"On 28/09/24 about 1.30pm, we went to MAYBANK Choa Chu Kang branch to do some banking transaction. When we reached there, we're surprised to find out that the banking hall is at second floor.  To make the matter worse, there isn't any lift for the convenient for the elderly.
As my wife has walking problem, we'll scratching our head what to do next. Luckily, a female banking staff approach us and after find out our problem. She immediately told us to wait for counter 7/8 staff to serve us without the need to go upstairs banking hall. We're very impressed and appreciate of her kind gesture. Her willingness to go to extra mile for the customers and her caring attitude towards the elderly is highly praised.
The same goes to the counter 7/8 staff that serves us. He has shown patience, caring and attentive towards the elderly.
The whole banking experience is smooth, pleasant and pleasing. Thumbs up for the MAYBANK staffs at Choa Chu Kang branch.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107645052337768753490/reviews
Raihan Rostam,1,"Now it's located near OCBC and DBS. The road where buses go through before going in to the interchange. Best part is, there's only 1 ATM for deposit and another for withdrawal. The deposit machine is not working currently. Great!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102641552175584375506/reviews
