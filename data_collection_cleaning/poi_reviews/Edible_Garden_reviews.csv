Gayan Chathuranga,3,"Edible Garden City is a fantastic initiative that combines sustainability, education, and community building. Visiting their urban farm was an eye-opening experience, as it showcased how we can grow fresh produce even in a city as dense as Singapore.

The guided tour was informative and engaging, highlighting innovative farming techniques like hydroponics and permaculture. I also appreciated learning about their efforts to promote food security and sustainable living.

The farm itself is beautifully maintained, with a wide variety of herbs, vegetables, and edible flowers. It’s a wonderful place to explore if you’re interested in urban gardening or sustainable practices.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115580882753025627106/reviews
