      "text": "Traditional Tutu Kueh made to perfection. A dying art helmed by Kerwin, the friendly 3rd generation boss. Used to have a branch in Ion Orchard as well but unfortunately that closed during Covid. Many born in the 80s/90s would have grown up eating this yummy snack. With rising costs and rental, and the younger generation always wanting to try the next fad in food, this is a snack that could potentially disappear when the current generation of hawkers retire. So come on down to try it if you miss it for old times sakes. Besides Tutu Kueh, the stall sells other stuff such a Muah Chee, Tea Eggs and Waffles as well. It‚Äôs solely for takeaway so don‚Äôt expect a nice comfy sit down area like a cafe. :)",

      "text": "They‚Äôre more famous for their atrocious service.\n\nAuntie ignored me despite seeing me for a whole minute never mind. Accidentally said Ëå∂È∏°Ëõã (tea egg) instead of Ëå∂Âè∂Ëõã (tea leaf egg) since the spelling on their menu is different and the cashier auntie went on a scolding spree, scolding me thrice in 10 seconds that I confused her and she doesn‚Äôt understand what I want. Is it that tough to understand when you‚Äôre only selling one kind of egg.. üòî\n\nTaste not bad. No egg skin on the outside so don‚Äôt need to peel. Quite fuss-free to eat. But that experience left a sour taste in my mouth. Despite the bad reviews, wanted to visit to visit since I grew up eating their tutu kueh and cup corn before they rebranded and became so commercialised with the merchandise.\n\nWill not come back again :/",

      "text": "Ordered a piece of peanut waffles, I was sceptical when the auntie took a piece that's sitting on the side and reheated it. So using this cooking method of double cooking the waffles, it creates a crunchy texture instead of the normal soft and fluffy. The peanut is spread thinly to avoid any wastage from leaking out, this also avoids ur teeth having sticky mess afterwards.",
