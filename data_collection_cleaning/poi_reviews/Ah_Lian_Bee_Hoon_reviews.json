Noodles were great, but the beehoon was soaked in the curry gravy so I regret choosing the curry, though the curry vege itself was delicious. Sausage and chicken wing was normal. Quite overpriced I would say, and nothing outstanding.",

Different prices, sometimes chicken wing $1.50, then  $1.60, even $1.80. 2025 prices, within days of each other.\n\nAbsurd.\n\nRude service from all of them, even reminding them that food is dapao not plate, get scolded. Money thrown at you.\n\nEven get scolding for their mistake. Tell them want chilli, they serve without. So asked for chilli, uncle angry. Auntie also. Same type.\n\nThe bullying 'service' turns your stomach.\n\nFood not fresh. Beehoon and noodles sour.",

Yellow noodles were normal, bee hoon had its standard with bites of bean sprout but I find it lacks fragrance, as for kway teow, definitely the winner here among the three noodles, that slippery silky texture sinfully cover your mouth with oiliness is one not to be mess around, leaving a savoury note after each bite.üòã\nLove Lian's sambal as their is spicier and wetter with bites of caramelized onion in it. Shiok.üòç\nJust get kway teow and bee hoon can already.‚úåÔ∏è\n\n2nd visit:\n- Chicken Wing standard marination taste ok\n- Cabbage with Dried shrimp and garlic\nStill gonna conclude their stuff are oily but tasty.",
