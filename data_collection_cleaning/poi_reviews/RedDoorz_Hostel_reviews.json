      "text": "The place is good for people who are looking for a place to stay the night and shower, which is ideal to me. The location isn't too far off, and the price I paid wasn't too expensive. It was clean enough and the lady at the front desk was really helpful and friendly. The only downside that I can think of is the shower stall was a bit stinky? It wasn't dirty or anything but there was definitely this weird smell to it. Other than that, the hairdryer doesn't work after certain hours, to not disturb the other customers I assume so better take note of that. Overall it's a great place to stay at.",

The location was close enough to some interesting shopping areas. I think the best part of this hostel is that the public lounge area is pretty comfy and clean.",

      "text": "You have to take stairs to the elevator which is kind of counterintuitive. Service is pretty good, usually run by teens so sometimes a bit misinformed but they try to be friendly. The dorm rooms were cramped and the top bed frame was loose so getting up was a bit of a hassle. The bathrooms were significantly more cramped. With all the cramped atmosphere sometimes it'd smell funky around but overall cleanliness was good. Breakfast is very simple bread or cereal basically. Location was great as you can walk around a lot of places.",
