Sarah Chan,1,"Most unhelpful staff .. Came all the way to the branch to get help with a query that I couldn’t resolve on the app, the counter staff (with much irritation) insisted I go through the app to submit my request, fine. It’s been more than 1 week and no reply from the bank. Tried to call the hotline, even worse, useless and makes it so hard to reach an actual service staff. Worst bank, probably will cancel my card zzzzz",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107956050453874455663/reviews
Jessie Mok,5,"**⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Exceptional Service and Attention to Detail**

I had the pleasure of working with Melina Wong at Standard Chartered at Vivocity, and I can confidently say that her service exceeded all expectations. From the very beginning, she demonstrated professionalism, deep expertise, and a genuine commitment to ensuring my banking needs were met with precision and quickly.

Her attention to detail is truly remarkable—no question went unanswered, and every transaction was handled seamlessly.
I highly recommend Melina Wong to anyone looking for top-tier banking services. Her dedication and expertise set them apart, and I am grateful for their exceptional support. Thank you for making banking such a pleasant experience!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113773530672911670644/reviews
Ching ning xin,1,"I am extremely upset about my experience with your bank. After receiving a letter regarding the outstanding mortgage on my housing loan, I attempted to call today more than five times to seek clarification. Each time, I was kept on hold by the AI system for over 10 minutes, and I was unable to speak to a customer service officer.

It is highly frustrating to receive a letter urging action but have no accessible way to resolve the matter promptly. I expect your team to address this issue immediately and provide a direct way for me to communicate with a representative.

I trust this matter will be prioritized and resolved without further delay.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115069610028549913644/reviews
J Ng,5,"I wish to compliment Chen Xinyu on her service. She was very patient and showed empathy in understanding the situation (way better and more professional than the call centre!). She has kept her word and assist to follow up on the issue, which was resolved eventually.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108029626375297623946/reviews
WAN WAN,1,The worst experience about a bank. Very regret to choose this bank. The hotline is always busy. The app is useless. I cancelled my credit card but I cannot get the balance and the annual fee back. I want to give a zero star.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107651061170648232786/reviews
