I try calling Goh Sin Huat on Friday and never expect their response was so fast immediately they send a technician down and Monday the installation was completed. The technicians were experienced and the aircon installation work and cleaning was very well done.  The price was very reasonable compared to other companies no hidden costs. I strongly recommend the company.",

      "text": "By far this is actually the worst company to buy your water from. Supported them for years, money was in the toilet and was flushed. Mineral water had a nasty metallic taste if you didn’t drink for quite awhile. They claimed that water was clean from a natural source but that was a lie. The mineral water is actually from an unknown source as the metallic taste is an obvious proof. Never clearly stated the policy to customer before first order, they forced me to pay more for the “deposits” for the bottle which is $25 per bottles which was ridiculous. I decided to pull the plug and find other supplier. Customer service officer who attended to me was extremely rude. I wanted my money for the deposit back and had to wait till about end of April 2023 with a lot of excuses. Same thing as another customer had experience, need to return all to process the deposit. If not, we can kiss our deposit goodbye. Being so rude, customer service had suggested me to put at the door. If Bangladeshi janitor saw, he would think they were unwanted bottles and would throw them away. Not his money so easy for him to say. He lied to me many times that he didn’t suggest to leave them at the door which is false. I hate them a lot. Waste my time and money. Don’t patronise them if possible.",

Price was very competitive including installation and removal of old system with ceiling board cutting out and patching back.The two Chinese technicians were very careful, detailed and tidy clean. Will deal with the company for other appliances in the future. Very satisfied with the purchase. Thumb up for the two workers as well.",
