Dawn T,5,"A little stall next to the Ann Chin Popiah stall-- easy to miss except for an A4-sized sign and the sight of Mr Ho himself! But please don't skip this, it is really the best I've had.

Freshly made on the spot, with the perfect balance of sweetness and fragrance, and somehow the texture of the outer layer really hits the spot. I liked the coconut even more than the peanut.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117687371745634241647/reviews
juzcrap,4,"unless you see the uncle working on his kuehs, you would not know or guess that the store is even in operation. although we were at the store at about 12.30pm, uncle was just starting out and told us that we had to wait at least an hour for him to prepare his ingredients.
an hour was sufficient for us to have our very relaxing lunch while waiting. we left our order of 5x coconut, 5x peanut with uncle and he readily told us, we only need to pay him when we collect the kuehs.
for those in a rush, you will need to time your visit wisely. we returned an hour later and our order was still be prepared.
uncle told us that he usually starts selling from 2pm.
we had to take our kueh tutus and eat on the go, rushing back to the office.
our verdict of the kueh tutu? they were worth the wait and price. the skin was not too thick nor too dry. the coconut was slightly wet and sweet while the peanut had a slight saltiness to it.
i have to admit that eating too many coconut version consecutively got too much for me given its sweetness.
minimum order of 5pcs at $0.70 each. order qty increases in batches of 5.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101307563513792648804/reviews
