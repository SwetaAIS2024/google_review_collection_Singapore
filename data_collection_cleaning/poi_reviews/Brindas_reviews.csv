Ashvin Venugopal,5,"When i think about a place where you can have some privacy to have meals, i think of this place. The place wasn't packed, ( for some reasons) which gave me more time to order the meal of my choice.  Food maybe a bit pricy but worth every bite and i was stuffed. The staffs there are very approachable and i don't have any bad feedback i can give about them. A compliment i can give is that they were very polite to disable residents. They spoke in a very friendly tone, alerted him when they serve the food for him even though its self service and placed his food in the tray return once he's finished with his meal. There's a self service station, clean restrooms and tray return station nearby. There wasn't any negative vibes from this place at all. I just really wish more people will dine in here in the future.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100470550328896988703/reviews

syawal razak,1,"Bought 2 pcs of samosa take away and its still raw, never mind their high prices but getting this kind of quality is just disappointing",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117606636358312681128/reviews
hsimg7,5,Ordered for 7.15am on a Sunday morning and it was delivered promptly and on time. I had several calls before the delivery to confirm it was for 7.15am not a PM delivery.  Really appreciate this attention and service from Brindas. Ordered vegetarian meal and it was good and tasty with good portions. Well labeled food packets to easily identify the content instead of opening it and checking what it contains. Thank you Brindas! ðŸ™‚,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105879704948649565856/reviews
R L,5,"Don't know why this place has low reviews. Had the cheese rava masala thosai and I thought it was awesome. Rava thosai was crispy and the cheese was generous. Chutney was tasty too. Quantity was good too.

Service is fast and polite.

One minus however is that the toilet was a little disgusting as it was wet and there were a lot of wet tissues on the floor.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114551521595925199520/reviews
