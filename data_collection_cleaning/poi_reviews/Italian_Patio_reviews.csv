Mark Phooi,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Italian Patio, and I can honestly say it was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had! From the moment I walked in, I was enveloped by a warm and cozy ambiance that made me feel right at home. The setting beside the poolside, with the golf range in the background, created a serene atmosphere that was perfect for a relaxing evening.

The menu is a true delight, featuring a range of sumptuous Western cuisine that left me spoilt for choice.

What truly stood out was the impeccable service. The staff was not only attentive but genuinely friendly, making sure I had everything I needed throughout my meal. Their recommendations were spot-on, enhancing my dining experience even further.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104374795524668089692/reviews

A good spread on the menu. Must try the gelato ( ice cream ) after the mea.

Gwen O,2,"Venue was decorated pleasantly and atmosphere was lively and perfect for families. Biggest turn off however was definitely the waiting time. While informed that there would be a 30minute waiting time, it took 45 minutes for two pizzas to arrive, and a total of 50 minutes for two slices of bruschetta to be served. Food was decent, nothing to rave about; to describe it simply, lasagna was slightly better than the frozen ones from NTUC, pasta dishes were perfect for those craving an after-meal coating of oil in the mouth. Would definitely recommend coming only during non-peak hours if you'd like to give this place a try. In somewhat fairness, the waitress did apologise for the one hour waiting time when handing us the bill. Nonetheless, wouldn't be recommending this place for a good while to others.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101299725760256521929/reviews
