Avy Goh,5,"Tried once a very long time ago, think should give a second chance as is different cook and already worked for long time.
Now the chicken is fresh, with no frozen taste, the soup is fragrance and not over spicy.
See the satisfaction look from my hubby. He's very picky on curry noodles.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112226331862324103616/reviews
CCS,1,"Trued once when they first opened a year or so ago. Today, I gave them another try. Though there were some visible changes, the test of curry mee is still in the eating.

And it was worse this time. The masala curry was neither Hainanese nor hokkien taste. The chicken was bland and tough. It was obvious they put on some efforts, but perhaps they just need to do a serious reevaluation of their recipe.

Ya. This is just my opinion. They do seem to have some customers during lunch hpurs",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
Pheng Hong Tan,5,"Read the few Google review before this and almost resistant to try it..But anyway bought a bowl to try as craving for curry. Surprisingly I think it is not bad..Not sure about the masala part, but as a curry noodle is definitely worth eating...Nice curry that's not too oily and generous ingredients as shown.. for $4.50.

I would say it's a big bowl. I won't specially travel here to eat but if around this hawker centre and wants curry, I will still buy it again!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115016030043268007982/reviews
Peifa Zhou,3,"A normal curry noodle. Potato not fully cooked and doesn't cook together with curry therefore there is no taste at all. Same goes to the tau pok. Curry soup is average, not too dead salty and slightly flavourful. But for picky tastebuds, this bowl confirm cannot pass.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108839949234864089751/reviews
