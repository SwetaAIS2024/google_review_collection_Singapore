Rachel Chua,5,"Highly highly recommend! My husband and I completed our open water course with Marlin Divers. They went out of the way to fit our scheduling requirements which we really appreciated as we were only in Singapore for 2 weeks. The course was professionally done and we felt safe and confident with our instructor (also had lots of fun!). She patiently answered all our questions and made sure we were practising good habits from the beginning. Marlin Divers also has high quality and well maintained equipment, and we got great advice on which equipment best fits us and how to use and take care of them. We are so impressed with the training we got and we would definitely dive with Marlin Divers again!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102836796935970485216/reviews
Kah Yun Lee,5,"I had a great experience going through the open water course at Marlin Divers. It was my first time diving. The online self study was convenient. I was able to learn at my own pace and now having the knowledge helped put me at ease for the pool and ocean dives. The instructors were very friendly and approachable. I was able to pick up and perform the required skills quickly and easily. The dives and equipment were managed well. My dive buddy and I were able to complete the course without a problem. Thanks again, wonderful instructors!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102898823089402848211/reviews
M3NACE,5,Able to accommodate a very last minute booking. Very patient for new divers (got certified weeks before traveling to Singapore). Our guide insured our safety under low visibility and was still able to point out local wild life. They also took us for a quick sight seeing tour of some local beaches for us to visit afterwards. Highly recommend!!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105195738293383567488/reviews
Austin Won,5,"I am immensely grateful to E Lin Pow for teaching me open water diving. As a professional female diving instructor, she has witnessed my journey from a physiological fear of breathing underwater to confidently removing my mask and breathing at the ocean’s floor. Moreover, it’s worth noting that E Lin Pow is a PADI Course Director, the highest level in the PADI professional spectrum, which speaks volumes about her expertise and reliability in the field of diving instruction. I highly recommend this dive center to anyone looking to learn diving. Whether you’re a beginner or looking to advance your skills, this is the place to be.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106957268138111725500/reviews
Stuart Lee,5,"Fantastic experience with Marlin Divers! I chose to do my OWD with them as they were the only ones who could accommodate my very challenging timeline and needs at short notice. However, I soon realised that I couldn't have picked a better team to learn from - they had a strong emphasis on safety, focus on foundation competencies, and really helped me feel comfortable in the water. Really was the best introduction to the diving family!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103453694440249884715/reviews
