      "text": "As a frequent traveler and local guide, I was excited to dine at Arbora in Singapore, known for its stunning views and unique ambiance. Unfortunately, my experience was anything but welcoming.\n\nI was the only Black patron in the restaurant, and despite arriving well before some other guests, I was completely ignored for over 30 minutes. A table seated to my right after I arrived not only had their order taken promptly but even finished their meals before I decided to leave without receiving any service.\n\nThis disparity in treatment was glaring and deeply disappointing. Dining establishments should provide consistent and fair service to all patrons, regardless of their background. The scenic setting of Arbora cannot make up for the lack of inclusivity and respect I experienced during my visit.\n\nI hope the management takes this feedback seriously and implements better training for their staff to ensure that every guest is treated with equal care and attention.",
