Geoffrey,5,"The Meadow at Gardens by the Bay is a great spot for a day out. The views of the surrounding gardens are beautiful, especially when everything lights up in the evening. It‚Äôs an open, spacious area, but since it‚Äôs fully outdoors, you‚Äôll want to be ready for the heat or rain. On a nice day, it‚Äôs an awesome place to relax and take in the scenery!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118410996700151686433/reviews

Vincent Lee,5,"Don't give this less ""grandiose"" part of the Gardens by the Bay a miss just because it lacks the Supertree, Skyway, and eateries. The Meadow (and the Serene Garden) is worth a visit for its equally well-paved paths plus the benefit of lesser crowd. A great way to enjoy nature and art; a therapeutic escape for busy city life.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111417065994620089449/reviews
