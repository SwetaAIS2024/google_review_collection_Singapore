Thank you for creating a safe and joyful space for them to learn and play. We will always cherish the memories and experiences they have had at LGH.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117365315956535520573/reviews
Joelle Cai,5,Both of my girls have been attending LGH Tampines since they were 18 mths old. The teachers were attentive and not only does the school emphasize on the academic aspect but they also focus on the studentsâ€™ physical well being. There were lots of outdoor activity and excursions were being organized which really help to develop the kids gross motor skills.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108344683178095248942/reviews
Odilia Lazaroo,5,"I wholeheartedly recommend this preschool to any parent looking for a nurturing, educational, and joyful environment for their children. We have sent all three of our kids to LGH@ Tampines!

The teachers at this school are exceptional. Not only are they highly skilled educators, but they also genuinely care for each and every student. It's heartwarming to see the level of attention, care, and concern they provide to the children. They create a nurturing and stimulating environment that makes learning enjoyable.

One of the best indicators for us is how excited and happy our kids are to go there every day. Their enthusiasm speaks volumes about the engaging and enriching experiences they're having. It is very reassuring as a parent to know that our kids are in good hands!

Thank you LGH@ Tampines :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110158982810585559259/reviews
Yunurhaiza Yahya,5,"I had a super hard time finding schools for my youngest around Tampines since she was a newborn. Tried my luck applying at LGH Tampines when she was around 13 months (although the school accepts 18mths for Pre-N), and was delighted to hear from them within few weeks! The Principal was very willing to answer my queries and was responsive as well. When my daughter started her Pre-N journey in May this year, she had a hard time adjusting to the environment, but her teachers were very patient during her transition period. She has finally adjusted and is enjoying her time in school!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109376037997106744564/reviews
Felly Sam,5,"My son started N1 in this school in Feb this year. I feel at ease that he is in this school.

It's a lovely place!

Teachers are nice and communicates well with parents. Staffs are friendly too.

I also noticed that my son falls sick less often in this school.

If you are looking for a place for your child in this area, I highly recommend you stop in for a tour.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110421138577550559180/reviews
