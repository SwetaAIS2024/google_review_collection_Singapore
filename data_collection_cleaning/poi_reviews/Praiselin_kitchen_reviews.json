      "text": "Delicious, just like Home!!!\n\nI had an unforgettable dining experience at Praiselin Kitchen! The food here truly capture of homemade  cooking.\n\nThe cumin dosa was crispy and flavorful, perfectly complemented by the soft, fluffy idlis paired with delicious chutney. The puri and bhaji reminded me off a classic breakfast, light yet satisfying.\n\nIn lunch  i use to prefer  chapati and vegetable fry.\nThe chicken biryani was rich in aroma and taste, cooked to perfection with tender chicken and fragrant spices. The vegetable fry was fresh and well-seasoned, and the mutton was incredibly tender and flavorful, just like a home-cooked meal made with love.\n\nThe attention to detail, fresh ingredients, and homely flavors made the experience truly special. The staff was warm and welcoming, adding to the overall charm of the place. If you're looking for authentic, homemade-style food, Praiselin Kitchen is the perfect spot. I am visiting daily!\n\n... Authentic Homemade Flavors-A Must-Try!!",
