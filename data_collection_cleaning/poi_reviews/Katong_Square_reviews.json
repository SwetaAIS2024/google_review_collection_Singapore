The pedestrian walk is also wide enough so it is safe to walk especially in the evening because there are enough lightning and in the afternoon is not so hot because there are lots of trees. There are also some small shopping malls around the area.",

Honestly with the plot size, the design, and the integration with the 2 hotel chains here (Indigo and Holiday Inn), it's just very messy. Not much foot fall traffic, and weird synergy of retailers here. Honestly would rather shop around i12 Katong, or not at all, if given the option.",

I asked if she could identify a bottle I had that was similar to the ones inside.\n\nShe repeatedly scolded me even after I said \"okay\" and thanked her for her time, telling me the same thing over and over again about checking the date on the bottle or googling it. I tried to end the conversation, only to be met with - \"I keep telling you, but you DON'T SEEM TO...\" and her repeating the same information.\n\nI get that she's not an expert. I didn't expect that sort of information from her and thanked her for her time when she couldn't provide it. What was completely uneccessary was the way she berated and humiliated me for asking.\n\nPlease be wary of this shopowner.",
