Jason Soh,4,"I happened to be in the vicinity looking for rosti but after seeing a long queue for the prawn noodle decided to try it for myself. The prawn noodle did not disappoint, the soup is not the over rich type but tastes homely and soothing. The price of $9 for a big bowl also comes with 8 decent sized prawns, full prawns that have been de-shelled, not those cut into halves with the shells intact type. Very nice and very good value for the cost!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113133934501923551074/reviews

Jocey,5,"The best prawn noodles in Singapore! Truly deserve 3/4 Michelin stars!

The owners were also incredibly humble and very generous is topping up soup for us.

Try the dry Hokkien noodles! I highly recommend it, noodles were very flavourful, and the pork ribs were extremely tender!!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109815282357089927639/reviews
