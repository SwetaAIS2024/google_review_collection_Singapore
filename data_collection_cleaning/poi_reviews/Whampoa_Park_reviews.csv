Joune Seng Cheah,5,"A fun place for the family as an outdoor activity area. A variety of playgrounds to cater for different age groups as well as an exercise area for adults too.

The highlight would be the ninja warrior like obstacle course which was the first we encountered in SG.

Connected via park connectors to the canal, it’s a great stop over for a long cycling trip as well.

Situated nearby is the popular Whampoa food centre which has quite a lot of stuff to cater to the dinner crowd.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108546382381102221027/reviews

Jason Feuerstein,5,"Amazingly huge park with plenty of different areas catering to both young and older children. Has a large exercise area and all the equipment looks brand new. Perfect for a family morning out.
Added benefit compared to many other HDB parks is that there is a toilet nearby at the bus stop.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102782536632226571174/reviews
Henry Wong,5,"Great place for a family day out.

The playgrounds are interesting outdoor training equipment suitable for children adults and the elderly too.

There are some shelters if needed to take a break from the hot sun.

That's also a coffee shop near the bus interchange for a quick bite if needed...b",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112721378459649099680/reviews
Christopher Sim,5,"It's great to have 2 forest theme playground separately for children from 2 to 5 and 5 and above within such a small space. Kudos to the planner. There's also small rain gardens where you can explain to your kid how natural filtration works.

There's a dog run park which is a good addition.

Good choice of equipment for adults and senior citizens to work out too. Will be back again",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117314526216799237630/reviews
