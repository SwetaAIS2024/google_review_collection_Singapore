We ordered a Sapporo beer tower and some spam fries, but unfortunately, the beer tasted sour. When we asked for a replacement or at least for the staff to taste it, they refused, which was disappointing.",

Dinning in the open, its nice and windy. Perhaps the only distraction was the neon light at our table which make the area a little too dark. Haha.",

Food menu was limited as not everything was available and the Thai food stall was closed. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the Cajun Fried Chicken Wings, which were perfectly fried and juicy. Ordering was easy using the QR code. Service was OK.",
