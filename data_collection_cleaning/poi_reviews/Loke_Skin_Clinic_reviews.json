My daughter emphasise tt she is going bk to Japan and the receptionist (young lady) took down her email add and said they will email her the result. One month over my daughter still did not receive the result. I called and the receptionist (old lady) said there is no indication tt they shld email the result. I said then why they took her email add? Then she still wants to give excuse saying doctor on leave. I said it has been one month aldy, they shld follow up even doctor is on leave. The she admits tt they overlooked. I think this is not professional.",

Dr Goh of Loke Skin clinic is able to detect the root causes of her issue on 1st visit, and prescribed her to treat it. Everything was done professionally and effectively.
