Josephine Xie,5,"Very friendly over the counter staff though there was a long queue during lunch peak. Offers a great variety of cakes, muffins, non food items as well. Service was fast despite the lunch peak. Hard to get a seat though.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102692272705971311848/reviews
Joey Tang,1,"This morning I went and requested for a tall macchiato. While the menu said caramel macchiato, I specifically told the barista that I wanted it without caramel as I didn’t like it sweeten. When I took the coffee, it felt so heavy and opened up and it’s full to the brim! Went and asked the barista is this macchiato and he with a straight face said “yes, it is like that”. I may not be a coffee connoisseur but this is so wrong. It shows that the barista doesn’t even have basic knowledge, “great training” Starbucks! Wasted $7!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112287555229535080918/reviews

Yusuf Bhiwandiwala,1,The worst cappuccino i’ve ever had. Starbucks is generally pretty bad at making coffee. I am not sure why people go there. I thought of trying this place as i moved to this area. Should have expected the worst coffee here too. Never again.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107457213620963140998/reviews
Sashika Peiris,5,Love the energy boosting vanilla latte. Fairy spacious and super convenient Starbucks located in the Mapletree Business City. Ideal place for a relaxing chitchat if you skip the peak hours.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110313046626856799895/reviews
