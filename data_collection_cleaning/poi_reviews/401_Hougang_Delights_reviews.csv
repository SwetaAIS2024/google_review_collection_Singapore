LP Pua,4,"This Mee Siam stall has been around for many years. Today, I happened to pass by and couldn't resist ordering a plate to satisfy my craving. One thing I appreciate about this Mee Siam is that the owner squeezes the lime into it for you, instead of the usual practice where they give you a lime to squeeze yourself. The Mee Siam is of the Nonya type, and it was as tasty as Nonya Mee Siam can get. One complaint was the small portion for the $4 plate.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews

Nelson Lim,5,"Ordered the fish porridge and fish soup with milk and rice.

One of the best soup base I have tasted in a long time. They are using Spanish mackerel for their fish and the meat is fresh to boot!

Worth the 15-20min wait especially during the meal times.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117926345924996702573/reviews
