Have to add plentiful chilli flakes and pickles to work. Egg was too cooked and so were the rice mushy and clumpy.\nYakiniku XL is much better very generous beef. However the egg was again over cooked the egg yolk was solid and rice was overcooked as well. See last photo. Very good value always but it's a shame as we have had better at other outlets. Not sure if it's because we were the first customers of the day?",
