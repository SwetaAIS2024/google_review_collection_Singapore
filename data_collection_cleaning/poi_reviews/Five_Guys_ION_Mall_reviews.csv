Takahiro Koyama,4,"FIVE GUYS started in Arlington, Virginia back in 1986, and now has over 1,500 locations worldwide. In Singapore, you can find them at ION Mall and Plaza Singapura.

The menu’s the same wherever you go—customizable burgers, hand-cut fries, all-beef hot dogs, sandwiches, and rich milkshakes.

What makes FIVE GUYS stand out is their focus on freshness. No freezers, no microwaves—everything’s cooked to order.

I got the Cheeseburger, and it was seriously satisfying. Two thick, juicy beef patties, melted cheddar, fresh tomato and lettuce, grilled onions and mushrooms, thick-cut pickles, plus the classic combo of mayo, ketchup, and mustard—all packed into a soft, slightly sweet bun made fresh by a local bakery. It’s big, bold, and full of flavor.

M *,4,"had tried the cheese burger bacon before, and it tasted good. The cheese added some flavor to the burger.

This time, ordered the bacon burger. It was a bit dry, and the sauce chisen wasn’t enough on the burger. Although the concept of choosing toppings is great, we probably need to add more sauce or toppings to make it better.

Overall, the burger was still nicely cooked and looked good. However, it could be improved. The fries this time were from the Netherlands and weren’t too salty. The presentation wasn’t the best either, as the burger and fries were all in a bag. Messy.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103330821176864508073/reviews
Ribeye,4,"Five Guys at ION Orchard delivers on its reputation for indulgent, made-to-order burgers. The Bacon Cheeseburger, while pricey at $22.50, is undoubtedly the highlight. You can customize it with a range of free toppings, and the result is a moist, juicy, and flavorful burger that’s messy in the best way possible. The crispy bacon, melted cheese, and fresh ingredients add layers of texture and taste that elevate the experience.

The fries, served in generous portions, have a rustic, skin-on quality and came lightly salted. Drinks come with free refills, which adds some value to the meal. For two people, a full meal including burgers, fries, and drinks cost around $55, making it more of an occasional treat than an everyday indulgence.

The open kitchen setup lets you see the team in action, crafting your meal fresh, and the vibe is casual yet bustling. If you're dining during peak hours, be prepared for a short wait, as orders are cooked to order.

Overall, while not wallet-friendly, the Five Guys experience is worth it if you’re craving a high-quality burger and don’t mind the splurge. For a satisfying cheat day meal or a quick, premium fast-food fix, this is a solid choice in the heart of Orchard Road.
Sadly they don't do the iconic free peanuts in Singapore.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108129213100021627372/reviews
Irene Lim,1,"A very expensive fast food joint.
A set of little hamburger, little fries and a milkshake cost over S$36.
The patty is kinda dry. I did not enjoy this meal. Fries was ok, not so little.
The music is so loud that I had difficulty hearing the cashier staff.
Service was ok at the cashier staff but the lady who was helping at the collection counter was friendly and helpful",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105804445185126817371/reviews
Mishael George,2,"Rather disappointed. Had a fabulous experience at five guys in Dubai mall so I decided to make the long trip from Pasir Ris to this branch in ION and it wasn’t worth it. I order a BLT sandwich which turned out to be a burger hastily put together with bacon bits falling everywhere. My husband ordered a cheeseburger which ended up being extremely wet and greasy at the same time. (I don’t know how)
The fries were the only saving grace but five guys does give you waaaaaay more fries (they are greasy of course) than you can eat. I suggest getting a small serving. The two of us could barely finish half of the regular serving and we did eat a lot.
The experience and the food just didn’t justify their price point. Came away disappointed.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109555834279127675858/reviews
