Jack,4,Fuss free service and very easy to get all your items for a bbq under 1 roof. Prices also reasonable. Sometimes parking could be an issue. As for the food strongly recommend the otah and satay.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288565584051666357/reviews
Lee JI,4,"Food came at the 50th minute of the delivery hour but ok since it was a public holiday. No sign off required so it was a bit sus especially if customers arrived late.

Food was defrosted already. Bbq chicken wing, Mongolian kebab and chicken satay were very good!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113582053690694725740/reviews
Superman,1,"Had a very unpleasant encounter with this company driver. Delivery to location at 5pm to 6pm, morning 11am called to confirm location, 4pm called say nearby if can delivery early, after which 4.50pm reach but I am not yet at the location, driver say car parked at roadside will get into traffic summon ask me faster reach and demand me to reach by 5.15pm. (My delivery time scheduled 5pm-6pm) The driver keep calling and finally say u want to complaint go ahead as he mentioned he cant wait anymore and can just take a photo of the delivery to location and just go off even the receipent not at the location.

The otah (non-spicy) taste awful and the mee hoon dry and not very cooked, no ingredients or taste.

Very bad experience as first time customer. Would like to share on this bad encounter and poor services of the company with bad attitude of the driver!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108142158420846021257/reviews
