      "text": "Makcik work not ikhlas. Me and another customer standing in line waiting to order, makcik went out probably for toilet break without making eye contact with us and just let us stand  there without saying anything. When she came back 5 minutes later, not a word was said and she went back in the stall to wash some of her dishes and to prepare her onions. Only after another minute of watching her do her thing, did she take the customer in front of me’s order. When she asked the customer in a rude impatient tone what kind of mee she wants for the Bakso, that’s when I decided not to patronise such a rude store. All in all I wasted 15 minutes standing in front of the store when there’s no queue. Reading the reviews afterwards, I’m appalled that this is completely normal for the store",

      "text": "Great food but Q can be a bit slow moving. If you are unlucky, the Q can be long near the meal times.\n\nTried the Kentang Ball (potato ball). Very hefty and filling. Imagine a potato ball (mash potato/ begedil) the size of an adult fist. Swimming in a very savoury and spiced gravy-soup. Add two Tulang (one mutton leg bone, cooked well and long and sawn in half so you can suck the marrow). And you get a very filling and satisfying meal. Best on a rainy day, I swear.\n\nI have also ever takeaway the Tahu Telur. Excellent choice, holds well even when take away. You can watch the makcik aunty fry the dish by ladling oil over the Tahu Telur and you just know it's gonna taste great.\n\nWill be back to try the other offerings.",

Went for an old school breakfast which was a hearty kampung Porridge which has fermented soy bean, roasted peanuts, fried ikan bilis, sambal kangkong, stir fry beancurd & ikan bilis in soy sauce and a side of salted egg, sambal belacan and chili padi soy sauce.\nPerfect dish to start the day! Highly recommended but do take note porridge is served in the morning only.\n\nAlso had the Kacang Phool with the fluffy yet crunchy baguette. It taste the same as the Geylang Serai one and it is delicious! Highly recommended for something light in the morning.",

Immediately after, another customer asked for Mee Soto in Malay and was served right away. This clearly shows preferential treatment towards a specific demographic. I cannot believe this behaviour is still happening in 2024.",
