We had salmon and beef cubes, which were perfectly cooked and very delicious. Service is very attentive and friendly. Kudos to Richard for a great hospitality and making us feel very welcomed! üòÅ",

You can even hear the birds chirping in the background. There is a diverse range of cuisine to choose from as well. I also found the resident robot who was helping delivering food quite cute.",
