L H Ng,5,"Delivery was slightly earlier than requested and food was still warm when it came. Portion given was good and more than enough for 10 pax. The CNY mini buffet set has 8 dishes, 1 dessert, packet drinks and cutlery was also provided. Favourite dishes are golden salted egg prawn and prawn paste chicken. It's our first time ordering from foodline and this vendor for CNY, overall it's a thumbs up for the whole ordering till delivery process.

Yong Khiang Koh,4,"The food and services from +Robert Catering are good. The staffs are friendly and quite professional. They came on time and our guests enjoyed the food. The only comment is the quantity of the food. We ordered 30pax for 28 adults, but it seemed not enough.
