      "text": "Went for a lipo consultation early last year at the Novena Med Ctr. I didn't find doctor David Loh approachable. He honestly had a low demeanor, unfriendly, wasn't approachable. And I found him lazy tbh. I am of normal bmi, but carry abit more fat in my arms and upper thighs. Which is why I was clearly there. Before assessing my body. He upright called me fat, stating, just by looking at my arms (because I was in a sleeveless dress) and asked his nurse to offer me Saxenda injectables( close to $500), without knowing my medical history/allergies. Told me to use them and come back after 3 months. It seems like he just wanted to make immediate money out of the \"free\" consultation. I tried using the appetite suppressant injectables but experienced bloating and indigestion and discontinued. All of which was also not properly explained to me. The nurse only taught me how to use the dosage. All in all, the doctor couldn't be bothered to sit and discuss my concerns with me. Its like he just wanted to faster  get rid of the consultation. He only talked to me to a good whole 10mins, (with body assessment) and lazily told me to use Saxenda. I went for an assessment at another clinic recommended by a friend and learnt more about the treatments and what worked for me. All in all, don't fall for the free consultation and head here.",
