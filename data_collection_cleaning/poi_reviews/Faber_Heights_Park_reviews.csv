C,4,"Faber Heights Park is a small, well-maintained green space tucked just off the Ulu Pandan Park Connector. Despite its compact size, it offers a peaceful spot for residents and passersby to rest, exercise, or bring kids for a quick play break.

The park features a sheltered pavilion, basic fitness equipment, and shaded seating areas, along with a swing and a slide that make it family-friendly. It’s clean, quiet, and conveniently connected to the wider park connector network. I’d rate it a 4 out of 5 — a modest but well-designed neighbourhood space that adds charm and function to the area.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews

Nilesh Korgaokar,5,The walk along the canal is a mini birder’s paradise. Apart from several bird species there’s a resident Grey Headed Fish Eagle that if you’re lucky will put on display it’s awesome fish hunting skills. Go in the mornings. I was very fortunate to see it hunting within an hour or so my starting my walk.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111615711468280915846/reviews
Reuter Chua,5,"Nice Park with main park connector... Lots of activities like walking, running, cycling for all ages. Great place to photograph birds like eagles kingfishers herons etc. Most cyclists are OK but a fair share going too fast too impatiently so watch out. Maybe the authorities should consider speed bumps and other obstacles in the PCN stretch around the park to take care of errant cyclists.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112156012558572594770/reviews
