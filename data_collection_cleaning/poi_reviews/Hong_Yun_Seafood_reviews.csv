Mok Kong Meng,3,"Hong Yun, their signature dish is white bee hoon. Must order... Beside this, I did try their fried rice with smoky work hei. Taste not bad. The next stall selling satay, must try too. üëç",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106005371487342004407/reviews
Patricia Au Yong,5,Not too bad! Food tastes üëç  like the fact that there's an air conditioning sitting available. My guests from USA enjoyed their dinner thoroughly üòã will be back üòÅ,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117237667465189562447/reviews
HC L,4,"Famous for their White Bee Hoon. This is a dish without sauce, unlike hor fun. It is moist, so not the same as the dry bee hoon we have for breakfast. Pork slices and egg were added. The pork slices were very tender. Pork lard also added for those who like some crunch. Should be eaten with their sambal chilli. Instead I made the mistake of having it with red cut chilli. Didn‚Äôt try the other dishes so no comments.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105381120259821237733/reviews
Yihan Lin,1,"Just skip the place, unless u have a unique taste for white boon hoon minus the gravy and taste like morning fried bee hoon. Rest of the dishes are salty and serving size small for the price of $11 each. Prawn paste chicken had no smell of the distinct paste smell. Bowl of white rice will cost you 70cent. If they cannot even get the staple zhi char dishes right, don‚Äôt bother with the other more complex dishes",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113528009140257994211/reviews
