Irys Lim,5,"A pancake store which sells traditional and modern pancakes. Love their fragrant peanut sauce instead of old style peanut which tends to fall out when biting. Each bite is full of crunchy peanut sauce filling.

I Started with their modern filling pancake though and they had various flavours cheese and encased in 2 round pancake.

Love each and every of them so far. But it can be a long wait if they run out of the skin. So order in advance before buying other stuff.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113330574047521272654/reviews

Kristina Wong,5,"staff were very friendly, tried the biscoff pancake and it was pretty good and unique considering i’ve never tried one with biscoff and the filling were pretty packed as you can see the filling were spilling out of both sides!!

Rach,5,Am a fan of their reasonably priced charcoal min jiang kueh pancakes👍🏻💯 (peanut and coconut flavours)🤗🤤 and love their munchi pancakes as well (tried the blueberry/apple/strawberry cheese flavours so far)! Staff are generally friendly too and tend to kindly accede to my lil requests for specific pieces when available etc. Do try if you’re craving for good min jiang kueh or some 🥞!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100368288078910287205/reviews
