Did I mention that this set that comes in generous portion and free-flow of barley tea cost below SGD8?!",

She is always cheerful and bubbly when we order.\nFood is generally cooked fast and need to collect at the counter. I would say the quality and quantum are reasonably good for the price.\nPrice has increased after the renovation but probably due to the higher rental for the new contract. But it is still reasonable.\nAtmosphere is ok and has improved after the renovation.",

Has free self service hot tea just like dining in korea. Their cold noodles are my favorite, opens up your appetite and very nice chewy noodles. Beef bulgogi porridge is normal, porridge not sweet or flavorful enough, but with the beef is alright. Potato pancakes are korea sweet pancakes. It's a small Cafe restaurant dinning outlet, I think the price is ok and worth visiting again.",

Ginseng chicken was subtle in flavors while the chicken steamboat was bursting with flavors. Similarly kimchi rice rice with egg was equally good. All at an affordable pricing.\n\nFor the food, portion size, flavors and affordable pricing, this place is packed. Definitely worth trying for all the above reasons. Highly recommend.",
