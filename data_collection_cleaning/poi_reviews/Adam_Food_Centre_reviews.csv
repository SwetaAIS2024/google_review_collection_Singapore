Hans Han,4,"Drove here after a workout at MacRitchie Reservoir. Order from the famous Selera Rasa Nasi Lemak stall recommended by a friend.

The rice is fragrant and has a good texture. The fried chicken wings and egg were freshly made.

Will be coming back to try the other famous stalls/dishes like mee soto, indian rojak and prawn noodles.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102083716852028840049/reviews
