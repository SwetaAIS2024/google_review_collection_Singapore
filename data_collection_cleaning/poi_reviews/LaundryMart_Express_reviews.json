      "text": "Easy enough to use. The machines come with detergent and if you opt to pay a little more, there's softener too.\n\nDryer was a little confusing as there was a low, medium and high setting. Tried medium for 25 mins and my clothes were still a little damp*. An additional 10 mins of high temperature did the trick though I could have just use the high temp setting for 15 or 20 mins I think. So far no shrinkages.\n\nIf you change dollars to coins, there will be tokens, so plan ahead on the amount you might need.",
