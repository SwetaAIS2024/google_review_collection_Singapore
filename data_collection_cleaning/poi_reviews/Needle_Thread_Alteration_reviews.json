Thread was not of the same colour as the top, they did not cut off the loose threads and it was not sewed straight. With such skills, I could have sewed it myself‚Ä¶ last picture was the other side‚Äôs original sewing pattern that they could have referenced from.",

They are very meticulous and did an amazing job with the alternation.\n\nI also got my dresses and other items dry cleaned. It was pressed down really nicely and as fresh as they could be! They keep up to their word and true to the timing promised.\n\nWill be coming back to them again for their excellent service and skills!\n\nThank you so much Needle Thread Alternations!",
