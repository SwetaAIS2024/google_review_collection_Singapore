However, on my next visit, I tried the Wagyu Burger and absolutely loved it‚Äîit was excellent. The only minor issue was that the egg inside was slightly overcooked, but it didn‚Äôt bother me much. Thanks to its location, sitting outside offers a peaceful atmosphere that‚Äôs truly relaxing. Next time I visit Singapore, I‚Äôll definitely stop by again just for that burger.",

A suggestion to the management would be to really invest in a decent sound equipment so the full potential of the people performing comes across",

      "text": "Good drinks, good food, great live music! Had a bottle of red wine, which was reasonably priced, and tried some appetisers and main dishes. The scallops and prawns in wine sauce were delicious and very appetising! The fish and chips were fresh and very meaty! Batter wasn‚Äôt overpowering, but lacked firmness for my personal preference (still good though!). Some of my favourite dishes there are the scotch eggs and Haggis with chicken. Very tasty and nicely presented! Had a Guinness while we enjoyed the live music there which is very good! Highlander at Millenia is a great place to chill for dinner till late! Food and drinks and entertainment at its best! This new outlet at Millenia is slightly larger and more cosy than the previous one at Clarke Quay. Also has a very ambient Al fresco area! Will be back for more! Service and staff are very attentive and friendly which makes for an overall complete evening experience!",
