Gerard James Rozario,5,"Good variety of food choice - Muslim, Indian, Chinese food all under one roof. Tried the Minced Meat Noodles from Fei Siong, really good.

Aason Than,2,"Food: Good variety and most of them actually are average or above!

Price: Cheap. Price are cheaper than hawker on average.

Cleanliness: Not very hygienic.

Service:
1. Cleaning services are slow but the workers cannot be faulted. They are sort of understaffed but there are not much staff needed after peak hours.

2. Food stalls staff are usually alright. No rude people.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105507199431117793886/reviews
