Very quiet and there is still foot traffic but is way less and most of the restaurant here are closed. Very different atmosphere here as compare to 2019 pre covid-19 days.",

Best way to describe is a very wide walkway with a combo of steps, ramps and escalators, going between the main Resorts World area and the Sentosa Merloin. It's under a really high roof with a lovely spacious feel, with water fountains and restaurants on both sides to complete the atmosphere.",
