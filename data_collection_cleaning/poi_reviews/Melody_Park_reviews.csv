Rajasingam Thuraisamay,4,It's one of the phases within East Ledang. Consisting of only Villas / Bungalows. Visited my friend staying here. His property comes with its own private swimming pool and is very spacious. Overall very impressed with the green design of the housing estate as surrounded by small gardens throughout the housing estate.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100148905594142454958/reviews
