Rajen Arasu,5,"Ordered  takeaway Nasi Rawon. Very decent standard  and very reasonably priced.  Nasi Rawon includes Serongdeng (fried desiccated coconut), choice of Sambal Tumis or Sambal belachan. I added Begedil  (deep fried potato cutlet), Kupang (mussels), ikan bilis (anchovies) with peanuts, Paru (fried beef lungs) and Sambal Goreng. My takeaway order only cost me a very reasonable SGD 4.50",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113317460774650179369/reviews
