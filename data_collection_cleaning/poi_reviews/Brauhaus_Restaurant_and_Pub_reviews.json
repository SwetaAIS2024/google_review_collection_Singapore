      "text": "5 stars\nAbsolutely love Brauhaus! They have an incredible selection of bottle-conditioned beers from around the world — everything from authentic Belgian Trappist brews to classic German styles and rich English ales. It’s a beer lover’s paradise! The food is equally impressive — hearty, satisfying German fare. Their pork knuckle fried bee hoon is a must-try — a perfect fusion dish that hits all the right notes. Cozy vibe, friendly staff, and great for both casual hangouts and serious beer appreciation. Highly recommended!",

Lovely warm wooden interior, great life music, and an amazingly wide selection of beers. Let’s do a world tour!\n\nTried the pork knuckle and the sausages, with sauerkraut and potatoes. Amazing sausages, and a fairly ok pork knuckle. I’ll be back here for more.",

      "text": "My family and I have been regulars here since I was 15, we always enjoy the live music every Friday and Sat nights but now they do have live music gigs frequently during the week.\n\nWe love their signature pork knuckle bee Hoon as this is something familiar and yet homely for a Singaporean Chinese Family. Tasty noodles with good wok hei and the meat from the pork knuckles isn’t tough.\n\nPork knuckle and sausage platter is also a must try!\n\nMy wife ordered their beef goulash, I tried it for the first time. So good too!\n\nLastly if you’re into beers, they have a wide variety of beers from various countries. Personally I would recommend trying the beers from Germany or Belgium as it really fits the theme.",
