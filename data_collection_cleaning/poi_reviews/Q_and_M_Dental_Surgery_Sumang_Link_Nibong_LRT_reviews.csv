Jason L.,5,Dr Chan and the staff are very professional. Was able to get my teeth/gum issues checked and rectified on a PH when many other clinics are closed. Will be coming back more often even though there are other clinics nearer to me. Highly recommended to visit this clinic if you are staying in Punggol. seek a doctor early since health is wealth!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117354913118974499631/reviews
