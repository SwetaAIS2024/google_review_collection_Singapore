Filtered coffees served on takeaway paper cups despite stating having coffees in. Of the two coffees we had, one was diluted and had none of the remaining taste notes. I learned later that there was no more beans for this coffee. Overall experience was one feeling cheated, not the same as previous experiences at Mei Ling St or Vivo branches.",
