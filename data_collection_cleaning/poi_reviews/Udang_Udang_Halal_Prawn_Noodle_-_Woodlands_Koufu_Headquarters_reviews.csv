Heidi HL Tan,5,"Love the Prawn Noodles, similar to the Penang style. Is rich and flavourful, full of umami. Price is reasonable. Foodcourt is airy and spacious. The 1 and only Halal Chinese style economic rice is as good. Pleasant service from the owner and his staff. Definitely will be going back again soon.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102520513874827778096/reviews
