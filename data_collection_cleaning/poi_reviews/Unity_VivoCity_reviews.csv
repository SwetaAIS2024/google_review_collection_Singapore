Brendon Ho,1,"Seems like the male pharmacist (wears specs, forgot his Chinese name) is quite blur and totally regret asking him and buying the medicine.

After the lady in front of me in the queue paid for the medicine he turned his attention to me and asked what I needed but the lady was still standing at the counter bcos he was still holding on to her medicine without realising and she had to remind him she hasn’t walked away bcos he hasn’t passed her the medicine LOL.

Afterwards, I asked for vomitting medicine but he was replying so quietly and I could barely hear him throughout. He looked like he was forced to work as a pharmacist there. Worst part is that he gave me the wrong medicine and it didn’t have effect and when I went to the doctor, the doctor told me the medicine was meant for diarrhoea… Jesus Christ man, how is this guy a certified pharmacist?",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104705222716713188837/reviews

Romy Glass,1,"maybe don’t have your employees in the skincare area, walk up to customers and pick a facial feature that needs “fixing”. i have observed and experienced employees starting their sales pitch with - “ looking to fix your dark spots”, “products to fix your acne”, when the customer hasn’t even mentioned what they are looking for. it’s highly rude.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114346888320467930850/reviews
Maria Christine Asuncion,2,"I bought medicine here that required dispensing from a larger container. The guy took a bottle from inside, and without washing or disinfecting his hands or putting on gloves, proceeded to dispense 10 pills into another container right at the counter. Is that even hygienic? I expected better",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102534443550978293575/reviews
