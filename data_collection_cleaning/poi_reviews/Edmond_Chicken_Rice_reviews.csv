Mimo Eats,3,"A Solid Halal Chicken Rice Option, But with Room for Improvement

It‚Äôs rare to find a good halal chicken rice, and Edmond‚Äôs certainly stands out as one of the better options I‚Äôve tried. However, it does fall short of the high standards set by other Hainanese chicken rice stalls. If you plan to visit, be sure to arrive early to avoid the long queues and the possibility of them running out of chicken.

The set is great value, offering generous portions of vegetables, rice, and chicken. The roasted chicken is juicy and flavorful, the vegetables are well-seasoned, and the soup even comes with two wanton dumplings‚Äîa nice touch. However, the rice was overcooked, which was disappointing given the quality of the rice brand used. It also lacked the rich flavor typically associated with this dish.

Overall, while there‚Äôs room for improvement, Edmond‚Äôs offers a satisfying meal for those seeking halal chicken rice.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109251384615992579089/reviews
AJ,5,"I came on a Friday and it was sold out at 3pm.
I came back on Tuesday 11am, and finally got to try it. Probably one of the best chicken rice on my list! Extra chicken and add-on chicken gizzard total of $7.50 worth it!!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113544670960827633564/reviews
Shravya Srinivasan (Scss),5,"The food was so really awesome, and the aunty running the stall was really nice. I went there with my friends (also her son) and she was so nice and put all the food on the house. The chicken rice was absolutely perfect and the chicken was so tender and savoury. Would definitely go there again",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105587113224508247812/reviews
JY Lee,5,"Always very generous with the portion. Rice is fragrant and meat is tender.
Soup is rich in flavour and not bland.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106976672219961391837/reviews
Azman Koozy,5,"Edmond Chicken Rice.. is one of my favourite local chicken rice stall.
The rice is flavorful, toasted chicken is nicely done and the soup i can say is tasteful..with dry onions in.. makes it better .
The chilli sauce with the chicken rice is not hot and also not blant.. just nice..
They also serve steam chicken.
Overall i give Edmond chicken rice.. 10/10.. even the price is reasonable.
Extra rice n extra chicken.. would cost u only between $6.50 to $7.0...this is for an UPSIDE portion of rice n chicken .. not the normal size..

Location: Tanglin Halt food stall. At the wet market.. opposite the old police post..opens morning to 3 or 4 pm.. depends of chicken availability..

If you love chicken rice.. you should try it out when your nearby... You wont regret it..

Enjoy...
