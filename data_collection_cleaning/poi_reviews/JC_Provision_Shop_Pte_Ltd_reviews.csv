David Lim,1,"Never seen it open. If the owner don't even bother open, why is this shop even here?? The vending machines near the shop is bad. It barely has any snacks, Hershey's bar is $3.50, red bull is $99.99, and when you buy something, it will just drop it down violently. Once opened can of coke, explodes. Ribena cap damn hard to open. I literally had to use my teeth to open.
Don't come here unless you want a unpleasant experience. Oh yeah, they took down one of the vending machines.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113015809076678685697/reviews

Narinder Kaur,1,I have read the reviews and I totally agree. This collection point is absolutely useless. I have been there on 1/4 and 2/4 and it was closed. My collection due date is 4/4. Going to try one more time on 3/4 at lunchtime. Not sure if I will get my parcel.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102350460884247342099/reviews
