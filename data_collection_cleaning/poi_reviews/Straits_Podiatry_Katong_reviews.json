I was a bit nervous about the treatment since I’m afraid of pain, but Dr. Daniel was very gentle and always explained what he was doing, reassuring me along the way to help calm my nerves. The nurse was also so kind, staying by my side and helping me feel less scared. I truly appreciate the care and service they provide to their patients.",

Post the procedure, they offered good follow up reviews to ensure a smooth recovery. While it’s not a cheap procedure, I would recommend Straits Podiatry for professional treatment.",

Although I had to travel the day after the surgery, Dr Benedict always keep in touch to monitor my healing & provided precise instructions for the aftercare. It is a wise decision to engage Dr Benedict as he is genuinely concerned about his patients. Never regretted my decision to go with Straits Podiatry!",
