      "text": "Excellent food. Superb service.\n\nI’m really happy we dined here! The food was so delicious. We got Kadai prawn, lamb rogan Josh, bandara kabab, onion bhaji, saffron rice and garlic naan.\nThe lamb was succulent and tender. The onion bhaji was super crispy but not oily.\nMy favorites were the prawns and chicken bandada kaban.- I will be dreaming of these 2 dishes!!\n\nAffordable pricing, on drinks and food. We had excellent service by Pavav.\n\nHighly recommend!!!",

Hence we have to left without eating anything despite long wait.",
