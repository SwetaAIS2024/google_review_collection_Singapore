Entire area aircon leakage + aircon not cold. Not sure if this is mall issue or the shop issue. Eating claypot is already very hot, plus the hot environment, sweats quite a lot.",

      "text": "Lunch at Lau Wang Claypot Delights @ Punggol Oasis Terraces\n\nDropped by Lau Wang Claypot Delights for lunch and had a satisfying meal packed with rich, local flavors. The standout dish was the Sambal Seafood—spicy, aromatic, and generously portioned. We also enjoyed the Eggplant with Minced Meat, which was savoury and comforting, perfect with a bowl of warm white rice.\n\nAnother highlight was the Homemade Ngoh Hiang (2pcs)—crispy on the outside and juicy inside. The Pig Organs dish was bold and flavourful, though definitely for more adventurous eaters. For vegetables, we had the Nyonya Chap Chye, a classic braised dish that was both hearty and nostalgic.\n\nTo accompany our meal, we tried the Luo Han Guo and Lemongrass drinks, both served hot and refreshing, a nice touch to balance out the heavier claypot dishes.\n\nPrices were reasonable, totaling $60.70 for a feast for several people. The service was efficient, and the food came out promptly. A great place for casual dining if you're craving traditional Singaporean claypot fare with a modern twist.\n\nWhere we sat, the aircondition was weak and we perspired. Too warm. However,  definitely return to try their other claypot specialties!",
