      "text": "Never really a big fan of large crowded MRT stations. Personally was quite lost the moment I exited the station, as there were 3 to 4 large exits with long walks, presumably leading me to different parts of Serangoon, Balestier, and Boon Keng, upon exit. Without proper signages and directions, it's just very difficult to find anything if you're here the first couple of times. Exited one of them accidentally, and had to go back down to find the right exits.",
