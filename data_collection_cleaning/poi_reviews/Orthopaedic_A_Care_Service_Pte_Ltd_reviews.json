      "text": "Dr Nathan was my 2nd opinion for knee microfracture surgery. He has since become my first choice for any ortho issue. He is not only empathetic, humble, and professional, but also highly knowledgeable about his craft. Many other clinics in SG have a lot of fancy fluff (especially when it comes to ortho issues). Don’t be fooled. At the end of the day, the Dr’s competence & personality matters most. Dr Nathan doesn’t charge exorbitant rates, nor does he push for unnecessary surgery. What he does do is provide the patient with realistic treatment prognostics and genuine care (helps in the healing process). He is also way more knowledgeable about his craft than the first specialist I saw (someone younger than him). I think what stands out most is his humility. He is not trying to prove anything or show off his talent. Professionals with humility will listen, be careful not to miss things, and be more likely to attain an accurate diagnosis or treatment protocol. One gets the feeling that he does not really need to work at his stage of life but chooses to do so out of genuine compassion. As a healthcare professional myself, I often find myself trying to emulate Dr Nathan in my own work after visiting him as a patient. Thank you.",
