Jar ofheart,1,"I am utterly appalled at the incompetence and negligence shown by the student care services at KRTC Jurong West . My experiences seeking help and resources have revealed deep issues with the staff's ethics, responsibility and basic concern for student safety.

At every turn, staff have evaded taking any real action or ownership of students' needs. They consistently push issues off onto other departments and pass the buck endlessly. I have found the management to be the worst offenders when it comes to apathy and deflection. They seem to have no grasp of what their roles entail or how to provide competent oversight.

Most disturbing is the lack of safety protocols and preventative measures put in place. On multiple occasions I have found myself and fellow students in dangerous situations that could easily have been avoided if staff demonstrated basic care and precaution. It is clear this department is putting students at unacceptable risk.

I urge all students to steer completely clear of these deficient and hazardous student care services. They will not support you in any way and worse still, actively allow harm through negligence. The administration must intervene immediately to address the incompetence of management and overhaul proper training as well as accountability measures for all staff. Our well-being and safety should be their top priority. I hope sharing my experiences prevents more students from such mistreatment.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105022262264887277894/reviews
