Sim Sim Ho,3,"Booking of appointment was smooth and easy. Video consultation appointment was conducted exactly as per appointment time. I like it.  No waste of time in waiting.

I have decided to add on comment here. I was told by the clinic assistant that I would receive the medication in 1-3 working days, but today is already the 3rd working day, plus the 2 weekend days, total 5 days, i still yet to receive despite payment done almost immediately after consultation 5 days ago.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109075021949946651707/reviews
Lynette Mojica,5,"Fast, hassle free and convenient.
I have started my weight loss journey as I am recently diagnosed with Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia. My friend recommended me a clinic, but itâ€™s quite far from my place. A monthly visit to that clinic is a hassle for me. Good thing I found Sienna Health Clinic. Registration and online consultation was very smooth. Plus they will deliver the medicine right at my doorstep for free!
Thank you Sienna Health!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103128921095350991454/reviews

maahirah mohammed,5,"5 star for convenience and affordability. Pleasant and efficient customer service.
Doctor is friendly and knowledgeable but would be lovely if she could lead the consultation by asking questions about our lifestyle, goals etc and guide from there. Overall still a good experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104101051284113874481/reviews
Sophie Wang,5,"Tele-consultation was arranged soon after the questionnaire was completed. Doc was meticulous and professional, offered practical and useful medical tips.
