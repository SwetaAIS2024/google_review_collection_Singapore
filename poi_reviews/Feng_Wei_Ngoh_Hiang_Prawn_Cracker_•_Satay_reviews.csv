Bryan,1,"Expensive satay at 0.90 per stick, taste is so-so. If priced at 0.70 cents per stick then reasonable for being at hawker and its subpar taste.

They don’t issue buzzer, after ordering I have to walk far back and forth 2 times to check on my order. The 2nd time I just wait there for it. The lady at the counter didn’t mention any specific time, just say wait and come back later, so I went to check at 15 minutes interval.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115527441573527762214/reviews
Don Lim Yuan Heng,1,"My order, placed at 7:46 PM as shown on the receipt, was initially supposed to be ready in 20 minutes. I returned at 8:20 PM only to be informed the satay order was incorrect and I would need to wait longer. Considering the high price of 90 cents per piece, and my intention to sample every stall, this hour-long delay without any compensation has completely diminished my appetite. While it's a hawker stall, the poor service is still unacceptable.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101994076632101374057/reviews
