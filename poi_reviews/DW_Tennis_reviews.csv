Neelima Subramanyam,5,"Desmond is a fantastic tennis coach!
I’ve had the pleasure of taking lessons with him, and I highly recommend him for both beginners and intermediate players. He has a great teaching style – patient, encouraging, and knows exactly how to break down techniques so they’re easy to understand.

Desmond makes learning tennis fun while still challenging you to improve with every session. His tips on form, footwork, and strategy have helped me build confidence on the court. Whether you're just starting or looking to level up your skills, Desmond is the coach you need!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106880312886481231383/reviews
