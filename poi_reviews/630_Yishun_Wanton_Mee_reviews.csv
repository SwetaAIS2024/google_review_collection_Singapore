Kwong Fei Yee,1,"Oct 2022. Tried the wanton noodles. Come with nice pork lard. Can eat.

Tried it again on 22nd Mar 2023. Unfortunately this time the pork lard was not fresh. Really spoilt the taste of the whole bowl of noodles. Inform the stall owner about it so that she is aware and be more careful in future. Dropped the rating from 4 to 1.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118030178376808365901/reviews

ÊÄªÁªì good to eat once a while, preferably not the last bowl cos everything really scrape from bottom already. More tasty, more quantity but oso more oily & more residues..",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104531474538795569096/reviews
Damian Peh,5,"Delightful bowl of wanton mee, finally managed to try it after multiple attempts! Flavourful broth with wantons that are equally flavourful and packing with fillings. The char siew isn't dry and is tender while the chilli packs a nice umami punch. Highly recommended!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106672332240497038454/reviews
Sean Goh,3,"Heard alot about this very famous wanton noodle stall that used to be at blk 632 and later shifted over to blk630.  I was told that this stall always generates long queues. Reached the stall slightly before 1pm. There was no queue, i was able to order immediately upon arriving. Order their wanton noodle which was SGD$4.

Noodle was nicely cooked, texture of the noodle wad springy. Sauce wasnt too my liking though.Charsiew and the wanton was pretty average. Wanton skin has a strong alkenline taste to it.

Overall, it pretty average for me. Had better wanton noodle elsewhere. Noticed that the ppl behind the stall isnt the elderly couple but 2 vietnamese women instead. Not sure if the stall still belongs to the original owner.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
