The service here sucks, really sucks.\n\nThe resturant supposed to operate 24hrs but however, the cleaner decided to clean the floor at the busy hr and keep chasing the customers out of the area and was asked to sit at the front area (the area was already packed with customers)\n\nCan the management look into it. I am fine that the area to be close for cleaning after 10pm whereby customers are lesser.",
