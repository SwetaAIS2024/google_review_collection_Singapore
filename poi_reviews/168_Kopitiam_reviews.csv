Jimmy YEO,1,"It was a bit expensive for the mixed rice, yes of course, I've ordered fish and meat egg but some stall is about $9 plus. I asked for less rice, dun understand why the staff shook the head, and  showed the expression of impatience. The cost is $10.70, and the fish is $4.5. Well, I'm not eating this stall again. Will try other stalls. The other 2 coffee shops opposite the road are newer and better foods.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102792564288426657922/reviews

Rajen Arasu,3,"Average neighborhood coffee shop. The economical bee hoon stall offers food at reasonable prices for breakfast with good portion size. The economical rice stall offer good variety of dishes at  reasonable prices. The Indian Muslim stall prices are unreasonable and offer less variety and taste. For Indian Muslim food, better off  walking a short distance to the adjacent block 158 Indian Muslim Coffee shop.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113317460774650179369/reviews
