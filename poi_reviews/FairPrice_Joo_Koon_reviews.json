For being so far in the West and Being surrounded with Industrial Estates, it has a Lot of Shops to go to (Fairprice Obviously but also a spread of Fast food Places). Overall, a great place to go if you live further west than Jurong East onwards if the hustle and bustle doesn't suit you! (By the way, I went in a time when it was supposed to be Lunch peak, but it was not crowded at all!)",

The staff at the service counter said i shd collect the free coffee at the service counter, which i highlighted that it was not stated in the promo label. And she remarked to me 'sui bian ni', in loosely translate language up to you! I think the level of service really need to be improved!",
