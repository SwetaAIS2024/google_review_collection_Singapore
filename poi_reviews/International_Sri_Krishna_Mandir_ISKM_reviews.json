      "text": "Nice to visit. Peaceful place for meditation. However, I would have expected a temple structure but not a very generic building occupying a floor as a temple. Good to have something than nothing but would be happy to see a temple in future. A must visit place. Inside decor, God, Goddesses were great. Looks miniature of ISKCON style. One thing to note, in general if we search ISKCON Singapore, by default you get this address at Gaylang Road. However there is another ISKCON temple near Mustafa at Little India. Pls make sure where you're heading to. Wheelchair accessibility is limited for visitors at the temple. Pls plan ahead. Thanks.",

If you force yourself to have a conversation and preach why Krishna is above all the other gods, then I'm sorry to say, you don't have the my approval for this.\n\nAs much I am still follow Hinduism and am a Brahmin, the vibes here don't sync with what I'm looking for. I've been to enough ISKON temples in India, but never have I ever encountered such experiences.\n\nMy two cents - Unless the devotees voluntarily approach you with their intention to serve the temple, let them do their thing and leave them alone.",

We often visit on weekends for my kids classes and listen to the spiritual talks followed up with a Sunday Dinner with some Drama and cultural activities. Most of the preachings are to bring Krishna consciousness to the brains..",
