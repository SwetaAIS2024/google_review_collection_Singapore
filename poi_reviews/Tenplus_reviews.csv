K K,5,"This cafe is situated at the entrance of a plant nursery. There is a little open courtyard with some toy tricycles for little kids. It is not air conditioned, but even though we were there for lunch, it was not too warm. Plenty of fans kept the place breezy, and perhaps because it is set among a lot of greenery, it was comfortable. The food and coffee was good too. The prawn pasta was delicious and reasonably priced.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101557443580464751545/reviews
Loretta Wong,5,"Located at the Sungei Tengah, Love the atmosphere up here. It’s clean and well renovated. Food and service is good. Great for kid to run around the Vicinity while waiting for the food. There’s a live band starting from 7pm, overall experience is great. Will revisit again.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112443424951940400691/reviews
Fong Joey,5,"It is a cozy spot perfect for a laid-back hangout. They allow pets, which is a huge plus for animal lovers. The vibe is chill and welcoming, making it a great place to relax.

Food-wise, prices are slightly on the higher side, but the quality definitely makes up for it. Everything I tried was fresh, well-prepared, and delicious. The All Day Hungry Breakfast is a must-try—hearty, flavorful, and super satisfying.

That said, transport-wise it’s not the most convenient place to get to, especially if you’re not driving. But if you don’t mind the journey, it’s worth the visit. (This was actually my 4th visit!)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112670361442066324184/reviews
Avis Peng,4,"Very good place to chill and relax. Listen to live performance, chinese genre of music. Food is good, Asian western fusion. Order the beer before 7pm to get better discount. They have red and white wine but limited selection. Whisky and cocktail are available. You can bring your own liquor and pay $20++ for corkage, but if you spend more than $100, the corkage will be waived. Live performance only on Friday and Saturday. Quite a remote place though. Better if you drive or go with friend that drive.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112154892036335324432/reviews
Shufang Qiu,5,Awesome food and nice ambience at reasonable prices. Maybe tables are sliiightly too close to each other :p but parking is free!!! There's live band for those who like it - may be a tad too loud when you want to have a conversation with your friend. Overall we enjoyed a nice Friday evening here.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101663372908276162597/reviews
