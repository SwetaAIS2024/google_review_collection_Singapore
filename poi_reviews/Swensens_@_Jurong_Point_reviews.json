The mala pasta was the nicest out of all the dishes we ordered. It was tasty and spicy. The ice cream was good, mint was our favourite flavour.\n\nThe service was a little slow, considering that there were very minimal customers that day and timing that we visited. We weren't attended to while queueing outside. We had to walk-in and find seats ourselves to get noticed by the staff.",
