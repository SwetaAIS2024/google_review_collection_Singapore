It was a beautiful construct delivered in a pretty box. Love the texture with crunchy bits inside. The Wild Alaskan Pollock Fish fritters are 2 small super crispy breaded fish fillets. All pretty good. Enjoyed my meal. Shiok.",

The lady who took my order even marked a huge 6 in that section on the order form & it's still missing. I think the gentleman making the orders needs to pay closer attention to his work.",

Really really tasty, a healthy option and great convenience if you’re on the go. Miso is also super tasty. Maybe less relevant, but I love how colourful and unique the packaging is too.",

Well, she looked as though she hated her job!\n\nThe food was tasteless even though I have chosen flavorful items. I had a salad bowl and it tasted raw and just very meh! I eat salad and poke bowls very often by the way.\n\nThe husband had a maki roll and he was so disappointed in it that when we got home, he made cup noodles. He even said that the noodles was more satisfying that maki roll.",
