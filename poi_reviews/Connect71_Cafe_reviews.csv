lontongstroong,4,"Located a tad bit out of the way from the well-trafficked areas of NTU's North Spine and I've only known this place rather recently. Surprisingly popular among some students and staffs - there is always crowds around lunch time, perhaps the 10% discount of all items on sale for them is one of the main draws.

Discount aside, the offerings are actually pretty good given the price, albeit the Japanese and Japanese-inspired noodle dishes' portion is somewhat smaller than average for most people. The coffee is one of the very bests in NTU and very competitively priced ($3 for long black/espresso after discount). Don't expect the variety like real speciality coffee place like let's say Venture Drive, but they are know what they are doing - the coffee I've had was chocolaty, a bit velvety, and came with right 'body' and thickness.

Due to its popularity, the indoor space is very crowded in lunch time, but the outdoor dining space (next to a rooftop garden) is almost always empty. Some shading (even patio table with umbrella) would do, especially in hot weather.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews
Cassia A,5,"Really good place to study! Their coffee is good. $3.50 for a black, which isn‚Äôt bad. They have a 10% discount for NTU students.
Both indoor and outdoor is really nice. It gets busy around 11am. Some outlets, but not many.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117662481746295955146/reviews
LP Pua,4,"It took me quite some time to find this restaurant. Even the two students I asked for directions didn't know its location.

The restaurant is neat, clean, and has a nice ambiance. The food was good, but since I wasn't very hungry, I didn't try the full meal. However, fellow diners commented that it was good.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews

Amazingly high quality food at a very affordable price point.

Pic 1: Gyudon. Beef was super tender and flavourful. The portion is substantial but not too much either an it was overall a joy to eat

Pic 2: Lychee rose cake. Got this huge piece for $6. It's really a huge cake I ended up sharing with my friend. The cake was really nice. I'm usually not a cake lover but the cream wasn't too heavy and the cake itself was light and moist enough.

The cafe vibes were awesome and service was good too! Those coming to NTU should support this place. It's slightly difficult to find though so do budget some time for walking around.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104772352309308188418/reviews
