Jia Hang Chua,4,"I see a lot of bad reviews but I didn’t experience any of that. The receptionists here are cordial and efficient, and the female doctor was polite and professional. I’ve been here twice (both mornings) because it is the closest for my group insurance coverage.

Just wish there was a sign that said where to queue up to register.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106159523117256350133/reviews
Therese Lim,1,"My visit was on 2 Dec, 845pm. I’m aware the clinic closes at 9pm, my sincere apologies for reaching late as I was sleeping the whole day due to how sick I was. Anyway, receptionist were nice to register me despite it being near closing time. Just as I was registering, the doctor comes out of her room and was shock to see another patient (myself) there. “I thought last registration is at 845pm?” was what she said to the staff. I honestly felt really bad putting them in a situation like that despite being sick but the only reason why I visited was because this is the nearest panel clinic under my school’s insurance. Was so thankful my fever showed up as 37.5, enough to justify why I needed to see the doct (lol). In hindsight, I should’ve just seen a doct tomorrow but I wanted an MC to inform my intern supervisors in advance hence why. Many more exchanges happened which I shall not blabber on about. But thanks to the nice 2 counter staff & cleaner auntie for validating me although I felt really bad. And apologies to the doct if you had any plans, I’ll make sure to visit earlier next time, if not just entirely avoid the place at all cost. Thanks!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110990118634113239825/reviews
Biter Fit,1,"Used to say, no mask no doctor. Politely asking for a mask yet a harmful way to reply. Simply have shown no empathy towards same humans, it's not even a waste to spare one mask to those who needs one! Why choose to work in health care when u don't even have the heart and passion  to do or to act like one???",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116477067011534156193/reviews
Clothe Chattels,1,"I am deeply dissatisfied with the service and care provided by this clinic. My recent experience has been nothing short of frustrating and concerning.

My prescription was for a 5-day course of antibiotics, but the clinic dispensed only a 2-day supply. When we reached out to clarify the discrepancy, the staff refused to verify the prescription against the doctor's note or memo. To our astonishment, they claimed they do not keep such records, which is quite alarming.

We were forced to seek urgent assistance at another clinic to obtain the correct dosage. This lack of attention to detail and refusal to rectify the mistake is unacceptable and raises serious concerns about the standards of care being provided here.

Given the seriousness of this lapse in medical standards, we are considering reporting this incident to the Ministry of Health. This experience has been deeply troubling, and I strongly advise potential patients to be cautious.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115193836473098035423/reviews
Daniel Maher,1,"My wife walked in today @6.40pm n was told by the receptionist that they couldnt lock in their system. Nothing they could do, not even the doctor. When asked if she should wait or come back later. They told her they didnt know when n what they could do abt it. Cant they do registering manually?  So, if the system isnt up by tonight, the girls there plus the doctor just sit in the clinic and starring at the computer?  What kind of service is this?  The receptionists have never been helpful at all. Previous ones were very rude too, thinking the owned the clinic. Patients were treated badly, not just us.  Reason came back is because of the medications works well for us. But we have to put up with such unhelpful rude  attitudes. Doctor Lai or the management could you please look into this maters.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112881813476427777640/reviews
