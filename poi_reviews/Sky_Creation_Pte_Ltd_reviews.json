From the initial consultation to the final touches, every step of the process was seamless. They took the time to truly understand my style and needs, offering creative solutions that transformed my space into something beyond my expectations.\n\nThe attention to detail, from color choices to furniture selection, was impeccable. Not only did they maximize the functionality of the space, but they also brought in a perfect balance of aesthetics and comfort. Communication was always prompt and professional, and they managed to stay within budget while delivering exceptional quality.\n\nMy home now feels like a true reflection of who I am, thanks to their expertise!",

      "text": "We had a great experience working with our interior designer, Anthea Tan. She was creative, attentive, and responsive throughout our home renovation, always making an effort to understand and address our concerns. While we truly appreciated the carpentry team's hard work, there were a few areas where the finishing and attention to detail could have been better. These werenâ€™t major issues, but they didnâ€™t quite match the high standard set by the design work. Fortunately, Anthea remained supportive and helped follow up on those points. With a bit more consistency in the workmanship, the experience would have been close to perfect.",

      "text": "I recently worked with Eunice from Sky Creation on a renovation project, and I canâ€™t recommend her enough! The level of attention to detail she brought to every part of the job was truly outstanding, and I especially loved her modern luxury design and how she used lighting to make the space feel elegant and inviting.\n\nDuring the renovation, nothing was overlookedâ€”she made sure every finish, every corner, and every element was done to perfection.\n\nAnd what stood out most was how willing she is to go the extra mile to address concerns or requests we had along the way. Their follow-up was excellent and made sure I was completely satisfied with every detail.\n\nThey kept me updated every step of the process, so I always knew what was happening and what to expect next, which made it so much easier for us. She also offered thoughtful suggestions that improved the overall design while still staying true to my original vision.\n\nThe project was completed on time and within budget, which I deeply appreciated. Thanks to her dedication and professionalism, the final result is even better than I imagined.\n\nIâ€™d recommend Sky Creation to anyone looking for a quality work, thoughtful designs and great communication!",

Floor tiles, wall paint etc etc. Ness went through everything thoroughly with patience giving his opinions and thoughts when necessary. We met up a few times to slowly go through every small detail of the whole house before proceeding with the full house renovation.\n\nDesign\nI truly liked how the whole house turned out making me feel like home with the warm lighting and it is more spacious.\n\nWorkmanship\nEverything went very very smoothly and there wasn't any major problems that needed to be amended after the renovation except for some minor problems like stains etc.\n\nService\nNess attended to us and replied to our queries as soon as possible giving me a detailed and clear answer toy queries at times.\n\nValue for Money\nYes, I personally think its value for money as everything turned out to what I was hoping for for my newly renovated house.",
