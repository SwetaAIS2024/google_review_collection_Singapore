Kyaw Kyaw Win,5,"My father, sister and brother in law seeing Dr Cheong for more than 20 years. Dr explained well and what are the things that you need to follow up after the tests which Dr recommended because need updated lab report to prescribe medication base on lab results. Dr is quite straight forward on explaining the results and make sure that patient understands well what he explained. When there is a difficult situation on live and death Dr will explain well pros and cons about the patient’s condition. Dr told the patient to spend time the rest of the quality of life if the patient can’t be cure at all and not giving more medicine and tests to make profit.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104514996471970415768/reviews
Billy Christian,5,"If you want a doctor that is not over prescribe meds, no nonsense, straight to the point and spot on detailed diagnosis, Dr Cheong is the person to go to. Thank you for taking care of my dad, dad-in-law and mom-in-law in the past 20 years, Dr Cheong!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106810983896496129325/reviews
Samuel Poh,1,Indeed should have checked the review. Proven that the Cheong is all about earning and do not care about patient’s need. First visit telling me all the big ticket items and rushing to secure the registration for the procedure and zero personal touch on my concerns and issues despite telling him direct. Walked out of clinic paying a high $218 for merely few sentence of consultation and nothing done! Worse private doctor ever!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113506183668092048702/reviews
Roh Music,1,"Confirming other reviews here.

A doctor with a big attitude. Rude. Not willing to listen to the patient or raise any questions to him. Pictures the worse possible medical condition to the patient in the first appointment itself, which scares him and bring down mentally. He wanted me to do a number of expensive tests even without reviewing years of historic health screening reports I produced. One of the worst experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101881359552131980489/reviews
Mark,1,"The doctor is really sucks. As a doctor should let patient know his situation. But he keep asking us to do lots of test, and said its very serious now. But after all the test he said you are fine. We asked what mean by  fine. He said fine is fine loh. It's so rude and no patience.

It's not only the fees, also the pain that when do injection test. He tried to confuse us and not answer our question directly.

It's a very bad experience ever.",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115247259705730266888/reviews
