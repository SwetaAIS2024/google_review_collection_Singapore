Meg NA,5,"Dear Ms Sha, Teachers & Staff of LGH478,

Thank you so much for your care, concern and guidance for my two daughters over the past 6 years! This has been a truly wonderful period for them, as they have always looked forward to going to school and never dreaded it. Thank you for making school such a joyful and enriching experience for them!

A special thanks to Teacher Cahaya and Peng Lao-Shi for their dedication and nurturing guidance during both girls'  kindergarten years, and to all the other teachers who showed them  love, care and support throughout their journey.

We are especially grateful for how you kept us updated on the girls' progress and were always willing to listen to and address our concerns. We will deeply miss the fun, warmth and strong bonds we have shared with all of you. Both girls will certainly miss you, and so will we!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112516588558865791529/reviews
