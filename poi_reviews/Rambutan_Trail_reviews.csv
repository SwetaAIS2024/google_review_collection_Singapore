Forest BK,5,"🍒The short but interesting Rambutan Trail located near the Main entrance of Thomson Nature Park routes around the former Rambutan Plantation.
🍒Along the trail, vistors are treated to the ruins of the former villagers residences, with information boards to their stories and the several fruit trees around.
🍒A former Rambutan Plantation's water source can also be found at the trail.
🍒Don't miss out on this tranquil and shady trail when visiting the Nature Park.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
