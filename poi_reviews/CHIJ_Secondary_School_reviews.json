The PSLs were warm and welcoming, making it easy to settle in.\n\nThe 'campfire' was unique and different from those at mixed schools, creating a memorable and special moment for everyone.",

I feel that this is a bad habit that should be corrected especially because they are not injured and should go to the back of the queue. I cannot blame teacher's\nfor not teaching them because this is basic etiquette that they should know .",

In the same lift as them, pressed the open door button for them to exit , the teacher just walked out, taking it for granted. Very self entitled. Not surprise to see the students behave this way when the teacher herself is so rude.",

We get that we have to practice god but it‚Äôs too much for people who don‚Äôt want That. It might lead to atheists. So I hope you aren‚Äôt like that pushing religion. Wish to join soon ü§û",
