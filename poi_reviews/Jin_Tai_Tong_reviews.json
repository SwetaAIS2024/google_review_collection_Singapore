And the tall guy casier gives you a f look! I can reccomend even more things affordably good to buy especially parents with young children.. But definitely the staff gonna get screwed someday!\nI hope the boss could advise this Malaysian staffs to behave wisely with respect!!",

I thought the price shd be reasonable.  To my surprise, the price is high and sales person was annoying. Push hard to sell not just one product, but many more. Is so irritating. I juz walked over to Hock hwa next door to take my time and buy with a better price with nice n friendly sales persons. Never go back to them again.",

The price for Karihome milk powder here is the cheapest I could find in Singapore. Even the Mamypoko diapers too. To top it off, the staff are really friendly and helpful. Will definitely come here again!",
