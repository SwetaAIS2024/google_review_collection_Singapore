Hrmgr,3,Not the best I tasted for turtle soup unless you like this diluted version. I have not tasted any wine or herbs in the soup. Portion is not as much as others and the rice is hard. The aunty does not mind serving you at the table and pick up after meal if you are seated near the stall.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews
KM Lim,4,The soup does not have the herbal taste. Feels diluted. Meat and other parts can eat. Chilli is not spicy enough. Aunty will bring the food to you. Location is a bit behind. Need the unit number.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115165287266283385823/reviews
Shuhui Tay,2,"See like no biz so give some support.
Attitude from auntie very bad.

Cost $10 a small bowl. N 3 chunck of meat n 2 chunk of jelly meat. That all.

Soup not hot at all unlike the stall which sell soup near the supermkt

Siambuddhas,4,turtle soup herbal was just nice ..not to over powering ... blending taste which suits even kids.. portion just right..slightly lesser but the operation cost here should be higher so understand it... lady boss was polite too... will come back again if my tummy calls and I am near here!,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111674103831778752169/reviews
Edmund Ho,4,"1st try;
Happened to grab the last serving of the day. Out of the various turtle soups tried in Singapore, this is the least overpowering herbally. Which may suit some taste buds.

2nd visit:
Rare rain amidst the heat wave. Was craving for some soup to warm the gut. Same stall, same turtle soup but had a larger portion which was served in a claypot. Arguably flavour was better kept in claypot than porcelain. And on a crowded PH morning, a table was easy to come by in this corner of the hawker food centre.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110400657629395024917/reviews
