Big ass fans to keep u cool and also circurate the air to keep u smelling less like mookata after your meal. Meats are well marinated, chilli with garlic awesome. Taste reminds me of the new udon before they moved away from golden mile.",

Cut of meat was lean and not super fatty which made it super good for it price point compared to other joints. Overall exp was above decent and the set for two was filling. 10/10 would come back for the vibes and meat quality for it value! Kudos to the store helper for the service which was totally unexpected.",
