Deric Lau,5,"My son has started his lesson with Teacher Joy @ Piano Espressivo for a good 4 years now. Prior to that, he was attending Piano lesson with Yamaha and at one point, he disliked it so much that he didn’t want to attend the piano class. We didn’t see improvement in him & almost give up until we met Teacher Joy. She is a very dedicated teacher who will try her very best to nurture every child in music and piano regardless of their level of interest. Now my son has passed ABRSM grade 2 exam with “distinction, which is very unexpected results. Grateful for her teaching all these years. This shows that the child passion can be developed over time if you found a very good teacher. Thank you Teacher Joy!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107710817373897390321/reviews
