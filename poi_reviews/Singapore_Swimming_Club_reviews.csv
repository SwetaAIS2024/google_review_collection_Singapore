The club sports facilities are excellent, I’ve used the pool, tennis courts, bowling alley, and gym before.

Chong Evon,4,"Went there for the second time as my aunt is their member. The first round tried their lunch buffet. Decent taste in many varieties. This round tried their fried hokkien mee. The taste was perfect, the portion was big. But wait for my local coffee for a long time. This really needs to improve",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104133007521280423603/reviews
