Glenn Ong,5,"The store manager , Bel, is very friendly. She was patient when she taught me how to use my handphone for the digital stamp.

As compared to Gxxxxxxxx, I find there is more personal touch in this store. The friendly conversation and lively ambience makes me feel relax and enjoyable.

Thanks very much, Watson team. Keep up the good work.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106856816458022447338/reviews

Jasmine,2,"Went last week on a weekday morning 8am+, the cashier is empty so I did a self checkout, paid and I took a plastic bag to put my things, a staff suddenly came over without saying anything she took my receipt from the machine and start checking, after checking the receipt she just left it next to my item and leave. She should be checking if I have pay for the plastic bag, watson if u cannot trust your cust than pls have a staff always standing at the cashier and remove the self checkout machine. Not when I take the plastic bag a staff rush over and check the receipt, thank u.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104028378165080970080/reviews
