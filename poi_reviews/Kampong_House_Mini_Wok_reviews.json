      "text": "The sight of sliced fish served in an old-school aluminium steamboat pot is too tempting to resist.\nThe soup is savoury with lots of won bok [a.k.a. Chinese cabbage], tomatoes and tofu. However, the fried fish slices are mostly batter with just a morsel of fish meat within.\nOn the other hand, the prawn paste chicken [a.k.a. har cheong gai] is a must try here. We love the crispy golden-brown skin with juicy meat and the fermented shrimp ü¶ê paste is strong!",

Overall it‚Äôs okay, but I think it‚Äôs kind of like drinking ketchup plus chilli water , half way through, taste fatigue kicks in and you don‚Äôt feel like eating anything anymore",
