Had it patched back at Denticare again but unfortunately it also fell out the second time plus the hole became bigger from his works. If a tooth filling does not work in my case I should have been informed because I now have a bigger tooth chip with gum sensitivity when chewing. Also paid for the service to fail on me twice.",

He was friendly and professional, and clear in his explanation of my dental issues. I also appreciated how transparent they were about costs upfront.

      "text": "I had a truly disappointing experience at Denticare - Marine Parade. The nurse/receptionist who has a fuller figure, my family interacted with was incredibly rude and unprofessional. From the moment we arrived, we were met with a dismissive attitude and a complete lack of basic courtesy. When we attempted to ask questions, we were treated with impatience and condescension, which made me feel disrespected throughout the visit.\n\nWhat was even more troubling was when my mom provided her NRIC during registration. After handing back the ID, the nurse purposely cleaned her hands with rubbing alcohol in a manner that made me question whether it was meant as an unnecessary action or, more concerningly, if it was done because of our ethnicity. This behavior was uncomfortable and unsettling.\n\nIn a healthcare setting, I expect professionalism, respect, and dignity, all of which were completely lacking during this experience. I sincerely hope that the management at Denticare addresses this matter to ensure no other patient feels mistreated. Better service and respect should be the standard, not the exception.",

Each treatment was painless and most comfortable due to Dr Johari's judgement was spot on. Staff Doris was extremely intuitive when she noticed that I was sweating while waiting, she turned on the mini fan to cool me down. Upon settling the bill, she ensured that my payment amount is linked to my NTUC app to obtain the reward points. Thank you very much for the fantastic service!",
