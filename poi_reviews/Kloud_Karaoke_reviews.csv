Glueck Bermudeza,5,"Great place to have fun with your friends especially if all of you love to sing.  The prices of the beer and other drinks are within our budget range. The place is also well-maintained, you can see some attendants cleaning from time to time. Nice place to have fun",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110485628126082022916/reviews
Tony Dovaston,3,"Good karaoke place in a shopping mall.  Nice setup and easy to use web based app.  The only 2 down sides of this place other than the seriously overpriced drinks are that it has no bathroom of it's own which means you need to go out into the mall, and the rooms are not soundproof meaning you can easily be impacted by the noise from your neighbor's",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115321554810390937788/reviews
