jimmy lee,5,"A medium sized mall that offers several F&B outlets, Macdonald's, KFC, Kopitiam food court, FairPrice supermarket, a large decathlon outlet and a bus interchange. As you can see from the photos that I posted, there is not much crowd here. This is because this is a very remote area.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110518855728692358654/reviews
Ya_DudeAndrewYT,4,"I really liked this place, I didn't have high expectations for this but it was a Lot better than expected. For being so far in the West and Being surrounded with Industrial Estates, it has a Lot of Shops to go to (Fairprice Obviously but also a spread of Fast food Places). Overall, a great place to go if you live further west than Jurong East onwards if the hustle and bustle doesn't suit you! (By the way, I went in a time when it was supposed to be Lunch peak, but it was not crowded at all!)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115907873812460466955/reviews
ASMR Infinite Sounds,3,"Went there to get some groceries. Bought a bottle Melitta coffee that say buy 1 free 1. After paying at the cashier, realised that she double charged it and so went to the service counter. The staff at the service counter said i shd collect the free coffee at the service counter, which i highlighted that it was not stated in the promo label. And she remarked to me 'sui bian ni', in loosely translate language up to you! I think the level of service really need to be improved!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110799705823733805035/reviews
