Portion was also very little for $8.20 (creamy salmon pasta).\n\nHad bought the pasta from the shop before, not too sure why the quality has dropped so drastically. Perhaps due to a change of people?",

Mental note to order double portions of blanched broccoli for a healthier lunch\nOnion rings were crisp n stayed crisp until I finished the meal\nThe added sausage was huge and outstanding as it doesn't have that thick plasticky skin that many Western stalls offer\nIf the coffeeshop had better ventilation I would have given atmosphere 5 stars\nAs it was, I had to sit out the secondhand smoke throughout my entire lunch\nPaylah and cash available\nNew addition to menu - pork cutlet. Great value for money $7.50",

The coffeeshop that the stall is located at is generally quite spacious and there are seats available.\nThe ordering is done at the counter and the food was served within a short period of time.\nThe food tastes great, the chicken cutlet was definitely significantly sized.\nOverall, it is a great meal that satisfies the western food cravings!",
