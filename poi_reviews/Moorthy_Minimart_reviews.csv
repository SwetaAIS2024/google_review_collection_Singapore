May Htoo,1,The worst customer service I ever had.Need to find the item by myself in those mess up basket and not organising anything. I collected my shopee item and I met the guy who they called boss he was so ignorant man. I also met old lady and another woman all individual person have their bad personalities. OMG how they run their business with that attitude. This is un-convenience store.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109976836430706533289/reviews
Elizabeth Chow,1,"Was here for shopee self-collection. I had 9 packages, but the whole process was so messy and disorganised that I could only find 8 packages. I told the lady that I would be back for the 9th package another day since she could not find it.

The next day, I noticed the package now read ""completed"" and ""delivered"", meaning the money had already been taken. I went back for the 9th package, and to my horror, even though the package was right in front of our eyes, another Indian woman would not let me take the package as the ""pin code"" was wrong.
Of course the pin code would be ""wrong"" as the first lady had marked the packaged as completed, and could not find my package earlier on!

I highly recommend setting your pick up point for the other mini mart a few doors down. The process is a lot smoother there.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103401568104463788784/reviews
Johnson Poon,1,"was here for shopee self collection. i was quite unhappy abt the indian girl who attended  to me. she asked me for the date i bought my item, i just showed her the sms. for some reason she read 16-06-22 as the 6th?? i was collecting 2 items and after scanning the second item, she literally took my item and used it to smack another girl who i assume is her sister? (because her sister took so long to look for the second item) like hello?? THT'S MY ITEM, EVEN IF ITS NOT FRAGILE WHT IF YOU BREAK OR SPOIL IT??! when she asked me ""what did you buy?"" the old lady at the counter had to lecture her in front of me ""it's none of your business what people buy!?"" i just feel kids should not be ""helping out"" at a place of business. this girl clearly lacks the savoir faire and professionalism to facilitate smth as simple as a shopee self collection. FIRST AND LAST TIME IM PUTTING THIS MINIMART AS A PICKUP POINT. HORRIBLE.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107993336720654597752/reviews
