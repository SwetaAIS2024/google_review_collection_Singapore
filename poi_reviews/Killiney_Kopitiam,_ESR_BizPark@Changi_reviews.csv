Ravinder Singh,3,"Decent kopitiam. Fast service wven though it was quite crowded this morning at 730am. Don't really know what the hype is all about. The Nasi Lemak packs a nice spicy punch with the sambal, only wish the sambal was a little more.  The Otah / Otak packs a nice spicy taste,  to bad it was cold when i got it. The rice was just plain & lacking of the ""lemak"" taste. Kaya toast was just normal to me, and so was the half boiled eggs.

Didn't try the curry chicken & roti prata. Might do so the next time.

Coffee was really good.

Please bring your own tissues ya. They don't provide.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102719535661291383683/reviews
Ed T,3,"Coffee & Eggs were familiar and consistent, thats about it.

Couldnt taste kaya or butter in the Kaya Toast.

Fried carrot cake was so so.  Not disgusting, but overly sweet.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118071263998897226945/reviews
Grace Cong,4,"Suddenly missed the Hainanese Chicken Chop on fries at Killiney so decided to hop down to Changi. Haven't had this since before the pandemic, when I used to work in the area.

Happy to report the taste is still good as what I remember, serving still generous and chicken chop fried very nicely.

The only con is that price has increased, but I suppose that's true for most things now in Singapore. Will be back when craving strikes again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113537823141241983550/reviews
Yen Kang,1,"Ordered via delivery.
Mee Siam - no beansprout, lime stale, taupok in the sauce tasted like cardboard
Curry Chicken - the gravy is watery and lack of spices
Braised Chicken Rice - is overall BAD. And no green veg
Otak otak - is stale
All the food ordered were just so bad!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109925346954475862180/reviews
Winter Koh,2,"My wife has ordered pork chop rice and I have ordered Duo Nasi Lemak. But the above pork and chicken looks like overcooked or try the oil has been used for multiple times. My wife only eaten one quarter of the food, itâ€™s a waste. The food quality is not there. Sad and disappointed.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114763878148508312556/reviews
