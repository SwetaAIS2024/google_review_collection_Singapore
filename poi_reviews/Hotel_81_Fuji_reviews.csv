Sy 112,1,"I had a deeply frustrating experience at Hotel 81 Fuji at Balestier and would strongly advise against booking this hotel.

Other budget hotel is still better.

Upon arrival, there was confusion about the requirement for a physical IC due to a new government policy, and the staff handled it with little flexibility. Despite eventually providing my IC, the room was nothing like the photos on Agodaâ€”no window, not as clean, and far less spacious.

When I spoke to Zai and the female staff at the counter, there were conflicting instructions. Zai initially confirmed it was fine for me to register under my name, but later insisted my friend had to register as a visitor, which didnâ€™t make sense and was never communicated clearly.

This led to a heated exchange where Zai became unprofessional, raising his voice and telling me not to speak to him anymore.

When I clarify if I will get my full refund & I would like to cancel this booking. Which initially the Indian female staff offered. He continued to not answer me & tell me to directly speak to Agoda. He will not answer me.

Adding to the confusion, the female staff promised a free cancellation, but then later said there would be a one-night penalty, because we already took the keys and went into the room. which was never mentioned during check-in.

When we requested a refund, we were told to contact Agoda directly, even though the staff member had originally said she could provide a full refund immediately.

In my opinion, the staffsâ€™ communication was inconsistent, with Zai contradicting himself, and how the Indian lady was not fully transparent, the overall handling of the situation was unprofessional.

If Zai was so knowledgeable, why didnâ€™t he step in to clarify things when we were talking to the other staff?

The lack of clarity and poor customer service left me feeling dissatisfied. I would never recommend this hotel based on my experience.

Overall itâ€™s not that cheap, price really donâ€™t justify the quality of this hotel.

Book with caution. Unless your expectations is really all the way down to hell.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115695042227932112682/reviews

Wings,2,"Room is so small and difficult to accommodate for a family but can manage. The most inconvenient thing is there no any handle and racks in the wash room to keep your toiletries and other stuff.
They give only two small water bottle so please bring your own two from outside.
Clean and neat. Good for budget travelers and friends .",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113656813117470027174/reviews
