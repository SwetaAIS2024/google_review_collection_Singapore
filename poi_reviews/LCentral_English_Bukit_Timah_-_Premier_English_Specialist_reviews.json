The classes size are small too.\n\nMy younger son who is mischievous and inattentive, had became proactive in doing his homework every week.\n\nMy elder one will be completing his reading program before he starts P1 next year. I can foresee that he will be able to cope with the spelling tests and excel.",

Classes are small groups, where the teacher focuses more on the students, and the teacher provides detailed feedback on the day. Center staff also pay a lot of attention to student management.\n\nIn particular, during a difficult time due to the corona virus this year, the center provided excellent online classes so that there would be no gaps in the classes.\n\nAs I watch my child's skills grow step by step, I express my warm gratitude to both teachers and staff.",
