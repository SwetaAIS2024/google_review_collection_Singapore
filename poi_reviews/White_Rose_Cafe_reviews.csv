Zozo,5,"Came for the Penang Hawkers' Fare.

From the tangy, spicy goodness of Penang Laksa to the savory delight of Oyster Omelette and Penang Prawn Mee, every dish is made Ã  la minute. But thatâ€™s not allâ€”watch in awe as hawkers work their magic before your very eyes. Marvel at the sizzling sounds and aromatic clouds of steam as they fry up Char Kway Teow, whip up crispy Roti Canai, and assemble the perfect plate of Pasembur.

Lastly, a big shoutout to all the staffs at Penang Hawkersâ€™ Fare! Despite the place being so crowded, their service was absolutely top-notch, making our dining experience even better. all the dishes we tried were fantastic especially the Char Kway Teow, Penang Rojak, Roti Canai, Pasembur, Oyster Omelette, Penang Laksa, and Cuttlefish Kang Kong. Truly enjoyed every bite!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109173464175521287422/reviews
Bian Lee,4,"Our party of 18 had the ala carte buffet for lunch. We ordered all the dishes on the first order to try out all. The food was served piping hot and most are tasty. We particularly love the curry fish head with lots of ladies fingers and a big fish head that is fresh. Love the spices used in the curry. We also enjoyed the long beans, fried fish, chicken roll and sambal squih. There were many choices for desserts, the Cheng ting and chendol topped the list. Itâ€™s a quiet place for small talks and catch up besides the good food and good service",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106963842817729813226/reviews

Jenny P C Quek,1,"Rose Cafe York Hotel

5 of us were at lunch at Rose Cafe on Feb 23 @11am.
We decided that having 5 buffet was too much so we went ahead to check the ala carte menu, since a very polite male wait staff told us that it was not possible to share buffet with ala carte on same table.
This male wait staff (didn't get his name though) apparently came back and offered 2 buffet and 3 ala carte for our table.
We asked if it was ok for us to even share the buffet & the answer was an emphatic *YES*.
When we were finally having our desserts, 2 of us wanted another 2 orders of ice kacang & the male wait staff took our orders.
He apparently went to check with the female team leader n came back to say that we may NOT have any more dessert. We asked but couldn't get the definition of ""buffet"" practised by Rose Cafe.
I reminded him that in the beginning, he had agreed to us sharing the buffet.
If repeated orders of desserts were not possible, we should have been told from the beginning.
Would the General Manager of York Hotel care to explain what ""buffet to share"" is at Rose Cafe please? I would really like to hear from you so that we will not make the same mistake of interpreting what the word 'buffet' means.

*On the side note, we would like to thank the very polite male wait staff for his gentle, professional and accommodating attitude towards us*.
I am sure you are able to find out who this gentleman is from the date and time of our meal.

Thank you / Jenny",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106169253028481289012/reviews
