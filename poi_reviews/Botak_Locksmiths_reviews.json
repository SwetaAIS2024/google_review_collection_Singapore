      "text": "Huge thanks to Mr. Robert! He was incredibly responsive and came all the way to unlock my bathroom door. What a dramatic day—my wife and I got stuck inside the toilet around 6AM++, had to climb out through the window, enter the house through the kitchen, and then call for a locksmith. Mr. Robert arrived within 30 minutes, just as he promised over the phone. Truly a lifesaver!",

He was very professional and did his best to minimise the damage to the existing door handle & lock so that we wouldn’t have to pay an exorbitant price to change unnecessarily. Appreciate his helpfulness and tips in maintaining the door handles!",

Has a quick call explaining my situation then Robert was able to give a quick quote and an ETA. ~$70 for unlocking, varies according to how far your place and the type of lock. Terence came by promptly and fixed it, explaining to me what he was doing along the way and what he thought the problem was. He even explained in Hokkien to grandma! Friendly guy Terence!",
