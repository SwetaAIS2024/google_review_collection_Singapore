      "text": "Do note their closing time is 1045pm (pasted on their door) doesn't mean you can enter after 10pm. Visited this outlet on 12 Dec 2024 with 2 of my friends at 10:15pm. The female staff who was mopping the floor stared at us as soon as we walked in. My friends and I were trying to grab some snacks since most F&B outlets were closed. The lady started to make louder noise while cleaning up and switched off the fridge lights. We didn't buy anything since we can tell the staff did not welcome us and the other customers. They do their closing half an hour earlier and will give you bad attitude if you try to purchase things.",

My wife will pay whenever we are out together. This Chinese male cashier put me down by saying to my wife that man should pay, in the view of Public. What got to do with him and does he know me?? Furthermore, he was argumentative. All my money are kept with my wife. I don't keep any money. He spoiled my NDP. Cheers must warn him not to speak unnecessarily.",

The worker, a young lady, rudely grabbed my item and scanned it and snatched my card from my hand to pay for the item. She then very rudely pointed to the self checkout board and read it out loudly. This is very disappointing.",

Your cashier served the lady in front of me first and when he's done serving her, he motioned to the person behind me instead of me. So I naturally went over since it is rightfully my turn.\n\nHowever, during payment, he then questioned me if I actually queued and I said yes. Then he proceeded to say that he didn't see me and imply that I cut the queue.\n\nI told tell him that I queued all the way and was behind the ladyâ€” he is the one who did not see me.\n\nPlease train your staff and educate him on how to provide good customer service and not let a rotton apple tarnish the outlet/brand as a whole.\n\nPS that one star is for another staff of yours who's being helpful and polite to me today.",
