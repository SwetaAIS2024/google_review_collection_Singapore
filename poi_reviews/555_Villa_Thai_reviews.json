I went on Sunday and I love this band! The chicken wings are crispy and delicious. I love this Tom Yam mama seafood pot.",

There is a fried porridge stall which looks like a zichar stall.\n\nNote there is live band at 630 to 930pm. There was also a group of active seniors dancing away when we were there. Music is of course very loud and we just enjoyed the food without chatting.",

The fried kang kong was an interesting twist to the usual sambal kang kong. The fried vegetable itself was rather tasteless. Hence, youâ€™ll need to eat it with the dipping sauce served on the side. Omelette minced pork has the good amount of fluff and eggy goodness.",
