The service was good; they even gave alternative recommendations when certain dishes weren't available. And if the food we order is a lot they will advise. l didn't know their potion is surprisingly large.",

The pork chop was a little bit tough but still yummy. The garlic truffle fries was a generous portion of fragrant goodness.\nOverall, a meal with a view and happy atmosphere :)",

      "text": "Visited Marina Bistro with my family over the weekend. I used to come here occasionally when I lived in the West, but it had been a long time since my last visit. This time, I came not just for the restaurant but also for a drive around the scenic marina area. Now, visiting as a husband and father, it felt quite nostalgic.\n\nWe arrived around lunchtime and enjoyed a great meal under beautiful weather. We ended up ordering a bit too much, but my son loved the food and had fun following the robot server around. The staff were consistently friendly and especially kind to children, which we really appreciated.\n\nThe food itself isn’t particularly unique, but it offers good value for money. The portions are generous, and there’s a nice variety of local dishes. It’s a great spot to drive out of the city for a relaxed meal. Would definitely visit again!",

The two beers, tiger was fantastic and fresh. The Edinger dark was not right, sour  tast. The restaurant later mentioned the barrel has been two days.\n\nI need to start developing a new checklist to ask, e.g., the freshness of the draft before ordering (also recommended to you :-). It would be good to offer me discount or replacement of the non fresh, even I asked for. Service and food rate can go higher with these considerations.\n\nReally nice and fresh draft Tiger beer.",
