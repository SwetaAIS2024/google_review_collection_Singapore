Abba‚Äôs was recommended by a close friend, and we are glad we went with the recommendation.\n\nThe owners were very friendly and helpful with suggestions. I must add that the owner managed to convince my brother to opt for a burgundy lining which made the end product look sharp yet stylishüëåüèº They also assisted to expedite the suit making given my brother‚Äôs short departure date.\n\nMy brother left feeling very happy and satisfied with the whole experience, and I‚Äôm certain he will be back for his future suits tooüëçüèº",

      "text": "DO NOT BUY ANYTHING HERE, there are far better stores with similar prices in Singapore. I bought a suit here and this is my experience: The owner is very pushy and will try to push as many items on you as possible. He's very good at that. Since you're most likely a gullible tourist lured in by the promise of a tailored suit for a low price, he doesn't care if you like the result or not. Also he will make you pay in advance, which is fishy at best. Never happened to me with other tailors.\n\nMy suit didn't fit correctly the first time and he tried to make me believe that it was fine (it was far too small). That never happened to me with other tailors. A final fitting is the standard.\n\nThe presented fabrics are mediocre at best. I wore my suit five times now and the fabric is already deteriorating. For that price you can get better fabrics, eg at Mohan.\n\nI have already redone two seams and a button. After five days of wearing that suit.\n\nIf you want to get ripped off, buy here. Else, look up trustworthy tailors on Google.",

The moment I stepped into this shop\nI was warmly greeted by \"Jimmy\" the proprietor. He takes tremendous pride in his work and it shows through his customer service and quality of the finished product. My request was easily fulfilled within extremely short notice of 1 week. Expect to be shown 6 different shades of black broadcloth that's indiscernible to a customer like myself. There are sooooo many options to choose from, but you can trust him to help you find what's best \"suited\" for your needs.\n\nSupport local independent small businesses whenever possible.",
