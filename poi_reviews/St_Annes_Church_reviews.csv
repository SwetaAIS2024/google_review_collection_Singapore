Zona Felice,5,"St Anne's Church is a beautiful and peaceful place! What makes this place extra special is the warmth and dedication of the priests. His kindness, wisdom, and heartfelt sermons leave a lasting impression on everyone who attends. Every prayer session feels deeply spiritual, and there‚Äôs a strong focus on connecting with Jesus through heartfelt prayers and hymns. It‚Äôs the perfect place to find peace, strengthen your faith, and feel the presence of the Lord. If you‚Äôre looking for a church where you can grow spiritually and experience true devotion to Jesus, St Anne‚Äôs is the place to be! Highly recommend! üôè",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103286545440105926554/reviews
Kat C,5,"The church is clean and cool. Air conditioning works great. It's also big, could probably accommodate hundreds in one mass. Sometimes though, they try to squeeze people on the first floor before allowing people upstairs, which could already be during the mass. Priests make good homily. The choir groups, since they're different every mass, are good and their music is heavenly.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108131097069901450874/reviews

jimmy lee,4,"Built in 1963, St Anne's Church is a typical local parish Catholic Church that is located just 2 bus stops away from Sengkang MRT station. Convenient for those who stay nearby. Weekday mass singing is surprisingly good compared to other parish churches.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110518855728692358654/reviews
Marcus Tsai,2,"St. Anne's Church is a modest yet functional place of worship, offering a space for quiet reflection and community gatherings. The church‚Äôs interior is simple but serviceable, with adequate seating and decor that is unremarkable yet maintains a solemn atmosphere. While it doesn‚Äôt boast the grandeur of larger, more ornate churches, its understated design allows for a focus on prayer and worship. The acoustics are decent, ensuring that sermons and choir performances are heard clearly by the congregation.

However, my experience with the altar server training program left much to be desired. The trainers lacked the warmth and patience one would expect in a church setting. Their approach came across as overly strict and, at times, dismissive, which could be discouraging for younger participants. While I understand the importance of discipline and attention to detail in such roles, the trainers‚Äô attitude could benefit from a touch of kindness and encouragement to make the process more welcoming.

Overall, St. Anne‚Äôs serves its purpose as a community church, but there is room for improvement in how its volunteers and trainees are treated. With a few adjustments in attitude, it could foster a more inclusive and uplifting environment for its members.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108750866791936933469/reviews
