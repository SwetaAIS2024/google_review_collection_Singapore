Yan,2,"Kinda thought for once, since the prices for every dish is clearly stated, the stall won’t anyhow charge. Unfortunately no. The price of this plate of 2 dishes I ordered without rice should be exactly $3.30. Fella tried to charge me $4.50. After asking him about it, he tried to say it’s because he gave me a bit more meat then proceeds to remove meat from what was already a small portion, then changed the price to be $3.50, insisting it is $3.50 because I didn’t want rice. But rice was clearly stated to be a separate item price on the pricing board. Oh wells…
Taste wise, not bad but can’t stand dishonest cai fan stalls so probably never again ;( unsolicited advice but if you are planning to be dishonest maybe just have the prices up on the board haha…",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117928612654810910499/reviews
Jack,3,"This cai png or economical rice stall has a large variety of dishes. Food was also freshly prepared. The lemon chicken was quite good of this lot, very tender and juicy.
