Vincent N,5,"Really a hidden gem that I finally got to try. As a self-professed handmade fishball noodles fan, I would say this definitely caught my attention. When the noodles arrived, the portion looked generous and the ingredients clearly handmade. The fishballs were on the chewy side, with more bite than I expected. My personal preference was for a smoother and more tender type of fishballs, so this was slightly unexpected. However, I would still definitely recommend this place as on the overall, this bowl of noodles is hearty, and one hell of a flavour bomb.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110317899711198965848/reviews
Leonard Chong,5,"Dinner dated 28 March 2025.
One of the better ones I have had so far within Singapore..
Everything were big sized.
The fish dumplings won over my taste palate completely.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101585984216350252104/reviews
Bryan Tay,4,"The fish ball noodles served were pretty tasty. The ingredients were ""big"" and filling. Noodles were well done and really have a good texture. If I visit this noodles shop again, I will request lesser pork lard in my fish ball soup as it really makes the soup very oily. By the way, the soup was tasty without the pork lard ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106836086325330248925/reviews
Alexander Reinaldo,5,"Generous portion of noodle (mee pok) with small, medium and large size variety. Really recommend the fish dumpling, fish ball and fish rou add ons. Though there is no Aircon, it was quite cooling when we came around 11am. Thanks for bringing this food to our neighbourhood! (Simple appreciation at the last photo!)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108446373348289716691/reviews
