Jonathan Foong,3,"Itâ€™s okay,  not the best place for a driving range but gets the work done.

Itâ€™s definitely different from other driving range, as ur shooting ur ball in to the net rather than grass.
Different feels.

Usually quite packed, and very unlikely u will be able to use their ball tracker, itâ€™s always taken.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117861101933605612241/reviews
Arturo Xue,4,"My humble opinion. Staffs were friendly & helpful if you appeared friendly to them. A great place to come for practices. Ample parking space (can be hot because it is uncovered). Reasonable costs for practice balls (not the cheapest though). You can get a bay most of the time during weekdays. However, the situation can be very different during weekends. Overall, I enjoyed the facilities very much. If you are staying around Bedok, Simei, etc, this is an ideal place to practice your golf swing. Last but not least, the bistro on level 4 is a great place to have a beer & unwind after your practice.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115811763776882357711/reviews

Kim Chan,4,"Lots of parking and convenient if you live on the East Coast. The multi-level or high-rise driving is a great idea, but once the novelty wears off, there's nothing new. The high-rise arrangement with the nets at the bottom to catch the golf balls makes it difficult to judge the distance of your strike. The cost is higher than Marine Bay Driving Range, which charges $3.00 for 75 balls between 700am and 1200 noon. Sky Range charges $2.22 for 25 balls. The uncle behind the desk was very friendly and gave me instructions on how to use the store value card to obtain practice balls. Good experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107011124082367604946/reviews
Jaâ€™ Afar,1,"Poor customer service at the front deskâ€”staff were unhelpful and rude, using hand gestures instead of communicating properly. Extremely frustrating experience.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108745316053496701550/reviews
