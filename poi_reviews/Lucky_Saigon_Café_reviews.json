      "text": "Interesting nature theme Vietnamese restaurant well hidden in Tanglin.\nMisty entrance to welcome you.\nPet friendly, sheltered outdoors, with high ceiling fans. Might get warm if it’s hot weather so dress lightly.\nFood is not bad, with quite an extensive range of drinks.\nThere is a high pitch sound that is at the background. Those with sensitive ears might find it disturbing.",

      "text": "A hidden away cafe. I like the place for the unique experience it offers but it was unpleasant because firstly there was a constant high pitch noisy which we feedback but staff didn't know how to solve, secondly while it is excited to have peacock and chicken in cages, the smell was overwhelmingly strong. When I reached the entrance I could smell it. Even though the smell wasn't at the dining area, it is still an unpleasant experience to smell it on entry.\n\nWe like the fried fish ordered and the ability to wrap fresh spring roll sheet with veg to eat it. Quite nice.",

      "text": "This Vietnamese restaurant nestled in a compound off quiet Tanglin Road that also housed a plant nursery and Salvation Army Collection Centre.\nThe Place\nIt looks like an ornamental plants sale room, with pots of hanging plants, complete with fake stream, wooden fences and a wooden bridge.  The alfresco restaurant also try to give a rural vibe - walked behind it, you will chance upon a hugh cage housing some chicken, a turkey and some birds. There is also a fish pond.\nThe Food\nCrab Soup - tasted quite savoury with bits of crab meat, but lacking in robustness.\nDry Seafood Glass Noodles - the noodle was rather too 'al-dente' for me, and lacking in flavour. The beef pho I have tried on a previous visit was better, but also not outstanding.\nThe Verdict\nVisit the place for the experience (if you like an artificial countryside vide, and need a quiet place to chill), but not for the food.",
