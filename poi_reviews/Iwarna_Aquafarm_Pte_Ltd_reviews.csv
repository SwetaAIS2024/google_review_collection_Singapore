ต้นอ้อ รีวิว,5,"I always love visiting Iwarna Farm! They have such a wide range of unique livestock, beautiful corals and rare healthy fishes to choose from.
Their marine fishes are very well quarantined, which really gives them a better chance of thriving once you bring them home.
They also offer seawater and RODI water for sale, with convenient delivery and maintenance services right to your doorstep. Super convenient!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107040153804960569377/reviews

HB ONG,5,"Recently restarted my Marine Tank hobby after resting for more than 10 years. Today my first visit to Iwarna aqua farm. Great variety, value for money and quality marine fishes, invertebrates and corals. Bought 14 bags of the above and still feel that I wanted to buy many more LOL.  Bought Harlequin Shrimp pair, Sexy Shrimps, Bumblebee Shrimps, Royal Gamma, Kole Tang, Blur Tang, anemone, worm etc etc etc. Enjoyed today’s special 20% discounts.  :) Also very happy with the fantastic service provided by Zheng Xi and the staff. Sure deserves a 5-star rating.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103698741710896518792/reviews
