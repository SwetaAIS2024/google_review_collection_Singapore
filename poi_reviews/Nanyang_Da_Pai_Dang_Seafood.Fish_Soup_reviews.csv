Felicia (Projectdreamz),5,"Been here a few times and find the taste is very good.
Fish soup - fish slices are very fresh but soup is too salty. The chili is good. Ideal if can add other vege too.
Zichar - minced pork tofu, honey pork, prawn paste chicken all delicious.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107026370846754217623/reviews
Low Bao Heng,4,First time at this new coffeeshop (FoodHub). Had this salted egg diced chicken rice with egg from Mata Thai. Not bad. $7 pretty reasonable like the usual Tze char stall. üòÄüëçüèº,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108033403024309465290/reviews
AL Tan,5,"Shop was originally Mata Thai but just changed to Nanyang Fish Soup few weeks back.

Zzz,1,"Recently moved to woodland glen. A place to avoid at all cost. They'd rip you off your money. There are better stall to spend and eat tasty dishes from. They charge exorbitant prices for dishes. Daylight robbery. Preferred the old stall before this stall came about. Also, please teach your  china workers in the stall counter  basic Engrish. All don't know English; tortuous for my multi racial fellow citizens. üôÑü´®",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116853706466480288237/reviews
Choo Hua,1,check out the seafood fried rice i have- the squids are miniscule and countable on this plate of rice. shocked at the sight of it and taste even worse as the squid are added on as an after thought- it tastes cold ‚ùÑÔ∏è this stall should just shut down for good,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104708244885573386896/reviews
