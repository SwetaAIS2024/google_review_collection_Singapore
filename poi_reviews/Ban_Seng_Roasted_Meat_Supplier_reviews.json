      "text": "[Mixbag]\n\nDon't come here if you want to get good food, come here for a surprise.\n\nUsually, my order would be the roast pork char siew noodles. At $4, I would say the noodles are quite lovely but the portion is so-so. What makes this actually decent is that the uncle serves a big bowl of salted veg duck soup- that itself is worth $3+ in some places. But, its not a menu item.\n\nIssue is, while $4 for noodles and that generous and amazing portion of soup is super worth it, the converse is that the noodles come without the soup. At $4, you suddenly feel shortchanged as the portion definitely is measly at the price. Well, you ask the uncle for soup and, well, he doesn't give it to you cause its not a menu item.\n\nThe roasted meats on its own are nice, but portion wise is on the smaller end. The thing about the uncle and the shop in general is that your meal can go so many ways. It's as if this is his side hustle. Smoking, going to the toilet, not free are reasons for me having to order somewhere else for my meal. Also, the soup is not a guarantee.\n\nI've hypothesized that he prefers girls more - you should see the portion of my roast pork and that of my sister's. Also, the higher the voice the better.\n\nTake it from me - go here if you want to be surprised. I've had my meal here and felt that it was the most worth it meal for $4, and I've had the same meal here wishing I ordered something else.",

My friend drank a bit and realised it after finishing half her meal. Fortunately, they give the soup for free. However, the lack of hygiene is still unacceptable. NEA if you see this, you might want to review their hygiene grade.",

What I like best is that it was not coloured and tasted nice, not overly sweet. The rice was cooked decently with a good al-dente texture and grain was not broken. Sauce was good, again not too sweet.\nAccepts PayLah & CDC vouchers.",
