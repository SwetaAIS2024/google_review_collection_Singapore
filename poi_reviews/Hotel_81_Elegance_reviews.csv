Mega Ayuningrum,4,"No bidet but shower is close to the toilet seat so you can use shower after having business. Budget hotel where hotel water doesn't exist, super cold since using central AC and it's not controllable by remote so you can contact receptionist to change the setting. For budget hotel it's okay, near local food stall and many choices of culinary. Close only 500m from MRT and bus station nearby.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110948480341396764156/reviews
mamamo Gerky,3,"Overall, it’s not too bad. The room appears to have been cleaned, but not very thoroughly. The mirrors seem like they haven’t been wiped in a long time. On the bright side, the room provides a hairdryer. However, the sink is leaking, and every time it’s used, water seeps out. This should be improved. The location is relatively far but not too far from the bus stop. There are plenty of food options available. Most importantly, there are no bed bugs.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110277123750646262214/reviews
Jyeo Teow Hee,2,"This hotel 81 Elegance at Foch Road is an old hotel using keys to open the rooms instead of using a key card to scan. Rooms are very small, it's for a single to two adults,  average size.
Had been going to this hotel 81 Elegance for a year but I did not know that this hotel 81 has poor cleaning hygiene habits. On zhe 6th February 2025, I accidentally saw one of their male cleaner, an old male staff in the midst of cleaning a used rooms after the guests had left. He was using the used bath towels as a mop clothes and using the bath towel to scooped up dirts and human hairs from the room floor and scooped up to throw the dirt and human hairs into a bin at his cleaning cart. Wahlau! Just imagine those used bath towels were collecting germ  and bacteria, even the used bath towels were sent to a laundry contractor, germs and bacteria will still remain after the washing had been done. There is a hygiene laps in their cleaners.  I reported this find at their front desk counter. I do not know whether this hotel 81 management will do the enforcement or not. Covid 19 virus is still around   but this form of cleaning in a guest room is not exceptable.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117955834511396165585/reviews
Chiranjeev Singh,1,"The Good - The staff is friendly and helpful. The location is great as it has a couple of bus stops and train stations in walking distance. There are various restaurants around the hotel as well.

The Bad - The room is tiny just enough for a bed. The bathroom had a strong MOLDY smell, with actual patches of mold growing (refer images). The Thermostat was either broken or not-controllable from room, as no matter how much I increased the temperature manually, or called reception to make it warmer, the room was always colder than 21°C - unbearably cold, especially after you come back wet from the rain.

Choose this hotel if on a budget or if you need to be in this locality.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110804804950753931258/reviews
Priyanka Palit,2,"Room was v v small. No closet. No space to keep your luggage.
The bathroom was v small. One thing we did not like was that drinking water faucet was connected to the tap in the bathroom washbasin which was v v near to the commode. The hanger for clothes in the washroom was right above the toilet seat. So if anything slipped from the hanger, it would fall directly into the toilet.
One thing that particularly irked me was that housekeeping used bath towels to wipe the bathroom floor and toilet seat.
The location is a bug plus with bus stops and MTR closeby.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117695343012290803380/reviews
