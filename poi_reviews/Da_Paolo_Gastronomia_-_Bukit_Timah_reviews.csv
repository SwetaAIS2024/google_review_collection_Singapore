Daniel Bok,4,"Another shop we popped by to grab some food and coffee for a picnic. The buns are okay, but the selections they have is quite amazing (especially for breakfast).

Sonal Sathe,4,"Had some desserts last night, were too good! The valrhona chocolate one and the hazelnut one, both were yum :)
