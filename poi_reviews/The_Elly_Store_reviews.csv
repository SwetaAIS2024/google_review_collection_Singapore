Joi Yeo,5,Went to the Elly store to purchase some jellycats and Clarabelle was super helpful and very nice. She helped me check if there were any new stock left or if there were some other bird jellycats apart from the ones I bought. Will definitely come back here again if I need toys. Thank you so much once again Clarabelle for your help ðŸ˜Š,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117478995946190184174/reviews
Olivia Sim,5,"I recently visited The Elly store with my children to find their new shoes. Jiemin provided exceptional service, demonstrating remarkable patience despite the crowded store. She expertly recommended the perfect fits for my kids. We left the store delighted with two new pairs of shoes and a stunning mermaid sequin cape, which Jiemin kindly offered to get a new one from the stockroom. Her outstanding service made our shopping experience truly enjoyable!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108352858647482298439/reviews
Qing Yan Chen,5,"My dress came torn. From the attached picture, we can see that the stitching is poorly done and did not 'take' enough of the fabric, which is very very thin. Realized it was torn when I unpacked - I have not worn it at all, not even to try it out. Very disappointed as we had bought matching sets for dad and baby, and we were planning to wear them for her first birthday. I don't think I can even mend it since the fabric is super thin and looks like it will tear easily.

Edited the review because of the amazing service recovery. Thanks for the exchange and patience!",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109954846416209178367/reviews
Danielle Chua,5,"The staff were exceptionally sweet and considerate. From the moment I stepped into the store, I was greeted warmly, making me feel instantly welcomed. After selecting my item, one of the staff members promptly guided me to the checkout with a kind demeanor. The lady handling my purchase was particularly gentle, thoughtfully adding a double-sided tape to seal my bag, yet leaving the non-stick side on so I could personalise my card. The other staff member provided clear and thorough instructions on how to care for my purchase. Overall, the experience was not only warm but also incredibly calming, leaving me with a lasting impression of their exceptional service.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102628139941812453639/reviews
MF,5,"We recently ordered a personalised hamper for one of our staff who just had a beautiful baby Boy. Special
Shout-out to Daion who we liaised with, he was able to pick out practical gifts and also really cute ones which the mother really loved (monogrammed jellycat bunny.) Overall, it was a pleasant and speedy experience ;)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104632706505616237575/reviews
