Really neat and systematic structure, and I doubt you will struggle with finding anything‚Äî everything is well labelled and classified into clear sections! They are pretty well stocked and even have a whole breakfast section. It‚Äôs huge, but still not as big as the NTUC in Vivo City.",

If you want to close the counter, just close it after the sale, don't let users have the responsibility to tell those queueing behind them that it will be closed. It is easily missed and not the user's job. Complete waste of time queuing for nothing.\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous. The person that came up with this should have the karma of being stuck in a immigration queue which closes just before the their turn",
