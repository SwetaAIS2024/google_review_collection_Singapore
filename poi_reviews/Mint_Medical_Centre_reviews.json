      "text": "I want to thank Dr Dora.  I am from Canada and was visiting Singapore with my family.  Started having fever the first day in Singapore, I just searched Google for a nearby clinic.  Made appointment arrived on time and there was no wait, the previous patient is just paying at the counter.  The timing was very well managed. I was then asked see Dr Dora.  She is very patient and calm.  She asked me to take Covid,flu test.  It was Flu A.  I told her my travelling plans as I will visit Tokyo after with 3 kids.  She gave me an antiviral pill ensured it will be effective within 2 days.  She checked me thoroughly and made me feel relieved.  Thank you so much and I was well and continued my trip.",

      "text": "Unpleasant counter staff! Called the clinic at 9am this morning to ask if I can do a walk in as my child is unwell (she could hear my child crying in the background). She said I could come in and I said I would take about 20 mins to reach. She said I can either come in at 9am or the next appointment slot is 10.20am. I'm really unsure how I'm supposed to get there at 9am when I called in at 9am right when they opened. This is a kids clinic and it's appalling to see how they are not thoughtful at all!",
