Met the old venerable who is burning some joss paper. Unfortunately I couldn’t understand Mandarin. People walking pass the temple will bow and pray towards the statue of Kuan Yin with kids by the side on the right side of the temple. Featuring by the background, the minaret of Al-Iman mosque and the setting of the moon in the morning.",
