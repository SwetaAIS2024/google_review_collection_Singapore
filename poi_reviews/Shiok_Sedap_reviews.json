I did ask again if I hear wrongly with probably 1 otah considered a meat dish.\nBut yes $6.40.\nRecommendations would be put pricing on the dishes to avoid misunderstanding.\nTaste as per normal beehoon. Do see the stall properly b4 you visit.",

The curry chicken, Ayam penyat, beef rendang, begedail, fried taukwa with tempeh are all very good.\n\nThe pricing is reasonable. The curry chicken drumstick, begedail, fried taukwa with tempeh and turmeric rice comes up to $6.70.\n\nDo give this place a try",

      "text": "At a friend's recommendation, I went to this nasi padang stall at Dover Crescent. It's near to a bus stop which makes it easy to get there. Me and my BFF ordered 3 dishes each for our nasi padang. Love the tender beef rendang and succulent chili sotong. We also ordered two vegetables each - I liked the eggplant and the spinach. I find the bitter gourd a bit cooked for my taste (maybe I just like it a bit green) ... my BFF thought the sambal egg was a tad sweet for her taste bud - I guess everyone has different palate. üòÑüòÑüòÑ\nOh, we also bought kueh (yes, they sell nyonya kueh too) ...the sweetness of the kueh was just right ....and it's soft and chewy...",
