      "text": "First time checking out this dog friendly cafe with our Cavapoo. Nice decor with stuffed toys and a small enclosed garden for dogs to run around in. Unfortunately it rained before we went so our dog was not keen to explore.\nFoodwise, as I'm lactose intolerant, the choice was narrow. Also the menu was in a  small faded font which we couldn't read. Had to take photos and enlarge. Tried to find the menu online but not successful.\nMy single burger (no cheese) was covered with lots of sauces. Overall nice but I reacted badly to some ingredient and was spinning after half a burger. I do react to MSG or additives so could be 1 or the other.\nHubby had the cream spaghetti with chicken which he declared good.\nThe lady boss offered chicken liver treats to dogs but we didn't try as our dog has a sensitive stomach. The dog at the next time was very happy with it. In fact the white Spitz also had a dog meal which he finished in no time. Looked very healthy with fruits etc.\nFor the chill vibe, we may go again to have drinks and let the dog make friends, especially in sunny weather.\nOtherwise, won't make a special trip up Phoenix Park.",
