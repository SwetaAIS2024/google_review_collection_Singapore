Muhammad Nazri,5,I attended the Agape JW Parents' Day X SSDB event and had a great time. The event was well-organized and engaging. I especially liked the zumba dance session for the kids and the games we participated in together. It really strengthened our bond with the school community. I'm looking forward to more events like this in the future!,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108555855156685033134/reviews
