Kef Low,4,"Ordered the $6 fried hokkien prawn mee. Taste is ok, would give a rating of 3 star, given 4 star is because of the extra prawn soup which normally not available in so many hokkien mee  stall i'd eaten.

2 good size prawns with squid and pork belly. The fried lard is crispy and a bit salty to my liking. Portion is ok, not to little.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107955224785853922261/reviews

paulin phang,5,"I recently dined at Six Avenue Porky Prawn Noodle, and it was a fantastic experience! The variety of dishes they offer is impressive. I tried their signature prawn noodle, which was delicious, with perfectly cooked prawns in a rich and flavorful broth. The pig liver and kidney mee sua was also exceptional, with tender meat and silky noodles. The solo porky prawn noodle was another highlight, boasting a great balance of flavors. We also enjoyed the traditional fried Hokkien mee, which was loaded with seafood and pork goodness.
The broth is simmered for 14 hours, and it truly shows in the depth of flavor.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117115006801951626028/reviews
Mark Koh,3,"Second time buying noodles from this stall.
First time I tried their prawn mee soup.
This time round I tried their fried Hokkien mee. Prawn, other ingredients are quite fresh. The broth is also quite power. Some wok hei. What lacking is that the noodles did not absorbed enough of the broth. Chef should have stew the noodles with the broth slightly longer. Need not be so soupy, after the noodles absorbed the broth it will be slightly dryer but is ok.
Stall owner that read this may want to consider my suggestion and after the improvement may want invite me back for tasting.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104379740216436886242/reviews
Claudia xuan,5,"One of the better prawn noodle and HKM found in Sengkang area. Hokkien mee soaked up the zhup, quite tasty, paired with the chilli for more flavour. Both prawn mee & hokkien mee has alot of ingredients and broth够味. As pork heart ran out, staff kindly informed and told that he will replace with other ingredients.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102342605769118777419/reviews
