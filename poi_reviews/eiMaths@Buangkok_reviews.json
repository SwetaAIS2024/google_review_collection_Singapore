      "text": "I'm really glad I decided to send my kids to eiMaths @ Buangkok. Teacher Lyn is such a caring and patient teacher. She really goes the extra mile in ensuring that my kids understand the Maths syllabus. She constantly encourages them, and will even provide additional classes to help them catch up on their studies. She also regularly provides student updates after lessons so I know how my kids are progressing. Additionally, the lesson books that eiMaths uses are unique and really challenges students to think and see things from a different perspective. It is unlike other Maths assessment books I have used. I highly recommend eiMaths to other parents looking to support their kids in their Maths studies.",

Earlier he went to MPM class but we find this more suitable because it follows MOE syllabus. Teacher Lyn is very jovial and helpful. My son always looks forward to going to this class. Highly recommended.",
