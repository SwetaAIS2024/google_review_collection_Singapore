      "text": "I had an appointment for a scope. I thought it was a seamless process since I have my personal insurance (foreigner), and I already acquired PRE-AUTHORIZATION letter from the insurance company. I thought I will just need to do my scope then pay the 5% copayment, get the result and some of the documents then done.\n\nIt was a horrible experience from the front desk (I forgot the name but starts with letter G, indian lady). In the beginning she asked me about the Letter  of Guarantee (LOG). I already told her that I have the Pre-Authorization letter from AIA then I asked her if she wants to see as I have a soft copy (screenshot). She replied she doesn't need it as she only needs the Letter of Guarantee (LOG) from the COMPANY where I am working and not from the INSURANCE COMPANY who will actually settle my bill.  I was quite amused as Pre-Authorization >> Letter of Guarantee >> Seamless admission without payment. Isn't the process? Then afterwards she asked me to forward to their email address so I forwarded the screenshot because I have a pdf with password (view file only) on my phone. She replied that she cannot open the file that I sent her because they can only open the PDF file. I'm not so sure about how true her words are but since I don't want to argue I just paid in full.\n\nInitially when she's telling me about LOG she was like agitated also then when she asked us to give her a review, she became very nice.\n\nWhy am I very upset? It's because the system from one department to another are all messed up. They also don't know from which department they should get the information about a patient. They keep on pushing the responsibility to another. Last but not the least, Insurance companies have mutual agreement with hospitals. Hence, acquiring pre-authorization letter from insurance company or letter of guarantee should either way be both accepted. They cannot deny one just because you dont have another one or vice versa.\n\nImagine if I don't have cash/money which is over 2k to go there because I'm expecting the pre-authorization letter to take effect but the front desk declined then my fasting, effort, time will all be wasted.\n\nThis is just an awareness especially for foreign employees who are working very hard. As for SGH, pls educate your staff for the proper process handling, endorsements and system flow if any modification, adendum, or eratum.\n\nMedical team is good and reliable!",
