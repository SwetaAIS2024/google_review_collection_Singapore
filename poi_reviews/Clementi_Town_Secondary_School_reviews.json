As a student graduating this year from this school, I can confirm that the school includes many holistic development activities. One of which stands out to me is the \"end of term cohort activities\" like \"CT got talent\" at the end of terms 1,2 and 4, which shapes a child, by providing them with knowledge on the arts and understanding of things outside of academic lesson. I am the 2nd generation of my family to be in this school (Clementi Town Secondary School is a pretty new school), and I definitely feel very blessed to have spent my past 4 years of education here.",

It's about developing good communication skills.\n\nBecause they may grow up to be cowards who are unable to voice frustrations directly, and so resort to dropping sly hints to harass people.\n\nEven worse, they may get children to drop sly hints on their behalf.  And pass on this negative character trait.",
