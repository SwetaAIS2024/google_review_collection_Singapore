Admin Enquires,1,"My family, including my uncles, aunties, and relatives, have been patients of Doctor Sarina since her employment at Saudara Clinic. During her tenure at Saudara Clinic, her staff and Doctor Sarina consistently provided exceptional care.

I have also been a patient at the Tampines Shifa Clinic.

Today, I arrived at 12:01 p.m.

The reception desk staff informed me that registration had closed at 12:00 p.m. I explained that I had arrived at 12:01 p.m. and that it was still 12:01 p.m., but they persistently refused to allow me in. Despite online research indicating that the clinic was open until 12:30 p.m., if the clinic were indeed closed, it should have been updated online to prevent unnecessary inconvenience for patients.

The staff I encountered at the Shifa Clinic, who had a tattoo on her left hand and was wearing a scarf, exhibited a lack of professionalism and an unpleasant demeanor.

This was a distressing experience with the staff at the Shifa Clinic. Her former clinic staff, Ms. Kamsia, was far more approachable and friendly.

Management of Shifa Clinic Staff
Please ensure that your staff receives adequate training. If any staff members are experiencing personal issues, it is crucial that they address them privately and not bring them to work.

As patients, we expect a certain level of professionalism and courtesy from the staff we encounter.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115395247774015985781/reviews
