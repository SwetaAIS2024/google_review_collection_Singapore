WT Wong,3,"Decent sukiyaki in a modest small mall . Broth is authentic served with vegetables and beef.

However the rice (supposed to be Japanese rice?) was bit hard and dry instead of moist and soft. Suspect it was warmed using microwave before serving .
The mushroom was also ‘over grilled’ that it appeared black and shrunk.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116204037022034321113/reviews

AC Chan,5,"Pop by for a late lunch at this quaint little cafe-bistro run by a Japanese family. We opt for their sukiyaki set that’s super value-for-money!
The sukiyaki is served in a shallow cast-iron pot filled with tons of thinly sliced Angus beef alongside with vegetables, mushrooms, tofu and konjac noodles.
Love their scrumptious and addictive soup base that’s bursting with sweet, salty and savoury flavour. ♥️",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
Grace Bu,5,"Taste: Really delicious Japanese food. Chicken Nanban was so succulent, flavourful and filled with egg mayo!!! Chashu was well marinated (they ran out of egg so they replaced it with more meat). Portion size was big too. 🤭

Cost: $29 + service charge, no GST

Waiting time: 15 minutes, Sunday 730pm

Overall: 10/10, will bring my family and friends here. We are regulars at this place ever since my brother recommended here (also a regular)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111891956501988952404/reviews
T Tan,5,"The boss is friendly, prompt and v sincere. 👍👍👍👍👍

Ingredients v v fresh - and quite generous.

Unagi was quite tasty well done.

Quite a light / slightly sweet sukiyaki soup...not really my favourite... But probably just the style.. I am not a sukiyaki expert..

At the same time I can't really taste any MSG 👍.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105342097727930447553/reviews
