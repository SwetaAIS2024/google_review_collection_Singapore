Fab Foodie Swede Malin Nordblom,4,"Great baked goods in a relaxed hotel environment. The croissants, donuts and other things are rather big. It’s a great selection. There is also sandwiches, pizza and other things to order.
Nice coffee selection.
You can choose to sit inside or outside. Quite expensive.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107062657007062713328/reviews

TLC Is In The House,4,"Never ever overcrowded, this quaint, charming Italian cafe has a lovely showcase that's always brimming with  sweet bakes.

The cakes although attractive, are a hit and miss. There's a black forest gateau that offers a nice edgy, boozy kick with juicy cherries within. That I can vouch for. My advice is to skip the cannolis altogether cos they're just sitting out there the whole day and the ricotta cream removes all the crispness in the cannoli shells. A pity.

I'm partial to the savoury snacks, including loaded croissants with fillings like prosciutto and smoked salmon. Love the cheesy creamy pastas which usually hit the spot when in need of comfort food and something more substantial. Otherwise, they offer a loaded wall (yes, literally a display on a wall) of breakfast pastries all day long including cruffins and crusty loaves.

We drop by occasionally for a decent enough cappuccino on lazy mornings after a stroll at the Botanic Gardens.

Ultimately though, what appeals to us most are their unique offerings of Amaretti Virginia. It's probably the most comprehensive range in Singapore I've come across besides the one at Jupiter 57.

Service by the ladies are either pretentious or stiff while the gents are more genuine and warm.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116246063219109577345/reviews
N Y,5,"What a hidden gem, truffle burrata pizza is a must order. They serve good gelato and tiramisu too, definitely a place to visit again!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105633440650460007544/reviews
Anton 999,5,"Lovely atmosphere and delicious food. The service is also fine and the prices were generally okay for a hotel cafe. Really no complaints. I probably wouldn’t buy any of the cheeses or other Italian sundries here, as they’d be cheaper almost anywhere else, but for a coffee and something sweet, it’s reasonable and high-quality, and a comfortable place to take a short rest or kill some time. Their breads and pastries really are better than most other places. The sandwiches and yogurts are also good. Definitely worth a visit. I think it’s also worth noting that, perhaps a bit oddly, there are two sides to Dolcetto that have separate entrances. In addition to the side facing the large open seating area, there is another side closer to the hotel’s main entrance. They have wonderful gelato and it’s reasonably priced for what you’re getting. Great little spot. There is also an additional selection of deli items around the corner.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113685000306523260417/reviews
