      "text": "Had tried these few of their dishes over the past few months:\n1. Pork chop rice aka ÊéíÈ™®ÁéãÈ•≠ ($7)\n2. Sliced pork in tomato soup with rice vermicelli ($6)\n3. Fried fish bee hoon soup ($6)\n4. Bittergourd Sliced fish bee hoon soup ($6)\n5. Xing Zhou fried bee hoon ($6)\n6. Yangzhou fried rice ($6)\n\nMy all time favourite is their pork chop rice aka ÊéíÈ™®ÁéãÈ•≠ which I had been eating from here for a while - will request for no onion üßÖ and no garlic üßÑ. Pork chop here is thick and tender; sauce is sweet and savory.\n\nAs for the rest of dishes, these were my first time trying and they are all pretty good! Their sliced pork in tomato soup with my choice of rice vermicelli was so heartening - best choice for a rainy day. Same for the sliced fish & fried fish bee hoon soup where I ordered without milk. Xing Zhou fried bee hoon and Yang Zhou fried rice are the same ingredients just the carbs and sauce were different - these were not oily.\n\nThey do have quite a number of other dishes like wanton noodles, chicken curry rice, etc which I will definitely patronize to try them.",

This is a hidden gem tuck in the side of Katong. ü§§\n\nThe large variety never fail to disappoint me and the favour and taste of every dish is just so on point every time I eat here.\n\nMy go to dish is the fried chicken cutlet noodles with extra chili. The juicy chicken paired with the egg noodles and chili is just perfect.\n\nAlternatively, the fried sweet and sour fish is a popular choice too, would recommend to try having sauce on the side if you are not a sauce person.\n\nOverall, a great place and have been eating here comfortably over the years. Be prepared to wait a while especially during peak hours.",

      "text": "Ordered the fried fish soup and also chicken cutlet noodle. The fried fish is really good! It came with 3 huge pieces of fish which are moist inside and really crispy layer. The batter is not thick too. The fish soup with milk tasted good too. The chicken cutlet is well flavored and coated with crispy batter. Really love all the crispy stuff here! Came for dinner on a weekend and it was quite crowded and the waiting time can be quite substantial but the food was really good for the price point! Will definitely be back to try the other menu if around.",
