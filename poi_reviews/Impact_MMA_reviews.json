      "text": "Two years ago, I stepped onto the mats for the first time, not knowing that I was about to find something that would change my life.\n\nSince that day, this gym has become so much more than a place to train. It's where Iâ€™ve been tested, humbled, lifted up, and transformed â€” not just physically, but mentally and emotionally. And at the heart of that transformation has been Prof. Leke.\n\nProf. Leke is more than a coach. Heâ€™s a mentor and someone who genuinely wants to see each and every one of us succeed. Through every competition, he's been there â€” pushing us, believing in us even when we doubt ourselves. Thanks to his guidance, Iâ€™ve stood on podiums with medals around my neck, and teammates by my side.\n\nBut what truly sets this gym apart is the family it creates. We're not just training partners â€” weâ€™re brothers and sisters in sweat, struggle, and support. We lift each other up on hard days, celebrate each other's victories like our own, and constantly work to help one another grow. Thereâ€™s no ego here â€” just respect, hard work, and love for the art and each other.\n\nWhether you're a white belt taking your first nervous steps or a seasoned competitor chasing gold, this place welcomes you with open arms and sharp technique. The mats may be where we train, but the real strength of this gym is in the bonds we build.\n\nTo Prof. Leke and my incredible teammates â€” thank you. Here's to many more years of growth, challenges, and shared victories. Oss.",

Would recommend to anyone who is looking to train or is trying martial arts for the first time.\nThings have turned around since the new management took over this year with cleaner toilets and a lounge area that parents/members can wait.\nThe location is a short walk from the MRT and there are a lot of cafes around.\nFor newcomers trying jiu jitsu, you can try wearing a pair of long tights and sleeved top.",
