      "text": "A very decent destination for F&B, amenities, grocery or to bring your dogs out to walkabout. I will not really call it a mall per se, but more of a community area located within the lush greenery of Hillview. Itâ€™s about 7mins walk from Hillview MRT so itâ€™s pretty convenient but when it rains i will expect footfall to be even lesser. Carpark is really poorly designed in my opinion - spaces are not maximized and the lots are just simply not sufficient. Turning radiuses are also very tight at certain corners. That said, I do enjoy the breeze and serenity around the area. Thereâ€™s also a couple of really good Italian and Korean options within this establishment.  A 24/7 Anytime Fitness is also located here to cater to the residents in the area.",

However, there isn't an atm in this mall which is very inconvenient.\n\nThe nearest atm only at Hillview CC. There should be more ATM (POSB&OCBC) within this mall to provide convenience for patrons and staffs who works there.",

The Christmas decoration was good too.\nKeep up the good work but more could be done to pull in the crowd.",
