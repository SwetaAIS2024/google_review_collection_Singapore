      "text": "The auntie doctor keep on talking and talking and talking and talking and talking non stop. I am feeling very unwell and wish to go home asap to rest, haven't even eaten breakfast, feeling very weak already. I don't understand how can she be a doctor. I didn't pay to have counseling session. I just want to get my illness treated and get medication at that point of time. Save your lecture for your counseling session outside of your clinic. You are a medical clinic, not counseling center, for goodness sake. And tell me there is no cure, she cannot cure my illness. I didn't asked to be totally cure, can at least give me some medication to ease the symptoms? And i was just having diarrhea and bloatedness. You don't know how to give medicine? And super expensive, just consultation fee is $50, the most expensive doctor i have seen, she is not even a specialist. I not sure is it she purposely keep on talking to drag the time, so that can charge the consultation fee to be $50. I am not there to chit chat. Won't step into the clinic again. Very unprofessional, don't wish to even mention about her dressing.",

      "text": "Might have legitimately been the worst doctor I've ever had the misfortune of being a patient of. Went there to get a flu vaccine and the entire time the doctor was incredibly condescending and extremely unprofessional. Berating and looking down on me, saying \"so you don't believe that prevention is better than cure?\" because I have not been getting the vaccine annually as per advised. Even went on and said \"you know there's a small percentage of you dying from getting this vaccine\" and looked me dead in the eyes in silence, as if waiting for me to be mortified and beg him to not kill me I guess?? The final cherry on top was when I took off the plaster it wasn't even on the needle mark. Excuse Me?\n\nPlease do NOT bother coming here at all",
