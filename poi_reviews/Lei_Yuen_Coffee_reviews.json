This avoids ugly and unhealthy competition under the same roof.\n\nBut even during dinner service, this limitation applies! Illogical since the other stall never operates beyond lunch.  Another restriction I was told is economic rice stall cannot serve up deep fried stuff! Again competition issue?\n\nThe most ridiculous logic to protect 1 stall, and deprive patrons of their right of choice?\n\nSo now, the economic rice stall at the other coffeeshop (aka Foodloft) can whip up fried beehoon, kway teow and run away with monopolising prices!\n\nTime to vote with our feet and bring our precious little money elsewhere from time to time, isnt it?",

It was from fish bone and there were fried fish parts in the soup. It was milky not from any added  milk but the actual fish bones.  It was tasty. It was good enough to warrant another visit a week later.  It is a neighbourhood coffee shop so don't expect swank surroundings.  The fish pieces that came for us to cook inn the steam boat were fresh.",
