      "text": "As per previous reviews, I find the cashier rather rude. In fact, she seemed to have an anxiety issue. She asked if all the rest of the items in the basket was 20 for $5, which I said yes, but I noticed one that was not and she curtly told me to wait.\n\nWhen I told her that I wanted to paywave, she tapped on the reader and said, ‚ÄúTap here la!‚Äù I think she might have a bad day or rather, according to previous comments, all her days are bad.\n\nNonetheless, I will be back. I tried the goodies, they tasted good and I like how I can sample so many goodies with $5. I got a Salted Egg Fried Rice packet free. I also not sure why it was complimentary. The cashier just placed it into my bag.\n\nThe Xian Ge Cold Noodle with Devil Spicy is super addictive.",

The price when check out and what's stated on the shelf don't tally at all and the staff do not admit to their mistake and refuse to sell.\nWent to Bites by scarlet at Tampines 1 to burchase hdl hotpot soup base, as per their price reflected on the shelf, it states that 3 for $9.90, usual price for 1 is $3.80. However, upon checking out, the price reflected was $4.50. I went back to cashier to verify, and the staff say that UP is the price per pack under the promotion price. She seriously trying her luck thinking I don't know what UP means! After I explained to her that even under promotion price, per pack shld be $3.30 not $3.80 and UP means original price, she then  insisted that the price per pack is $4.50, if buy only 1 pack is to pay $4.50 as per stated on the shelf and the price stated on the promotion card for per pack is the old price not the new price. Not admitting to their mistake, the cashier just say she refund me and she took away the item. I ask for the refund of the price diff but the staff dw to sell stating that their manager not around they cannot change the price.",
