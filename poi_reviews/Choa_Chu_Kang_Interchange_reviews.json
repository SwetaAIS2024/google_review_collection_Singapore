      "text": "One of the more pleasant bus terminal in the West. A hub for bus lines towards the sparsely populated and trafficked Northwest Singapore and places like Mandai Birdpark and Zoo. Bright, super airy, with some F&B stalls, bakery, and money changer (!!). Some bus pens are located faraway from the main exit due to the U-shaped layout of the terminal. Other unique features of the bus terminal are the ticketing office in A/C room and lots of electric plugs.",

      "text": "In the early hours, it has been observed that a significant number of students frequently bypass the line, particularly for bus 302. It is perplexing that this behavior is deemed tolerable while many individuals adhere to the appropriate queuing etiquette. This is not an isolated incident involving a handful of students; rather, it involves large groups. One must question whether this reflects the societal standards we are instilling in our future generations.",

He jammed braked and the passengers have to hold on very tight to the hand rails if not will fell down. I m a senior and almost fell down when he jammed braked. When alighting I was worried he will move off before I get down. There was turn around Bukit Batok he made big turn which was very dangerous. Pls educate this drivers and consider the safety of the passengers in the bus. It’s not a fun ride for him. 1 fall may cause a life….",
