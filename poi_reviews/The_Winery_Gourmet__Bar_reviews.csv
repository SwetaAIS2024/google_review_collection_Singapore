Katrina Lu,5,"Had an amazing dining experience at this Spanish restaurant on my husband‚Äôs birthday. Every dish was delicious, from the appetizers to the main course. We truly enjoyed each bite. The atmosphere was cozy and perfect for such a special occasion. Our server, Rachel, went above and beyond‚Äîshe was not only super friendly but also professional, making this evening even more better.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114522243919494155047/reviews
Go Huat,4,The food was amazing esp the seafood paella! The pork dish is surprisingly good! Super Tender coupled w the sauce! However what disappointed me was that i was here to celebrate my gf birthday (i did put in their note that i was celebrating my gf bday) I was hoping that they might have a little surprise on the house but nope nothing. I guess the only positive was the food but not the service. Doubt will be coming back here when the location is so out of the way.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101893920626357417226/reviews

Andrea Tan,5,I love how cozy this place is. Their iberico pork paella ($62) tastes so good and they served amazing crispy bread appetizer with premium olive oil (smell and taste so floral and nice). Thank you The Winery Gourmet | Bar for the hospitality moment at the restaurant. We had a great time enjoying the food and the place! Remember to make a reservation before heading there.

Xu Eric,5,"The food was prepared to perfection and beautifully presented. The beef tartare was decent, but the creamy rice and uni pasta with fresh sea urchin stood out, each dish cooked to perfection.

The wine selection was impressive, complementing the meal wonderfully.
