quasi modo,1,"Really poor service. Bought a wrong product through her recommandation, and refused to refund. Her poor product knowledge is pathetic, but her poor customer service really takes the cake. I don't understand why she still has a job, especially when Japanese are known for their high standards. Shocking.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109532089483323202501/reviews

Chris Chew,1,"Extremely frustrating trying to call this outlet! Called on a Friday morning February 21, 2025 from 10:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and no one answer the call!!! Was trying to call their outlet at Millenia Walk looking for a particular product but the telephone number for this outlet at Millenia Walk is not listed. And when googled the number for the outlet at Millenia Walk, the number 67351226 was listed, which belonged to the outlet at  Takashimaya. So I tried calling this number to see whether they can direct my call or provide me with the number for their outlet at Millenia Walk.  To my frustration, there was no answer despite calling for 30 minutes from 10:30 a.m to 11:00 p.m. on Friday February 21, 2025 from 10:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.  I do not think that the staff were so busy non-stop for the whole 30 minute and could not pick up a call.
Unbelievable for a Japanese pharmacy to have such poor service!!! Surely the locals who man the store have to be well trained by the Japanese owners to be customer centric!!!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112427752108727414097/reviews
戴正圆,1,"Me and my colleague had very bad experiences yesterday. The lady who is worked around 4pm yesterday had a very bad attitude. As a salesperson, she doesn't even know the most basic manners. She is so horrible.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114348940817044504892/reviews
