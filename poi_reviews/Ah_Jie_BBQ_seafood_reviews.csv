Veronica Pestana,4,"Someone told me that the BBQ stingray here was good hence I had to try it.
Not sure if this is a Vietnamese owned stall or just run by Vietnamese staff but the grilling of the stingray was on point!
I requested for it to be less spicy and she suggested she put the chilli by the side.
What I got was a succulent piece (small size is $13) but it was quite a lot for one person actually!
Although this coffee shop is always packed in the evenings as they have got other choices of food too...the atmosphere can be a bit noisy with the beer uncles and the thumping loud music.
Food wise it's one of the better coffee shops in the area.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107681237278744268338/reviews
Shiro Ryu,4,"Went there to try the raw seafood for the first time raw prawns taste good with a nice level of spice.

After that I tried the 2nd time the spice level dropped.

Spring roll and the deep fried fish is one of my favorites.

Overall the food is nice",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106841399989964859945/reviews
BH Tan,5,"Second time here because I was thinking about the delicious bbq and sambal flavours. Favourites were the sambal stingray, the raw prawns and the okra. Okra tasted amazing and crunchy!

Cockles were fresh but tasted average to me despite being highly recommended by the owner.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116504199657695769073/reviews
Mao Town,4,"Taste.              ✅✅✅✅
Presentation. ✅✅✅✅
Cleanliness    ✅✅✅

It’s at hawker center therefore cleanliness it’s the hawker style. They are two staffs in the stall. Staffs are polite and smiling face. Take time to serve our food.

Sambal sauce not really spicy to me. Level three of the spiciness foods. I personally think the sambal squid set or sting ray set with rice, the  food is small.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117888691291053296859/reviews
Luis See,5,"Very good price and portion. This is located inside NEW CENTURY FOOD HOUSE, most of the bigger tables were reserved by zi char stall. Here for dinner on Sunday early evening.

Had bbq stingray, squid, marinated cockles (can choose doneness), fried spring roll and etc....

Love the sambal chilli they used; it reminds me of another stall I used to go but was closed down.

Everything is good, but sambal sotong is abit too oily.
Personally didn't like the fried chicken as too much flour,  maybe would have been better if no flour?

Hope they can maintain the standard!
