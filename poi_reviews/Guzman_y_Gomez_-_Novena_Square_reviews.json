Whether you’re craving hearty Mexican comfort food or a lively dining experience, Guzman exceeds expectations.",

One thing that this restaurant can improve on is not overgrilling meat to the point of burning. After giving feedback on that, they were more careful, but still have rooms for improvement.",

The service was impressively fast, and they provided a variety of sides, including flavorful dipping sauces, fresh cilantro, onions, and green chili peppers (not sure what type, but they added a delightful kick). Highly recommended for anyone craving authentic and delicious Mexican food in Singapore!",
