      "text": "(1) Buddha jump over wall soup - Fantastic thick soup, came with lots of ingredients! A plump chicken thigh, fish maw rings, abalone slices, juicy QQ mushroom slices, & ard 5-6 pieces of dried oysters. (2) Yam rice was of generous portion - authentic old-school type, with big cubes of Yam, rice was fluffy & well-flavored! Very good value for money. Amazing flavors done just right, super earnest service by the lady stallholder, even offered free soup refills. Wed evening ~630pm, not crowded, weather was cooling off so overall dining atmosphere was acceptable. Tables are well spaced out & ceiling fans aplenty. Able to get parking lot quite easily. Didn't take pic of the soup, only the Yam rice. Will surely be back.",
