I found Renee's recommendation of customized insoles and stretches effective in alleviating the shin splints I was experiencing after running. Both Renee and the counter staff have been patient and empathetic in dealing with my concerns, and  have consistently accommodated my tight schedule. I especially appreciate the warm reception that I always find here.",

      "text": "Very efficient customer service and prompt replies. I like the transparent pricing before the procedure and my appointment. I did callus and corns removal, Renee was very patient and helpful in explaining the difference in different foot conditions. She also gave good advice on what footwear to use and the option of insoles in the future. I have very thick callus on both my foot and two corns, all removed after the session. Although she said it’s not a permanent solution, it still helped to make me feel better when I am walking or standing. Highly recommended.",

I am currently recovering and I think the time I need to completely recover is approximately 1 month after surgery. I spent approximately 2,000 Singapore dollars for the surgery. Overall I had a good experience there. highly recommended",

Appointment wise, they usually don’t arrange too tightly such that you have to wait too long.\n\nAs for the treatment, I undergone SWIFT for warts. Gonna be honest here that the treatment itself is going to be painful; but what I really appreciate is Dr Renee’s transparent yet empathetic approach. She’s also fantastic at delivering the treatment such that most of the warts were cleared within the first two treatments.\n\nThank you again and I would recommend Atlas Podiatrist!",

She told me it might take a few sessions to fully resolve the issue. However, during my first follow-up today, we found that the warts had fully recovered after just one treatment!\n\nThe treatment itself was painful, but the results were absolutely worth it. Dr Renee was incredibly patient, thoroughly answering all my questions, and the clinic staff was friendly and welcoming. I truly appreciate their care and professionalism. Highly recommended!",
