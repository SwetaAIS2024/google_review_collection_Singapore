Ahmad Nabil,3,"The mandy chicken is average. It's not the best, but it's still okay. Chicken is a bit small.
Really loved their hummus and falafel. Hummus was so smooth.
Shawarma was okay. A bit more on vegetables inside.
I'm not sure why they called kebab hut when there is no kebab in the menu.
Parking is easy to get. It's not a busy area.
Price is standard. Service is great and quite fast.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105898109282720005223/reviews
Shaaa,5,"The food was absolutely delicious, the restaurant was clean, and the staff were super friendly.

Nirosa Vijayakumar,3,"The chicken Mandy was average—definitely not the best, but decent enough. The shawarma, however, was quite dry and lacked flavor. The milk tea was moderate, nothing special but drinkable. Overall, an okay experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102801533620755814527/reviews
Bobby Abdurahman,1,"I was disappointed with my first order from this restaurant. When we received our pizza, it was scattered everywhere, and the toppings had shifted all over the place. It looked unappealing, especially since we had visitors tonight. I won’t be ordering again. Please check your delivery service; the driver seemed unsure of what he was doing.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113830206837438904257/reviews
HEMA 0807,1,I'm really disappointed with the food served there especially the Mandy chicken. I really don't like the taste. I ordered milk tea and its awful.
