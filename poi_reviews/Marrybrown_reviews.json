      "text": "Was very pleasantly surprised by how warm and personable Wallace , the staff who serviced us. He went out of the way to explain the available menu, the options and even recommendations.\nAfter taking our orders, he even informed us that he would bring us our meals.\nTo top it all off, he even moved to open the door for us to enter the dining area.\nHe showed sincerity and care that was unexpected in a fast food establishment.\nHigh praise for Wallace.\nI will certainly be going back for more.\nThe spicy chicken was lovely, with Indian spices and flavours prevalent, and the accompanying curry on the rice, so yummy. The chicken was moist and the skin crunchy. The fish for the fish and chips was tasty , but on the “skinny” side.  Nevertheless, a nice meal.\nSadly the aircon was not cold and some of the seats damaged/torn.\nCheers!",

One chicken thigh fillet which was alright.  The other was a processed chicken patty like a giant nugget. Tastes like a knock off MC Spicy.",
