Kenny Yap,3,"Pretty quiet on a Saturday night at 10pm. Drinks were pretty interesting and portions were generous. But I wouldn’t say I enjoyed my drinks in particular.

Entrance was on the second floor up a very dark staircase.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105256927610815725781/reviews
Kai Ling,5,No food available on weekday due to limited manpower. The fantastic cocktail n opportunity to get up close n personal with the man who built it from scratch more than made up for it. Mysterious location which was an adventure locating it.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100635259993109346258/reviews
Melissa Eisner,4,"Rally cool experience at this bar. Gin infused drinks only … they were out of a couple that we wanted to try, but the ones we had were great. I like the blue pea drink, and the toasted coconut one was lovely as well. Great vibe to the whole place more than anything … a 1970s sort of feel. Definitely worth a visit.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117316308946167178763/reviews
Jd L,4,"Somewhat hidden upstairs and by a non obvious door thru a non obvious signboard. Mixture of 70s Chinese vibe atmosphere. There were some seats we like but we're only reserved for more guests. So unless you have the number, you can't take the seat. Menu seems interesting at first, but after a couple of drinks, it gets old. Maybe I prefer those where they tell you what are the main ingredients in it. Overall, loved the atmosphere more than the drinks.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115003699534688199669/reviews
Jie Ying,5,"We loved the menu - the drinks are heavily influenced by regional/local delicacies, and well balanced (not overpowering in a weird way). Highly recommend but do make a reservation because they are a cosy bar",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102567754147084735394/reviews
