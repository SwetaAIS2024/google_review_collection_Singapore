Princess Mania,3,"This Indian Muslim stall had been a long-standing fixture in this kopitiam since Day 1. Only like the prata, which is not too oily and pretty good. The mee goreng is unpredictable; depending on who is the cook of that hour - it can be nice or a miss. Of late there is another Indian Muslim Western Food set up next to it. Was attracted by the signboard. Ordered the ""signature burger"" at $8.50. Later, I realised it was the same stall as the original - menu had the original stall menu plus the Western food. We ordered the chicken chop from the original stall and the burger. Strangely, you had to pay at the 2 separate stalls. Well, the chicken chop shocked us with the red colouring and chopped up small pieces of chicken(signboard display was not what was presented) i dare not even try the chicken. My burger was acceptable although the meat patty was bland and half the size of the bun. Fries were alittle overdone. I think I will stick to just the prata.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107320587807657797918/reviews
Airwan Sekeluarga,5,"I have been buying food from this establishment for a long time since I live nearby. I have to say that their food is good and the price is reasonable.

I always buy the Nasi Goreng Ikan Bilis for lunch and Roti Prata for Breakfast.

Recently they have expanded their business and are selling western food. I have tried the fish and chips and it was good. The fish and chips consists of a single fish fillet, seasoned fries, coleslaw and tartar sauce.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112667255304150351934/reviews
AL,5,One of the best prata around the area. Iâ€™ve tried a couple around here and non have been able to match up. They have nice mutton soup and beehoon goreng as well! The prata dough seems to be handmade &never fails!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109747682452231998880/reviews
