Forest BK,4,"ðŸ›´Cyclist Park is a quieter part of East Coast Park that is mostly visited by young children where they hone their cycling and scooter skills.
ðŸ›´There are areas with slope and bumps for some challenges.
The area can get a bit sunny during mid-day but otherwise a serene place for some fun time.
ðŸ›´Nearby are a Seven-Eleven store, a PS Cafe and an Indian Restaurant.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
John Muzi,5,"Cyclist Park is part of East Coast Park.  Beautiful trees.  There are two food outlets, PS Cafe and Indian Restaurant. A Seven Eleven store. Wish there were more food outlets.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105282531820988437830/reviews
Michael Ong,3,"It's quite a small park for cyclist but i guess mainly its for kids to learn how to cycle. There's 2 areas with bumps if the kids are looking for some challenge. But my girl manage to learn how to turn while cycling as there's some areas with sharp turns. So overall it's quite ok but do note that some areas are quite narrow so if there's a lot of cyclists, it may not be so convenient.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111639995742026580143/reviews
Adrian Sim,4,"Nice place for kids to learn cycling, skating etc. Not too ideal in the afternoon as there is not much shades around. Perfect for mornings or evenings. 7-11 nearby for convenience of getting drinks but prices are marked up significantly.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103937034157085738131/reviews
the cruzes,3,"Resting place near 7/11 is very littered at night to early morning. trash can situated literally 3 meters away does not help.

however it is a nice place during day. 7/11 is also very convenient.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111492143931551908744/reviews
