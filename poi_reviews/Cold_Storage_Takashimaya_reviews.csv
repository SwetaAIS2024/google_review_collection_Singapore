win win cabbage,5,"I recently shopped at Cold Storage and was impressed by the wide selection of organic produce. The store was clean and well-organized, making it easy to find what I needed. However, I found the prices to be a bit high compared to other grocery stores in the area. Overall, I would recommend Cold Storages for those who prioritize organic and natural foods.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104561859506628774030/reviews
BR Wong,1,"Bought their roasted honey chicken steaks and pork belly from their cooked food counter today. Requested that the counter staff cut the steak into 6 pieces as we are eating as finger food, he refused claiming cannot cut so small pieces , in the end he only agree to cut to 4 pieces which were quite large to serve as finger food and i had to cut again.

Really wonder what's the difference in effort between 3 scissor cuts vs 5 . A few seconds more? Refuse to go the mile even when it doesnt take any extra effort. From the accent, he is obviously a Singaporean,  probably lots of job openings around.

In terms of food quality, the roasted chicken and pork belly were extremely salty , no taste of any honey sweetness, did they even bother to use any honey?",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105906034575547265267/reviews
Jade Hian Koh,1,Super bad customer service. I was trying to order the Christmas feast at the stall but there was no one manning it. Worker at the deli store was kind enough to help get someone. Hanging around the stall for 15-20mins and the store manager Beth came. Let her took the order for another customer who came in later then me while I waited. She brought the customer for payment and never came back! Went to the payment counter to have someone to get her out so that I can tell her that the service at this store is unacceptable,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115139230995241809925/reviews
Daniel Judah,5,"A very good convenience store. The place is located on the B2 of the Takashimaya Department Store. The store is clean, well-lit, and well organized. The store has a self checkout system so you can just scan your products and then pay using your cards - itâ€™s convenient and fast.

The store also sell fruits, biscuits, wine, delis, dairies, cleaning supplies, and other stuff.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113463946697790816422/reviews
