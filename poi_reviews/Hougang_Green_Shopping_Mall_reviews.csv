abern ardern,5,"Please, do not take Arnold's for granted. Support them, i would cycle here just for that to get my fried chicken needs sorted out from time to time. But, for those who do not fancy fresh, tasty juicy crispy chicken parts, do not fret! Plentiful of food selections to fill your stomachs, and also enjoy a hot bowl of soft soya bean curd just on the left of the main entrance staircase. Have some fruits and snacks as you head out to go about your dailies. And, should you somehow dropped and crack your phone along the way, there is a very reputable phone repair shop!

Come get your peace of mind and heart at this very cosy mall, have your stomachs filled and happiness with your loved ones here!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103363691493236312646/reviews

Alex Chew,1,"Parking lots are tight.
When heavy rain, there’s flash flood in the underground carpark.
Lots of weird stares from maids in agencies. The food choices are not bad.

Lift is super slow, elevators are under repair most of the time.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107696607377855745700/reviews
