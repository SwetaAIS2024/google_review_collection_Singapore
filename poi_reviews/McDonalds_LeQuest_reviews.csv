Doris Chin,1,"Worst service at Macdonald I have ever encountered. Upon ordering I found that it was not indicated whether hot or cold Milo. I told their crew I wanted hot Milo (written by crew on receipt).. upon return I found cold Milo waiting. I am sick with bad cough! I asked their staff and was told ‚Äúcannot change!‚Äù.. made some noise and their manager came who is totally hopeless.. without checking anything, the attitude was can change but need to take back scratch card???? Totally missed the point?? I did not abuse their staff in any way but talked loudly as I was agitated!! Made me feel like a criminal? And then when I said I don‚Äôt want the Milo, she abruptly ran into the kitchen without any word of assurances or apology ! Lousiest service I have ever encountered. Here is proof I told their staff (handwriting is there!!) Macdonald maybe you need to review your staff training .. customers should be right but now I feel bad üò¢",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112751620993800022010/reviews
