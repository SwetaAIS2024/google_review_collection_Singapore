We ordered tamago and kani sushi. Waited for 20 mins and reminded the service staff 3 times, but each time the kitchen staff puts them on the conveyor belt, it will be taken away by other customers. Please change your SOP on customer's order. Putting them on the conveyor belt doesn't ensure customer will received it! Very disappointed with your service staff in this branch! After this wait, we have no more appetite!",

Sashimi slices also getting smaller and thinner.",
