Calvin Sim,5,"The downtown line has definitely helped to reduce traffic congestion around the Sixth Avenue roads. Around the vicinity of this station are very homely eateries, spas and bike shops, as well as Turf City which is a strange mall that has evolved from its old function of being the horse punters' paradise in days of yore.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103128429614857031939/reviews
General Twilight,5,I have observed that there are not many people who alight at this station. This may be because of the lack of residential units in the area. It is a small and compact MRT station and just a barber shop in the station. It is located near to a shophouse and that it is situated along a highway. It is the nearest station to horsecity. It is a great way to spend your weekend to explore the area around the station. I am sure you will be surprised to find what lies beyond this station!,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114314523990529053400/reviews
