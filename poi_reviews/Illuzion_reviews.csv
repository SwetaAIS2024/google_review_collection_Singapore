Deacon Blu,5,"Came to this bar to drink and sing, absolutely loved the vibe! The waitress Angel was very friendly and accommodating, she even taught us some drinking card and dice games.
Unfortunately I didn't manage to order any food because I was too caught up with the drinks and the games, I literally forgot that I was hungry. 😂😂

100% will return here for the vibe and the friendly people!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117631229776092147543/reviews
