eyeda,5,"Customer Feedback for Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf – Kallang Wave Mall Outlet

I would like to express my heartfelt appreciation for the exceptional service provided by Raja and the team at CBTL Kallang Wave Mall.

After attending a concert yesterday, I placed a Grab pick-up order intending to dine in, to skip the long queues at the counter. When I approached Raja to request if whipped cream could be added to my drink (as Grab orders typically don't include it), he readily agreed without hesitation. I placed my order and returned to my seat to wait.

A short while later, Raja personally came over to check if I had completed my order, and thoughtfully verified the outlet name. It turned out that I had accidentally placed my order at the Stadium Walk outlet instead. Realizing my mistake, I offered to place a new order at the Kallang Wave Mall outlet, understanding it was my error. However, Raja immediately reassured me that there was no need — he would personally prepare my drink and contact the Stadium Walk outlet to explain the situation.

Thanks to Raja’s initiative, patience, and customer-first attitude, my drink was prepared perfectly, and I was able to enjoy it without any hassle. I am deeply grateful to Raja, the Kallang Wave Mall team, and also the Stadium Walk outlet for their understanding and kindness.

This experience truly reflects the outstanding service spirit at Coffee Bean. Thank you once again for making my evening even better!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118122160876379008055/reviews
Olivia Shaw,1,"Bad and very slow service. Staff talking and laughing. One taking order but no one was preparing food/drinks. I ordered a muffin and ice latte but it took about 20 minutes to prepare. They were not even preparing until we asked. They didn’t even bother looking at their order display screen. Three staff and not many customer but still very slow. The worst outlet ever.

Muffin was moist but not as nicely toasted as other stores.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100167489864798560469/reviews
Wen,5,"Pretty empty throughout the day on weekdays, I worked here in the morning for a few days cos I had an appointment nearby for the week.

Nice chill ambience, only 1 power plug unfortunately but since it was empty I managed to use it.

Food is the usual coffee bean standard. Comfort food but nothing to write home about. I like it though! Overall a pleasant experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103862327742326848642/reviews
Loki,4,"I don’t know why I ordered spicy tuna spaghetti from CBTL but I did. The small plate of mediocre pasta was definitely not worth the $13 price tag but the only saving grace is that they did give quite lot of tuna.

Service is very slow at this outlet like some of the other comments, but the outlet was clean and conducive for working and chatting.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101937176024039442948/reviews
