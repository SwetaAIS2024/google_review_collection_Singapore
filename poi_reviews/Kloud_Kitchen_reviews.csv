Abdul Hannan Abdul Rahman,1,"I had a really negative experience there even though that this Kloud Kitchen restaurant is halal and open to all Muslims. The hijab lady at the counter was inattentive, very arrogant, and showed lack of respect to me yesterday, despite the fact that I had been their frequent customer for almost about 1.5 years. The waiting time/queue is quite long (took almost an hour), the halal food is not nice, and the customer service is VERY BAD (well below average). Overall, I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone (even Malays and Muslims). I am very disappointed and will not bother to visit this restaurant again ever. It's not worth trying !!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109272807668863021973/reviews
mystikalbrotha,1,"Food is nothing to shout about for the price on the menu, what I can’t understand is the long wait for my order to be done, almost a good 40mins. IMHO, Wouldn’t recommend the place.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115430676713268915840/reviews
