Helping each player to improve their groundstrokes on the spot when there are mistakes. It has a small retail shop at the side of the tennis court as well where it sells Balls, Shoes, Rackets and even Restringing services. Highly recommended for everyone who is keen to learn tennis and to have fun while playing tennis. üëç",

As an intermediate tennis player my session was focused more on cleaning up my technique and footwork, as well as some groundstrokes and we even touched on my net game which I appreciated üòä. Overall I enjoyed and was very happy with how accomodating they were to us üòä. Thank you to Coach Steven for hitting with me and helping me clean up my game üéæ and Alycia for helping us organize everything! Many thanks from the Philippines üáµüá≠!!!!",
