U can see them making the paste and etc.\n\nThey have special items like big mushroom w paste, big meatballs, fried items are placed separately and crispy!\n\nI personally love their self made meat balls. Was really tasty and fresh. Even their Crabsticks have a Wanton skin alike wrapped around and tasted really good.\n\nTheir chilli is my favourite too!\n\nAmazing lunch!",

Loved the taste of everything, even the soup! The wanton was big and juicy and very worth it too. Loved the way they served the chicken rice nicely too. Very worth the money. 3 thumbs up.",

The fried tofu very nice, the instant noodles cooked just nice a bit al dente when you just started eating and then as you eat the texture softer, just nice. Don't like the Tau Kee, not sure is it not fried through enough of it's the quality, very rubbery hard can't bite through. The soup also a little bland for my liking.",
