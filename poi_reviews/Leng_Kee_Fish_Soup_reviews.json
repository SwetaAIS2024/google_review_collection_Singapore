Generous portion of fish slices.\n\nAte the fish beehoon and takeaway 2 bowls of fish slice soup. Super yummy. Will definitely be back (even tho it's across the island for me)",

      "text": "Visit Bukit Timah Food Centre on a Monday past lunch. With most stalls closed and my stomach rumbling, fate (or maybe just hunger) led me to the unassuming Leng Kee Fish Soup. I got the smallest bowl ($6) and added bittergourd and rice (+ $1).\n\nDon't underestimate this simple soup – it's a flavour bomb! The broth is rich with the delicate sweetness of batang fish. The fish slices are fresh and cooked to perfect tender texture. I finally get why this stall is always buzzing, even on Mondays!\n\nThe popular side, pig trotters, were sold out, but the kind folks drizzled their heavenly braised sauce over my rice upon request.\n\nI should have tried this place ages ago, and you bet I'll be back for more of that amazing soup and, hopefully, score those legendary pig trotters next visit!\n\nUpdate Dec 2024: revisit the stall and they are now located at the interim market. I had the $6 fish soup and added braised tau pok for $1. The quality and portion remains the same and I realised they are using You Mak Cai. It's no wonder the soup has a natural sweet fragrance. Pig trotters were unfortunately sold out again but it gives me a reason to visit earlier next time.",

      "text": "$8 seafood soup, ingredients consisted of fish slices, 3 prawns, squid, lettuce and tomato. Prawns were plump and firm, and not powdery like a lot of prawns found in hawker dishes. The fish slices were flaky and delectable. Soup was rich with umami. Portion size-wise, it is already well worth it. But it is also really damn delicious, so try it if you're here.",
