Ang Jasmine,5,"Kids dine free on sat/sun/PH, my 2 years old son loved their pasta. We ordered rack of pork, 50 degrees king salmon. Portions were generous and delicious. Highly recommend the rack of pork, meat was very tender and flavourful. Will be back here again!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111119292585638470922/reviews
ericcsn,5,"Nice location, wide range of drinks. Did not make a booking prior to visit and restaurant had a good crowd (lucky me). Ordered Caesar salad, fish and chips, halibut, beef bolognese. Prices in the usual range for such meals. Taste were actually quite good. Worth follow up visits",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114245543879083590910/reviews
Alvin Poon,5,"Happened to pass by and wanted to get a quick lunch and entered this restaurant without knowing anything. And to my surprise, the food are very nice and up to standard! Seriously, it's better than other well know western restaurant. The sirloin is juicy and the fried chicken wings are very tasty. For the beef slider, the mean is a little cooked though but understand it is more suitable for children. I will be back!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105353160611945498763/reviews
Shower Chan,5,"I had a great meal at Lazy Later and wanted to share my experience. I ordered the sirloin, and it was tender, juicy, and cooked just the way I like it. The meat was flavorful and easy to cut — no toughness at all. But what really stood out were the chips. They were golden, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside — absolutely delicious. Dipping them in the mayonnaise took things to another level. The mayo was creamy and rich, a perfect match for the hot, crispy chips. Simple, satisfying, and definitely worth coming back for.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102276747412958004634/reviews
sandra loh,4,Went with family of 7 on 4 may 2025. Teriyaki chicken burger was simply succulent. Sirloin medium rare was just nice and fresh. Kids’ free meals like pepperoni pizza and prawn spaghetti were satisfactory. Family enjoyed the dinner & Will patronise again.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113016861061131639700/reviews
