Never heard or seen of a western stall selling minced salmon and THIS thin?? There was also a piece of hair in my pasta… (no it’s 100% not mine as my hair colour is blue). First and LAST TIME HERE OMG",

The patty changed from actual minced beef meat to this compressed, sausage textured patty with lots of Mala flavouring. I took a bite out of it & gave up the entire burger completely.\n\nThe pricing is really fair for a western stall, but I would rather prefer a skinner patty made with actual minced beef than whatever this is.",

So what if you have many online orders or whatever, I finally asked are you closed?!?! Again ignored no reply whatsoever, not even a Im sorry we are closed or too many orders etc Never seen someone so rude in F & B line.\n\nAlso just less then 5 mins after I walk off to order other food I saw them serving a American woman wow like hello what is this!?! Too much.",

      "text": "Original Post - Pretty sure I ordered Hainanese Pork Chop with Fried Rice. It sure looks like a regular Pork Chop which is supposed to cost $1 less according to the menu. When asking the server about the oddity, they said something along the lines of \"You can choose your sauce for Hainan Pork Chop\", ah yes and why wasn't this mentioned during the ordering? Very disingenuous. Food still tastes pretty good but they should review their service staff.\nUpdate -Approached their staff regarding this issue on another day and was compensated with complimentary Hainan Porkchop Fried Rice",
