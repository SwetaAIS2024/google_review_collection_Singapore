The teachers are so caring and genuinely invested in each child’s development. My child has thrived here, not only learning essential academic skills but also gaining confidence and social skills. The curriculum is well-rounded and engaging, and I love how they incorporate play-based learning. Communication is excellent, and we always feel informed about our child’s progress. We’re so grateful to have found such a wonderful preschool community for our little one!",

      "text": "Our daily school routine has undergone a remarkable transformation since relocating to this area. My son, previously hesitant to attend school, now eagerly looks forward to each day. This change was facilitated by our discovery of Twinklekidz during a school tour, where we were greeted by the affable Principal Ms. Linda. The school's vibrant culture, characterized by confident teachers and students, starkly contrasts with our prior preschool experience. As a self-contained institution, Twinklekidz boasts an array of modern amenities, including a playground, outdoor water play area, and safety park. Our initial concerns regarding food intake and adaptation were promptly addressed by the teachers, who demonstrated remarkable understanding and support. The transition has been remarkably seamless, and we extend our sincerest gratitude to the teachers, principal, and administrative staff for their unwavering support. Twinklekidz Preschool comes highly recommended. 😀💯",

      "text": "We cannot thank Twinklekidz enough for the incredible care they’ve provided to all four of our children over the last 11 years! All 4 kids have thrived here, thanks to the nurturing and caring teachers, and the thoughtful and engaging curriculum.\n\nWhile many places push academics heavily, we loved that Twinklekidz takes a balanced approach - prioritising experiences beyond academics with hands-on exploration, and connection with nature. Our kids thrived through art projects, craft workshops, gardening activities, and plenty of outdoor playtime especially when they were younger—all while learning life skills and teamwork. The regular excursions were also a highlight, sparking their curiosity about the world in fun, engaging ways. Of course, in K1 and K2 there was a more conscious effort to focus on preparing for Primary school, but again the preparation wasn’t about all about breezing through lower primary academics but rather about skills, e.g. buying food during recess. They tried their best to secure visits to primary schools so that the children could be exposed to the primary school environment, and I know that back in Twinklekidz the teachers practiced “buying food” during meal time.\n\nOver the years what we had also appreciated was the stability of the staff and the relatively low children-teacher ratio. Unlike other centers with frequent turnover, the core team here has remained wonderfully consistent. Seeing the same warm, familiar faces every day gave our children (and us!) a sense of security and trust. We have no doubt of the level of experience knowing that many of the teachers have been at Twinklekidz for so many years. But really experience aside, we sensed each of the teachers’ genuine care and concern for the children. It is hard to put into words what that means for us as parents, to have that peace of mind to focus on work and personal commitments, knowing that our children are in the care of adults who genuinely care for them.\n\nWe are endlessly grateful for how much the teachers at Twinklekidz have given of themselves to the care of our kids. Thank you for being part of our ‘village’!",

      "text": "Me and my son's experience with Twinklekidz has been nothing short of amazing! My son started at Twinklekidz at 18 months and has been in the Playgroup class led by the wonderful and experienced Teacher Julia. She has been such a good teacher to Nathan and a great support to us as parents, never failing to give wonderful advice when we are having 'issues' at home with our son that we need to overcome.\n\nBeyond Teacher Julia, all the other teachers in the school are amazing too and the school has such a warm and welcoming vibe to both parents and children - a testament to the long tenure that most teachers have with Twinklekidz. As parents it can be difficult to entrust someone else with the care of your precious child, but with Twinklekidz there can be no worry!",
