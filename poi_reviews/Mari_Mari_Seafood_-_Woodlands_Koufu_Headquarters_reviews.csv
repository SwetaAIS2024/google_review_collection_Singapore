W8ll8am Gastby S8m,2,"📌 The Tom Yam Steamboat from the menu photo and the actual one were two different things. I felt cheated.  They should at least inform us. However, failed to do so.

The best so far is the Pertai dish. Followed by the prawn-paste chicken wing and the salted egg sotong also yummy 😋.

The rest so so. Overall the taste is on the sweet side.

Just an update, two of my family members got food allergy reactions.  Update photo .",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101069809328749995510/reviews

mmm,2,"👎🏻 Waited for almost an hour for the food to be served, even though the food court was mostly empty. Only 2-3 tables were occupied and the rest have finished eating.
👎🏻 Guess they were busy fulfilling delivery orders - saw grab delivery men came for orders.
✅ Ample parking space in the MSCP.

Food Taste:
⚠️ Sweet Thai Chilli Chicken: Sauce was too watery.
⚠️ Fish Head: Broth was ok.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102944840465029663400/reviews
