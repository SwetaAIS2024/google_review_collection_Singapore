Nanrisa Lee,5,"A shop of visual treasures indeed! I stumbled upon this gem of a gallery while I was exploring Singapore last May. I was mostly just looking for a break from the heat, but Lim sets such a relaxed, inviting atmosphere, that I ended up spending well over an hour chatting with him and hanging out.

He has an eclectic, well curated mix of pieces (mostly paintings, but also some installations and sculpture) by well known artists, as well as local and emerging. And the absolute BEST THING about this place, is the lesser known pieces are just as exciting as the big ticket items. I can personally attest to that, as I’m now the proud owner of one of Mr. Lim’s visual treasures - a stunning watercolor by Shang Cheng Xiang. Thanks again Lim! I will certainly be back for more.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100681270198429245677/reviews
G N,5,"This cozy but well-curated space is where CW (Mr Lim) showcases emerging local artists; more often than not you’ll also see works by established Singapore artists, and a good smattering of international art he’s collected over the years. It’s a friendly space and you’re likely to get a great conversation with Mr Lim as well, and maybe with the artists who pop over. Put this on your map, whether you’re a serious collector or just curious.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111293244369377528612/reviews

John Cunningham,5,I’ve visited Mr Lim’s a couple of times during my stay in Singapore. I enjoy talking to the owner about art. His knowledge far outweighs mine and I’ve learned some interesting things from him. On my most recent visit I bought a couple of limited edition prints by a British artist which I am delighted with. I’m looking forwarding to revisiting the shop on my next visit to Singapore!,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108780510713293727944/reviews
