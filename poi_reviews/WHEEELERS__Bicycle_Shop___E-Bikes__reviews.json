These bikes were bought during the pandemic and had never had a proper full service until now. Your workâ€”degreasing, changing cables, and everything elseâ€”has made a noticeable difference.\n\nThe price for this service was extremely reasonable, which I really appreciate. For anyone looking for quality and affordable bicycle servicing, especially if you're in Punggol/Northshore area, I highly recommend Wheeelers\n\nThanks again for your great work.",
