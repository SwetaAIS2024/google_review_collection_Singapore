Christopher,4,"The school is quite okay. Teachers is quite kind and chill. They had a great yeahub where we can play games. Teacher In charge is mr Rajah. He is a kind man. I'm from NCC teachers are quite kind. English teacher could be know for kindness but just a little bit strict. What can improve is that the NCC teacher could just be a little bit more kinder.now he's okay. English teacher just a bit more kinder. Rest are good. Students can be a bit more better though. Now they are just good. Also some students were vaping. Please stop this. If the students are reading this, I know I am famed among sec 2s. Please do spread this. For those who are vaping,this is not funny please stop.
Just need some improvements
1. People are starting to use the words autism and call others autistic for no reason would just like some teacher to tell the school about it.
2. Student quality. Some students are like selfish that even when a teacher says to stop,they decline. Not saying that students are bad but most are good. Also when I talk to others, one Student interrupted to tell me to shut up. So attitude needs to improve. Don't take this as an offence. I'm just stating improvements. Most students are good.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113844418432309028632/reviews
Chia Yu Jin,5,Used to be a horrible student but the teachers there are great and treat u like a young adult and nurture you(it depends if you chose to listen to them anot) even though cut off point is easy to enter but doesn't mean it is a bad school. Went to poly thn uni rn and I can ensure you it's a good school with great teachers.(choose f&n mr sng is good) but of course if you enjoyed art or dnt go ahead and choose what you are interested in,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117647152019424306430/reviews
