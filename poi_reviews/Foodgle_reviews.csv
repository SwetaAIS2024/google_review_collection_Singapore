J T,5,"This is probably the best kopitiam in the whole of Sengkang and Punggol area in terms of food options and standards, despite the super tight space: zichar, Indian food, Muslim food (very popular nasi lemak), Japanese food, Thai food, noodles (bcm, laksa, ban mian), roasted rice (+chicken rice)...",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102136104763111141763/reviews
Alfred ho,4,"Personally I'm surprised that at this corner of punggol there is this coffee shop. Good variety of food from Chinese, Japanese, Muslim and Thai food. Seatings are limited with narrow walking space. Not too crowded at meal times except for the chinese soup and muslim food store. Pricing range from budget $3.50 for duck noodle to almost $10 for a japanese don meal. Nearby supermarket, clinic and malay snack outlet. I could not rate higher then this rating due to yet to try out the food. Will review again after experience the taste there.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111847154516022642987/reviews
Denise Chew,1,"Not sure why the reviews were so good. Coffeeshop has a weird and narrow layout as if this was an afterthought. Half of the stalls were closed around 2pm. Halal zi char stall took ages to serve my food, another customer who ordered later got served first, and no one else had ordered from them as far as I could see. Hokkien mee that I ordered used yellow mee instead of the flat ones as shown on their website, too much msg and too salty. Will never come here again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112391008989722435366/reviews
