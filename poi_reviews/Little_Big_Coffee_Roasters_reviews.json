      "text": "Finally got to check out this coffee spot. It’s only opened on weekdays which makes it hard to visit if you don’t work in the area.\n\nChose this over bras basah boys as it’s along the main road with natural light coming in. Ordered a regular white and was pleasantly surprised to see that places still sell it for not just below $5, but below $4 at $3.80.\n\nThey didn’t cut in terms of quality either. The interior is quite simply decorated. Nonetheless, a really good cup and a nice spot to pause before moving on with the day.",

Enjoy the relatively slow pace of life here away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of Singapore.\n\nOne of the few small coffee roasters in Singapore where you can buy their beans which are roasted on site, and also sample their delicious coffee.  They also serve delicious home baked cakes.\n\nThey bring in a good variety of coffee beans to bring home for your own home brew too.\n\nThis is an often overlooked place. Highly recommended to drop by!",

Some seating upgrades, food still smashing, extremely affordable prices (bagel w spread $3.50, bagel w other goodies $6). All bakes done in-house!",
