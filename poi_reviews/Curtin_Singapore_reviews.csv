N. Jannah,4,"After Moving to New Location: 4

Prior to Moving: 3.5
I would say a 3.5. The campus is smaller than what it appears to be online but it is still nice and cosy nonetheless. With the right lighting, it can be good a good place to take photos!

Since it is a small campus, the facilities aren't exactly what I'm used to but it is still sufficient.

Still the school will be moving to a different location in 2022 if I'm not mistaken. Hence, hopefully the facilities will be better. üëçüèº",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112421989350245637833/reviews

Arianne Lin,1,"Literally so many bad reviews on this school, the support system literally sucks, on the first few days of the trimester there's so many issues, so many staff & lecturers are unprepaid, so many attendance issues, academic issues that takes forever, to solve. Knowing that the school faces oveewhelming number of students with academic issues on the first week, there should be more staffs to assist instead of making student wait hours, on top of that academic issues need to be queued physically / physically take a queue number? why is there no online support / tech support? why is there no links to help and support and the timetable is absolute bullshit because why do they make students bid and choose if the school is just going to change the modules / schedule when the trimester / semester starts?! what's the point?? even after i graduate im pretty sure none of these issues will be solved or improve, wouldn't recommend anyone to come to this lousy school",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114611116591491985155/reviews
Black Jacket,1,"compulsory 3 hour attendance for student pass holders every weekday. just go to other schools, dont apply here. people from other schools dont have to do this, just attend classes and attendance is counted from there. most students stay quite far and yet, is now forced to travel for this. this wastes our precious study time and transport money. avoid and go to other universities.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111138452378268676121/reviews
