      "text": "The shop dared to sell expired goods and spoilt products to people. They also use harassing tactics (e.g. pressuring people to buy until they buy it) to attempt to sell their products. They also never display the price tag of items so they can technically trick you to spend more. They buy their products at a discounted deal from Fairprice and sell it separately for a much higher price. Overall I do not recommend anyone to patronize this shop! Why couldn't the government send some SFA officers to regularly check on their products??",

Expect his service to be very slow, and if asked for plastic bag, he'll give it to you and expect you to bag your items yourself. The whole time you're there waiting for him to serve you, you'll feel as if you're secondary while his phone call is his primary concern. I would rather walk to the NTUC at hougang or buangkok than to buy from him even though he is nearer. Poor.\n\nRead the other reviews and you'll know this shop is horrible. Hope they close down and haomart will come back.",
