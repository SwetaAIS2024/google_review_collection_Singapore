Rekup Fan,5,The scene is quite scenic and nestled among lush greenery and open concept over the reservoir. Rain seeps in when there is a heavy shower. The staff was attentive and reassured me that the clinic is safe despite some reported crocodile & alligator sightings nearby.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104775002691329726075/reviews
Tan Timothy,5,"I was in an accident earlier this year, which resulted in my nose being upside down. It was a horrible thing, every time it rained my nose would be filled with rain water.

One night as I was walking home, nose filled to the brim with smelly rain water, a crow landed next to me and brandished a name card. 'Dr Tan Clinic"" was written on one side, and on the other was just two lines - the longitude and latitude.

Desperate to get my nose fixed, I made my way there on foot. The trek was nothing short of arduous and challenging. Finally after a few hours, I reached the co-ordinates.

It was around 9pm at this point and to my huge disappointment there was no clinic in sight. Right as I was about to walk back home, a strange creature with 3 eyes crawled out of a tree, it looked like a rabbit mixed with a dog and a bear. ""nguah nguah hoo"" it kept murmuring. I was really tired at this point, so I ignored it and walked past it. That's when it reached out and put it's hands on my shoulder. They were human hands, and so I turned back around to see a man in a white coat. He looked awfully disheveled and upon closer inspection, I noticed a name tag that wrote ""Dr Tan"".

With nothing to lose, I told him about my situation and how it has caused me so much problems. He then placed his hands on my face, which were really dirty and smelled like raw eggs for some reason. With his hands on my face, he started chanting the words ""wahoo wahoo wahoo"" many times. About a minute goes by and he puts his arms down, he must be done right? I looked up at him, his nose was now upside down!

Wait, does that mean... Without hesitation, I ran to the nearest body of water. With just enough moonlight to illuminate my face, I gazed into the waters to see my reflection, my nose was back to normal. Tears now running down my cheeks, I could finally cry without fear of my tears going down to my nose. Gone are the days of blowing my nose only for mucus to shoot up and stick to the ceiling.

I wipe my tears away and ran back to where Dr Tan was but the closer I got, Dr Tan became less apparent, its as if someone was dragging the opacity down of him the closer I got. A sudden wave of tiredness came over me and i fall to the ground. My eyelids growing heavy with each passing second. I woke up at the front doors of my home, maybe the kind Dr Tan carried me all the way home.

Regardless, Dr Tan exceeded my expectations and everyday I wake up knowing that there are still good people in this country.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100024435744233455869/reviews
