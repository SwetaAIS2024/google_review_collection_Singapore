hex,5,"Pasta was pretty decent but the portion quite tiny, maybe could introduce a XXL portion size like your pizzas.
The XXL pizza very generous portion and pretty worth the money imo
Taste-wise, the pasta is pretty good
The pizza could be more flavourful? It felt kind of underwhelming not gonna lie.

Wee Kim Goh,5,"One of our favorite pizza and pasta places in the East. The pizzas are freshly cook in wood-fired oven, with a thin, crispy crust and generous authentic ingredients.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100563171422395315368/reviews
Grace Chua,5,"Damn, the carbonara really hit the spot. But it got a bit too jelak at the end. Still worth it though, was so good. We enjoyed the pizza as well.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114659626761328424594/reviews
Van Chan,4,"First time visiting this pizzeria. Wanted to try somewhere new for a change. I‚Äôm a thin crust pizza üçï lover. However, I didn‚Äôt really like the thin crust of the Diavola Pizza that I had for dinner.

I found it to be slightly hard which was disappointing. The toppings were pretty good & yummy. Maybe just a tad too salty for me (I‚Äôm pretty sensitive to salt, spices, msg etc in foods). Perhaps that‚Äôs how it should be. I‚Äôm not sure.

To be fair, I gotta try more of their foods to give a holistic review.

I ordered warm water ($0.50). What‚Äôs really nice was that the staff kept on topping it up for me.

The service from the staff was attentive and I like the overall vibes of the place. The place was almost fully packed at 7.50pm when I entered.

Was lucky to find a nice table for dinner (I am also quite finicky about my table seating when I dine out ‚ò∫Ô∏è)

I was the last to leave at close to 9pm, and I‚Äôm glad I was able to shoot the interior when it‚Äôs empty (I do feel a bit strange pointing my phone at folks when they are eating üòÇ)

The Sunday nite vibes were really jovial and everybody‚Äôs having a good time.

I like the simple & tasteful decor of the eatery. The restrooms were really clean üíØüíØ

I may come back again for another visit. Maybe for lunch? We shall see ‚ò∫Ô∏è",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102169738300622572121/reviews
Eu-Gene Ong,5,"Our go to place for pizza. Love this place!
Their pastas are served in garlicky loveliness. Favourite pasta - Squid Ink.
Favourite dish - Roasted Cauliflower
Gotta try their XXL pizza at least once for its novel size! The quality of the pizza is of course very good. Order your pizzas in advance on weekends to avoid disappointment.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106968684173083879457/reviews
