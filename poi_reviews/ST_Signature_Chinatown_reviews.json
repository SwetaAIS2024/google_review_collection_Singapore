      "text": "Great location! Nice interior and safe environment. Seems clean and nice.\n\nI stayed in the private room which was nice but loud from neighbours and the kitchen. The kitchen is the place people go to have phone calls and such and people can be very loud.\n\nThe bathroom for women is on another floor which is okay but not convenient.\n\nCheck in is online but there was a guy helping when I came.\n\nI'd recommend it for what it is and the perfect location in Singapore!",

The shared bathroom is fine and looked clean to me. 2 showers, 2 toilets, 4 sinks.\n\nThe self-check-in option was perfect and the simple key feature with the app also worked perfectly.",

      "text": "ST Signature Chinatown hotel does it's job for the price you pay. What I liked about this hotel is that even though the room is small (and no window) it felt very clean and private - compared to a capsule hotel of the same price.\n\nAdditionally, everything felt super seamless to self check-in. The location was perfect, super close to a famous hawker centre and between two stations. It's also a 15 minute walk to Merlion park.\n\nThe drawbacks is that I didn't find the bathroom that clean, it also smelled sometime. I guess that's the nature of a public/shared bathroom. Additionally, I arrived to the hotel after a long flight an at 12am and to my dismay there were NO lifts and I had to carry a heavy big luggage up 3 floors.\n\nOverall, a pleasant stay.",

      "text": "I really like the location and the cleanliness of this place. It is located very close to popular spots in Chinatown. Very close from Maxwell MRT and still walkable from Chinatown MRT. It was also nice that the location is walkable from the bay, very strategic location. I booked a single room without window with shared bathroom. For a short stay it was okay since I was out most of the time. The shared bathroom was always clean and there are shampoo and body wash as well. The kitchen is not too big but enough. We can refill our water bottle which was very good. They have a self check in system with an app and it was very easy to use. We open the door with the app so I need to make sure my phone is always on and not running out of the battery. The only downside is that there is no elevator.",

The room is quite good, tv included, public area includes a kitchen.\nThis place is inside the Chinatown, so you can have a tour to the Chinatown in the evening, many things to eat nearby. LRT is about 5 min walk. There are bus stops 3 min away",
