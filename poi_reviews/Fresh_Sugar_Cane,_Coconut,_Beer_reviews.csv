Hui Yee Tan,1,Sugarcane tasted diluted. Ordered one regular and one large - both were of the same quality. Not sure if the store was closing and didn't have enough but it is the worst sugarcane juice that I have ever tasted. Bought another cup from a different store nearby to confirm it was not due to a bad sugarcane season. The intensity of the colour between the 2 cups were totally different.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113839897100157119315/reviews
Flo Yeow,4,"Would have loved to get my sugarcane juice from them, but they've already ran out around 745pm on a Sunday evening. At the very least, the stall owners were kind enough to come apologize and be nice about the situation, which I thoroughly appreciate. I just said ""awww it's alright next time then thanks"", and walked off.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
