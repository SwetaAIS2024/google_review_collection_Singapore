I called up to check, the receptionist said she would check but didn't get back. On the 3rd\nweek, I walked in to collect. The receptionist told me to wait for doctor to review. I waited for about 40 mins and she told me I could get the report to view and no need to see the doctor.\n2. Surgical mask not given and I went to guardian to buy.\n3. Dr Grace is average, nothing to wow about.\n4. There was I went there during the operating hour and it was closed.",

      "text": "Had to go to a clinic to get a wound dressing changed for a leg injury. I forgot to bring a mask, and the receptionist (an aged lady) refused to give me one even though there was a box of 100 masks from Guardian taped to the counter.\nI get that they ask patients to bring their own mask, but surgical masks aren't that expensive and she expected me to hobble around to find my own mask. Thankfully one of the other patients waiting took pity on me and lent me one.\nThe doctor was ok, nothing special. I had to pay extra for wound dressing (which is fine). Even without the extra cost I paid, their standard consultation rates are slightly above average, definitely enough to afford a few cents for a mask.\nIn future I will go to one of the other 3 clinics within 100m just to avoid the grumpy and stingy receptionist. Faith Clinic is just 10 metres away and I had a good experience there in the past (both the doctor and receptionist).\nPlease have masks available for patients in future. Surgical masks are in ready supply nowadays, and I cannot understand why a healthcare institution would not have one.",
