Adrian,5,"Had free flight lessons on the DA-40CS during my time here back in poly. Good memories and friends were made here.

Instructors are ex-RSAF so they'll give you a taste of how they teach stuff in the air force. One tip I have is to lower your instructor's headset volume before taking off.

Being a government-linked organisation means it has to adhere to a budget like the SAF and civil service. Which you can see with their old computers that they use for teaching and barely-functioning aircon in the planes. ""If it ain't broke don't fix it"" is manifested in the equipment and infrastructure of the club.

Not that it's a bad thing though. As a student you just need to pay for 2 polo t-shirts and a booklet. The rest is free!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112650091918325033403/reviews
