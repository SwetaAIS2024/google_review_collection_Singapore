She has also taught me many techniques which I haven’t been taught by my previous teachers. I have significantly improved in my piano after joining her class. Not only that, she also organises piano concerts for us to perform in front of our families every year to boost our confidence for our exams. She’s definitely a professional piano teacher and I highly recommend her :)",

Attending her lessons was never boring but fun and motivating.\nThe year end concert was also a great exposure for the gals to perform in front of a crowd. This instilled confidence in them and made exam less daunting.\nThank you Ms Vanessa!",
