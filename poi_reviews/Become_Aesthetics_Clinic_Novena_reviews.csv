Yee Sing,2,"I completed 10 Pico Laser sessions mostly with Dr. Nicole. I was dissatisfied with the treatment. The pigmentation still on my face after 10 session instead of removed. Each session is about 5 minutes, which seemed rushed.

Initially, I was told that 3-5 sessions would be sufficient to remove the pigmentation before signing up the package. However, when I shared my concerns and disappointment with the clinic, they pushed me to sign up for more packages instead of addressing my concerns. They claimed that they never promised removal in less than 6 sessions, which I found misleading.

I wish they would review their previous communication, such as our WhatsApp messages, to recall their initial promises.

Disappointed with this clinic.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110587561364289529973/reviews
Mabel Lee,1,"i would like to comment on those good reviews might be pseudo; im extremely dissatisfied with the service; its seems like each time the doctor just want to get each session done quickly especially pico it’s like a 5 min session. the assistants want to make you sign more packages without addressing your concerns. well after all the sessions, unfortunately i only see slight improvements. to the higher management; maybe you would like to reassess the doctors and assistants working in the outlet and provide more professional trainings. consumer are paying thousands for those packages, how can it be a slip short session. stop giving a default template replies to google reviews, it’s useless without improvement; and having pseudo reviews to overwrite the bad reviews. i did not want to continue using their service; i advice people to think twice before continuing or signing any new package with them. it’s a bad hole. well it’s my own personal opinion.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106361145862382896128/reviews
