David Oon,4,"The fried oyster is one of the better ones I have tried. Egg and dough has a nice chewy texture and an eggy savoury taste. The oysters arek plump , about the size of a thumb on average. Combine the gooey mess with the tangy punchy chili, the result is delish oyster-eggy goodness in a mouthful.

Tried the black and white carrot cake too. The portion is pretty huge for $8 for a place like this atas hawker centre. However this dish was not special or spectacular in anyway.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111461636018977333111/reviews
Darren Cheong,4,"I try the Malay style fry Noodle..$8 SGD

I like it because it's not Sweet ( no added sugar according to the Chef)

In my dictionary, this malay style fry noodle is above average.. bundle of egg and generous amount of ingredients..

Waited almost 24minutes until I was served. Because only operate by 1 chef when I patron.

However, the portion for $8sgd was a bit disappointing.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111136407063098297690/reviews
Ricky Teo,1,"Placed a $6 order of oyster egg. Before me were 2 other orders of $8 & $10. After me, a lady came to place another $8. After her, a young man came to ask if I had placed my order. After realising that I had placed mine, he went forward to place his order and left. It was another $8 order. All this time, the cook has already started frying his wok of oyster egg. When he was finally done and dished out the various plates of oyster egg, the first first order of $8 was given her plate, then the lady after me was also given her $8 plate. The young man  who placed his $8 order after me came back, saw me waiting and asked me ""Yours still not ready?"". He smiled but then the lady serving the dished out plates of oyster egg called him over and gave him his plate of oyster egg. Finally the last 2 plates from that cook were given to the first customer who ordered 2x $10 plate. When I didn't get my $6 order, given before some of those who ordered $8 after me, I went to the lady to ask for mine. She said the cook is going to fry all the $6 orders in his next wok. I was really shocked to hear that and decided to cancel my order because it would mean I have to wait another 20mins. What really got me was that they served those bigger orders first despite some placing their orders after mine. I cannot understand why they have to fry the $8 & $10 together and the $6 separately. Aren't they the same oyster egg? Isn't it supposed to be first come first served like the famous Song Kee Oyster Egg, some stalls away in the same hawker centre, which was unfortunately closed this evening. I am very unhappy with this service. Felt so discriminated against because I ordered the small plate. I will not visit this stall again despite reviews that their food is good. I will stick to Song Kee or go without oyster egg there if they are closed.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106066407431782542860/reviews
Thea,1,Guy making the rojak wore a glove to prepare the food but touched cash with both hands and went back to touching the food. Very unsanitary and worrying.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112606488799168900603/reviews
