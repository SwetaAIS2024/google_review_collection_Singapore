Buren,4,"A fast, easy choice among many in Plaza Singapore.
I think, weird enough, Plaza Singapore doesn't have this besides that many F&B outlets here. They are mostly expensive, not filling, weird, or not fast/easy.

I remember there used to be a foodcourt but couldn't find it now, so, we settled for Burger King. Burger King is not a economical fast food, but it's familiar to get if you want something fast and simple.

Since a while ago, I feel the burger's quality has gone down but yeah, it's still okay.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103975090698079167241/reviews
