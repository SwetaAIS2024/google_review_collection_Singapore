웬케빈,5,"Triplets Bakery in SGH Blk 4 is a must-visit, offering an irresistible array of tasty baked buns and freshly made waffles with a variety of delicious fillings - a perfect treat to satisfy your sweet and savoury cravings!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107458777477246149283/reviews
MISSY CELINE,1,"Very dishonest marketing gimmick to promo their breads at 3 for $5 when only selected flavours are allowed.  If cannot honour the promo at 3 for $5, do not put up the promo.  When we wanted all 3 cheese sausage bread, the staff advised need to add extra money and cheese sausage bread NOT ALLOW for the the promo.  Very ridiculous advice and she has the cheek to keep argue. Hence,  if not any breads are for 3 for $5 stop mislead consumers. Very disgusting gimmick just to clear your unwanted bread of the day.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117401426607150549431/reviews
Jamie Lim,1,"I was in the queue to place my order, three staffs in the store walked away doing their own things despite they saw I was standing there. The customer behind me suddenly passed me to place order.

I told the staff I'm already in the queue. The staff fault me that I did not mentioned to them. I told the staff to  improve the situation by let the customers to choose their bread. The staff replied me that if they let customer to access, customer will steal their bread.

My intention to see this bread shop can improve their service. Sad to say this staff are not willingly to improve their service.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107825578920588941444/reviews
kenny choe,2,"They used to be the best waffles: crispy waffles with melted chocolate spread, and the cream cheese waffle is delicious too. Now they've become the worst. Straight from the package, they were no longer crispy but soggy. Something is definitely different, sad to say, and I'm definitely no longer recommending this waffle.

The only thing they improve is the qr code ordering, which will definitely speed up the process compared to queuing up for waffle order, but the waffle doesn't taste good anymore so sadly.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103708775000240850126/reviews
