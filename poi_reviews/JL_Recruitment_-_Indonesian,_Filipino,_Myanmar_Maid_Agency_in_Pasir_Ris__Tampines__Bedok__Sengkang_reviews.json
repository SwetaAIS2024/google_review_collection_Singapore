From the very beginning, she took time to understand our family's needs and recommended a helper who fits in perfectly with us. Her experience and intuition in matching the right helper to the right home is truly impressive. What sets Cathy apart is her dedication that goes beyond just completing the hiring process - she continues to assist even after everything is finalized. She's always ready to help, clarify and even communicate with the helper to avoid any misunderstandings. Her helpful nature, professionalism and genuine care make her someone I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. Thank you, Cathy, for making the entire process so smooth and reassuring!",
