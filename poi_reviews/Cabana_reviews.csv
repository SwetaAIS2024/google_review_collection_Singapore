Soo Hin Yeoh,4,"This is the main restaurant of the Singapore Swimming Club.

We think the food quality is average esp the western meals but Asian options are pretty acceptable. The Beef Noodle soup and Char Koay Teow are good options.

Food service is slow on weekends.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115725392210756907778/reviews
