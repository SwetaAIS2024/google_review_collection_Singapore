eternal sunshine,5,"This is one of the best seafood restaurants in Singapore. Whatever I had was delicious. Chilli crab with mantou was sweet, spicy, and creamy. Going to the washroom was a pain because I had to pass these cute frogs, not knowing their fate.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105852881241042647005/reviews
Akhtar Samani,5,I was told I had to try this place. It did not disappoint. Had the signature chili crab some sides and it was absolutely amazing.

Phúc Nguyên Phạm Hoàng,5,"No Signboard Seafood is an absolute gem for seafood lovers! The crab dishes—oh my gosh—are a perfect 10,000/10, with the chili crab being an explosion of sweet, spicy, and savory flavors that’ll leave you licking your fingers. The crab is fresh, meaty, and cooked to perfection, making every bite pure bliss. The service is equally outstanding, with attentive and friendly staff who make you feel right at home. The vibrant atmosphere adds to the experience, though it can get busy, so book ahead. After your meal, take a short stroll to nearby spots like Merdeka Square for some cool photo ops. Hands down, a must-visit for an unforgettable seafood feast!

Estelle Cros,2,"Not the good experience I was looking for.
Be careful with the prices as you have to ask for, they are not very clear because depending on the weight of the crabs. Vegetables (big asparagus, big mushrooms) aren’t cheap either.
The cereals shrimps have nothing to crave for, a bit dry. We waited long before the chili crab was served. It comes in a kind of tomato not so spicy soup and is a bit bland. Can’t say if it’s really fresh or frozen.
When we wanted to pay and leave, we were asked to stay seated and wait, not so pleasant…",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105018260651386953652/reviews
