      "text": "I visited Pizza Kreta Ayar earlier today and for some reason, this has become my go-to branch. I find the pizza here more delicious compared to other branches, there's just something about the flavor that tastes better, which I think reflects better quality. Service is also fast, and the waiting time is always reasonable and acceptable. The staff are quite friendly and accommodating, especially the manager on duty who made the visit even more pleasant. Keep it up, and maintain the good quality and the taste of the pizza !!!!",

The pizza was so delicious cheesy got spices. Got perfect blend of chicken & toppings .\nGenerally when we order personal pizza from other outlet toppings & cheese all we need to search from micro scope as its budget friendly they totally vanish everything from it. But this outlet no words to say‚Ä¶ everything was so nice so perfect the ambiance the taste & specially the aura of the little girl who was making the pizza.‚Äù PAT‚Äù she was singing  inside the kitchen so lively so energetic so happy that her mood flows to pizza & makes it so amazing‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\nPAT if u read my comment i want to say‚Äî‚Äî Be happy & cheerful always.
