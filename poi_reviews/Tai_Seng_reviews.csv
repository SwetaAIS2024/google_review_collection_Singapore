Kaddly,1,"If you’ve ever been to Tai Seng MRT station around 6 PM, you know it’s a nightmare. The place is packed with people, especially Malaysian workers, and it’s chaotic.

Getting on a train feels almost impossible, and if you miss one, good luck—sometimes you have to wait an hour just to catch the next one.

The crowds are overwhelming. Everyone’s crammed together, and there’s no space to breathe, let alone move comfortably. It’s frustrating how disorganized everything feels.

There’s no proper queue system, and people are just pushing and shoving to get on the train. It’s stressful and exhausting.

What makes it worse is that the trains don’t come often enough to handle the number of people. You’d think they’d plan for such a busy station, but it seems like they haven’t.

More trains, better schedules, and some crowd control would make a huge difference. Until then, commuting through Tai Seng during peak hours will continue to be a test of patience. It’s honestly a terrible experience.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116091397237028724296/reviews
Nirmala Damith Jayawardena,5,Still not very crowded mrt most of the days. Now there is a new underpass set up linking 18 Tai Seng which make it much easier to access and no need to cross here road anymore. Only downside is that the path to bus stops are not sheltered and bit away from the mrt entrance.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118144818109147977690/reviews

Lovell Ang,5,"Thank you to the Taiseng and Paya Lebar SMRT team for swiftly aiding me in recovering my lost item.

Accidentally left something in a train that stops at Taiseng station around 9:45pm on 3rd June 2024.

Went to seek assistance from the Paya Lebar Team who called Taiseng Station and had 2 staff who were keeping a look out for me and swiftly returned my lost item to me despite it being closing timing.

I am very grateful and thank you for your service!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108351209332081965346/reviews
