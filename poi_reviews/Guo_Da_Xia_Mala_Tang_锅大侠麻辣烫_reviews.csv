Darren Teo,1,"My children order 3 fishballs. I eat 1 and the fishball is NOT cooked properly(inside the fishball is cold and hard). The fishballs are NOT fresh.

I went to the owner and tell him that the fishball is NOT cooked properly and he replied me : 鱼圆不是熟的吗？ i feel its pointless to continue as the owner is not feeling apologetic. He Didnt even apologise.

Will NOT patronise the stall again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102690579046319615043/reviews
