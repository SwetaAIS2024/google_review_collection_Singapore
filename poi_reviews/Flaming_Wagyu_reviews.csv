Alex Lim,4,"Friendly boss. Recommended us to start with more fatty, then go lean.

The Beef was good. The fat is spread out nicely. It's a Must Try.

The mutton was covered with instant noodle crumbs. Can try. It's not on the menu.
The meat was well prepared. No gammy smell. Meat was tender. After 2 portions of marble beef, the mutton feels lacking.

Tried the fried octopus. Nicely done, tender with a crispy coat.

The pork collar was good, too. Easy to start with.

For the oyster lovers, there's fresh oysters $12 for 6.

It's hidden in an industrial canteen. Open air seating. Suitable for BBQ.

went on Sunday evening, the place was almost empty. We almost thought they were closed.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116892180143185379722/reviews
Jayley Tan,5,Food and service was excellent. Especially their A5 Wagyu Sirloin never expect I will find such an affordable and quality food in industry. Beef really soft and melts in your mouth. Nice place to chill and gather with friends.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101475530089363917684/reviews
Joel Lee,5,"A little stall in a quaint industrial estate, this place boasts of excellent cuts of meat and affordable prices. Had their A5 Wagyu Sirloin with their Karubi cooked on a charcoal grill (which was an excellent touch)

The owner took efforts to recommend  various cuts and portions. Operated by a couple, they keep quality meats affordable.

Would recommend to pay a visit! Parking in front of the industrial food court but available for parking after 7pm or along the side of the road",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115401232083678633394/reviews

Scottz Lip,5,"Love the ribeye waygu. Thick and juicy on the grill. Oyster is fresh at $2 a pc. And the cuttlefish. The charcoal used is smokeless. Good price!

Great for family dinner. Plenty of parking on a weekday evening.

Don’t forget get beer to go along!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109944330221879220267/reviews
