Callis Yip,1,Most of the staff at the Bishan North Shopping Mall branch have very rude attitude! Poor frontline service. Team really needs some education on basic frontline customer service.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102199329597323082324/reviews
Adam Lee,5,"Ang Mo Supermarket is a neighbourhood retail market offering a wide variety of food, beverages and household products, organized into sections and shelves. It has a wider selection than grocery stores, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market.

There are aisles for meat, fresh produce, dairy, and baked goods. The shelf space is also reserved for canned and packaged goods and for various non-food items such as kitchenware, household cleaners and pharmacy products. Ang Mo Supermarket also sell other household products that are consumed regularly, such as alcohol (where permitted) and medicine.

Ang Mo Supermarket is situated near residential area in order to be convenient to consumers. The basic appeal is the availability of a broad selection of goods under a single roof, on a single level and their goods at relatively low prices. There is an ease of parking and frequently the convenience of shopping hours extend into late night.

Typically a chain store, goods are supplied by the distribution centers of their parent companies thus increasing opportunities for economies of scale. Ang Mo Supermarket usually offer products at relatively low prices by using their buying power to buy goods from manufacturers at lower prices than smaller stores can.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115680102960193169110/reviews

JJ,2,"Service has always been  friendly  until this morning at 8.42am. Upon checkout, Cashier at the most right counter(next to the laundry shop) refused to pack. I couldn’t reach the groceries from the other end of the belt, so she asked me to shove over the other side near the stairs and pack myself. No smiles and just disinterested to help or even be polite.

No stock for a number of times for select fruits and veges, such as pumpkin, red dragonfruit, avocado, that you could find in other chains or stalls.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104859118545374870995/reviews
