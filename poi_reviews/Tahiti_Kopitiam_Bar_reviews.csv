Joven Ang,3,"Located at 8th floor (top floor), this canteen serves basic delicacies ranging from Chinese to Indian, as well as Thai. Total 6 food stalls (currently only 5 operating), as well as a drink stall. A convenient place for ppl working within this building, price wise a bit on the high side, and choice wise average only. Can't be choosy since the location does not require you to walk far.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110469154087288311183/reviews
