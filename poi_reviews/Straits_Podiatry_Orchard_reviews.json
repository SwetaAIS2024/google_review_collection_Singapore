Managed to book an appointment within a day. Dr Saw was super friendly and clear of what’s going to take place, how it will take place and what I have to be aware of. The whole process was just super efficient and seamless. I didn’t feel as scared as I thought about the procedure I will be doing. My husband also felt good vibes from the whole process too. THIS PLACE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",

      "text": "I recently had the pleasure of visiting Podiatrist Dr Saw Yu Ting for my 14 year old daughter’s in ingrown nail, and I must say that the experience exceeded all expectations.\n\nThroughout the extraction, Dr Saw's calm demeanor and clear explanations helped my daughter feel at ease and confident. Dr Saw’s attention to detail and precision in her work truly made a difference in the overall comfort and well-being.\n\nI cannot recommend Dr Saw highly enough for anyone in need of podiatric care. Her skill, professionalism, and ability to perform the procedure with ease and little pain brings a lot of comfort as a mother.\n\nBelow is the photo of the pain my daughter had to go through and the large chunk of nail creating the pain. After the entire procedure, my daughter is feeling so much at ease.\n\nThank you, Dr Saw, for your exceptional care and expertise - I am truly grateful for the positive experience.",

U appreciated how patient and professional Dr Saw was, and I was encouraged to focus on steady progress in my recovery. Front desk staff are also very sweet and pleasant, and ever responsive and helpful over WhatsApp.",

The treatment itself was quick and efficient, and I felt well taken care of throughout the entire process. There was thoughtful after-procedure care; they checked in to make sure I was healing well and were always ready to answer any follow-up questions.",
