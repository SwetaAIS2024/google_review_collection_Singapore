We came in for a cocktail and were treated with on the house mango margarita shots and personalised drinks. Music was 90â€™s hip hop/rap. If your looking for a hideout with great drinks this is the place.",

Friendly, approachable, good sense of humour and really good cocktails drink. Itâ€™s hit you before you know it! He made a drink with absinthe without tasting like it at all, next thing you know 70% alcohol hitting the blood stream! Canâ€™t wait to go back again!\n\nTheir menu has interesting names for drinks ðŸ˜‰",

Could probably only handle around 20 people during covid times so if you want to go there during peak hours, you may want to make a booking.\nOrdered the negroni and it was served on the stop with no fuss. Negroni was well balanced and came with a burnt peel as garnish.\nIts worth the visit if you are in the area. May try to return and try something from the menu although the menu generally looked uninspired.",
