Ordered Mango Tango with Poached egg (additional $1.50), really flavourful and umaminess was really good!\n\nUpdate 17.1.24:\nOrdered the Moo Ragu with additional egg, the sauce was really flavourful and I love how the penne was cooked al dente because it isn’t soggy by the time I reach home to consume it. The cherry tomatoes had a wokhei and the sauce was thick, flavourful and reminded me a little of aglio olio dressing. 10/10 would recommend",

      "text": "Googled (as usual) for nice food at Bugis junction and decided to try this as I love pasta. The beetroot pasta was thick and chewy, though like other reviewers mentioned it was a bit too tough to eat so I ended up steaming it to soften. Aglio olio base was quite tasty. They could be more generous w the salmon pieces though - felt that it wasn’t a lot compared to the photos in other reviews. All in all, not bad and I’ll try it w the other main/protein ingredients (e.g. chicken breast/prawn) the next time. Hopefully those are better portioned and more filling!",

I quite enjoyed it — but I got really thirsty after (needed five cups of water) so it could contain lots of salt or MSG.\n\nTrufflin’ Cool — cold pasta with truffle oil, tiny scallops, shio kombu and ebiko — was flavourful and crunchy with the ebiko. Didn’t get thirsty after this.",
