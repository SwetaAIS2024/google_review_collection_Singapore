Sam Martinez,1,"Had two good experiences in the past. Engaged them for a third time. Unfortunately, didn't turn out well. They left me stranded. Completely unreliable. I had provided all the information beforehand, including pictures. The day itself, the movers arrived, decided the item was too heavy and just left. On the phone after the guy was rude and hung up mid-sentence. Ignored my messages after. Avoid.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116530095119620940044/reviews

BF,5,"Punctual, efficient, nice movers! Reasonable price compared to other companies. They are reliable and kind! There were some challenges moving my sofa into my new home but they were very patient and took care and time to device a method and eventually safely maneuver the sofa into my new place. Thank you - you made my move an easy and stress-free one.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102341943348299606545/reviews
Gwendolyn T,5,"I engaged these movers based on a friend’s recommendation and I couldn’t be happier. The uncles were all super nice and funny (and very very strong!!!) they work so hard and were always smiling/never in a foul mood even though my furniture wasn’t the lightest nor the easiest to move. I really appreciated how easy it was to engage them, we liaised over WhatsApp.

We hired these movers for our actual move, storage, and disposal. It was hectic but we managed! Do exercise common sense - if you have particularly expensive or delicate items, consider moving these yourself or making arrangements to pack them safely in bubble wrap etc.

The movers were often early or on time which was fantastic. I recommended them to a friend who used them just today too!! If you’re on the fence, please give them a try.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106789357335533471689/reviews
Desiree Koh,5,"George & his team of movers are really professional. They are helpful, fast and communicative. We have used their services three times, and all three have been wonderful experiences.
