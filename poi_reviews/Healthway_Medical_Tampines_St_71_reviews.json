      "text": "First visit to this clinic for treatment of cough and flu left me disappointed. Instead of focusing on my immediate ailment, I was given unsolicited advice about weight gain, which felt unrelated to my visit. While I understand that overall health is important and a doctor’s guidance is valuable, I expected the consultation to address my primary concern. Additionally, when I mentioned walking as my form of exercise, the dismissive remark that it ‘is not exercise’ further dampened my experience. Unfortunately, this interaction affected my mood for the rest of the day.",
