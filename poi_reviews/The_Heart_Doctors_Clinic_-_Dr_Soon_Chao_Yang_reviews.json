Did not give us the CTscan form & I still reconfirm with them that morning if I need to have the form. They say no need. End up I have to wait from them to go back clinic to fax the form to the radiology clinic before I could do the scan. Wasted almost an hour time because I have already paid for the scan at the doctor’s clinic. If not I would have walk off. Lucky the scan does not require fasting. If it does than good luck to you.",

The clinic has a really nice and harmonious ambience that made me feel calm.\nDr Soon also took the time to explain my conditions and scans in detail. He also reassured me constantly because it is not everyday you hear about heart conditions, some terms can be extremely difficult to understand. Really kudos to Dr Soon and his team for being so awesome and making my experience a pleasant one. Thank you once again!",
