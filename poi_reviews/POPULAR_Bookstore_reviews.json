      "text": "Complaint Regarding Unprofessional Service & Denied Exchange Request - Marvin\n\nDear Popular Tampines\n\nI’m writing to express my frustration with a recent interaction I had with one of your staff members, Marvin. On Monday, 09 December, 17:59 SGT, I attempted to exchange an item, but Marvin refused to process the exchange because the item had been opened. While I understand the importance of return policies, I was unaware that the item contained a wired component when I opened it. Marvin insisted that the situation \"cannot be misinterpreted\" because the picture on the packaging clearly showed it, which I find unhelpful. As a customer, I did not fully recognize the item’s specific details, and I would have appreciated more assistance or understanding from him.\nWhat made the situation even more disappointing was Marvin's rude and dismissive attitude. I expected a more respectful and professional approach when trying to resolve an issue, especially since this was a genuine misunderstanding on my part.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could review this situation and consider a resolution, whether through a policy exception or another alternative. Clearer guidance on product details and return policies would help prevent confusion in the future. Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to your response.",
