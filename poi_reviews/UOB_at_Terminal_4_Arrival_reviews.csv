Hoàng Đặng,5,"This place is very large, with automatic check-in procedures so everything is very fast. The airport has many gates, so wherever you go, you must pay attention to the signs or you will get lost.
After checking in, you will go to the waiting and shopping area, which is very nice and clean
In general, as a place to spend money, Singapore knows how to make people's pockets comfortable and satisfied
Free fast wifi connection but you have to go to the information counter to check in and apply for wifi.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110101858001038376729/reviews
