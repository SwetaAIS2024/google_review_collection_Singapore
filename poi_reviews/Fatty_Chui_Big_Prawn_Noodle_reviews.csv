Jack,4,"This prawn noodles is definitely a hidden gem. Ordered the big prawn with pork ribs noodles soup for $10. Definitely very worth, 5 big pieces of pork ribs which are huge and so tender no porky taste. The 2 big prawns are also fresh and thick with bursting sweetness from the prawn heads. Noodles are blanched well no alkaline taste and broth with fried pork lards is umami goodness which I devoured every drop.  So satisfied and full after this meal!

Edit: came here again Dec 24! Look at the size of the prawns compared to the spoon! Excellent again!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288565584051666357/reviews
Sean Goh,3,"One of the stalls inside 58 New Upper Changi Road that sells prawn noodle. This stall has been around for quite some time here. Decided to give this place a try since i had a craving for prawn noodle. Reached there slightly after lunch and there was a few people in the line, i didn't had to wait long before it was my turn to order. Price of the prawn noodle starts from SGD$4 onwards.

Opted for the dry prawn nooodle which was SGD$4, with the combination of yellow noodle and vermicelli. Noodle was nicely cooked but could do with more sauce as the noodle was rather bland. My bowl of noodle came with ingredient such as sliced pork, prawn and fishcake. The broth was not bad but somehow it feels like it is lacking something.

Overall, the prawn noodle was okay but nothing special for me.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Serene Lim,5,"I love the thick big prawns that came semi peeled along with the yellow noodles, bean sprouts and pork lard! The overall taste was just so comforting and the prawn soup was also rich and aromatic. $6.50 is quite worth since the prawns (3 of them) are really quite big and delicious and overall portion is filing.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110380172636865578097/reviews

Supreet Kini,4,"Nice bowl of prawn noodles. Opted for the regular prawn noodle (dry) as I prefer to have my soup separately.

Soup has a nice tangy taste, perfect for cold weather. Noodles is nice, and prawns are soft. Good breakfast option at Blk 58.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105328280516267995599/reviews
