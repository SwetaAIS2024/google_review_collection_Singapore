Damcho Tshering,5,"Explored the Dragon's Teeth Gate at Labrador Park today! Not only is it a place of historical significance, once guiding ancient sailors through Singapore’s waters, but it’s also nestled within one of the most scenic coastal parks.

The surrounding Labrador Nature Reserve offers lush greenery, scenic coastal trails, and stunning views of the sea. Walking along the boardwalk, with the sea breeze and the sound of waves, was a refreshing escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

The trails here weave through rich biodiversity, historic remnants of WWII fortifications, and peaceful viewpoints. It’s fascinating how this place beautifully blends nature, history, and tranquility. A perfect spot for history buffs, nature lovers, or anyone seeking a peaceful stroll.

Highly recommend a visit for a day of exploration and reflection!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116833702802756994837/reviews

Neo Carl,5,"Long Ya Men, or Dragon's Teeth Gate, was a prominent granite outcrop at Keppel Harbour's entrance in Singapore, first recorded by Chinese explorer Wang Dayuan and historically significant as a navigational landmark for mariners, including Admiral Zheng He during his 15th-century voyages. The British demolished it in 1848 to accommodate larger vessels, but a symbolic replica was erected in 2005 during the 600th-anniversary celebrations of Zheng He's expeditions. This replica, standing in Labrador Park, commemorates Singapore's rich maritime legacy. Nearby, the Reflections at Keppel Bay, a luxury waterfront residential complex whose gleaming towers and unique architecture mirror the significance of the site, serves as a modern testament to the area's historical importance, embodying the spirit of navigation and discovery that Long Ya Men once represented.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114156824127645615154/reviews
Saifu Angto,4,Nice historical point on past maritime expeditions and spots.  The surrounding walking path is great - Berlayer Creek Boardwalk and Labrador Nature Reserve.  The Bukit Chermin Boardwalk is currently closed due to a construction project.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews
