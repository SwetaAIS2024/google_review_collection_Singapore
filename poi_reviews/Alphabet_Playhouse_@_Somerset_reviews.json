My kids were so happy there that it broke my heart when we left - due to moving.  My kids still talk about Alphabet and their teachers. I remember my kids used to come home and tell me about the brain: \"Mom, did you know the brain helps you think?\"  And I would hear them sing songs and tell stories that they learned from Alphabet: \"Run, run as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the Gingerbread man.\"\n\nThis school gave my kids everything I was looking for and MORE!  Thank you for everything. ",

The teachers and staff are always friendly and helpful, and I appreciate their focus on safety and the care they provide to my kid daily. It gives a balance of play and learning and a positive influence that makes your kid thrive — highly recommended.",

I can see the care they have for all the kids, and every staff member seems to know the names of all, even if they are not their day to day teacher. The curriculum is a great balance of play and learning, and my children have spent years there running in and out every day with smiles on their faces.",
