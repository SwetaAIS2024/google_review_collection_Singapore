K C,2,"It's one of the worst sandwiches i ever had...paid $6.50 for a two-piece of toast and mashed egg.
Coffee was definitely nice, but the sandwich ruined the experience.
Not recommended at all, save money for another coffee shop.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106338028054631679675/reviews
Nichole Tan,2,"I really don’t mean to be the bad guy, but your photos really are verging on misrep. It’s going to be quite hard to continue patronising your establishment (the sandwich is so skinnie and the soup is really tiny). Please reconsider either your pricing, photos or supplier.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117528392310766293552/reviews
Henry Ng,5,"Yearning for a good sandwich on a Friday on end my work week. Googled and found this sandwich store at Marina One. Walk-in ordered over the counter, to avoid lunch buzz I decided to order for takeaway. Had an espresso that’s pretty good since I saw a good espresso machine La Marzocco. I bought the sandwich at 12.30pm, had the sandwich at home at 1.45pm, and it tasted good. The sandwich bread (Sourdough) was grilled to perfection (I can imagine if It was consumed fresh), and the filling was generous with sufficient cheese stuffed in it. They offer quite a few different sandwich type, egg mayo, Teriyaki, Hickory BBQ etc.. The service staffs were efficient. Overall service good.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118188627403947032731/reviews
Jeffrey,4,"I came for the coffee yet I decided to try their sandwich after reading some good reviews. I order their signature cheese sandwich, it was delicious and really good. Although I am expecting melted cheese but it’s good enough. The coffee is really good, I drank 2 cups. Will definitely come back for more.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114245811301243431771/reviews
Lionel Tan,4,Stopped here for a quick breakfast. Had the almond croissant that was warmed up. Also had a cafe latte. I would say that the latte was very good. The almond croissant may not have been very fresh. Good service by the staff who are efficient and polite. Price wise I paid $10 which would be on the high side.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105174264645946437106/reviews
