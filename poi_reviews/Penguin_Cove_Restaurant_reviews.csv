Kai,3,"The coffee was great. 5/5 Piping hot and stayed hot in the double walled glass mug. Cute penguin chocolate power sprinkle.

Food wise:
The strawberry tart was not as good as before. Soggy tart base and the vustard was a bit bland. 2/5

Smoked chicken ham sandwich 3/5
Spicy drumlet 2/5 Cold
Corn dog 2/5 Quite dry

Tldr, only stay for the penguin view and coffee.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103961412486889059100/reviews
"Chan Wai, ÈôàÊüÉÊ±ê",5,"The fish and chips and farm and fries are the most popular dishes. The food portion is generous and is delicious. The bake rice is not recommended. The rice is blend and the cutlet  is just full of flour. The will occasionally bump in penguin food so that the penguin will swim under water and you will get a good view of the penguins.

We ordered the penguin buns to bring home and to our surprise, we have to pay $2 for the box. We decided to skip the boxes but they only put them into individual paper bag and no carrier is given üò∞üò∞
Anyway, my kids were disappointed that the penguin buns were kind of ‚Äúdistorted‚Äù by the time we reached home. The bun only has very little fillings and mostly just bun üòÖ",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100289457793824033886/reviews
