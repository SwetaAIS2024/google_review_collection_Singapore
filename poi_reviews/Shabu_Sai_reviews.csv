Bloody Toad,4,"Nice and great pricing Shabu Shabu restaurant in Changi City Point.

The soup base is very flavorful therefore umami will sure be level over 9000. Many varieties of food to choose from. $18.90 will not have beef. SO it's good news for those who do not consume beef.
Add $2.50 for additional drinks free flow. The soft serve also tastes great although it's only one flavour , it's a great productive machine. Like!
They clear our empty trays in a great frequent manner. Nice! Then food also comes fast. No complaints here. ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113593135148233291633/reviews
Simriti Bundhoo,5,"Pro tip: Skip at least a meal before going before you would want to eat a lot to make it worth.

It's a buffet style hotpot, so everything is free flow (including meat) for 90 min (that's the time limit per table). You can also add-on free flow soft serve and drinks (non-alcoholic) for S$2.50.

Had a good time and the wait staff were nice and  quick on their feet, refilling our broth every now and then.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114463195551820846467/reviews

LongEr,5,"Daily Japan style hot pot buffet.

This place has increased its prices a bit; weekday dinner is now $25.99++, with an additional $2.5 for water and ice cream. Overall, it's still reasonably priced.

The beef is fresh, thinly sliced, and just the right thickness, so you won't feel uncomfortable after eating. The yuzu soup base is relatively light, while sukiya tends to be a bit salty. This place doesn't offer as many varieties of dishes as the one in Simei; it doesn't have lobster-flavored fish balls. Of course, true buffet connoisseurs who come with a purpose likely won't waste stomach space on vegetables.

Opting for regular beef is a wise choice because wagyu beef tends to be very fatty, and you might feel overwhelmed after just a few bites. Trying to eat enough wagyu to make it worth the price challenges the limits of human acceptance of fatty meat. However, regular beef also has its fair share of fat, which is why beef slices always look so appealing, and it's a secret profit formula for the restaurants.

Some negative reviews mention poor service because they clean up and start closing early, creating a rushed atmosphere to encourage customers to finish quickly. Customers arriving late, for instance, eating around 9:30 pm, find that the self-service water dispenser has been removed, and they have to refill their glasses manually. I don't think this is a significant issue since the waitstaff are generally polite and frequently remind customers of the last order time. Besides, when eating at home, we often pour our own water, so don't let it create unnecessary stress. Just enjoy your meal.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107257477085501290498/reviews
khaikhai123,5,"Have a wonderful dinner at shabu sai changi city point.

Both the beef and pork meat are sliced finely and fresh.
The sukiya soup are nice with their signature minced meat on the bamboo  like dishes.

They provided free flow of drinks and ice cream.

What I like the ice cream is they provide topping like rainbow rice sprinkler  ï¼Œmashmellow and cornflake.

Drink got coffee and tea and other carbonated drink like Pepsi and root beer.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115116364248656767934/reviews
