Reached the place around 8pm and surprised that the place was pretty empty.  Quick browse on the menu, quite extensive and they have set meals available. Ordered 5 dishes, 2 veg, 1 squid, 1 egg and chicken.\n\nFood didnt took long to be ready. Portion was relatively huge. Enjoyed the food but the outstanding dish for me has to be that chicken dish.\n\nOverall, food seems not bad and will likely to be back to dine again.",
