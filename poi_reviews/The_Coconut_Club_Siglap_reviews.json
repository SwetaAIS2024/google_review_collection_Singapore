The best thing about the place was the Aunty who brought us drinks and took care of us all dinner.\n\nThe sour sop drink was refreshing. We had fried chicken and the rundown both were good and recommend going with someone else so you can try both.",

The meat dishes, rendang beef and fried chicken were very good. The sayur lodeh was not to my taste. The laksa had heavy dried shrimp taste. The chendol was OK but it was too expensive. The kueh salat was quite disappointing. The green portion was hard and not lemak.\nService was good.",

My first time visiting the Siglap branch, and I must say it is still a great experience despite being a place where it is hard to find parking.\n\nThe service crew was very attentive and courteous. The environment is clean and welcoming despite being located in a small outlet.\n\nFood is good as always, despite a change of ownership. I'm pleasantly surprised that kids under five dine for free with the rice & egg set.",
