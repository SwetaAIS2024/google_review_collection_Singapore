I was informed that they would be closing in May 2025, if you are considering visiting , please call and confirm they are open\n\nVisited joe(which is owner and cook) kitchen on a random weekday night for dinner\n\nWhich such great reviews on Google, one would expect a queue during dinner time. Instead there was only 1 other diner when I visited the place. My partner says itâ€™s looks deserted and we should go somewhere else. I persisted\n\nService was absolutely stunning. Waitress was kind and polite, much more so then 5 star Michelin restaurants\n\nAtmosphere was cosy\n\nLetâ€™s talk about food , Tom yam soup was absolutely stunning. Blend of spicies dancing in your mouth. It was neither overly spicy nor overly sour, it was a perfect blend. 5/5\n\nRed curry chicken looks nice on picture but was rather disappointing. Curry was really sweet 1/5\n\nKang Kong tasted fresh and crunchy but nothing much to shout. But this is to be expected. I wonâ€™t recommend this dish as it was too over priced for what you are getting. 2/5\n\nFor all of above and 2 tea costed $40+",

Got the thai fried vermicelli and thai milk tea. Milk tea was not too sweet and vermicelli was not too oily or salty. Chef was also quite generous with adding chicken and egg. Interested to come back and try more dishes",

I walked pass by the kitchen area while went toilet and noticed the washing place is not hygiene, and the restaurant looks old. Price consider a bit high compared to others (not food courts / hawker)",

      "text": "Mango salad is probably the best that I have ever tried - thinly sliced with the right texture (between ripe and unripe mangoes) and balanced taste (not too spicy). Tofu soup was not bad. Claypot prawn vermicelli was generous in portion with six large prawns but the taste was rather one-dimensional. Service was OK. The restaurant was quite messy inside so the ambience was almost non existent.",
