Fiona,5,"Pat's Pub by Sensi is a hidden gem! The cozy atmosphere immediately makes you feel at home, and the friendly staff go out of their way to ensure you have a great experience. Those who love to sing.... sing away! They have a great library of songs on Karaoke. Hungry? You'll be spoke for choice with the incredible Japanese food – fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Best way to describe Pat's.... ""Where everybody knows your name"" Highly recommend for anyone who appreciates Japanes food, great drinks and a welcoming vibe!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113741462097849668351/reviews
