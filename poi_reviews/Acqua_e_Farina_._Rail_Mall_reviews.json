      "text": "This is a \"hidden gem\" of Italy in Singapore. Each visit is a fresh reminder of how good pasta and pizza in Italy can taste. There are truly few italian restaurants in Singapore that can deliver this authentic experience. They really do their basics of tomato sauce, al dente pasta, pizza dough well, and their attention to fresh ingredients cap it off. I  love the trattoria style - homey and down-to-earth; chef Roberto and Antonio (before he left to open their 2nd restaurant at Keong Saik) would also come round the tables to check in. Conviviality is the spirit of this place - lovely, and truly alive.",

Everything was fresh, yummy and balanced. Service was excellent and staff were extremely friendly yay! Hung streamers for a Birthday and even gave us an ice cream and fried doughnuts on the house ðŸŽ‰ Pricy but worth it for the special occasion :) will be back!",

The dishes were will portioned and the fresh made pasta was lovely as usual.\n\nOur meal was more expensive than usual as we ordered a bottle of nice wine from Acqua e Farina.\n\nItâ€™s always a pleasure to have a meal there. Many thanks to Chef Roberto and the attentive staff.",

Both were amazing, especially the fettuccine!\nAlso appreciated how the pastas were split for us.\n\nEnded off the night with a dessert platter, which was decently portioned for 2. Loved every dessert on the platter. The platter also came with the fresh Italian doughnuts which we loved.\n\nWould love to return and try the other pastas someday! Can't go wrong with any.",

When we informed them that we were going to share the pasta and steak, they served the pasta in two separate plates. After we were done with the pasta, they served the steak. Both the mains were good.\n\nThe staff offered us the desserts menu after that and we had a delicious dessert platter.",
