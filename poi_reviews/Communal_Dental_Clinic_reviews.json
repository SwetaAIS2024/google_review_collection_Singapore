      "text": "I have been 'gently' told by the dentist here to get my wisdom tooth extracted but they did not once tell me the urgency and implications nor did they get me to do teeth x-ray. I thus had no knowledge of the severity how the wisdom tooth had impacted the neighbouring tooth, until I went to the polyclinic for regular scaling and polishing where the dentist promptly got me to do a teeth x-ray that exposed the dire situation and that made me quickly get the wisdom tooth extracted. But damage has already been done far and deep to the 'neighbouring' tooth. If only the dentist here had done the basics like asking me to do a teeth x-ray and explaining to me the consequences, I would be able to make an informed decision and wouldn't have to go thru this whole daunting experience + burn a huge hole in the wallet!",

I have always spent hours queuing up in the morning (no booking allowed) for my annual scaling and polishing as the dentist is exceptionally detailed and thorough. For this year's appointment, I made a booking for the afternoon slot and to my surprise, Dr Shane is also super detailed, and he made me feel very comfortable. Both dentists at this clinic are great. Thanks!",
