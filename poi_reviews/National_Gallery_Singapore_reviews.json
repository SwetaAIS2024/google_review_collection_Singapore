It was fascinating exploring the building as there is a combination of old and new design elements and several of the old ballrooms and official spaces are able to be visited too. The staff were helpful at pointing interesting things out to us too which was nice as well.\n\nBe sure to head up to the rooftop terrace for some great views over to the skyline and across Marina Bay.",
