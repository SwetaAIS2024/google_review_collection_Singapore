Vee 祐宁 L,5,"Ordered drumstick noodles with ‘kian’, $6.20.
Chicken is soft, noodles no big deal. Got pork lard which I love.

I ever tried their chicken drumstick porridge, yummy too.
Overall not bad la.

Ample sheltered parking as it’s a new block.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108165100612773637428/reviews
Song Hui,3,"Rice was cooked. Not hard nor soft. Sadly not as fragrance as I expected as a chicken “rice”

Meat was a little bit lesser than I thot vs price.

Chili was not sour nor flavour enough. But at least is decent

Hard boil Egg was a little bit hard

Veg is still ok",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102889091147091208541/reviews
Ivan Low,5,"Ordered the chicken cutlet rice. I love the soup, tastes good in my opinion. Chicken cutlet and chilli was good too. However $5 for just chicken rice and fried chicken cutlet is a bit plain… Sadly inflation and rent is killing everything",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110005553739647465764/reviews
Alan Tan,1,"Tried many times and the chicken is often undercooked.

Store has difficulty to take and perform order correctly. Often request for “remove bone” or porridge but end up with entire different order.  Can you believe I order chicken porridge but he give me chicken noodle?

Try at your own risk",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115761301423060203310/reviews
Durgashini,5,"One of a kind chicken rice, served with fragrant rice, and flavoured soup with corn and potato. Love the chilli sauce it is a 10/10. Fresh chicken, tender and moist. Very cleanly prepared gizzards and fresh. Definitely a must try! Only cost $4, and $1 for gizzard.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108126900551659785402/reviews
