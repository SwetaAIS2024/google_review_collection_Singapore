William Lu,5,"Should put the entrance door clearer. It doesn't seem like an entrance door. I needed to look properly to find it. Entrance is only from outside, one small door.

Many varieties inside the store itself, price is quite competitive. It was a neat store. Accept cashless payment here.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews

Shane Sou,3,"I visit here often to get my essentials, great place to be honest. What really bugs me is that I tried to get my morning coffee at 8:20am today, but the door is locked with the store keeper at the back texting. Couldn‚Äôt get her attention no matter how much I knocked or waved. I‚Äôm sure that they are definitely open at this timing because this doesn‚Äôt happen when it‚Äôs the other store keepers. Disappointing.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113838226612501026193/reviews
