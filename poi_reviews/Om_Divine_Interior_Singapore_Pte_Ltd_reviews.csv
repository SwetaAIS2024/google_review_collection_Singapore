Churchill Parthiban,5,"The altar looks really beautiful. Everything is arranged so nicely, and it feels peaceful just looking at it. The lights, flowers, and decorations show a lot of love and care. It’s a lovely place to pray and feel calm.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102640618371676242971/reviews
Jai Rajathy,5,I was sourcing out for prayers alters in malaysia and then came across Om Divine Interior in singapore. When compared the pricing locally was cheaper and was quite reasonable price. They did an amazing job because I asked to customise my alter. Everyone was like wow so nice. I truly recommend their service.

Sangeetha Sri,1,"Extremely disappointing experience with this company. They completed the renovation of my altar room in December 2025 and partial in jan 2025 , but since then, I've been trying to get them to return and rectify some issues. Despite numerous promises to come and fix the problems, they've consistently failed to show up, making excuses every time. It's now April, and I'm still waiting for them to make things right. Their lack of follow-through and poor communication has left a bad experience",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111068945526678101320/reviews
Ram Raja,5,"Thank you 🙏🏽 to Guna bro and team for the excellent work on my Alter. 😍😍😍😍😍😍
They customised the alter for me better than expected.
I had many compliments from friends and relatives on their beautiful work.
My request was very last minute but yet Mr Guna understood my situation and helped to ensure that my alter was all ready including doing wiring before my prayers.
I would highly recommend his work! It’s truly a masterpiece. ⛓️Sangali Karuppar Thunai⛓️",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107764968598982269565/reviews
Rajeswari Shanmugam,5,Asked for the design I wanted and the alter was made far more to my expectations met. Beautifully crafted work piece. Very good services rendered by Guna the boss and his assistants. Good work. Will surely and strongly recommend Om Divine Interiors to those who are searching for made to measure god alters. God bless the company. Om Nama Shivaya 🙏🏽,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110730613303960166040/reviews
