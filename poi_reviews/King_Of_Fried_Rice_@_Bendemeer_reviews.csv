Josh Kuek (#jkgourmets),4,"King of Fried Rice was one of the most popular new food brand past few years. Yes. The taste of fried rice was good, unfortunately just not much eggs, overall ingredients was very simple it taste was not bad and acceptable.

Fortunately, their pork cutlet was really tasty and well seasoning, tender, juicy and delicious. Combination with simple eggs fried rice was overall okay. Tasty and delicious.

Unfortunately, the pricing was not so affordable and over pricing. For me, especially in this old neighborhood, $6 or lesser will be  ideal. Anyway, if you okay with their high pricing, I am recommend, otherwise not.

Kian Hoong Ee,3,"I bought 4 set of pork chop fried rice; but their fried rice is pre-cooked, compared to other outlets, so the food quality below average, I hope their boss can do the routine check.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116995141627649816442/reviews
Djoeis Shi,5,"Cheap and good! Just pay a fraction of the famous Taiwanese restaurant, you will get a quite similar one at a much lower price!

King of fried rice is a place to go for commoners who like the DTF styled fried rice.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111128052716293687431/reviews
Wee Guan Kho,3,"Brought my overseas friend here cos his colleague recommended him to try.

Not impressed with the fried rice, it‚Äôs not bad just that it‚Äôs oily and salty.
My friend shared the same thoughts too.

Would prefer DYF over this.
This would just be a cheaper options to DTF.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100019001441662947499/reviews
Wanga,4,"üçö Food & Taste: It is quite a decent plate of fried rice.
The fragrant egg taste in the fried rice is not very strong like DTF or Wok Hei but definitely better than (or even considered the best) many stalls around the area. The egg inside egg fried rice is generous. The rice used is still the same short grain rice as DTF. I would say if you want fried rice in this area, this should be the best place to buy from.

The pork cutlet is good! I‚Äôd say it is very very much like the one found at DTF. Thumbs up for it.
The chilli given is also good.

üìç Place: It is located in one of the coffee shops once you exit from Boon Keng MRT exit B. The coffeeshop has many stalls but hardly any seats so the next best option would be to opt for takeaway, which I did.

ü§µüèª Service: Service is alright. Just make payment at the cashier / with person collecting your order. Staff is usually very patient. Kudos to them for trying their best to cook each order fast enough and working in such heat in the kitchen. Please note only cash payments here. No electronic payments accepted here :/

üíµ Price: $7.20 for egg fried rice with pork cutlet (takeaway)

üê£Waiting Time: This is after all still a popular hawker brand for fried rice, so the waiting time can be long. Physical queue cannot be seen since they used the electronic queue system whereby you pay for your order and you will be given a number to collect later, which is great so you do not have to stand around there to wait. You can go buy something else in the area and collect your food later.

Will definitely return again to try out the other flavours because the texture of rice is still good.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109266329478172341849/reviews
