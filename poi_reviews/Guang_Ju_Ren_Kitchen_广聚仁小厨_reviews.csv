HM Choo,4,The 豆腐脑is interesting. Usually the tau huay we eat is sweet. This is salty. They add preserved vegetables etc. Would say it's quite refreshing. I haven't seen other stalls that sell it in this way. There's a wide variety of other items they sell. Most are standard dishes that can be found in other 凉拌stores.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105253344514999420082/reviews
Wei xiong Wang,5,"豆腐腦 Uncongealed Tofu

广聚仁小厨
📍 4 Defu Lane 10, Singapore 539185

🍜 Food wise: One wasn't expecting too much once again, and this is the first time one has tried 豆腐腦, it was delicious! Interesting!

So it is basically savoury tau huay with preserved vegetables, coriander, pretty good! One still had the option to add more flavour, chili!

This stall does serve some other delicious dishes too!

✨ Ambience wise: Some huge eating house, was told that this eating house has a few other gems like fish soup and chicken rice. Shall try one day.

🤵🏻 Service wise:  Great!

💵 Price wise:  Affordable!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100695078669204769827/reviews
