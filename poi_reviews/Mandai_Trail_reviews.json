This is the closest to 'walking in the woods' you can get here. Don't be put off by the seemingly nonstop up & down terrains(mountain bikers' favourite) throughout as they are mostly mild slope, only issue is that hikers & bikers share the same path for the most part. So advisable to trek in groups that the bikers could see you from far and adjust their speed accordingly.",
