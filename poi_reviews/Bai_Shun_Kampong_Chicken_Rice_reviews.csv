JK Chow (Jingzyy),4,"A pleasant surprise that we stumbled on because we made a detour due to the qing ming crowd. Ate the chicken rice with steamed kampong chicken and fried chicken and found it surprisingly good! The meat was tender, and the sauce enhanced the flavour. Soup was a great pairing as well! It's a little out of the way, but it also means there isn't much of a crowd. Good price!

Bernard Lim,1,"One of the worst chicken rice. Dry, no fragrance, kampung chicken was also bad. Saving grace was the peanut soup.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117750931718255847749/reviews
