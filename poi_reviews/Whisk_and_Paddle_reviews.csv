Catherine Tan,4,"Went there for an early lunch, and oh my, it was really crowded even before 12 pm. We ordered 3 pasta, namely the mushroom aglio olio, vongole linguine, and vongole marinara. For both the vongole pasta, they are really valued for $$. It's hard to find a vongole pasta that comes with so much vongole. Taste-wise, they were great too, though I would recommend vongole linguine over the marinara one. We also ordered the fried calamari. It was good, but I wish they could cut the calamari even smaller so that it's easier to eat and chew. Overall, it's not cheap, but the food quality made up for it. Great place for families for occasional splurging.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108571598741145831471/reviews
Laine Lui,4,"Service staff were friendly and food came quite quickly.
Bread basket blew me away! Each kind of bread was very well done - freshly baked/warmed with nice buttery-salty flavour
Duck confit was fine - meat was tender and well seasoned, but thought the risotto was a bit too creamy
Italian sodas were refreshing.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101567132677209992181/reviews
Zackery Goh,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Whisk & Paddle, and I can confidently say it was an exceptional experience from start to finish! The ambiance is warm and inviting, making it the perfect spot for a cozy dinner or a casual brunch with friends.

The menu offers a delightful variety of dishes, all crafted with fresh, high-quality ingredients. I tried their signature pancakes, and they were simply divine—fluffy, flavorful, and beautifully presented. My partner had the avocado toast, which was equally delicious and packed with taste.

What truly stood out was the attentive service. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent recommendations. The staff genuinely seemed to care about our dining experience, which made the visit even more enjoyable.

To top it all off, the coffee was outstanding—rich and aromatic, it perfectly complemented our meals. I can't wait to return to Whisk & Paddle to explore more of their menu and indulge in another fantastic meal. Highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for great food and a welcoming atmosphere!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109405400403426765330/reviews
Choon Kit Leong,4,"Visited this place for lunch yesterday on Good Friday. The queue was very long and the entire restaurant was full to its bream. The staff were very effective and manage the queue very well.

The food we ordered came quite swiftly and the taste remained good like before despite the crowd.

It is surprising and also commendable that it was well run and maintained a good standard on a crowded public holiday.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105403566482999279179/reviews
S.Y,4,"Bringing a pet out is like bringing a baby, sometimes forget to bring this and that, forget to take photos of my food, how can! 😆

Had a few of their dishes and these were some that I remember to take of.

𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗽𝗮𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝘀𝘂𝗻𝗻𝘆 𝘀𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝘂𝗽, sausages a bit off can't taste much of it, the rest were good.

Always like their 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝗮𝗹𝗮 𝗰𝗮𝘂𝗹𝗶𝗳𝗹𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿, go try if you have not! Their 𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗶 thinks the seasoning is not strong enough.

They were so nice upon seeing me with my pet, brought a pet chair for her 🥰

If you are looking for a pet-friendly cafe, you can come here though they don't sell food for pets but I feel this is good enough le, walked in the park can come here eat and relax.
