Song,4,"The rosti lives up to its hype. The smoky ham and cheese sandwich was perfect.

However, the pork bacon carbonara was disappointing if youâ€™re expecting authentic carbonara from this place. The carbonara consisted of CREAM instead of egg yolk and pecorino romano cheese. At this price point, I definitely expected more.

The artisanal smoked salmon sandwich was alright. The salmon and bread were fresh and delicious but the amount of cream cheese was minimal. Their competitor (Paris Bag**tte) definitely does better in terms of that.

Staff was friendly and nice environment that makes you feel like youâ€™re in Switzerland.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117148391154119526449/reviews
Richard W,5,"Pretty sure most people go here for the rÃ¶sti based on the linesâ€”I certainly only walk into a MarchÃ© if I crave rÃ¶sti. Theyâ€™re as excellent as I remember. Potatoes are machine-shredded in front of you and then put into a well-oiled smoking-hot cast iron pan. As a result, the potatoes brown and crisp up way better than on a skillet or flat top. Itâ€™s a hash brown but 10x better. The market- and farm-themed decor is super charming, with cow statues and all.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100281625767956045510/reviews
A J,5,"The restaurant is in the basement of the Somerset building. It serves European food, Spanish, Swiss, Italian, German. There will be a sign on the table to change to if you want to sit at that table. Then walk to choose the food from the booths you are interested in. Use the stamp card. When you are done eating, take the card to pay at the cashier.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113569366205788855440/reviews
Janchicsiken,3,"Will not recommend the seafood platter...it was too small for the price of $35.90++. You get half a fillet of salmon and bass, 5 pieces of calamari, some chunks of roasted potatoes and eggplant covered in a spicy sauce, 2 prawns. The rosti station had the longest queue, as expected. The garlic pork sausage didn't have the usual snap you get when you bite into a sausage. The food smell lingers on your clothes and bags after. Overall not a great experience ðŸ˜”",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110122050620611948477/reviews
Ankori,1,"We were there for early dinner like before 5. The rosti was burnt, the chorizo was super dry like been left there for air dried a few hours . The mushroom was the only good to taste . Chicken schnitzel is still the best . All the counters look dull but it came alive when we were leaving at about 7. Look like we have to be there at a right time for all the food to be served fresh and nicely cooked instantly . And for the ladies if you need to use the rest room , careful with the second and third cubicle doors it overlaps each other and if someone is not aware you are trying to closed your door and open the second cubicle door your hand could be sandwich between the 2 doors . Itâ€™s painful for an adult imagine if itâ€™s a child . Overall not a very pleasant visit today.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106937314843008324475/reviews
