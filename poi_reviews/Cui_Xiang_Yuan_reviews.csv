Whatever You say,4,"Just visited this estate out of random and chanced upon this very old school restaurant. Ordered from the white hair uncle before sitting down and opening up the Google map review. At first I was scared after looking at the negative reviews that this uncle would not cook what we have ordered from him as he didn't acknowledge or say anything when we told him our orders. To our relief, the food came in about 15 mins time. The Sweet & Sour Fish Rice and the San Lau Horfun taste good to be honest, it has this ""wok hey"" taste which is quite rare in most of the local tze char stalls. We decided to takeaway the salted egg prawn which we have waited for about 20 mins. The uncle was telling us ""‰∏çË¶ÅÁúãÊàëÔºåÁúãÂ§ñÈù¢ÔºåÂ•Ω‰∫Ü"" when the takeaway is ready and made us LOL. Overall the salted egg prawn taste good but it is a little too spicy and pricey at $18. Would recommend if you don't mind the eccentric uncle's attitude but I guess food is decent enough to attract some people back.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115784704512979476478/reviews

Hans Y,1,"Food is good (ordered from Grab before). But the In-dining service is appalling. I see several stories here with the white haired uncle, so i‚Äôm not the first to experience his ‚Äúservice‚Äù.
I arrived a bit before my friend, so I ordered a soup first. White haired uncle refused to take my order, he says must order all at once, otherwise the paper is too expensive.... huh... joke?
10min later my friend arrives, then we order additional dish. After 40 (!!!) minutes of waiting (and i see other people who arrived after us already been served), i asked him where our food is. He says must wait, or you want cancel? I was so furious, i said cancel it. And left to go to a much nicer resto.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106494352753614469695/reviews
Desmond Ho,4,"Pretty old school zichar in an old run down coffeeshop corner.

Not the friendliest uncle taking the order but food was served pretty quick.

One of the better tasting salted egg üêî - definitely #musteat

Skip the pig trotters beehoon as it somewhat lacked the oomph!

Sweet and sour pork was nicely done though I prefer more onions to go with it but oh well....",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117504934010715347794/reviews
