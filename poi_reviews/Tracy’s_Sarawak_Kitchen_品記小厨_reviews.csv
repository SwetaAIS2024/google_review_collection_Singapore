Lim Jaspar,3,"Non aircon, coffeeshop. Ordered Tomato Wok Hey Kway Teow. It is a unique twist to the traditional seafood hor fun, with the base being tomato. Taste is sour and tangy, in an appetising way. Surprised to find char siew in it, which added sweetness on top of sour. Prawns are fresh and firm. There is a charred feel to the kway teow, although I would not go so far to say is wok hey. Added an egg (+$1) which when beaten, the yolk further creams over the kway teow. Overall acceptable, added 1 more star for uniqueness.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115142463215299263560/reviews

Darren Cheong,3,"Surprisingly, this is not the best Sarawak Kolok Mee Iâ€™ve had in Singapore. The char siew and minced pork lack fragrance.

The Mani Cai is okay. Can taste the pork oil taste overpowering cause me unable to taste the Mani + egg + garlic (authentic taste)

The Laksa has a heavier 'asam' taste compared to the usual one I had at Bedok/Sengkang.

The portion is okay, but the ingredients are so-so (egg, taugeh, and chicken meat). Ermm... the two fresh prawns are very good.

Price-wise, it's average.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111136407063098297690/reviews
Hoong Wai Wong,5,"Food is good. Besides the normal sarawak kolo noodles, they have the crispy noodles and tomato broth versions. The tomato version is interesting, gives a tangy taste to the mix for wok hei hor fun.

The money cai with egg has a crunchy bite, makes it easier to chew the normally fibrous vegetable. The braised meat has a good  mix of fatty and lean meat, nice!

Kolo mee is good, overall can eat!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106237336061537561898/reviews
Rod3y,5,"If you are looking for home-cooked-style dishes, this restaurant might align with your expectations. The dishes here are not only affordable but very delicious, especially with the sunny fried egg on top. Try it. It's worth it!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112580360665282783020/reviews
