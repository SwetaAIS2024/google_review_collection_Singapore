While I was queuing up, notice many people were eating the wanton noodle from this stall. Queue moved pretty slow, as the stall was operated just by 1 person. Wanton noodle starts from SGD$3.50 onwards. Apart from the standard wanton noodle, they also served braised chicken feet and dumpling.\n\nNoodle was nicely cooked. Texture of noodle was springy. The sauce has that old school taste to it. Wanton was flavorful. A pity that the charsiew was too dry.Overall, I think that it was an above average wanton noodle, no wonder it was so popular with the residents.",
