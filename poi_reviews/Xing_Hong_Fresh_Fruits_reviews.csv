Cephas See,1,"Ordered some fruits from them for the first time as a gift for my relatives via facebook.

They were delivered today. To be fair, most of them came in good condition. However, one of the cherries I ordered came in a bad condition (refer pics).

Called & had a discussion with seller & his attitude was extremely bad - He was rude & arrogant & did not make an effort for customer service.

Essentially, the point made was he felt the Chile Rainer cherries were acceptable/normal & that I did not know about the cherries. He hung up abruptly at the end, telling me to go down by today to settle the issue.

Very disappointing experience & definitely will not recommend this shop.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102294235789008259599/reviews
Ryker Yuen,1,"Was recommended by friend and entice by their FB Live saying ""this sweet, that sweet""; ""this juicy, that juicy""; ""this the best, that the best"", ""only once a year""...

Went to the store directly and spent over $100 without doubt, but came home with disappointment even my young girls not impressed. Not sweet, damaged fruits, so so quality...

Save your money, you can buy better quality fruits from Cold Storge easily and even cheaper with the same fruits they were selling.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101753449419312708083/reviews

Mekhala Hm,1,"Ask for recommendation for oranges. Auntie recommended 2 types, and I bought both types. The oranges tasted rotten, so I returned the oranges, and Auntie told me 不好吃你拿回来啊. This is the respond I get from auntie. At least address the problem and be responsible for what u recommended.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115350577291925647248/reviews
Jes Choo,5,Boss Eric is such a humble person.  He personally delivered my small order of fruits to me today.  He is such an amazing person as he will go all the way out to answer all my queries even though it is already past midnight.    I hereby thank Eric very much for going above n beyond.   Eric is a hardworking n  enterprising young man who has built his business in a very honest manner.  I hv written my order wrongly as 7 lemons for $10  but Eric will bill me according to his price of 10 lemons for $7 instead.  My order of strawberries was very fresh n sweet.   Keep up yr good work Eric.  I will support u all the way! 加油!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116934346410958130163/reviews
