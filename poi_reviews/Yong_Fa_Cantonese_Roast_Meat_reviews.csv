Dawn Lim,5,"Excellent roast duck. Juicy flesh, crispy skin. Roast pork is very good too. Char siew is a little too sweet for me but definitely well caramelised. My 3 treasures rice with extra meat cost $8, but is quite worth it considering the generous meat portions. The soup on the side is sichuan vegetable soup. It's free and quite yummy though you can certainly taste the MSG.

Conclusion: Love the duck! Will be back!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113563695447323499189/reviews
Matthew Lee,5,"Damn good char siew!

Still that same fat juicy caramelized char siew that I remember from 22. As for their Sio bak. Just remember to tell auntie not to smother it with any sauces. Best served plain on plain white rice or with ice cold beer or stout.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102172941439658597090/reviews
Joanne Koo,4,"Pretty good, although best roast duck have herbal taste. Crispy skin but short of 5 star. Short drive away you can find crispy herbal taste roast duck. Half duck $23. Whole duck is $45.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112905022887760925981/reviews
TJ West,4,Definitely under rated. One of the best Cantonese Roast Meat stall u can find. U will not regret. They rest on Sunday. Yes they are back in business!!! The location shown here is wrong! It is situated at another Coffeeshop. But the stall owner doesn't care about this map error.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108487676548090983800/reviews
Tinker Werkz,1,"An insincere apology was given from the lady at the stall when i questioned her why she served another person who cut the queue.

I am sure this is the start of lots of negative reviews coming up.
Food was decent all along. I always enjoyed the roasted duck, The roasted pork not so great, as it doesn't melt in the mouth.
Their standards may have fallen or others may have simply improved their recipe.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103983591892601085239/reviews
