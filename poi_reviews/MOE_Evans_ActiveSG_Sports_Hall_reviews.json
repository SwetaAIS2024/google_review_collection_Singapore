The tables are average only, though. Table 7 is slightly better and it's net is also usable as of Apr-2025. It would be better to bring own nets for certain tables since the provided nets are not good. It could be quite hot in the afternoon and evening, also and some tables will reflect evening sun; slightly cooler in night time 7 to 10pm as of Apr-2025.",
