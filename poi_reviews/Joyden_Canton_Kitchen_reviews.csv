Wong,5,Was here on Mother’s Day weekend and the food took quite a while to be served. Every dish we ordered was delicious except the olive fried rice. It was too oily and salty for us.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117371414634904431515/reviews

Chua Bernard,4,"This is one Chinese Restaurant that serve really good and worthy Cantonese Cuisine in a heartland area. Especially their signature Moonlight Rice Vermicelli With Egg White and Scallop.. an rather unique and flavourful dish.

Their Dim Sum dishes were also surprisely good, like their Fried Shrimp Wanton (Crunchy exteriors, succulent, flavourful fillings) , Carrot Cake, Deep Fried Yam Puff with Minced Pork (Good Texture) and Pork Porridge (Smooth textured & flavorful).

Also like their Lychee Sweet & Sour Pork (Crispy Crust, Tender Cubed Meat and well balanced sauce mixture).

They have a team of attentive service staffs thus the overall lunch experience was good.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116763827953354833238/reviews
Tiffany Lim,1,"I recently ordered take-away fish congee and was looking forward to enjoy a comforting meal. However, I was quite disappointed with the portion size. The portion was so small that it was even below half a bowl! For the price I paid, I expected much more! Totally unacceptable.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115701817233186530838/reviews
Evangeline Tan,4,"First impressions are very important and sadly Joyden’s staff, Paul, failed to make a good first impression. When I asked him for recommendations, it’s like “Just look at the top 10 lor” kind of attitude. He just strode off and didn’t even linger around to recommend their dishes. No smiles, no passions, no pride of dishes served by Joyden. Thankfully, the female waitresses made up for this lack of service by Paul. They were very friendly, enthusiastic and serve each dish with a smile! That’s why I still rate a 4 star overall though tempted to give them a 3 star. I was also tempted to give a 2 star for service but it would not be fair to these ladies. The ambience is nice, quiet and pleasant, no rowdy customers. I came for the moonlight beehoon and it tasted much better than the takeaway I had at a recent meetup. The cod fish was fresh, served with ginger and spring onions, great combination! However, I didn’t quite like the Foshan coconut chicken soup which was cooked with coconut water, it didn’t have a sweet taste but rather a queer taste. I would try another soup if I were to visit again. I didn’t manage to take a picture of the Yam Paste dessert but my mum loves it! All 3 desserts that I ordered were actually very good!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106532653439880681935/reviews
