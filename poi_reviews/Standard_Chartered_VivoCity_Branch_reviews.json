Came all the way to the branch to get help with a query that I couldn’t resolve on the app, the counter staff (with much irritation) insisted I go through the app to submit my request, fine. It’s been more than 1 week and no reply from the bank. Tried to call the hotline, even worse, useless and makes it so hard to reach an actual service staff. Worst bank, probably will cancel my card zzzzz",

After receiving a letter regarding the outstanding mortgage on my housing loan, I attempted to call today more than five times to seek clarification. Each time, I was kept on hold by the AI system for over 10 minutes, and I was unable to speak to a customer service officer.\n\nIt is highly frustrating to receive a letter urging action but have no accessible way to resolve the matter promptly. I expect your team to address this issue immediately and provide a direct way for me to communicate with a representative.\n\nI trust this matter will be prioritized and resolved without further delay.",
