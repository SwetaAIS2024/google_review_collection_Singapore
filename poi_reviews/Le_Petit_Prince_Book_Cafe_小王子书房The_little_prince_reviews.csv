Regene Thong,5,"This little book cafe have a very good environment, is quiet and you can study or working there. There are variety of books even comic. You can bring your child here to have a reading time after school or weekend. The minimum spending here is a cup of drink. I have my late lunch there, the spaghetti is superb and hot chocolate is so nice! The staff also very friendly and we have a chat there to know more about this book cafe. Please keep it up, is another good choice for me for work beside those coffee cafe.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110895254943729939023/reviews

Bhumika Jethnani,5,"I love this place!! I‚Äôve been coming here for years and the owner has changed three times. But I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs stayed open. With this latest owner, I feel the menu has become better and the staff (Yasmin & Liza) are sooo friendly. They made the effort to remember my name and my order and always talk to me and ask me how I‚Äôm doing. I love coming here to study. üòçüòçüòçüòç Attaching some pictures of the food I‚Äôve tried here.

Adam Hor,5,"Wonderful place filled with artistic vibes. Me and my mates been there last week, the owner was super sweet, she served us with lots of complimentary dishes. The purpose of this place is not mainly about commercial and business, it‚Äôs for meeting new people and new experiences, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so special. Highly recommend to spend an afternoon here with the coffee. This is a good place to relief your stress.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100602634569265744048/reviews
