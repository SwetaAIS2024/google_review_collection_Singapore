Philip Kwok,5,"1st time ordering with Oceanwaves. Next day delivery.
The items were received frozen and fresh.
The prawns were adult hand sized - Tiger prawns 18 pieces and ang kar 13 pieces. Ordered 1kg of each.
The sea bass was descaled, gutted and cleaned.
Will definitely order again when the need/occasion arises.
Thank you Joanna for coordinating my order.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104391519206710421512/reviews

El An,5,"Thanks to Oceanwaves, we’ve completed our first round of hotpot feast!

Lovely quality for the beef short-plate slice, pork belly and pork collar shabu.
Thankful for the recommendation of the Hamachi Collars! Super easy to prep.
Thaw it, salt it, oil it, air-fryer it. Yums!

Will definitely order again for the coming CNY festivities. Can’t wait to try the sea bass that’s recommended but we decided against it the last order.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113070358460314804309/reviews
