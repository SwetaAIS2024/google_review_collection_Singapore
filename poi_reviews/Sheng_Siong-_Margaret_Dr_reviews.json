For such a large branch, it is surprising that the selection of fruits and vegetables are rather limited. Good selection of live and frozen seafood though. The non-perishables such as alcohol and canned food have a wide variety too.",

He took a trolley and started stacking the drinks and even offloaded it at my car. Very thankful for him because I was just recovering from a flu and feeling very weak. But I really needed to get the order.",
