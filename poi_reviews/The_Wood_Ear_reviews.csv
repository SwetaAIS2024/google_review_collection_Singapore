Chewielicious T,5,"Jesper is a true artist, weaving his personal inspiration into every dish he creates. I've had the pleasure of dining here 3 times, each with a completely different, specially curated menu that never fails to surprise and impress.

The attention to detail, thought, and passion that he puts into every plate truly showcases his pride as a chef. It’s an honor to experience his work firsthand—thank you, Jesper, for the unforgettable meals. Can’t wait to be back!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112973732117339181795/reviews

This was a very nice private dining experience where the dishes were inspired from Cantonese cuisine (I’d assume the menu changes from time to time). The 8 course meal was sort of divided into 2 starters, 4 mains and 2 desserts. We were very full by the end of the meal and Chef Jasper was kind enough to enable takeaway for some of the leftovers. The courses were really well made right from the starters to the desserts. Among the savoury items, the lobster course and the main rice course were fantastic. I absolutely loved one of the dessert dishes too which was an egg crumble.

This is a BYOB place and you can enjoy the drinks you bring with no corkage.

Service was absolutely fantastic with Chef Jasper taking superb care of us and letting us enjoy the meal properly without any rush at all. The chef also catered to my allergies by changing the ingredients of 2 courses, and then going above and beyond by replacing one whole course with a new dish just for me.

Overall, a really great private dining place which I’d highly recommend.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117541567004086369769/reviews
