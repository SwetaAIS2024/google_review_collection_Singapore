I called a number of pest control company but only 1800NoPest responded. Pin Pin managed to arrange their technician to work OT for my case (thank God)\nTechnician Mathi arrived at my place 25 minutes later and he managed the situation professionally. He was very polite and did his work with confident. I was very worried and he was friendly enough to calm me down.\nThe procedure took only 10 minutes. I think I was supposed to sweep off the dead bees but I was too scared so Mathi did it for me. ðŸ˜¬\nIn short, thank you 1800NoPest for providing service very quickly and professionally.",

      "text": "A friend of mine had engaged 1800NoPests services and i found out about the service provided by their technician Andy. Andy came to my place to work on the cockroach infestation on the 1st appointment. He was very friendly and excellent in his job. He was very diligent and meticulous to look for all the entry points that gave access to the cockroaches into my house - even tiny gaps which I myself don't notice.  I could see his determination to do his best to help his client to solve their pest problem. To my relief, his service was very effective and produced results. For the 2nd treatment session, he came with his colleague Yusri. Both were friendly, helpful and excellent in their job. Andy was also willing to address the concerns and queries of his client, which is very important for customer service. I have much confidence in them that their service is reliable and I therefore was willing to take up a maintenance service contract with them. Also thanks to Anna who is always so prompt and patient to attend to my queries.",
