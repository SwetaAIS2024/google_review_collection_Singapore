      "text": "We celebrated our anniversary here with the $88++ tasting menu (around $105 after GST and service charge). The little hand-written popsicle stick was a nice memento for us to bring home.\n\nWe got a corner seat and came in earlier, which made it feel like we were in someone‚Äôs home, enjoying a meal from a private chef. The ingredients were vibrant, and the way everything was charred brought out the amazing flavours‚Äî especially in the vegetable dishes, which I preferred over the meat ones.\n\nWe love this concept of Middle Eastern meets Japanese. It blends the clean, subtle taste of Japanese cuisine with the bold spices and comforting techniques of Middle Eastern cooking.\n\nHere are the items we had as part of the Feeeeed Me! menu:\n1. Pita\n2. Babaganoush\n3. Chickpea Hummus\n4. Mentaiko Taramasalata\n5. Burrata di Puglia ‚≠êÔ∏è\n6. Roasted Brussels Sprouts ‚≠êÔ∏è\n7. Stockyard's Angus Ribeye\n8. Wood-grilled fillet of Aquanaria Atlantic Seabass\n9. Charcoal prawns ‚≠êÔ∏è\n10. Jujeh Chicken Wings\n11. Pandan Basque Cheesecake\n\nIt‚Äôs exciting that the menu has changed over time and we got to try new things with our tried & true favourites, and it‚Äôs slowly becoming a comfort spot for us. Excellent meal‚Äîthank you for the experience!",

The sauce was interesting and did not overpower the meat flavour.\n\nCharcoal grilled prawns and octopus were quite good too. However octopus was a little over cooked and a little too charred.",

      "text": "Last night‚Äôs dinner at Habibi-san was something else. My partner and I went to celebrate my birthday, so we ordered the $88/pax omakase option on the menu. It was an amazing choice. We were served 3 dips, 2 sides, 2 skewers, prawns, pork, duck, and beef. The serving sizes for everything was definitely smaller than the a la carte sizes, but this allowed us to try many different things at the same time.\n\nThe food was 200% out of this world. Every single element was so so so perfectly cooked. We enjoyed every single item and demolished the whole meal, and wiped every plate clean.\n\nThe restaurant was super crowded though, so service took awhile to take our food and drink orders. But understandably so - so not a big deal.\n\nBig thanks to Hakim for making our night really enjoyable. Thank you for taking our drink orders and trying our suggestions! Hope you‚Äôll never see a Manhattan the same way again esp with muddled cherries üòâ",

Another noteworthy dish is their specials for the night, the gnocchi which was pan seared crispy (?) and unique. we would definitely come back here again",

      "text": "Came here for dinner and I must say the food and flavors were amazing.  Love how bold the flavors are, from the dips, to the Brussels sprouts, skewers and main dishes. My top favorites were the fish with yuzu beurre blanc, ribeye with spices and a citrus brocoli salad, seaweed chicken tsukune, Brussels sprouts and the awesome plate of dips ! We had the feedme menu and the chef did great with the arrangements. We also ordered cocktails which went great. Thank you so much, cant wait to be back!",
