Lu2yeenn,5,"A very welcoming atmosphere with superb service.
I was just looking for a nail salon nearby when Nail Allure popped up, thinking that it's in the middle of private estates, I might be lucky to just walk in. Indeed, a lot of luck was needed because they are booked out but one cancelled and they managed to slot me in. So good to give them a call before going down to not be disappointed.

I did medi and pedi gel, couldn't be more happy with how it turned out. Kim the owner is a lovely and straightforward lady, i really enjoyed our conversation and how she comments on what's best for my nails. No fake front is what's needed these days.

Already made an appointment for my eyelash and hope it will be my permanent place to visit in future.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109606025006819631103/reviews
Renu Sidhu,5,"Had a fun and amazing mani pedi session with Kim. She is a sincere, honest and harworking person with truthful and good intentions only.
I have not been doing mani pedi for 3yrs now as I have moved to UK. She cleared all wild cuticle growth and cleaned my nails so well that I didn't recognise my own nails!
Her suggestions and motivation on colors was spot on!
Btw her shop was clean and comfortable.
Highly recommend her, and I will certainly be back whenever I'm in Singapore next.
Thanks Kim, keep the high energy spirit gong üí™",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106046601666983052487/reviews
