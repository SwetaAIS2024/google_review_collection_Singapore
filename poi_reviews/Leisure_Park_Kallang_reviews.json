This mall has many empty shops, questionable empty spaces, as well as rooftop which is only accessible to the management office workers. I see a need for this mall to touch up on its space management and administration to make it more vibrant and increase the number of visitors",

Within minutes, both my children and I experienced breathing difficulties and headaches, prompting us to cancel our class. The staff also had to vacate the school and contacted the security staff. We later learned that the fumes were due to renovation work in the neighboring unit on the same floor.\n\nWe love this mall—it’s our cherished weekend family destination—and we urge management to take prompt and effective measures to prevent such incidents in the future, ensuring the safety of all patrons, especially our little ones.",

My family favourite is the Unabara Grill Fish shop. Hope it can continue to stay, because hard to find one that serve good fish meal since Ottoya (use to be at Changi City point) closed down ages ago.",

It has huge hidden spaces like a bowling alley and a movie theater.\nSadly its Cold Storage is closing tomorrow. I hope they don’t drop the ball and replace it with non-sensical stores or yet another NTUC FairPrice.",
