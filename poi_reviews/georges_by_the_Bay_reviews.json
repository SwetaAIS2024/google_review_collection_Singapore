On the other hand, the beer battered fish and chips left a bit to be desired, as it was a tad soggy. Despite this, the overall quality of the food was commendable.\n\nWhat really stood out to me were the very friendly alcohol prices. It's not often you find a place that offers great drinks without breaking the bank.\n\nGreat place to chill out with family and friends.",

The belly pork was not crispy and the Lava Cake was cold (still ate it all as the ice cream was delicious). Overall a nice place and I‚Äôll visit again, but maybe a bit more attention to detail on the cooking.\n\nWould have also been nice if they served coffee, but they don‚Äôt.\n\nOverall a 7/10 but I will return üôè",

Took over 45 min for the second last one of my guests to receive their food. And took 50min for the last person to receive theirs.\nCompletely disappointed üòû\nOn the plus side, the foods always good.\nBut it shouldn't take 15min to get chips and dip. And you should ABSOLUTELY NEVER serve the first plate 30min apart from the last plate. SAD.",

A truly memorable dinner experience.",
