L Davis (SG),3,"Only ordered its eggs and toasts set. I can say it's very normal tasting for me. Half boiled eggs were not really fresh to me, yuan yang C kosong doesn't have a strong tea fragrance. French toast's butter was nice but overall so-so/„Åæ„ÅÇ„Åæ„ÅÇ. I saw a hongkonger in the restaurant I think he might be disappointed with the milk tea. ü§î

But please try out their other food items and let us know.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112234525476361740401/reviews
Rene Lee,3,"We ordered fried rice, egg, sweet and sour pork and vegetables. Food is okay, acceptable but not that great. The sweet and sour pork was quite hard. The only thing that I found the best out of what we ordered was the Kailan. Also do note, they charge $0.40 per plastic container for dabao, so we got the plastic bag option instead",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108481221892893207863/reviews
Alexander C.,5,"Some of the best breakfast I've had in Singapore. They specialize in kaya toast and we pretty much sampled almost every kind they offered. My favorite was definitely the ultra thing kaya toast, where they take one slice of bread, slice it in half so you have two super thin slices of bread, toasts it and then fill it with kaya and butter. And they do it twice, so you essentially get two sandwiches from two slices of bread. The crisp and char paired with the kaya and butter were absolutely divine. Their kopi was also delicious; strong and fragrant. We opted to have the french toast kaya toast at the end and while it's quite the novelty, it's probably not something I'd get again. I would stick with the thin kaya toast :)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103837356333713673040/reviews

Gabby,1,"WAPO article piqued my interest. My first visit went downhill pretty rapidly after the nasi. lemak - kaya toast - strong taste of palm oil, flavour ordinary. Coffee extraordinarily average. Cold 3/4  boiled eggs was a cold put off.

The dry throat after effect lasted 4 hours, with lotsa gas forming in stomach - from the eggs and kaya....

Saw many foreign patrons and feel very sorry their experience of a local breakfast will be framed around this joint.

Conclusion - WAPO has a very very very low hurdle rate......",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116614355848095477658/reviews
