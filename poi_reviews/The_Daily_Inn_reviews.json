      "text": "This coffeeshop is quite cool and airy especially the outside sitting area. The tze char here is amazing. The salted fish fried rice is so flavourful and full of wok hei. It also comes with 4 pieces of medium size prawns and cost $6 which is very reasonable. The beef hor fun also has good wok hei and the sauce is really yummy. Beef slices are tender and nice and the hor fun is thin and soft. My only wish is that it had more vegetables but it is definitely one of the best beef hor fun.\nService is OK.  It takes some time for the dishes to come out but is definitely worth the wait.",
