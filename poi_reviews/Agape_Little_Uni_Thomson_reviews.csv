Natalie Monica,5,"My daughter joined Agape Thomson in Dec 2020 just before N1. She is now in K2 about to graduate in Nov. Agape Thomson has been excellent. I feel safe having my daughter in this preschool, we love the teachers and staff as they are trustworthy, nurturing and great in communication as well.

The preschool has an app for us to monitor the check in/check out time, and there are also updates shared by the teachers as well as term reports. My daughter loves going to school everyday ü©∑ There are also some enrichment programs available at an additional fee, such as Chinese Speech & Drama, Music and Science classes (the programs might vary yearly).",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104953727303484828766/reviews
