With the shimmering sea on one side and lush greenery on the other, this scenic walkway is the perfect place to unwind and soak in natureâ€™s beauty.\n\nThe gentle sea breeze, panoramic coastal views, and peaceful ambiance make it an ideal spot for a leisurely walk or just sitting by the benches to watch ships sail by. As the sun began to set, the golden hues reflecting on the water were simply mesmerizing.\n\nA perfect escape to reconnect with nature and find tranquility amidst the bustling city!",

      "text": "Back in the age of sail all the way to the steam, the cliff at the Labrador Hill was an important navigation landmark to guide ships coming from the westerly open waters direction to the narrow passage of the Singapore-Sentosa Island strait. In late-1800s, recognizing the importance of the location, the Brits installed modern defensive systems to repel attacks from the sea, comprising of some naval guns and pillboxes along this prominent feature. Some of these emplacements are still there, although not in the best condition.\n\nThe coastal trail has been developed into a park, popular for sunset watching among the locals. The jetty at the northern end of the park is a go-to place for locals to fish.",
