Aamm,1,"The area is near-by Legoland no doubt, BUT! I wouldnt recommend. Especially those with kids! IF you care enough about your kid's health at all, then take my advice. On the surface, the place looks clean, but under every carpet the dust, loose hair, dirts, leftover chips is under there. The sink is dirty. The decoration is filled with dust. The plastic plants is dusty. We found broken metal parts in the playroom. Coffee stains on the kitchen floor. Do not even look under the sofa.

The stove wasnt working, and when we asked, they replied back “sorry the stove cannot be use” this kinda thing should have been highlighted before we book not when we are already here. Its a homestay for god sake. People who rented here will want to cook! The hot water dispenser is not working.

Its all nice and cosy from their pictures, but this place is not clean properly. They cheap out of this. When we arrived, some surfaces are wet. The drainer is dirty with stains and leftover carrot and some other food which i dont even intend to know.

The corridor is dark. Some lights are not working. Light bulbs missing. The swimming pool is dirty, with sands and soils in it. The list just goes on.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100773481608240344186/reviews
Laarmi Jomoc,5,"We were there yesterday just for 1 night.. We book a 4 room unit but we were given a 4room with 1 extra small room which we really appreciated even though we don't use it.. The unit was all maintained super clean with all new furnitures and bedroom was so clean and nicely decorated with all new bedsheets and towels.. It is highly recommended from my experience.. The area was a bit far from the city but was so nice and quiet.. Near to Legoland, x park sunway and eco Botanic.. Parking was so easy and the condo security personal was all attentive..I also appreciated so much the host who were have been very Accomodating and replied very fast in all my inquiries and needs.. A special thanks to the host.. Thanks",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110505028168702409775/reviews
