Roland,5,"One of the place that I will go to for bak chang, freshly made daily and love both the nonya and the hokkien version. If want to buy during the dumplings festival, be prepared to order in advance or go in early morning to get it before it sold out.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103766504321573171977/reviews
Erinna P,5,"Friendly staff, best rainbow kueh. The fish keropok is one of the best I've had.

Very good rice dumplings that does not employ the use of dried shrimp, scallops. Great for for people that are allergic to it",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104975259573479660253/reviews
HuyenLy Nguyá»…n,5,"Really nice traditional kuehs, dumplings, bak chang everything. They're very popular and often sell out early so they're rarely open after 11 AM. On some festive occasions, like dumping festival, they make special dumplings - which sell out very fast, so better go down and preorder!

The price is higher than average, but they claim handmade stuff and premium ingredients, which you can feel very well.
Overall highly recommended!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112662903049952941403/reviews
