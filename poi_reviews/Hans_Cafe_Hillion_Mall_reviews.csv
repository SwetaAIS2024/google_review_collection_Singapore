Touristmouse,3,"I was craving for banana pie and chanced upon Han’s so I decided to give their version a try. Plus, this newly renovated branch looks so inviting.

Unfortunately, the $4.20 pie was served cold and fell short of expectations. The crust was dry, and the banana filling could be more aromatic.

Surprisingly, my accompanying Kopi C was actually better than expected. I may return to try other cooked dishes next time.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110409011587721664076/reviews

Yoke Hwee Tan,1,You need to do something about your service. Your outlet is clearly under-staffed with one person doing order-taking plus preparing drinks. No wonder the queue is so long.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111385559953930869654/reviews
