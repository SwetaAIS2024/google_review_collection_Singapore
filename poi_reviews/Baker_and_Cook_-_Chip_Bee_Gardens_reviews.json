      "text": "We‚Äôve been loyal customers of Baker & Cook for over a decade, and it remains one of our all-time favorite places in Singapore. The food is always fresh, wholesome, and full of flavor, and the service is consistently warm and attentive. The atmosphere ‚Äî especially at our favorite outlet in Holland Village ‚Äî is relaxed, welcoming, and perfect for families and dog-lovers alike.\n\nOne thing I really appreciate is that they offer gluten-free options. The Simply Scrambled Eggs in the photo I shared is the gluten-free version, and it‚Äôs just as tasty as the regular one! Another must-try is the Big Breakfast ‚Äî it‚Äôs generous enough to satisfy two hungry adults.\n\nI can only share a small glimpse of the many meals we‚Äôve enjoyed over the years, but we highly recommend Baker & Cook to anyone who loves delicious, healthy food in a friendly, feel-good setting. Thank you, B&C team, for so many wonderful memories!",

The owners have a rare dedicated crew... though sad that they lost Janet and her very high standard of hygiene and customer service.\n\nUpdated Sept 2024: not sure why but the breads are getting scarce and the happy coffee shop vibes dropping. Maybe listen to the hardworking crew and the loyal customers who bring new people here.",

Regular patron of everything, especially love their multi grain croissant  and onion and sesame bagel (unfortunately both discontinued) and more recently they have even changed the croissant to a sweeter type. Please bring back the specials on weekends like the Danish Boller and Walnut Rolls! There have been too many menu changes and not all are positive. Please hear us regulars management of B&C",
