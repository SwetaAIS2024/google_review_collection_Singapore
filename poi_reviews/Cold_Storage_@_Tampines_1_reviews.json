So rude the lady, ONLY 2 MINS then want to shout. Then what‚Äôs the point of you opening ur entrance you could have shut it. It doesn‚Äôt mean sense, don‚Äôt need to place ur morning anger on me if you are not having a good day. Terrible employees makes me never want to patronise from the store again.",

      "text": "One of the bigger cold storage.\nSelling huge selection of foodstuffs, there are the normal standard items found in normal supermarket, this store also sells, roasted meat as well (supposedly it was cooked in-house). There is also a sushi section too.\nFor this particular outlet, the organic section can be considered well-stocked up, there are the organic fresh produce and also the organic packed items.\nOne aspect I liked about this outlet, is there is a fresh nuts section. You can select the choice of nuts and bag them. Fast and easy.\nThis store was well maintained and was kept clean. You could constantly see the staffs, packing and arranging the items.\nThere are also the normal checkout counters and also the self service counters.\nGood place to do your grocery shopping!",

And argued that there is no receipt even though I had payment evidence.\n\nSo I asked if they preferred next time customers should open up the whole packaging and check one by one to make sure they're not putting in any rotten products?\n\nIn the end, they allowed me to change, but tried to short change me by changing only a few. I've complained, and managed to get acceptance to change the whole box.",
