Jun Long,5,"Absolutely Delightful Experience!
If you’re looking for the perfect dessert spot, this waffle ice cream place is an absolute gem. The waffles were crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and paired perfectly with their creamy, rich ice cream. Each bite was a heavenly mix of warm and cold, sweet and slightly savory – pure satisfaction.

The menu had a great variety of flavors and toppings to choose from, and everything was beautifully presented. The staff were friendly, patient, and clearly passionate about what they do, which made the whole experience even more enjoyable.

Whether you’re a sweet tooth or just looking for a cozy spot to chill with friends, this place is a must-visit. Highly recommended – I’ll definitely be coming back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118264921223014519220/reviews
Cherie C.,5,"A cozy café nestled in the heartlands. The plain waffles paired with minty After Eight ice cream were a surprisingly delightful combo. The strawberry green tea was light and refreshing — perfect for a hot day. I’d also recommend their signature Tie Guan Yin milk tea (available hot or cold) and their silky-smooth beancurd. Portions are generous and the food is priced very reasonably, offering great value for money.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106521239548585711787/reviews
Jo S,5,"Waffles were too crispy and delicious forgot to take a photo before I ate. We ordered the black glutinous rice waffle that came with vanilla ice cream. Waffles were crispy and sweetness was on point (not too sweet). Been there two days in a row and would definitely recommend.

Other commendable items:
Milk tea, tie guanyin milk tea (hot or cold), beancurd with pearls and nata de coco.

Yummy!!!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107504516379620098866/reviews
Sue G,4,"Found a nice quaint dessert shop near
Bukit Merah below the HDB block. They serve both western and asian desserts from drinks to waffles, bean curd and grass jelly. We tried the bean curd with glutinous rice and taro ball (taro balls were too sweet. Might suggest for them to opt another item like barley or peanuts vs 2 types of taro ball). The peanut soup was decent too. The mochi texture was slightly thick but all good. Tie guan yin milk tea was strong! Be prepared for the caffeine rush! Overall, nice place to
Chill out.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101395162337471098745/reviews
Her Lim,4,"Ordered waffle with a scoop of ice cream at $6.20. This was definitely value for money.
Waffle’s texture wise, the outer was crispy while inside was soft but not fluffy and slightly too thick. Due to such texture, after a while, it started to feel too heavy.
The aroma of waffle is decent but, personally, think it can be done better.
Overall, for this price point, it was good.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103993690235275561092/reviews
