Jonathan Soh,3,"Tried this mookata place recently — it was pretty average. Nothing particularly bad, but nothing stood out either. The ingredients were decent, the soup base was okay, and service was acceptable. Overall, it’s alright if you’re nearby and craving mookata, but not something I’d go out of my way for.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112532726011781214073/reviews
punyshark,4,"Finally got the chance to try 888 Mookata at Ms. Tam Chiak Kopitiam! Food here is absolutely delicious and the meltique beef cube has such delicious fat marbling, it kinda melts in the mouth when grilled! Garlic marinated pork and chicken taste really good too! Portion is reasonable here and service was straight forward and simple. Just scan the QR code to order.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101852695494997424451/reviews
Jenn Chong,3,Disappointed with the portion of the bacon. Used to be bigger portion for all choices that's why I come back often. Look at the serving of the bacon. Small slices and by the time it's cooked. It's like bacon bits. Am sure the portioning can be better to keep regulars coming back,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115067878117719393304/reviews

Zenobia Loh,5,This place provides good value to customers. Portion is decent and most importantly the stove is new so cook very fast… paid about $40-50 for 2 pax and it was just nice for us. But i think the vermicelli portion can be bigger cos its a bit little like almost nonexistent after cooking.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108057173795446265203/reviews
