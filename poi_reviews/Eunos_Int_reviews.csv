Areerat Kitsarikan,5,"Last 18 th of February I took a 63 bus from Bugis to circuit road.When I got off the bus I realised that one of my bags is missing.
I knew that It was still in the bus and I took a taxi to the Eunos bus interchange in Order to check my bag if it’s still still in the bus.
But I had no idea that I could get my bag back.I was hopeless.There were some essential stuff in it.
As I hoped,the bus arrived to the interchange a few minutes later.And I waited to talk to the driver.
This gentleman “Saw cheong Seng(the senior bus captain)”had my bag in his hands and I was so glad to get my bag back.And I’m so thankful  to this driver.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109729164678769491358/reviews
