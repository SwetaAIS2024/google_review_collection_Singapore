      "text": "When Swensons first opened in Changi Airport in the early eighties, I got a chance to eat the best fish and chips.  Lo and behold, one day during the pandemic, I chanced upon it again, right in my neighbourhood.  It‚Äôs the breaded type, crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  Generous portion with tartar sauce, coleslaw, baked beans and French fries.\n\nThese days, whenever we feel like having a hefty meal, I will pop by and pack home fish and chips, chicken cutlet or chicken chop and finally tried the steak.  Everything priced affordably.  I see young parents bringing their kids for chicken wing and French fries treat mid afternoon.  Reminded me of when fish and chips was a treat for passing exams or doing well.  This place is really comfort food.  Service is extremely polite, fast and friendly.  Pack home also no extra charge.  Highly recommended!",

Was not pack due to the outlook. But i quite a decent nostalgic western food place to choose and very reasonable price range. Quite impress for the amount i paid. Good job üëè",
