David Koh,5,"I went there to make an appointment for medical check-ups and was seamlessly guided to the clinics counter. There, the receptionist created an appointment for me, and within seconds, it was all over. The services provided were professionally done. I revisited for a Bivalent COVID-19 jab and was asked to go up to the 5th floor. To my surprise this side is very clean & spacious. The service provided was fantastic & efficient. But today my COVID-19 was done on the 4th floor & the service nurse was pleasant looking. She chatted with me to calm myself and explained everything I needed to know before giving me a jab. Also on the 5th level there's a Dental Services for Scaling, Polishing and Filling. Dr Wu did a fantastic job of filling both of my teeth.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109734834838217554825/reviews
Jacob,1,"Doctor has zero patience, i only got a few words in and she cutted me off assuming what exactly my back pain issue was. Don't bother seeing them if you have serious back pain because the doctor here doesn't even try to find out what is happening to you. Does a doctor really qualify as a doctor if she' doesn't even bother to listen?",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116088086466837346467/reviews
Emma Harona,5,"Today my first time receiving dental treatment at Bukit Panjang Polyclinic. I was greeted cheerfully by Dr Eunice. When I informed her that I am on blood thinning medication, she give me assurance and kept me informed what procedure was done throughout the treatment. She was very efficient, gentle and treatment was painless. Thank you Dr Eunice for attending to me and keeping my anxiety at bay",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102989970781722792846/reviews

PP S,2,"I went there twice for dental scaling and polishing, the experience was fine. A Thai lady dentist  there was the best but unfortunately I canâ€™t choose which Dentist to see. Until this morning I went again for teeth cleaning. Another lady dentist took only 15mins to finished, Im surprised in that speed until I came back and see my teeth after the treatment still like that. OMG! Angry & Speechless! Try your luck to go there but I will never go back again. And check your teeth in the mirror before you left the room.

Update!
The Clinic called me after I complained through their website to give a complimentary rectification to the previous service. thus I gave 1 more stars for their concern & responsibility.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107292466039214650227/reviews
