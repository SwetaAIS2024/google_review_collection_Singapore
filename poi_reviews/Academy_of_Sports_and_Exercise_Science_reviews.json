      "text": "Very glad to have found ASES! Coyie was great in getting me ready for my ACE course in Jan this year. The lecturer for the course is very experienced and knowledgeable, she is able to create a very conducive learning environment - blended learning practical and theory course work that helps all of us better absorb some of the more complex modules. I find it quite unique that ACE is also able to create a nice community amongst our batch mates even post training course. Highly recommended if anyone wants to check out ACE PT course!",
