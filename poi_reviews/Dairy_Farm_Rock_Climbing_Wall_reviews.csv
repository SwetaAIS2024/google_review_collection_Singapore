Morph,5,"Do you like crimps? Then DF has a tendon injury to sell you!

Frank,4,"This review is for the clearing and not the rock wall (for which climbing is currently suspended by NParks).
A scenic large patch of open space nested within Bukit Timah nature reserve, accessible via a short walk from Diary Farm Road Carpark A. It's a popular resting spot for mountain bikers since it lays along the Bukit Timah Mountain Bike Trail. There's no shade, so it's best to visit early morning or in the evening if you plan to spent some time there.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103884111905132806223/reviews
Jay,1,"THIS PLACE IS NOT SAFE! DO NOT GO HERE.

I don't know why an article has not been written about this yet. My friend, a mother of 2, went rock climbing with her kids. And when she was 4 metres above the ground, the rope SNAPPED and she landed on the back.

She's currently in the ICU and is currently only able to blink her eyes, and might be permanently disabled for life.

I'm absolutely appalled at the lack of safety measures here, this is not something you'd expect from Singapore. You would think a rock climbing facility would have better sense than this.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114172797297994610573/reviews
