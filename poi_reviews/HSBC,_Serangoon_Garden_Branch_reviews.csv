Derek Chua,5,"Came to this branch to open an account on a weekday around 2pm. I was informed that it will take up to 1 hour before it was my turn. It took 45 mins. Though I didn’t like the long wait, but I appreciate the heads up.

Then I was served by Angeline to open the account. Angeline was professional and genuinely nice. Enjoyed the little conversations we had while waiting for the bank’s software to load. She answered my questions clearly.

Despite the waiting time, it was a great experience.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106739889807635489065/reviews
Aloysius Chiew,1,"Branch is quiet and does not have many people but super long waiting time for account opening as only 1 counter. 30 mins for each person so an hour if 2 pax in front.
Even if you have an existing profile, physical IC is needed (opposite of what government is pushing for).
Misleading info from staff and call centre who is unclear of own bank procedures and does not know if digital IC is accepted. Totally waste of time.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100791693089603425644/reviews

Li Shen Soh,1,"Worse experience ever. Condescending tone used by Mr Rivers Lim while serving me. Went there to open a local account and international account, been 3 weeks no response from him. During the whole time there, he was trying to sell insurance policies to me instead of tending to my actual needs - to open a HSBC account Called in to check in, no response as well. If only I could give 0 stars.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100551829184402034738/reviews
Ida Suod,1,"ZERO star, if there is such an option. Waited ages for my number to be called while listening to other customers complaining about HSBC service. When it was finally my turn, the counter staff (only 1 was working) told me that if I want to make a deposit (to my own account), I have to have a physical letter stating where my cash came from! She could not reveal what is the minimal amount. When I asked her if I can deposit $100, she told me that I still have to have a letter stating the source of the cash. Yes, ridiculous, isn’t it?!

So I head to the ATM to make a deposit. Only $2000 is allowed!

I went back in, took another number to open another bank account. I ran out of time because of an appointment. So I left… and dealt with another bank which was much better but known to have weak security protocols.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106882296620111525109/reviews
