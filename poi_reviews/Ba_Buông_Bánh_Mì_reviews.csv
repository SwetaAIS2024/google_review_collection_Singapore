Orange,5,"I ordered the roast pork with added spice, though it didn’t taste spicy to me. For $7, the portion of meat is impressive. The bread was perfectly crunchy, and I loved the radish—it added a nice texture and flavor contrast.

There was a small queue at 10 AM on a Sunday, but I’ve heard the lines are even longer during weekday lunch. There’s no seating available, but the coffee shop next door is a convenient spot.

Will definitely be back to try other flavors.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
Daniel Chen,5,"I had ordered roasted pork, the filling was well tasted, i love the food especially the home made marinade pickled radish, so tasty. The staff was so friendly, polite, and prepared the food with very patience and care. Highly recommended to all and have a good try. Very reasonable price, and portion.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105848806612682876587/reviews
Ong RuYin,5,This is really a hidden gem! Decided to give this place a try as we were craving for banh mi and didn’t want to travel to town. It was surprisingly good with the generous amount of meat and fresh ingredients. The special edition came with chicken floss; while the roasted pork can satisfy the craving of a meat lover. Just to note that there’s no seat designated for the stall and have to get seats from the hawker next door.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105342401667095679559/reviews
megan,4,"I ordered the special banh mi - take note that this is a takeaway booth and there’s quite little space to sit here and eat. You also can’t rly sit in the coffee shop bc the coffee shop auntie will tell you u can’t sit there
There is one table but it’s at the side of the shop and it’s fairly cramped so the atmosphere isn’t ideal

The location is also hard to find - you have to turn left after seeing the mister mobile and it’s between two coffee shops

I also waited for about 10 mins to get the food but understandably bc there’s quite a lot of takeaway orders.

The special traditional banh mi was ok - ham was ok, the standout was the pieces of pork belly and pate. The shredded chicken was dri(er) than expected and this isn’t the best banh mi I’ve tried in SG (the amk one) is btr. However this is rather value for money with inflation so",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100978343250742524720/reviews
Zac Yeow (Zac Zakku),4,Dabao the traditional home and reheated it. $8.50 for bahn mi and coffee is pretty worth it. As for the taste I think the pickled radish could have been better. The pork belly also was under-seasoned.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117789579119392630062/reviews
