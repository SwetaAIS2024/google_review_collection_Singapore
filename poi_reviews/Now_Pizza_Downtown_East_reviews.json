Today, I tried the meat fiesta which was good but will try the other flavours in the future. I will also have the pizza at the kiosk the next time to compare whether any drastic difference.\nThey are using individual oven and can take  a long time to serve the pizza during peak hours.",

Meat fiesta would have been perfect if there was a punch flavour cutting through it, like a bbq sauce?\n\nI would still order it again!",
