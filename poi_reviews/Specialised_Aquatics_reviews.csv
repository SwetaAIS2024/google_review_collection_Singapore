Z.H Yap,5,"Wanted to start a small marine tank so Visited a few places and most of the staff donâ€™t really entertain me (probably think I only see see look look). Until I visited Specialized Aquatics, Hong (wearing spec guy) attend to me and explain patiently what I need to buy for starter and how to cycle the water. Then I just purchase everything from him.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104778042342688060633/reviews
Eric,5,"We are totally new and clueless in setting up a fish tank. Thankfully the staff were really helpful, friendly and knowledgeable! Wide selection of fishes and the price are reasonable.

Reza San,5,"High quality livestock handling...

This store always gets a negative perception within the reefer community due to their overpriced livestock. Talk to the staff about their processes and you will know why the prices are slightly on the high side.

Fishes imported undergo weeks of careful monitoring in a holding facility before made available to customers. Vials of test bottles can be found as they routinely perform tests on the tanks and logged to maintain optimal tank condition for fishes to thrive while waiting for their new owners.

Genuinely impressed by the exceptional care and thorough procedures setting this store apart in the aquarium industry.

Staff are also generally friendly. Its usual for any staff not being able to entertain you when there's huge crowd but if there's isn't, they are able to provide the best service to you. Would be great if they can start their loyalty programme again to make customers keep coming back.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116829050634114847441/reviews

He was helpful and recommended me some products, but sadly the one that I wanted was out of stock. Nevertheless, I continued asking some questions about the wattage required,etc and the staff was happy to help and answer even though I did not make a purchase.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110620822830901790352/reviews
