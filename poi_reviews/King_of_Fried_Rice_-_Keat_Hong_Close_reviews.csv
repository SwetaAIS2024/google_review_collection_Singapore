Ng Kah hong,1,"My daughter went and buy fried rice pork chop, after a few mouthful, discovered a silver round flat metal. After taking out from the rice, dunno what the heck is this metal round flat metal part.
This is not the 1st time, previously is hair and small transparent plastic. ( Dunno how they passed their hygiene)
To all buyers, pls look carefully inside ur food before u eat. Sometimes u might not know it may have “hidden gems”
Anyway I have report to SFA for more investigations.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101942324830124438582/reviews
Chunwen Huang,4,"Ordered the egg fried rice + pork cutlet and tomyum fried rice + crab & tobiko. Total damage was $19. Personally prefer the egg fried rice to tomyum one. Although both were pretty good, the tomyum fried rice was somehow lacking something.

Will try the xo fried rice next!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101636541114526759357/reviews

Ken Peh,5,This is a straight five out of five stars for me. I'm so glad they open a branch near my where I'm staying and I'm having it as my comfort food every single weekend without fail. Why spend so much money at DTF when you can taste fried rice at a better standard than them. Super highly recommended.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113975004215945002265/reviews
