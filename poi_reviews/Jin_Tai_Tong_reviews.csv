Mike Paandis,1,"The Sales staff especially the semi bald head short guy! Follows you around and gives you random things to check out at cashier when I haven't even finished my purchase! And the tall guy casier gives you a f look! I can reccomend even more things affordably good to buy especially parents with young children.. But definitely the staff gonna get screwed someday!
I hope the boss could advise this Malaysian staffs to behave wisely with respect!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100466047163609589362/reviews
Leedon chow Lee,1,"Called up this place to check the price for a herb. The man said could not reveal price over phone.  So I went in the evening as is near my place. I thought the price shd be reasonable.  To my surprise, the price is high and sales person was annoying. Push hard to sell not just one product, but many more. Is so irritating. I juz walked over to Hock hwa next door to take my time and buy with a better price with nice n friendly sales persons. Never go back to them again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100160538814148540500/reviews
Lim H,5,"If only I knew that I can get the best price for milk powders and diapers here at a very good price earlier, I would have saved more money from the beginning! The price for Karihome milk powder here is the cheapest I could find in Singapore. Even the Mamypoko diapers too. To top it off, the staff are really friendly and helpful. Will definitely come here again!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114863213988254420732/reviews
Chloe Tham,1,Very pressurising place with hard selling. Salesperson follows you around and gives you random things to check out at cashier and cashier would reccomend even more things. It's too overwhelming for a return visit for whatever reasons. Omg. No.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114253496021013283848/reviews
