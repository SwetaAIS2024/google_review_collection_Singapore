      "text": "ANG MO KIO TOWN GARDEN WEST was a rather huge park by local standards. And it felt as if I was climbing up Bukit Timah Hill when I climbed the steep slopes of the park. So be sure that you wear shoes that have a good solid grip. Overall, I would say that this park is the larger version of Garden Hill Park (see my Google review under ‚ÄúGarden Hill Park).\n\nPhotos do not do justice to the place (hence I didn't take many photos). You have to be there to experience the beauty yourself.",
