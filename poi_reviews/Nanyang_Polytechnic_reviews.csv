Gabriel Chinzz,5,"Nyp may be  not the most advance Polytechnic in singapore but will miss 3 years  studying here,staff and teachers were never once rude ,always patient (from my perspective depends on each student),only negative experience is canteens will get very crowded especially during 12-2(south canteeen)
Other than that 5 stars for this school!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104719369152372736453/reviews

Meng Foo Choo,5,"Came here for a sharing session. Impressed with the facilities and cleanliness. Student designs are very interesting. Someone ever said. The toilets revealed how civilised a place can be. Here in the design school I saw toys in the toilet, and different kind of hand washes in the toilet. How to interpret that, I wonder.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118082395255459356366/reviews
