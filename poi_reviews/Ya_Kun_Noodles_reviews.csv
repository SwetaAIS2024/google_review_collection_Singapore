Hans,5,I had eaten at this stall before they moved here from a nearby coffeeshop. The food is quite nice. Ingredients are fresh. Had the prawn noodle this afternoon. Good as usual. Only thing is no Kangkung. Overall I feel better than those fishball noodles chained stalls.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109015813757556736963/reviews
Tan Zhi Tong,3,"This stall used to have the famous bak chor mee but they have since changed. We still proceed with the order as we have made our way down to only realise the previous owner has closed down the bak chor mee stall.

Noodle tasted so so, where u don't need to travel down to just have their bak chor mee. Just take note that for those who wanted to try the previous bak chor mee stall, they have permanently closed.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106621762495339292882/reviews
Dennis Wong,1,"Very bad for prawn mee. Prawn is totally different from picture shown. Only got prawn. No other ingredients. Worst, prawn not properly clean as shown in picture. Avoid.

Very bad for prawn noodles. The shrimp were nothing like the pictures. Only got shrimp. There are no other ingredients. The worst part is that the shrimp were not cleaned properly as shown in the picture. avoid.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117585429128846167795/reviews
