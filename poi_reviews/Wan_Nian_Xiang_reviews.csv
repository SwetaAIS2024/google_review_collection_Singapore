Koh Wai Xhnn,5,"Decent zichar food. Affordable in today's market. But the pork chop is quite dry, not the best.
Salted egg rice was decent too. But lesser sauce than I thought.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113212008723833996332/reviews
YH J,5,Nice simple tze char stall with friendly staff. Tried both the salted egg yolk chicken & fish on 2 separate occasions - both were good & very fragrant. Also can order ala carte veg / meat dishes ($6-8). Recently start serving spinach soup. Recommended.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110082210226531439831/reviews
