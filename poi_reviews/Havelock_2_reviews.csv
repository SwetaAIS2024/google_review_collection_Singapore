shigella tan,4,"This shopping mall offers an eclectic mix of stores, cafes, eateries, pubs, karaoke, hair salons and even a law firm.

The Wing vintage shop occupied the 3rd floor and is a haven for those who are interested to own a piece of retro or vintage product. Havelock II is connected to Furama city centre by a sheltered walkway allowing easy access if it's raining.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106028660132558944519/reviews
