Flo Yeow,3,"It's an okay place if you're looking for a quick meal fix. Everything was prepacked, from the sambal chilli to the peanuts, and the components of the nasi lemak. So you simply order, they'll scoop up a bowl of rice, add all the extra packets into the box, seal it and pack it.

They were left with the chicken cutlet nasi lemak by around 6pm, which left us with not much choice. Added a banana leaf otah, and the ladies were nice enough to throw in an added otah. Extra star for the lovely gestures, but huge room for improving the customer experience.

Located on the basement floor of Raffles City, near Din Tai Fung and the entrance of Cold Storage.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Robert Zheng,3,"Worth trying.

Felt like standard fare, prepackaged sambal. Wings are reasonable. Roasted prawn was tasty but cold. Cheap and cheerful, $10pp.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106094371875030465764/reviews
