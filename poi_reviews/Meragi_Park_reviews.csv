Allan Ung,3,"A petite, peaceful park with a playground situated along Meragi Road. It is wheelchair accessible from the front and back of the park. The park has scrubs, plants, trees and chairs scattered throughout the area. It usually feels cool even on a sunny day. A good place to stroll, exercise, brisk walk, jog, rest or simply take your dog for a walk.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109830434604960986698/reviews
