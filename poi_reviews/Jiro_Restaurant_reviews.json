Good place to unwind if you are working nearby .\n\nSalad was well concocted with roasted pork belly and other vegetables/ greens .\n\nGrilled hamachi collar was a little dry due to over grilling . Can be better .\n\nOverall, great meal without breaking your bank !",

Service was very good as well - the crew were polite, friendly and very attentive (our tea were refilled countless times without reminders needed). I really want to gatekeep this restaurant but I hope more people can enjoy their amazing food and hospitality!",

It taste delicious with the smoky flavor and melt in mouth texture.If you are bring along kids, Hot Udon is a must have item for them. The broth taste pair so well with the chewy udon. We truly enjoy the authentic Japanese cuisine with the great ambience .",
