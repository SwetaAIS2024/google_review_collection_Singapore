We ordered the Hor Fun with egg and the Fried Rice with egg, both of which were delicious.\n\nThe service was efficient; our food arrived promptly not long after placing our order. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous, making it great value for money.\n\nThe taste was satisfyingâ€” the Hor Fun had a smooth, silky texture with a savory, rich gravy, and the Fried Rice was fragrant with a nice. Highly recommended!",

Ordered the famous moonlight hor fun, prawn paste chicken, marmite ribs and other food...\nThe recommended dishes were awesome, especially the moonlight hor fun.\nThe venue is non air-conditioned and under the sweltering heat of the afternoon sun, be prepared to perspire. Yet this is well worth the food and nothing that an iced drink cannot solve.",
