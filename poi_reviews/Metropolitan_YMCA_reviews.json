We had the breakfast package which was a delicious combination local and western choices. The neighborhood was very walkable and a major MRT station just five minutes away or a bit longer walk to the Botanical Gardens. A most enjoyable stay.",

The rooms are clean and comfortable, and the location cannot be better! Just two bus stops from Orchard Road, and the Stevens MRT Station along two major lines just a five-minute walk away. The included breakfast and coin-operated laundry are added bonuses. The only small issue I had on this trip was not knowing how to operate the TV. With a quick call to housekeeping, someone was sent to my room and it was explained to me.",
