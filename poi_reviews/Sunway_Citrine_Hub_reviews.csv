Gator,4,A relatively new mall but served the region well as there wasnâ€™t many things yet. The supermarket located here is big and well stocked. Could find most of the items that we were looking for. There is also a seven eleven within the mall. DIY shop is located on level two. There is a caring pharmacy too. Clean washroom and ample parking facilities as well. Spotted some eateries around the mall too.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
