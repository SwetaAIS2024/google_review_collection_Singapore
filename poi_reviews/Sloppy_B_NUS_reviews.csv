Jon Tan,5,"Finally some proper food in the area..
Marinara pasta that taste like marinara pasta. Pesto pasta that taste like pesto.

Might be pricey for some but good for the legit food & vibeüëå

Thomas Cheah,3,Toasts really good tasty fluffy and cheesy. Pasta can skip. Bland and uninteresting. Pretty much self service from ordering to collection and return own plates like a canteen. So is the cleanliness of the tables and dining area.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111579866316719212334/reviews
Evelyn Koh,5,"I ordered the sunshine pesto sandwich was really tasty! The basil pesto had a vibrant, herby flavor that wasn‚Äôt too overpowering. The cheese is a big plus for a cheese lover!

Hemanth Raj,4,Dropped by on my way to the museum. It was surprisingly better than I expected. Might be a tad expensive for the students. It was nice to see motivated young people having  intelligent conversations.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101667386957598951235/reviews
Leah Denoun,5,"Life changing experience! The bread so soft, the chicken so well cooked, the avocado so tasty and generous. Wow. Words cannot describe this experience and the sunshine presto and tater tot combo. Delectable and the staff is friendly too. The camping vibe is cozy but the chairs could be a bit more comfortable for my old backüôè nevertheless I love this spot! Thank you for your serviceü´°",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109188872707836560426/reviews
