kesmond chinyixin,1,"Feel cheated by Feng Wei Sea Food, ordered a roasted chicken but was given chicken chop.
Store assistant fail to inform us the availability of the roasted chicken, assuming..
Instead they choose to mislead us by placing 2 pieces of chicken wing and bunch of prawn cracker to cover up the chicken chop.
Only comes to realize it was a fraud when the taste and textures was different.

As a regular that always patron them I am disappointed and would boycott them as it was not the money or the services issue. It's the integrity of the store.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113603053452456775066/reviews

Besharps,5,"One of the best coffee shops I've been to. There were a lot of seats available when I visited, it seems to not be too crowded as its not located near any malls or shopping areas which makes it a pretty peaceful and chill place to have a meal.

The coffee shop has a tall ceiling which allows huge fans to be installed, making the place very cooling with good ventilations.
There was also a TV üì∫ installed on the pillar, allowing people to watch shows while they have their meal üôÇ

From most stalls that I've seen, the food prices were shockingly low considering the inflation lately. This place feels like a hidden gem üíé  and I'm sure most people who live around here are happy that stallowners are not increasing the prices too much and providing great food. üëç

I managed to try out both the Western food stall and Korean Japanese food stall, both of which were delicious and affordable. üëç

I had an enjoyable meal here and will definitely come back again in the future if I am nearby. üôÇüëç",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111020676081888304196/reviews
