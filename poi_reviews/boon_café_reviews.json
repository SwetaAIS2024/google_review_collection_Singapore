The chicken chop is slightly better than food court quality but plated better. Portions are small,but food is very cheap. Service is adequate and mostly self service. Ambience is pretty good as well, bright and spacious.",

They served some nice drinks, snacks and western dishes. Would visit again to try their other offerings. Too bad their opening hours are short and limited. Closed on Sunday.",

Vegetables were nicely seasoned and cooked too - they weren’t too salty and the veggies were a nice green color.\n\nI visited on a Monday 12pm, and it was packed with students as it was their lunch break. It began to quiet down around 1pm, so I think that would be a better time to visit if you’re thinking of getting some work done.",

Greatest satisfaction is the price , so friendly to the pockets . Definitely will return for the rest in the menu. Today (9/9/2023) is my second visit , still as good as what we have tasted . Keep it up !",

Sometimes we can attempt to go against nature but sometimes it is wiser to not force fit nature  . If a fish belongs in the water it should not come up to land.\n\nThe matcha cup doesnt have handle hence it is hot to hold it , i need to wait for it to cool down before able to hold it.\n\nThe food and drink was served in two intervals and not together",
