Sarina Omar,1,"Supermarket is very good! But staff at self checkout is rough handling with food purchased. Had to insist pomfret be placed in separate plastic bag. She was in a hurry to leave work.  In that case,  hands off my purchases. I am far more capable than her. I do not have to be rushed for her convenience.
Rude rude rude.
