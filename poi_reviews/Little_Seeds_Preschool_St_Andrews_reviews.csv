Xavier Lek,5,"I thank God for Little Seeds Preschool. It was Godâ€™s miracle that my kids get to enrol into LSP. Their old school was full after returning from a short stay in overseas. Any their blessed learning begins. I was delighted when I overheard them saying prayer before their sleep, saying grace before meals and singing Gospel songs on their accord. They learnt to appreciate and gratefu in their young minds. Thank you LSP.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109856883695227874592/reviews
