Weiling Oh,5,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting Starry Beaute and I couldn't be happier with my experience. From the moment I walked in, Janice made me feel welcome and comfortable. The atmosphere is relaxing and serene, which helped me unwind before my treatment.

Speaking of the treatment, it was amazing! Janice was highly skilled and knowledgeable, and she took the time to understand my skin concerns before recommending the perfect facial for me. She also explained each step of the facial so I know what‚Äôs going on. One of the highlights of my facial was the extraction experience. Janice was gentle but thorough, and she effectively removed all the impurities from my pores without causing any discomfort.

There was no hard selling at all as well which made it a pleasant experience.

I left feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, and my skin has never looked better. Overall, I would highly recommend Starry Beaute, and I can't wait to go back!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102581415245044774910/reviews
Grace Lin,5,"Did a sensitive skin facial with janice and I‚Äôm thankful that was not as painful as I anticipated it to be and my skin is softer, cleaner and more moisturized.
Most of my facials will lead to massive breakouts and redness for at least 2 days but I‚Äôm surprised that Janice‚Äôs facial gets the job done and my skin is still well taken care of after the treatment.
The best part is that she takes the time and effort to know your skin condition and recommend the right treatment that is most suited for your skin.
I highly recommend! Thank you so much Janice! Keep up the good work üëçüèºüëçüèº",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118143667861980785776/reviews
Song Lin Chong,5,"Had the most amazing 2 hours facial here! Janice is knowledgeable and explained all the steps beforehand. Face massage felt relaxing. Extraction was done swiftly and professionally! Had abit of swelling due to the pressure but after waking up skin was very clear and plump. Couldn‚Äôt believe my acne, bumps and blackheads are all cleared in one session. She also has awesome products where you can buy at an affordable price, no hard selling involved! For a 2 hour package, really affordable & first timer gets a 20% discount too! Can‚Äôt wait to be back again for my next facial with her ‚ù§Ô∏è",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102655795916148048321/reviews
