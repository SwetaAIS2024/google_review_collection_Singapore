I left the centre at 920 am. He knows his work, his eagerness to help me and politeness make the brand so world class. I have been here 2-3 times over the years and the customer experience never fails me. This should set an example for many other brands to learn and follow. Great Job!",

I knew we need to remove the water every use but the filter is so dirty, the dirt n dust does not suck into the water. The cleaning is worse than using simple dry vacuum. Will never trust this.",
