Food menu was sizeable enough, and a range of drinks including promotions even for soju!\nWe opted just for food this time, with a creamy Wild Mushroom soup drizzled with truffle oil, and Smoked Duck pasta which was well-seasoned.\nDefinitely somewhere you can return for a cosy get-together with loved ones!",
