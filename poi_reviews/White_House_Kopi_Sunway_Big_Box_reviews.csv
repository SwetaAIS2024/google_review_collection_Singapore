Caleb Tan,5,Decent fish soup noodles located at Sunway Big Box. Soup was flavorful and fish was very chunky. Value for money. Iced teh was very aromatic too. Also had a few servings of their sandwiches - peanut butter with cheese and tuna with cheese.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113662045918405903382/reviews
