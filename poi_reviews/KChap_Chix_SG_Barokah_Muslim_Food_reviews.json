      "text": "Barokah Indian Muslim Food is located in Jln Benaan Kapal Food centre, a small and isolated food centre. I ordered their green chilli chicken rice, which cost $6. The rice was a little dry and bland although its colour suggests that chicken oil/stock has been used in cooking the rice. Thankfully, the chicken leg was what saved the day. I am not sure if their chicken leg is fried upon order, but mine was. It was warm, crispy and marinated well. The green chilli was also spicy and zesty. This dish would have been an easy 5 stars if not for the rice, which is a pity as the food here has potential.",
