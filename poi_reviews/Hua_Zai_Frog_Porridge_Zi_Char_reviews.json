      "text": "We choose Gong bao flavour frog porridge\nand order 1 small baby kailan for sides.\n\nI love that the porridge is thick and still can taste the rice texture.\nThe porridge is still thick despite we eating super slow, haha! It didn't turn watery.\n\nThe main - gong bao sauce with 3 frogs.\nThe sauce is not salty at all, but it is still very flavourful! It's not very spicy and you can choose a different level of spiciness!\nPerfect if you have young kids! The frog meat is tender and has no fishy taste. There is an extra spicy level if you want to try!\nThe sauce selection: frog with spring onion, with dried chilli, with dried chilli extra spicy.\n\nSome other unique flavour: salt and pepper, salted egg, chicken essence!\n\nIf you don't like porridge, you can also opt for white rice!\n\nThe portion of the porridge is huge for 2 person! It's best to eat at the stall! Piping hot and shiok!!! Overall happy tummy! 😊",

      "text": "Had their frog porridge on a cool rainy day and it was the best way to keep warm. The thick porridge mixed with the fragrant sauce of the Claypot Kung Po Chilli Frog legs goes perfectly well together.\n\nSauce is thick, savory and full of umami with just the right amount of spice. It’s one of the best combo in my opinion but you can also opt for the non spicy choice.\n\nOrdered an additional Sweet and Sour Fish for the kids and it was also quite crisp and delicious.",
