      "text": "Been patronising this stall for a few years now and the quality is very consistent. It‚Äôs not just a fish soup stall. There are pork, chicken and seafood options. I love the wide selections of vegetables and condiments that you can customise for your order. It‚Äôs healthy and tasty!\n\nThe down side is that the venue can be quite hot and stuffy. So I always dabao. Owner has been very nice to help me separate the veg and soup so the food doesn‚Äôt get soggy when I get home. üëçüèªüòã",

Known for using quality ingredients with no added MSG, the stall offers a variety of fresh fish options & customizable bowls with vegetables.\n\nThey also have an amazing range of complimentary homemade sauces (you pick your own; very good) that enhance the natural flavors of the broth. Enjoyed my healthy & comforting lunch today.üòã\n\nMultistorey parking (white lots, level 4 and above) is nearby, with a useful sheltered walkway leading to the coffeeshop.",

      "text": "I was wowed by the amount of veggies given. After digging through the mountain of veggies, I found thick slices of fish that were fresh and succulent too. The soup is sweet and clear, and adding the fried garlic/shallots oil (which the chef will enthusiastically remind you to add) makes the taste go up a few levels. I really appreciate this store and the cheery chef there - there seriously are very few options available if you are looking for healthy food that is filling, warm, and provides a decent portion of greens that is not oily/laden with MSG. There should be more stalls like this.",
