      "text": "We tried the Claypot Bak Kut Teh original, )($7.50), Claypot Meatball Soup ($7.50), and Claypot Braised Pig‚Äôs Trotter ($6.50), along with youtiao and braised egg. My favorite was the BKT and the braised pig‚Äôs trotter, which is rich in natural collagen üòç. It‚Äôs cooked to perfection, making the meat tender and melt-in-your-mouth. The flavorful sauce seeps into the meat, and the gelatinous skin texture was absolutely amazing. Perfect for pairing with rice or noodles!\n\nThe prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous, making it a satisfying meal overall.",
