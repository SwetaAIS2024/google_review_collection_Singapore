ikeuufiedd,2,"didnâ€™t mange to buy anything here cause the staff will be staring at u the whole time. there was like a pc section and i was js trying to see
pcs they have but the staff kept staring at me intensively which prompted me to leave the shop, was about to buy a few albums but decided to go to a different shop instead. it wasnâ€™t even that bad until one staff approached the pc section i was at after i finished seeing and she had to keep moving the things there like i messed everything up like what did i do?? and once when i was going to pay for my albums, i was still walking around the store to see if there was anything else that has my interest but i went a little to close to the shopâ€™s door which caused the alarm to go off and i apologised to the staff but they still responded rudely and they said i couldnâ€™t go to the other section of the shop anymore?? anyways, the shop has a variety of kpop merch there, its js the problem with the staff so i wouldnâ€™t recommend this shop if its ur first time :â€™)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112507773767396001521/reviews
Elisse Cheng,5,"My go to album shop :) it sells stickers and kpop albums and also has a photo booth. there is also a lucky draw that changed theme once in a while. There are also toploaders, sleeves and lightsticks.somr albums with slight flaws (eg. a dent) will have a discount (eg. 10% discount). there are so many different types of albums ranging from solo,group and even ost albums.the place is so organized so it's very easy to find things. They also sell old albums and unpopular groups. They also have reasonable pricing. On top of that the shop is so pretty and aesthetic and the staff were so friendly and will help you out if u need it. 100% recommend this :)))ðŸ’«",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100713156931405203501/reviews

Ultimate Zane,1,"I recently went to the store last month and bought something. However, today (31 August 2024)
when I was checking my bank transactions, I found out that $21.63 was deducted from my bank account by Things I Luv past 8pm even though the store closes at 8pm. Looking to resolve this immediately and have called my bank about this. Please be careful when going to this store!!!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103574800237899908613/reviews
