Desmond Lim,1,"It's has been very long since we visited this branch, but we are regular at Hillion Branch. We are seated right at the end of the conveyor belt counter. We ordered tamago and kani sushi. Waited for 20 mins and reminded the service staff 3 times, but each time the kitchen staff puts them on the conveyor belt, it will be taken away by other customers. Please change your SOP on customer's order. Putting them on the conveyor belt doesn't ensure customer will received it! Very disappointed with your service staff in this branch! After this wait, we have no more appetite!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102400484891733905614/reviews
troy chong tze hom tomohiro,1,The sign said that everyone must be present to be seated but lots of people already were seated waiting for others. The staff were unresponsive and we waited over half an hour before getting seated. The food was sub par and everything was so slow. 1/5 avoid at all costs,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114012320087708549055/reviews

Kel Tan,5,"Food is fresh and there are lots of variety of sushi to quench your appetite. I have a few favourites that I come back regularly for. There is a time limit which I find, is too restrictive.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108283047018523660926/reviews
Cheryl S,3,Hit or miss. Depends on the day. Also why would they leave out fresh food to be sitting inside the countertop when it could already be on the conveyor belt. Some of these dishes sits on the countertop for the entire duration of my eating. Also cleanlinees not that great and water is not hot at some stations. Sashimi slices also getting smaller and thinner.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105222867469512313155/reviews
