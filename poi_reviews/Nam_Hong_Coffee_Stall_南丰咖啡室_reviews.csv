Ken Tay,5,Long queue but the price & quality is worth it. Kopi Gao was only 90cents which is definitely hard to find in Singapore. Would definitely recommend this drink stall if I come here for my breakfast.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116191322787657534557/reviews
Alicia Hock,5,"Kopi 90 cents, kopi iced $1. Quality is better than Ya Kun or Toast Box which charge 2 - 3 times more. Queue is long but moves quickly. Service is very good.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103670743926486862407/reviews
Richard Cheah,5,"It's one of the cheapest or probably the cheapest coffee you can find and buy here in Singapore.

All the drinks offered here come with very reasonable and economical prices.

Every morning, you will see long queues awaiting to buy coffee or other hot drinks as their morning routine.

The lunchtime queue, not to mention, is as good as well.

One of the popular coffee stalls in Taman Jurong.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116759225490774107700/reviews
CW,5,"You just have to give full credit to this coffee stall. They are still selling kopi-o-gao at 70cents for a  large cup! The kopi-o-gao tastes good & thick, no short change in quality or quantity. Please support this kind of honest hawker.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113626212339632338435/reviews
