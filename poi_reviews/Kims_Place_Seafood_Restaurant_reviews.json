      "text": "I rarely post 1 star reviews but if I can I really wish to give 0 stars. After reading all the negative reviews on Google, I‚Äôm upset I didn‚Äôt read before coming here. I hope the boss reads some of the reviews online and understand what‚Äôs actually going on\n\nTotally the worst place to go for a Mother‚Äôs Day Dinner with my family. Too many issues but I‚Äôll just list a few,\n\nReservation was not taken properly, table was only set up when I was there.\n\nAircon was not switched on until awhile later and I thought it was just warm in the restaurant.\n\nI ordered Large Fried Rice but was charged XL fried rice, I did not argue this with them because many issues were already there and I‚Äôve decided to just write a bad review instead, more on why I didn‚Äôt even bother to argue this below.\n\nBad service, slow service, rude waitress aunty. We had 2 tables and she happily placed a place of pistachio on the plate saying it‚Äôs Mothers‚Äô Day for every table and wishing everyone to be happy (ÂºÄÂøÉÊûú ÂºÄÂºÄÂøÉÂøÉ) which I thought was a good gesture until I saw the bill. $5*2. Then she said, ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt say you didn‚Äôt want it when I placed it down‚Äù. Maybe I was naive to think it was a good gesture for Mother‚Äôs Day.\n\nShe then said ÊàëÊâ£Áªô‰Ω†, oh maybe yes you realise you‚Äôre wrong but in the end she charge me $8 instead of $10. Total bill came up to be $300.10 and she said, l‚Äôll just charge you $300. This is such an insult, you think I‚Äôm here to argue over $2.10? It‚Äôs integrity. She made a bunch of other comments too.\n\nWhen I was telling my family about this $10, she shouted back, it‚Äôs $8 not $10. Excuse me? Guilty and had to explain how much was charged? Regardless of whether it‚Äôs $8 or $10, I don‚Äôt think the service and food here is really worth $300.\n\nPhotos attached showing what we ate for $300. I believe these are normal dishes we can eat at any Tze Char place. Most of the food were salty, sweet & sour pork, pork ribs, broccoli. Crab meat was very soft, not tender.",

      "text": "First of all, the 50ish years old looking auntie lied to us about the size of their hokkien mee (HM). When asked what‚Äôs the smallest size as I wasn‚Äôt too hungry, she said $8 so i ordered it. It was quite a big portion which I finished it in the end as I don‚Äôt like to waste my food.\n\nI later found out from the boss himself (son of the late Mr Kim) that there‚Äôs a $6 plate HM! Why did the auntie lied to me on such thing?\n\nThe HM it‚Äôs the wet type which I like. But the flavour was disappointing. Broth is not flavourful enough. If you are looking for wokhey, this is definitely not the HM you are looking for. Chilli is also so so and they apparently don‚Äôt put pork belly. But their fried lard was done pretty well and not too big/dry.\n\nConclusion: I won‚Äôt go back for the HM.\n\nBtw, we also ordered the hotplate oyster omelette which was really good! That one can order.",

Overpriced and not good.\n\nThere is a plump auntie that is really rude. Really bad customer service. She should get fired.\n\nOrdered XS at Kim‚Äôs Hokkien Mee (clearly said $12), got served S ($24) instead. Told the staff, they argued we asked for S. Menu is confusing on purpose. Feels like a scam and no integrity.",

Has a wine bar to chill out, Enjoying food with the best wine at reasonable price. Service is fantastic. The Boss shared a secret of making an additional dish with 2 bowls of rice. How? üòÄ. Go check it out. Strolling distance from Eunos MRT. Very easy finding your way to the place without a car.",
