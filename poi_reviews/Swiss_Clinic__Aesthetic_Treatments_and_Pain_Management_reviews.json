He first treated me for my wart infection over 10 years ago and since then I've returned for many other treatments over the years and my skin health and complexion have improved tremendously. In my 40s now, I always get comments that I look young for my age. Thanks to Dr Liu for explaining the importance of looking after my skin in my 30s. My boys have also seen him for their teen acne issues and we're happy with his care.\n\nThe team is always nice and polite. Products recommended are effective and well priced. Overall it is a pleasant experience to come here and I'll recommend it to anyone, understanding that patience and consistency is what get you the results.",
