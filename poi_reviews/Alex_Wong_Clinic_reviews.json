      "text": "Alex has been my go-to doctor since 2017. He has treated me for various medical conditions. He is patient, thorough and a man of high integrity and ethics.\n\nHe has successfully treated me for my high blood pressure, including weaning me off from the medication on a few occasions, ranging from as early as in 2021 to as recent as January 2025.\n\nHe treated my asthma and respiratory conditions well and followed up consistently over the years given that it used to take at least 3 months for me to recover from my cough. This has been improved under his watchful eye and care.\n\nI am still going back to him for my regular check ups.\n\nTherefore, I highly recommend this doctor to those who are looking for a good GP. And he has good referrals.",
