Felicity Chan,2,"I often wonder why Singapore hospitals do not offer healthy food options. My experience at umi @mt alvernia today has finally prompted me to post a review. I ordered a 14.90 salmon bowl.  The salmon came burned at the flipside in several places.  Carcinogenic. The salmon was dressed in sesame mayo. The miserable limped lettuce leaf soaked in teriyaki and littered with bits of burnt salmon flakes, and the shredded cabbage and 2 halves of a small cherry tomato summed up  the vegetable portion. If not under duress with no other healthier options to go to, this would never have been my choice.  Used to be decently priced and cooked.  But the escalating food prices in Singapore coupled with a declining standard,  made this place no longer a reasonable food option. Let's not even discuss health.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112603726872324049228/reviews
