Phua EK,1,"Do you see any fish? Fish soup costs $5. Why don’t these hawkers understand, that if they had increased the portions, they could’ve charged much higher and Singaporeans WILL pay? I’ll willingly pay $15 for a bowl of good quality and bountiful fish. Nobody likes to feel cheated.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108047144772138866825/reviews
Yu Ong,1,3 miserable tiny pieces of fish in the fish noodle for 6 dollars. Will void like plague next time - and the fish wasn't fresh at all. Would give a negative score if review allowed,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103005898198842870134/reviews
Crosby Ong,1,"Paid S$4 + S$1 for additional yuo-tiao. Can’t imagine what $4 would look like. Contrary to food critic reviews, found their rojak very ordinary. In fact, their prawn paste has very strong prawny taste.

Order only if desperate for a Rojak.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112276992196460215229/reviews
james c,1,"Portion too small for $5. Looks like kids meal version.
Soup quite tasteless.
Fish meat texture too tough, not Q.
Lesson learnt. Not coming back.

The bowl in photo is actually quite small. Reminds me of kids meal at McD",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111241506993302450577/reviews
Lai Vivian,1,"Fish soup looks very pathetic for $5.50. Seller said not enough vege, this should be inform to customers beforehand when cust place order.
