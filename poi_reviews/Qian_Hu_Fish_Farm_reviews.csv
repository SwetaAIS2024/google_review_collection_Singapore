Melvin J.,5,"Went to Qian Hu Fish Farm, free entry and parking! Plenty of assorted fish to see and buy, plus frozen seafood like lobster. Great for families, kids can catch and keep as many fish as they can in 30 minutes for just $7. There’s also a free shuttle bus. Simple, fun, and worth a visit!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110204106470894976302/reviews

W8ll8am Gastby S8m,5,"Always a nice place to visit. Brought my children when they were just little girls.

Visited the place again and now my daughter is 20 years old. Still great however the pond where the children used to catch fish has been a bit run down.

Otherwise still. one of the places that have many varieties of fish.

Alexis,5,"Visited today with my child for preschool outing but my child puked on the bus en route to the farm! He had spare clothes and I didn't... but a lady staff at the farm was super kind to give me a polo tee (their uniform)!!
The people there are very warm and friendly, including our guide uncle👍🏻👍🏻

Overall a very nice short trip and we had some small fishes as souvenir back home as part of our preschool tour.

Will find a day to return with my wife and child!! Thank you!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114368370570496022320/reviews
