Kye Koh,5,"I've been with Zachary since 2013, since I was Primary 3, and I could not ask for a better teacher. His style of teaching really is one of the best. Without his teachings, I would not be able to achieve my sense of music and appreciation for it like I have today. A teacher that not only excels at what he does, but truly loves his art. Rest assured that his students are well taken care of, and that lessons here are both enriching and fun. Being with him for so long, he's become more than just a teacher, and more of a companion and friend along my journey in music.

Knowledgeable in the history of many famous composers, Zachary is able to bestow upon students the know-how necasarry to understand and apply the different styles of classical music throughout the times. From the olden days of the Baroque period to the modern form of contemporary music, you'll be able to really feel the differences when he plays skilfully plays his piano.

Truthful to a fault, he is not afraid to crtisise and correct mistakes in the pursuit of performance excellence in his students. Strict when he needs to be, students will learn to be disciplined during lessons and to practice regularly.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100027829622246340741/reviews
