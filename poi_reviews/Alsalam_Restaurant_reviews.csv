defunct32,1,"Haven't been to Al-Salam in so long and I wasn't aware of how the ordering system works these days, I approached the drink stall but the staff ignored me, it's fine so I spoke kindly ""bang boleh order?"" (may I place my order?) He mentioned ""pergi counter order"" (go to the counter to place an order). Proceeded and paid, I was not informed that I need to advice the kitchen staff I have placed an order for YYY dish.

I sat at the table and don't misunderstand me, I am not asking to be served hands and feet, I was under the impression that they had a system where our orders are automatically sent to the kitchen or the staff will at least inform the kitchen, take note, nobody told me I have to inform the kitchen staff.

One staff approached me to ask what I ordered and I kindly informed him, now the kitchen is just opposite my table and I can literally hear them ""MANA AKU TAU DIA DA ORDER DIA DUDUK DIAM JE!"" (HOW I KNOW HE ORDERED ALREADY HE JUST SAT THERE AND KEPT QUIET).

Then they joked and laughed amongst themselves like it's really fun to belittle customers while I was there staring at them, me, a customer was being laughed at. Biadab nak mampus (mannerless AF) is this your idea of customer service? They then realized I was staring at them and then kept quiet.

Baru je 3rd day raya dah pun start perangai setan. Please educate your staff some basic manners, I'm fine if y'all wanna make fun but not in front of me.

EDIT: I had my food and want to update. Bland as hell, operation run for 24 hours but cannot afford basic salt and condiments? I'm not saying this because I was treated poorly earlier but your cook's lack of manners also shines in the dishes he cooks; lacked in taste, JUST TERRIBLE.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117433914383206007343/reviews
CK CK,5,"This neighborhood Halal Malay stall is one of the best with delicious dishes, fresh meats, seafoods, all types of aromatic gravies, curries, and friendly and attentive team of staff. I also have to say their pricing is really affordable. Most of their dishes will sold out by noon before they can replenish. Must try when around.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112703430868755541581/reviews
Amirul Afiq,3,"3.5/5 Prata Kosong: Nothing wrong with the prata, its decent but not great
3/5 Nasi Goreng Ayam Kunyit: To be honest, this is pretty decent too but the downside is for the price, the small quantity and size of ayam kunyit received is just... sad.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113215091442406768793/reviews
