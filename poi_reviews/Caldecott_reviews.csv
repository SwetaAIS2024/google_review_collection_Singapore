Wee Gim Hong (Nbss),5,"Some parts of the station is quite bright after the TEL concourse is opened. The surrounding areas of the station is quite empty for now as they are still building more housings. The station is very near some schools like Marymount Convent School, The SAVH and the Visually handicapped school (canâ€™t remember the name). The station also not exactly that many people except for people who come here to transfer to the CCL. The station is very clean!! The station is also very near an old condominium complex called Braddell View. A few minutes walk can reach the condo. Only 2 bus services can come to this station. Bus services 141 and 235.(Both from TPY int. These 2 bus services donâ€™t have much people taking them) The TEL concourse for the station is quite deep. Suitable to come here when going to Botanic Gardens and Thomson Plaza (via TEL). Overall the station is quite goodâ€¦ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜˜",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105439552809381147212/reviews
jimmy lee,5,"An interchange mrt station intersecting the Circle line and Thomson East Coast line. The boarding platform for the TE line is quite deep at B4. If you are switching line, do not tap out or it will incur additional charges. There is a passage link to the other line without passing through the mrt exit gates.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110518855728692358654/reviews
