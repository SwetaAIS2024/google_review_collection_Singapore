Derrick,1,"Order smash chicken from the Malay lady staff thinking it’s chicken thigh because all the menu only show thigh. Came out was super hard breast meat. Feedback made but was told I suppose to request. If it’s a regular stall outside I understand but this is a shop inside a mall and the menu should not be misleading. If different parts need to be request, at least highlight it somewhere in the menu. I can’t eat the breast meat as it just too tough so no choice I order another beef rendang to carry on with my meal. I felt staff should have at least empathize and acknowledge the feedback as genuine. One Credit to them is the side dishes, beef rendang and sambal is solid.

Update: Towards the end of my meal, I think this Malay lady staff maybe know I am writing something online about them. Literally Immediately once I took the last mouth, she came and ask with just one word ‘done’? Suggesting she want to clear my plates. The whole body language is suggesting like she wanted me out of that place asap. I just stay silence and took my leave while still chewing my last mouth. Yup I am definitely done with your stall!!

At least while walking out, the Chinese old man staff says thank you to me.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108953144790081158546/reviews
Andy Ang,1,"I ordered Ayam Penyet via Deliveroo. I called the restaurant to request a drumstick as I couldn’t put a remark in the app, but when my food arrived, I received breast meat instead. The chicken was super hard and dry, and the rice tasted so bad. No wonder can see so many bad reviews. This kind of service I think the restaurant will close down soon.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105611146976328920903/reviews
Meiyi Yu,1,"Our family’s first visit to the restaurant. Chicken satay was delicious along with the generous amount of thick peanut sauce (a bit too thick though).

However, I was bitterly disappointed with the grilled beef. Beef provided was a lot, but it was so tough to chew and swallow. OMG. Worst ever.

I seldom waste food. I had left 3 pieces of beef that i could not finish.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115076273714260283495/reviews
Kaiishaa,3,Food quality is inconsistent. Some days the chicken is delicious and crispy; other days it is extremely dry and served cold. I've been here a few times and will not be back again soon. Won't want to take such a gamble with that increased price tag as well. Service was slightly decent at least.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116908195414013818410/reviews
Louis Chua,5,"Great food and consistent quality always. The staff are very friendly and helpful in this outlet.
Enjoyed all the dishes we ordered. The sambal is especially nic and spicy. Sled-help for the soup.
Prices are also very reasonable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117782437474545961841/reviews
