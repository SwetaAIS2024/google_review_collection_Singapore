There are sinks at various points of the hawker centre which makes it convenient for washing hands.\n\nFat cat grilled fish was good, especially the mala flavour. Sheng jian bao and dumplings were delicious and affordable. The fen guo was chewy with lots of ingredients, truly a balanced meal. Braised beef noodles was good too! As for the FHM, I spotted some moldy yellow noodles :(",

To balance the meal, we had a plate of Iceberg lettuce drizzled with oyster/sesame sauce (tasted like a mix of both).\n\nEnded off with Strawberry lemon tea, which was fruity & full of strawberry pulp, even came with a cute otter cup sleeve!\n\nIG @pingguo301",

Very spacious and ventilation is good.\nQuite a number of variety of food available and not much of a queue or crowd on weekday lunch.\n\nFood wise is average with the western food and curry rice slightly better.\n\nA typical meal is around $5, abit more pricey than the usual coffee shop.\nParking lots are very limited.",
