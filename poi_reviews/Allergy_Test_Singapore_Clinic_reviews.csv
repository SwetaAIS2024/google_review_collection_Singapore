Brian Lee,5,Recently went for allergy testing at this clinic. Very satisfied with the entire process as it was fast and efficient. They have other medical services as well such as health screening and ultrasound tests. Will definitely come back here next time to do a full body check up.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104029158650005208105/reviews
