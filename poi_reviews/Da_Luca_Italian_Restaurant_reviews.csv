lydia bae,5,"I really love this place ðŸ˜­ itâ€™s my little tradition to go there every year for my birthday. Servers were very very friendly & nice & the waiter is always introducing todayâ€™s special, which I really appreciate. The food is so good & I love it so much ðŸ¥º itâ€™s definitely pricier but I love everything about this restaurant.

Update: visited again for my birthday this year. Did not disappoint & Iâ€™m still very much in love.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115696838656230481760/reviews
Goh Nai Shin,5,"We had a wonderful dining experience at Da Luca Restaurant to celebrate my wifeâ€™s birthday, and it truly exceeded our expectations. From the moment we arrived, the service was warm, attentive, and genuinely thoughtful â€” the team made us feel special throughout the evening.

Every dish we ordered was delicious and beautifully presented. The highlights were the Bistecca Fiorentina, which was perfectly cooked and full of flavor, and the Crispy Spanish Pork, which had an amazing texture and taste. The Portobello, Parmigiana, Tagliatelle Ragu, and Calamari were all excellent starters, and we ended the meal with a delightful Crispy Apple Tart and Panna Cotta.

The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, making it a perfect place for a special celebration. Thank you to the entire team at Da Luca for making the evening so memorable. Weâ€™ll definitely be back again soon!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101410878484704974922/reviews

Charis,3,Went there for dinner but didn't feel that the food quality was justified for the price. The price is the same as Garibaldi but the interior felt more like a casual Italian restaurant. The cold pasta with scallop and uni was average. Probably won't go back again,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114600726145980904216/reviews
kris hamilton,5,"The dinner here was wonderful, I sat down and had very attentive service. It was a medium sized restaurant and not busy while I was there. I plan to bring a date back to share and enjoy a meal.

The white asparagus, Spanish ham, and house chianti were all excellent choices.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115134086638642724110/reviews
