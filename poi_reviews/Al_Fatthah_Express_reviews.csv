Lyra Lyra,1,Mutton steak was very unappetising. Its suppose to be red not orangey. It taste sweet and full of scrambled egg. Too eggy. The packaging is not nice as well put in container instead of styrofoam. This place the only good thing is the prata. The rest is so bad.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105678512044157409953/reviews
