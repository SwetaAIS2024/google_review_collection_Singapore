Nonoka O.,5,"Great classic Min Jiang Kueh pancakes, for only 1 dollar each! I loved the traditional powdery peanut filling and the chewy cake with perfect crispy edge. The pancake sponge was only slightly sweet, so the cheese went surprisingly well together as well! The only one I wouldn’t recommend is the sweet bean. I think this is probably not home made, and I found it far too sweet and mono textured. I have also not tried the coconut, but the amount of filling looked pretty generous! This shop is a gem to be cherished.
