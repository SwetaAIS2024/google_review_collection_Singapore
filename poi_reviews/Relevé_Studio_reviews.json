I appreciate Ms Denise’s honest and constructive criticism in helping me achieve to the best of my ability.  I find that I can also transfer my learning in ballet to real life situations for example, how to carry myself when I do public speaking. I love learning with the rest of my class, as my peers help me to see the corrections I need to make.",

      "text": "Started ballet in this studio at 64 years of age!!! With lots of gasps and astonishments . Remarks like are you sure???, you gonna wear tutu , can you even stand on your toes? I have not regretted one bit and wished I discovered Releve earlier.  Best form of exercise for both body and brains. Denise is super encouraging and introduce us the steps slowly, suitable for our ability.Lots of laughter and stretches definitely good for the soul mind and body. Definitely recommend to all seniors.",
