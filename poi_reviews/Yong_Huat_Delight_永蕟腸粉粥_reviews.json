      "text": "Honestly pretty good chee chong fun. Nice and thin layers folded over each other. I got the prawn version and you can see the lady boss making your chee chong fun in front of you. Read online that she mills her own rice flour in the shop and i gotta admit the rice flavor and fragrance here is definitely more prominent that other shops. My only complaint is to have a saltier dressing but better to go with lesser sodium anw. Oh and the place is pretty hot so I was sweating buckets.",

      "text": "Pro Tip: PayNow QR is available\n\nI ordered the lean meat with meatball and century egg porridge ($4.50) + chee cheong fun with char siew ($4).\n\nChar Siew Chee Cheong Fun:\nWOW the char siew chee cheong fun is SO good!! Not the usual dry rolls you get - here it's drenched in this amazing soya sauce that‚Äôs a perfect blend of salty and sweet. Chee cheong fun‚Äôs super silky, melts in ur mouth. The char siew pieces are just the right amount of sweet and charred!! Portion was also HUGE for the price. Only thing is it can be a bit of a wait cos it‚Äôs popular ‚Äì but WORTH it!!! üòçüíØ\n\nCentury Egg and Pork Porridge:\nPorridge here really hits the SPOT. The century egg is gooey in a good way and the pork slices + meatball is tender, very well-seasoned and cooked in small pieces so it‚Äôs easy to eat. There‚Äôs even a lil garnish on top for crunch - I was impressed!! Didn‚Äôt expect much but honestly? it‚Äôs one of the BEST I‚Äôve had for the price. Portion could be a BIT bigger, but still very worth it and sufficient for smaller eaters.",

The rice rolls had a pleasant chew, although their thickness was inconsistent. Personally, I would have preferred thinner rolls and a more generous portion of prawns for better balance.\n\nThere were no queues when we visited on a weekday before lunch hour.",

      "text": "1. Century egg, lean lean and pork ball porridge - the porridge is thick and creamy type. The taste is very good. I like the fact that the pork ball is made from minced meat instead of commercial pork balls. I added the preserved vegetable served on the side which elevated the flavour.\n\n2. Bbq pork cheong fun - although the cheong fun looks unconventional, but no doubt that it's Cantonese style cheong fun. It's soft and soup smooth, and the char siew (bbq pork) complement the cheong fun. Sauce a bit too salty for me.",

Here they do the classic style with this rice flour that they make in house and steamed it in this huge steel pan. They come out fluffy, chewy and with a bit of bite. They‚Äôre are not as light as some of the ones I‚Äôve had. But overall is very good and the aunty and uncle here work very well together to bring the community a delicious snack!",
