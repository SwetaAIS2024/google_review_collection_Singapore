Min Yeo,4,"Nice dog park… not very big but is clean and there’s a tap within the compound. no need to worry about thirsty dog. had so much fun! Didn’t see much ants around probably is due to dry weather., but i heard from other park goers it best to avoid after raining ( within 12hr )",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108704533656678128656/reviews
Jing Han Poh,1,"There's a big muddy puddle after rainy days, which could be oblivious to first timers, so do keep a lookout before unleashing your dog.

Heard from the regulars that it used to be a really good dog run until the hole/ puddle came about, as well as ants that can be seen around the edges.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103112069697604614190/reviews
Jonie Quah (Elaerya),5,"Nicely sized area with a water point. My pup had a blast playing there. There's a QR link to a telegram chat for Pasir Ris dog owners on the fence as well.

Avoid days right after a rain though, the ants can be vicious.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102938570078143857445/reviews

Phyllis Ong,1,"My sister brought our 9-month old puppies to this Dog Run at Pasir Ris Park yesterday, for the first time ever. Just a short while later, the puppies got infested with black ants (some even crawling up my sister's legs too). Afterwards, she had to bring them to a Pet Groomer immediately to trim/shave their long fur (Shihtzu) as the situation was severe.

(We usually bring them to the Dog Run at Pasir Ris Street 51, near block 550.)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111081683384643399016/reviews
