Matthew Phang,5,"Located inside Shing Boon Hwa Food Centre along Dickson road, this little stall sells a great variety of Japanese Yakitori Sticks from chicken wings, pork, smoked duck, sausages, mushrooms and many more. Sticks are well grilled and the sauce that accompanies the meat is tasty and good. Overall, good quality of ingredients used. Prices are very reasonable too. Will definately come back again for more.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116828649080542336777/reviews
iAircon Singapore Aircon Servicing,1,"Arrived today 6 Sep for dinner with family after checking operation hours stated 6pm to 6am but to see an unopened business. Heard from the other stall/Tze char workers that the business don't have a standard start work hours, this is extremely bad, as our entire family left for other food with huge disappointment. It took you years of effort to build a reputation & took 30 minutes (our driving time) to ruin it ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112890187225063173830/reviews
