Guy,4,"Located within the newly revamped jurong west food centre. They have good chinese breakfast, taste wise, it was pretty standard. Priced was around $5, which was kinda expensive.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114405376517562605685/reviews
Jiabin Tang,5,"I wonâ€™t say the food looks fantastic but taste is not bad. Not to mention the stall owner is generous. For the commenter below, you can order their $4 meal and you can select any 3 dishes. She gave quite big portions of zai er and curry veg for me. Cheap enough for their stall rental price.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104836419119084334846/reviews
