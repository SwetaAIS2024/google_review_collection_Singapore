Newly planted trees and shrubs could be seen along the trail in effort to revive the native coastal species that increase sources of food and places for animals to seek shelter.\nBetter nature hiking trails are at the Labrador Nature Reserve.",

      "text": "Today, I ventured along the Keppel Coastal Trail at Labrador Park, and it was an unforgettable experience! This scenic trail meanders along the coastline, offering breathtaking views of the sea, lush greenery, and a refreshing sea breeze.\n\nWalking along the boardwalk, surrounded by mangroves and rocky shores, I felt completely immersed in nature. The trail beautifully combines coastal serenity with rich biodiversity, making it a perfect escape from the city‚Äôs hustle and bustle.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a peaceful walk with stunning coastal views, the Keppel Coastal Trail is a must-visit!",

      "text": "Disappointed with the new additions. We live nearby and come to Labrador Park and do the walk to Harbourfront regularly, and we were excited when we heard about the \"boardwalk\", hoping it would link Labrador park to Pasir Panjang via the wild  rocky coastline (see photo). Instead, they just built a short, raised walkway at the centre of the park itself and joined it to the existing network of paths Labrador has always had. After all those months of construction, this is all they could do?\nThe nearby walk along the coast from Harbourfront Ave to the Labrador Park Jetty is beautiful and well worth doing especially since the reopening of the Bukit Chermin Boardwalk a year back. But the recent \"opening\" of the Keppel Coastal Trail is something of a misnomer if the only enhancement is this underwhelming short, elevated walkway.",
