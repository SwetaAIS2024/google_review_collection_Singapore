Kong Wen Sheng,5,"Western, Indian-Muslim cuisine and the Japanese food stores are my favourite go-tos when I visit this coffeeshop. Price is super affordable and all of them accept online payment. They serve super above average food for that cost too by the way, highly recommend!

Place is wheelchair accessible too from the L2 carpark via lift, suitable table height allows wheelchair users to dine in too.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105513610287991060707/reviews
Wie b l,5,"Here I'm only referring to the PENANG KWAY TEO KIA stall in this coffee shop.
This food is quite amazing, it is essentially a slice fish soup stall with lots of pork minced meat variations.
The cook is very attentive and fast and generous with his serving of garnishes.
I ordered the Mee Pok with only the fish ball and fried fish sticks. My partner ordered the teo chew fish porridge soup. Both are very tasty and full of aroma. I think (not sure) they put garlic bits into their soup, or salted fish, or both?
The mee pok is tangy and the noodles is springy enough but not ""al dente"" like some of the best I've tasted before. The fish porridege has luscious serving of fish slices and tomato and vegetables. The mee pok and the soup that comes with it, gets a 5 star from me. The rest, well they can improve.
The fish balls were fishy enough and has an acceptable tautness to it, but it far lacks the stall in Newton Circus, which I've reviewed. That's one of the best, perhaps in singapore.
i would not hesitate going there to eat the next time I pass by that place. You should defintely give it a try, they have a good range. And most of all, the soups are full of flavour!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109201224600301983721/reviews
Leon De Suzanne,1,"Drink stall operator was rude, ordered a Kopi less sugar, he had the audacity to scoop 3 table spoon of sugar, i stopped him immediately and he raise his voice saying that's the standard for less sugar drinks.

I'm fine if you are reluctant to remake my coffee but does it cost to at least talk politely",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109506502688874098518/reviews
Nagen R,1,"The western food stall operator/ owner was rude. Asked not to serve fries and bread and offered to pay for an additional eggâ€¦he refused and spoke rudely! He said can only order those in the menu!!! Obviously not the owner! It ok if cannot customize, but at least say so in a polite way!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118002761300213401048/reviews
Khun C,5,I think it's unfortunate that a bad experience another reviewer had at one particular food stall has them dismissing the entire place. Their poor experience was valid and they have every right to be angry. And I have noted the review and I won't eat at that particular restaurant anymore. But I have enjoyed quick meals at other businesses in this food court and I whole heartedly support their businesses.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113032638184818514755/reviews
