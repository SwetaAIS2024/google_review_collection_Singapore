Dee,5,"Had the thai cream and laksa cream pasta with ice cream brownie! All so good and highly recommend for a decent price. Seafood pasta had prawn, salmon and sotong!

Was a nice place to enjoy my Saturday evening. Will come back againüòã",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101021032434231243303/reviews
GK Neo,5,"Found this place which used to be located at Shaw Tower. That was more than 10 years ago.

Food remains excellent. And my favourite Thai Cream pasta still has the right amount of spiciness and tom yam taste.

Had the 3-course meal, which comes with garlic üçû,  cream of mushroom soup and drink. The garlic bread taste exactly the same as the one I had more than 10 years ago!

Highly recommended for those who enjoy good pasta!

Attaching some photos which they took at Shaw Tower. For those who went there before ,  you will remember them!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112086448220028603176/reviews

Ian Li,5,"This place is a hidden gem! It‚Äôs already quite popular, but its location makes it a bit tricky to find.

The food here is fantastic‚Äîfull of flavor! I highly recommend trying the laksa cream and Thai cream bases. Both are rich and creamy, yet not overly oily or heavy.

The seafood is fresh, with the salmon pre-grilled for a smoky, grilled flavor.

The grilled chicken also adds a nice ""wok hei"" taste, making the dish even more enjoyable.

With the quality of the food here, it‚Äôs easily worth a higher price. If they upgraded the presentation and moved to a more visible location at Bugis, it could easily command double the current price. It's truly great value for what you get!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103602047879226708518/reviews
