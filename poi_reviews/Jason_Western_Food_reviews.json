      "text": "Ordered beef steak take away, found out that meat was still raw inside. Went back to check with store owner but they were unapologetic and rude, kept insisting that it's already fully cooked, before admitting that it wasn't fully cooked due to \"take away & preventing meat to be overcooked\". No need to be so hostile, just accept the feedback and move on man. Photo attached as proof.\n\nTexture of the Beef doesn't taste like beef at all, too much baking soda making it over tenderized, never had a beef steak that taste this bad. Definitely better western food around in lorong 7 & lorong 8.",
