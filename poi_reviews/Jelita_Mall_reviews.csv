Heng Li Wei,5,"Jelita Mall has finally reopened. The renovated place looks amazing. Very well lit and spacious.
Good choices of food, including halal food (pizza)
Will have more food stalls soon.

Craftsmen cafe by the roadside. Renovation looks almost completed.

Carpark has changed to 10mins grace period, charges 4 cents per minute after (not by hour). But Cold Storage provides complimentary 1hour carpark coupon if we spend 30dollars on their groceries.

Ls Ong,5,"Recently 2 Mar 2025, a newly renovated section 2nd floor in the Jelita Mall Jelita Gourmet foodcourd is opened. Good size and good variety of food stalls there. There are Ah Ma Bakchor noodle, Ipoh Tuck Kee zhi char, western grill stall, roasted meat noodle,  prawn noodle, prata, briyani, drink stall with beer that open till midnight, gelato economic rice and etc.

We tried the steam fish and fried kang kong for 2 person and ordered the yifu noodle and fried beetaimak for another 2 person from the Ipoh Tuck Kee zhi char. Due to promo, came with a free boil octopus dish as well. All tasted delicious and with decent prices. We have gotten the chocolate tissue prata and gelato for dessert to complete the dinner there. It was an enjoyable meal.

Overall, it was a good addition to the mall as there was no foodcourt near this area and will be a good pit stop for those who cycle or walk along the Railway corridor.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101628963016853842762/reviews
Henry Hsu,5,"about the gourmet ..A nice quiet place for early morning catch up with friends

Only the Chinese noodles store and the prata stalls are available when we were there at 8am

The coffee stall lady is very efficient and she alone handled the ever long Queue of hungry and impatient clients.

The masala Dosai is really good. Lots of potatoes...",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106264320981524934495/reviews
