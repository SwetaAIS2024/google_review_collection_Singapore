Matti Lepp√§nen,5,"This review is specifically for the Traditional Toast & Coffee stall. Haven't tried the other stalls yet.

A decent kaya toast set in pleasant, clean surroundings for S$4 is always nice to have! The quality is high and the kaya is very tasty.

Also, a huge thanks to the management for promptly addressing an earlier issue with the toaster!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101302754477090512693/reviews

Benjamin Tong,4,"A newly renovated coffeeshop situated at the corner of Tanjong Katong Road and opposite SingPost. Came here in the morning and saw this place by chance. Ordered the Teochew Fishball Minced Meat Noodles from this stall.

For a $4 bowl of noodles, I would rate it above average bowl of noodles üçú. Comes with a decent portion of noodles with 2 fishball, 1 meatball and minced meat. The fishball needs some flavour to it as the fish balls tasted too bland. Meatball tasted better. The portion of minced meat could be more üòÅ.

The chilli has the spiciness and taste which I personally like it. Noodles are cooked well, not too hard and not too soggy. The bowl also comes with fishcakes and pork lard. Overall its a decent bowl of noodles for breakfast and brunch.

At the drinks stall, I saw that they have a variety of toast sets. What caught my eyes are the garlic toast and otah toast. Never ordered as I already got the noodles. Will come back again to try. I ordered the Teh-O iced and the drink is made upon order. Taste is ""gao"" and affordable.

They also sell prepacked nasi lemak, mee Goreng and some baos at the drinks stall.

Hope they will have more food choices soon.  This is a cosy coffeeshop, good to chill.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114917436581267790072/reviews
Nana Latif,5,Usually it is difficult to find a halal stall in this area but surprisingly we managed to find a good one here. And they do serve halal banana leaf kind of nasi lemak for breakfast too! Peaceful and nice environment to dine in.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103426610047230951353/reviews
Kerris,4,"Best place to get coffee and toast! Crunchy toast, with wedges of butter and a little fresh kaya jam; and coffee you can stand a spoon up in. There are tables and chairs but let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs not a venue for a first date! And ladies be aware the toilet is one of those hole in the ground affairs so prepare to squat!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111994225819259498716/reviews
