Eugene Cheng,5,Amazing corner selling ice cream. Ample space. Nice owner. Ice cream was not too sweet. French fries and Tater tots was amazing! I love it! Will come back again,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108399906757411753559/reviews
Fatih Raka,5,"Came here to taste their ice cream, not disappointed. Tried their Thai Milk Tea, Strawberry Cheesecake, and Apple Yakult ice creams üòã They were all very deliciously thick and the servings were very generous. They also serve very fluffy and adequately sweet waffle üßá

If you‚Äôre looking for a high quality ice cream to enjoy late in the day, this is the right place üç¶

There‚Äôs about 10 seats inside and each table has its own charging ports üëç",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104160487126306227152/reviews

Jermaine Ng,5,"A clean and modern cozy ice cream place. Savory icecream was really nice with a mix of sweetness and savory from the cream, cheese and chips. Ferrero flavor was v fragrant, hazelnut was pronounced without being overly thick.
highly recommended :)",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103426478354957590234/reviews
Law,5,"A cozy new ice cream and waffle shop that‚Äôs quickly become a go-to dessert spot in the neighborhood!

I visited on a quiet weekend night and was warmly welcomed by the kind lady , who generously offered us samples of their flavors before we ordered.

We tried the mochi waffle topped with their premium chocolate and tiramisu ice creams‚Äîboth were absolutely delicious! ($14.50)

I‚Äôll definitely be coming back for more of their waffles and ice cream.

While they aren‚Äôt halal certified as of now, they don‚Äôt use pork, lard, or alcohol in any of their products according to their signs on the front door.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118092994805796056379/reviews
