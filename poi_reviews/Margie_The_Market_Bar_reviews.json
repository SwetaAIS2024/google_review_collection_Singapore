      "text": "Tried the Pork Jowl bowl and my friends tried the other dishes. We shared a chicken platter too.\n\nThe pork jowl was tasty: plenty of chicken rice topped with fragrant and fatty pork and Char Siew sauce, like the kind you get in actual hawker char siew rice stalls. However, if you don’t like the strong taste of pork, this may not be for you.\n\nThe rice bowls are also very filling. Do share if you are a small eater. Or if you have a bowl to yourself, avoid ordering sides.\n\nWe had the Hot Chicks platter. The best was the Mala Karaage. There was also a honey/bbq wing and a deep fried batter wing, with a hint of lemon but it was quite muted.\n\nPrice wise it was acceptable. The cheapest rice bowl is the roasted chicken at 9.90. Then the rest around around 11.90-13.90.",

But too many fatty parts and only 2 pieces of meat with actual meat.\nGrilled 'Chomp Chomp' Chicken Rice Bowl: smells good too. But meat was quite small and slightly tough. Sauce taste is not bad.\nTruffle fries: fries came hot. Truffle taste not strong.",

I don’t come here because these is a KTV joint or Live Band on other days than Thursday?? Live Band is fine, but keep it this way. Thanks",
