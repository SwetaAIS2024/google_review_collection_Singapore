A B C Traveller,5,"Affordable supermarket at Novena MRT station mall. It is in the basement of Novena Square. You can find all sorts of things here, especially food. There are MANY choices for alcoholic beverages. Self-checkout at exit is the best. I got myself a long list of snacks for tonight supper.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116585614877993483182/reviews
Florence Leow,5,"🍊🍋🍎🍅 CS Fresh supermarket
101 Thomson Rd, # B1 - 52,
🟩 Novena Square mall
Singapore 307591

🟢 This CS Fresh aka Cold Storage supermarket is conveniently located above Novena MRT Station at Novena Square mall.

✅️ Cold Storage supermarkets are seen as upscale premium supermarkets that sells fresher foods and stocks more international specialties and gourmet products.

✳️ I prefer buying fresh produce like fruits and vegetables at Cold Storage as they taste and look better.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews
Flo Yeow,4,"It's a relatively smaller Cold Storage vs the many others elsewhere. There are also many other supermarket options all around Novena, which puts them at a slight disadvantage. Donki, Fairprice, CS Fresh, etc are all within the 1km radius. That all said, supermarket shopping experience here has never been better. Cold Storage tends to give off this premium vibes, and this outlet does too. It's just a little too small for my general liking. Got what we needed, and left shortly after.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Gerald K,1,"Normal sized supermarket but poor service.
Confused staffs and missing manager for the self checkout kiosks.

If you want to reduce manpower with automation that is fine, but train your staff in terms of knowledge.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100455493160340838872/reviews
