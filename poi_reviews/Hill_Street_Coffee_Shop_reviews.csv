Jianlong Tan,1,"Terrible service. Ordered butter sugar toast, and they gave me this - one side not toasted at all, the other side burnt. And they tried to hide the burnt part inside. Disappointed.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107122545774483342812/reviews

steven lim,4,"First time ordering from here and the food was tasty.  We had the Crispy fried Lemongrass Nasi Lemak, as well as the Sambal Chicken nasi lemak.

The portions were generous and the sambal chicken was delicious.  We could not really taste the lemongrass in the other chicken, but it was indeed crispy.

Both dishes came with iced barley drinks, which were okay, and the portions were smallish.  The keropok tasted a little old and soft though.

Overall it was a decent lunch.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117434407303387249783/reviews
