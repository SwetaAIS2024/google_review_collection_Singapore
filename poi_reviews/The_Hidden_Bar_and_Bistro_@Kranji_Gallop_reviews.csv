符僡玹MëL Fü,5,"I am writing to commend the wonderful attitude, helpful approach and attentiveness to service demonstrated by Mr. Ted & Mr. SK. Their dedication and attentiveness were what made me decide to go with The Hidden Bar.

With this letter I would hereby like to compliment one of your employees, Mr Teo for the excellent service he provided me during my dining and chilling hours.

His professionalism and commitment to the highest level of customer’s satisfaction has to be acknowledged.

People are an organization’s greatest asset, especially in competitive markets like Singapore’s F&B sector. On top of good food offerings, The Hidden Bar also have incredibly warm and efficient service! Having in mind such a pleasant experience with the staffs here it would be my pleasure to continue coming back in the following years.

Congratulations on having an outstanding team !",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107426394838467672524/reviews
