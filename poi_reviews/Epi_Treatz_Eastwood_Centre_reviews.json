      "text": "Booked an appt for my 19 y/o niece today for the first time and was told it’s $88 for the first trial for deep cleaning facial.  My SIL dropped my niece off at the shop and came home telling me it’ll costs $200 instead cos the deep cleaning facial doesn’t clear pimples and oilseeds..  i understand salon do try to upsell their services, but from $88 to $200 and 1st time trial, I think they are just pushing their luck.   I called them back and told them to stick back to the $88.   My niece came back telling me that the experience was not that great.",
