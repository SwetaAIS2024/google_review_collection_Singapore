It was such a beautiful and peaceful temple, with a unique structure unlike anything I've seen before.  We were drawn to the vibrant colors and intricate carvings, and the atmosphere was filled with a sense of devotion and tranquility.\n\nWe were so happy to be able to offer our prayers and blessings to Ganesha.  It felt incredibly powerful to be surrounded by so many other devotees who were also celebrating his birthday.  Kitty and I both felt a sense of peace and connection as we offered our prayers and offerings.\n\nThe temple is a testament to the power of faith and perseverance, and it's clear that the community here is deeply dedicated to their beliefs.  We were so grateful to be able to experience this special place and celebrate Ganesha's birthday with so many others.",

This temple is just a 2 minutes walk from Bukit Panjang MRT station.\n\nThis temple has beautiful, colourful statues of all Gods and Goddesses. Apart from Lord Muruga, shrines of Lord Shiva and Parvathi along with several other Gods like Ayyapan, Durga are all present, including that of Lord Buddha",
