I really love their salmon & avocado don - their rice has excellent mixture of flavourful wasabi & cucumber which tastes amazing to me. Their salmon sashimi also tasted fresh. I'm actually looking forward to eating here again soon",

But I would have preferred to have more veggies (got avocados and veggies on the side). They seem to have really good coffee as well. Good place for a lunch in the campus at Innovation 4.0 building",

      "text": "Located in Innovation 4.0, the cafe is a little off the beaten path. In other words, a little ulu.\n\nThat said! The poke bowl at $9.20 is definitely their best dish. Sashimi is generous-ish and really fresh. Cucumber and rice is also seasoned wonderfully. There’s also a hint of truffle and mentaiko on the sashimi, which blends nicely with the other flavours in the bowl.\n\nMushroom Curry bowl is also worth the money, and a great budget option at $5.80. Really strong curry flavour and generous servings of mushroom and an onsen egg (slightly cooked. eh.)\n\nThe General Tso bowl was just, ok. Broccoli was tough and a bit too much vinegar throughout the bowl. Carbonara was also mid, I’d prefer the tea party or even pasta express for the price.\n\nPoke bowl  >>>\n\nThe Thai milk tea ($2.50) and matcha latte ($4 ish) are great, though the milk tea is pricey for a small tea cup.",

Would try their poke bowls; their mentaiko one tastes great!\n\nThey also have $5.50 strawberry cheesecake omg would try.\n\nSome new items on their menu like chicken teriyaki pasta is not available in the kiosk ordering machine.\n\n3.5 stars!",
