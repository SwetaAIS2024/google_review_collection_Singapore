      "text": "I’ve been training with Matthieu for over a year, and he’s been an exceptional coach. As a complete beginner, I had to relearn everything from scratch, but Matthieu’s patience and clear explanations made all the difference. He uses a variety of exercises to help me improve my techniques, and his ability to teach in both English and French is a big plus. Matthieu truly cares about his students’ progress and always adapts to their needs. Thanks to him, I’ve made incredible progress and genuinely enjoy playing tennis now. Highly recommend him to anyone starting out in tennis!",

      "text": "B Tennis – Outstanding Tennis Consulting Service!\n\nI reached out to Matthieu in September 2024 to introduce the K-Swiss brand ahead of its entry into the Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam markets in 2025. From the very beginning, he was incredibly open and kind, offering valuable advice on potential wholesale partners, top athletes and coaches to approach, and suggest strategies to increase market penetration.\n\nIn Malaysia, he even connected me with a major tennis tournament organizer, which was a great help. Matthieu consistently went above and beyond, always willing to support me whenever I needed guidance.\n\nIf you're looking to grow your brand sustainably and want to tap into a trusted and extensive network within the tennis industry, I highly recommend working with Matthieu.",
