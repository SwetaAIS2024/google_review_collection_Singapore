Went there at 3.30pm on 4 March 2025 at harbour front branch and was shocked to see that they have closed their main entrance with a sign that stopped customers from queueing as the staff claimed there is a long queue waiting inside. DBS website clearly stated its operating hours is till 4pm. So why did the counter services stop at 3.30pm?? Even if the queue is long, shouldnâ€™t the queue number stop at 4pm? If not, pls amend your operating hours- it is totally misleading!! I am truly disappointed with this miscommunication.",
