      "text": "This review is for Gap Year Hostel's side business as collection point in 2023-2024.\n\nWe’ve had consistent difficulties collecting our parcels from Gap Hostel’s collection service. Despite visiting during the recommended times (10AM - 6PM) and checking back frequently (like, every hours), the front door is often locked and unattended, with no contact information provided. This has led to our parcels being returned due to limited storage time. Attempts to kindly address the issue with the owner were met with an unapologetic response citing limited manpower. Given this ongoing issue, we have decided not to choose Gap Hostel as a collection point any longer.",

All orders were returned in this frustrating experience as a result of the staff's irresponsible attitude. ** Staff informed that collection time was within operating hours of 10am to 6pm, which customers abided to. Updated review to clarify that claim by owner of expectation for 24/7 service is false.",
