WS Tan,5,"The food here is good, in a very nice and cool ambience in a serene environment. Sat outdoors and there’s a live band singing great songs from the 80s. Ordered the beef sirloin steak and seafood pasta, both tastes good and serving size is decent. Paired with great beer on tap.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108457502341953450038/reviews
Reuven Cheng,5,"Came because I had Grabfood-ed their chicken wings and was really impressed. Both the salted egg chicken wings and chili crab chicken wings were super impressive tender and fall off the bone!

At the restaurant, tried their dry aged ribeye which was slightly on the dry side but paired with a really good beef jus and blue pea seasoning salt. Their baby pork ribs were juicy and also fall off the bone. This time we also tried their sesame yuzu chicken wings which were my parents favourite! My mum said that based on the aglio olio, can tell that the rest of the food will be great, and she was not wrong!!

Really impressed and look forward to going again :) will bring some friends over for drinks soon",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101098631149626039607/reviews
박종철,5,I go here often with my colleagues.  The staff are friendly and the food is satisfactory.  Especially the combination with beer is very good.  Sometimes we can enjoy live music performances in the evening.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113581609401808635924/reviews
Tan Jun Yang,5,"Got to know this place through Level Ground.
Nice ambience with outdoor live band. Wasn’t too crowded on a Friday night. Food was good and reasonably priced. Prompt and attentive service.

Wagyu rib on hot stone. Oil fats will splatter so grill with caution. But meat was good. Good for 4 pax.
Duck and mango pizza. Taste good together. Not a bad combination.
Salted egg chicken wing was well coated yet not too salty.
Truffle fries was crispy and not greasy unlike other places drenching it in truffle oil.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116652199618216577912/reviews
S. K.,4,"Food was good! Ribs were great and perfectly cooked. Fish & chips was good and also generous.
Small improvements can be made. I ordered a full rack but received a half. I could hear most of the convo between the wait staff and the kitchen about it. They served the next half rack in the end, and I felt they were generous about it because it came with all the sides as well - I was just expecting a plain plate of an extra half rack. We got the cheese fries. The blanket of cheese was unexpected, appearance wise but it was yummy nonetheless. Drinks were good. Maybe something to note is mosquitoes? I got 3 mosquito bites on my legs while there, indoors. Overall a good experience.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103411090377474571154/reviews
