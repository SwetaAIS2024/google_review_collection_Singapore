Grace Budiono,5,"Great Vibes, Even Better Drinks!

I recently visited Lazy Sloth along East Coast Road for their happy hour, and it was such a fantastic experience! The atmosphere is laid-back, with a fun and welcoming vibe that‚Äôs perfect for unwinding after work. The happy hour specials were impressive, with a great selection of cocktails, beers on tap, and wine at unbeatable prices.

The staff were friendly and attentive, ensuring we had everything we needed. It‚Äôs definitely a great spot to hang out with friends or even meet new people.

If you‚Äôre looking for a spot with good drinks, good company, and a relaxing atmosphere, Lazy Sloth‚Äôs happy hour is the place to be!

Jonathan Ang,5,The beef stew was surprisingly fantastic - probably the best beef stew I've ever had. Fish and chips were great as well. Very impressed by the quality of food in this unassuming bar.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101193920295862962205/reviews
Livia,5,"First discovered this place in March 2024 when I was eating at the yakitori restaurant next door and their HH drinks caught my eye. They serve a good pint of Guinness at 9.90 during HH which runs all the way till 9pm.

Finally tried their food when I had dinner with friends in October 2024 and I was pleasantly surprised by the standard of the food. Had the grilled chicken chop and it was tasty, juicy and succulent. Had their beef stew on another visit and that was delicious as well.

Really had no expectations for their food as I thought it was more of a bar but I‚Äôm mighty impressed and will keep going back.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116594601122806473772/reviews
