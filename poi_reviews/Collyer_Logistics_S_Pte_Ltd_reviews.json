      "text": "Ordered some sakes from sakemama.com.sg and understood from them that the sakes were delivered by Collyer Logistics. The sakes were delivered very very cold which is very rare because a lot of sake distributors do not realise that temperature storage is so important in keeping the freshness.\n\nCollyer did a great job ensuring the sakes were kept cold, almost as if it came out from the fridge. The delivery person from Collyer was also very pleasant. Highly recommend Collyer for cold delivery!",
