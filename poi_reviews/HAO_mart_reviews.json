When I walked a distance she called me from far and asked about the bag of oranges. Do you think is appropriate? And the store also installed with CCTV , what's the use of it ??! Sorry to mean it but it feels offended.",

They will let you know if the fruit you are getting is ready to eat already or still need to let it sits for another day or so. If you need anything and cannot find, just ask any one of them and they will help you with it instantly. Great and friendly mart near my house. üíïüëç",
