Kou chan,5,"this school is so awesome!!! I remember on a Tuesday evening, I was wandering the halls around the third floor waiting for my friend when I suddenly caught a glimpse of a big scaly creature! I got curious and decided to follow it. It kept twisting and turning around the endless St. Nicks corridors, and a thunderous stomping could be heard as it made its way into the school bathroom. When I opened the door, a wall of pond stench hit me like a brick. It reeked of fish water and I could make out a soft gurgling of water. I knocked on the third stall three times (mind you, it was the third floor) and asked if Hanako-san was present. To my horror, the door unlocked itself and creaked open. There, I saw a translucent figure; dark green with a spiky silhouette, drinking water out of the toilet bowl. It lunged at me, and it was then I realised, that was the ghost of the old school crocodile! Luckily, the announcement for us to get out at 6:30 was playing. The crocodile vanished and I immediately ran away, swearing to never enter that toilet again.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100394147318990270808/reviews
ikanaide,5,"an amazing and primary and secondary school! i still remember the days, when i was young and foolish, wandering around the halls together with my cohort… when suddenly, a gigantinormous skibidi toilet blocked our path! “i am hungry and i will eat you kids yum yum yum” skibidi toilet had loudly proclaimed. 40x7= 280 girls and i shivered under his crazed gaze, and just as we were about to be swallowed up, 校长婆婆 appeared! “孩子们，我会保护你！” 校长婆婆 bravely stood up for us, holding an enlarged whiteboard marker as her honourable weapon. “别怕！” we stared in awe and amazement as 校长婆婆 and her 27 crocodiles (who had crawled out of the pond to check out the commotion) beat up the skibidi toilet to pieces. it stood no chance against the mighty 校长婆婆. after that, 校长婆婆 adopted us all and we lived in happiness and harmony

all hail 校长婆婆 🙏🙏🙏🙏",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112143402210171818645/reviews
