azi len,4,"It's very helpful to have one in the heart to tampines, it's not so big which for me good for the parents to monitor their furbabies. And a nice place for dog owner to mingle and get to know other dog owners and share views and experience that helps each others not to mention organise e playdate.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110404998125992996345/reviews
William Cher,1,"Read from online about the friendly people and dogs. brought my puppy from Bedok Reservoir to zTampines dog run to experience it.  when we arrived, about 9 dogs were in the park with owners mingling and talking. Looks good so I brought my puppy in. 1 or 2 of the dogs were abit aggressive towards mine when he smell their bum.  within 5 minutes everybody including owners & dogs packed up and left.  Suddenly, the park was left with only 1 other dog  and my puppy.  was very very surprised and taken aback. Then after speaking with some residents there thst I realised that they gather as a clique regulary and don't really welcome ""Strangers""(outsiders). So sad. The review I read was yes, both  accurate and deceiving. they are friendly with their friends and neighbors but don't welcome visitors/guest to their territory. Boo boo....",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104315499223037721876/reviews
Emerald Unicorn,2,"I'm not sure you should call this a dog park or a litter box.

Now, full disclosure, I'm a foreigner from the great natural wonder of Washington State in the US. Lush green forests, fields, and mountains as far as the eye can see. Our off-leash dog parks are more like Dog acres where happy pups can run and romp, through the trees and fields, living out their best inner-wolf lives.

In contrast, this ""dog park"" by the Tampines Hub is one of the few Tampines has, if not the only one, but whenever I see dogs inside this box they look less enthusiastic about their situation. If they could glue their face to a phone screen like their owner, they would.

Maybe a little lap dog can get a decent lap, but a beefy boy can possibly shake a paw and then pant profusely from the heat.

Singapore, you got to up your good Boi game. A little pawiful, to be honest.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112976396898780930307/reviews
