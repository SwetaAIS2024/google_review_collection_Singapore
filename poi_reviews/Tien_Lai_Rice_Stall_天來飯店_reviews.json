Really liked the lean and nicely charred char siew and the crispy pork belly was very crispy! Skin is super crispy and tasty! Had way more meat than rice so itâ€™s quite worth it. Added an egg and the total cost was $5.30. Price wise is also reasonable!\n\nThe queue never stops so make sure you come early!",

      "text": "Have alway wanted to try this stall for the longest of time. Finally managed to find a day on weekday to come Taman Jurong Food Centre. This stall is well known for their roast items like Charsiew, roast duck and roast meat. There was already a long queue when i reached, there was at least 15pax ahead of me. Queued for almost 25mins before it was my turn to order.\n\nOrdered the charsiew rice which was SGD$4. The portion of the meat was quite generous to be honest. Charsiew was nicely roasted, there are bits of char and charsiew is more on the sweet side. Their chili also deserved a mention, it goes really well with the charsiew.\n\nOverall, the food was fantastic. The roast duck looks equally fabalous, wouldnt mind trying the next time round. I would definitely recoomend this stall if you dont mind the long queue.",
