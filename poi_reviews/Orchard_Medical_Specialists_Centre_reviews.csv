rafael apostolico,5,"Doctor Kieran Moriarty is one of the best dentists that you can find in Singapore.

The entire procedure was very smooth, painless and he was checking on me all the time. On top of that he explains to you what he is doing, the reasons why and how this will affect your wellbeing in the future.

The clinic by itself is very organised, clean and staff super gentle.

Will definitely come back and refer to my friends.

Thanks a lot",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109633771922771992895/reviews
Saan Choy,1,Nothing is opened in the 5th floor (looks like dead town.  No signages if this clinic does exist) and no one answering the phone either.  I think the place is closed ? Needed medical help and wasted my time and effort,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107475536872479598950/reviews
