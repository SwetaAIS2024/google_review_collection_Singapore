Potato Head,4,"Visited for casual lunch
This is our 2nd visit here and this time we were in private room.
Roasted pig here is really good and always impressed.
And today‚Äôs beef dish was quite special with this unique vegetable which is yellow and red tomato and cupsicum.
Especially this capsicum  texture is very special and only I could eat here.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113658781384736931614/reviews
William Tan,4,"This is the restaurant located in Singapore Swimming Club. Outsider, not the club member can come here for dinner as well. Not so crowded even it is dinner time. Environment also nice and quiet, suitable for a family dinner, you can talk as the environment not os noisy and not crowded.

Food taste here also nice. üçö8/10 in overall. No so salty as well.

But price here is quite expensive. It is reatsurant price, per person starting from SGD 30+ depending on what you order.

Plenty of parking. Parking rate starting from SGD 2.50, subsequent hour SGD 3.00.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116142914043575788977/reviews
Ron Yang,5,"Serene environment with attentive service. Food quality is excellent. Price is reasonable. But you must be a Singapore Swimming Club member to eat here. The beef cubes are a MUST try, so is the Red Bean Pancake.

Highly recommended. Must try. Have been back and will be back!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104960568279362160422/reviews
David Moh,5,"This is a big Chinese restaurant that serves a wide variety of Chinese cuisine. The food served was of good quality and delicious, albeit at a higher price range.

Not much ambience but it makes up for its good quality and delicious food served.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112451213464084221858/reviews
Bugwagen,5,Been here for CNY reunion pre-pandemic and found the prices to be exorbitant and don‚Äôt have much impression of the food.  Recently was invited for dinner at same restaurant and really enjoyed the food!  Good Chinese restaurant food.  Had more helping of the soup.  Fish was very crispy!  Beef was very tender and nice! Mee Sua was also very tasty.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109071563364310385081/reviews
