Lily Teo,5,"Visited wethefarm as volunteer on a rainy Saturday. Sign up on Eventbrite. They opened on Sat and Sunday and the ""educators"" are very knowledgeable and willing to answer questions. It was raining and we do indoor activities like soil mix, preparing materials for composting. Love the whole set up concept and altruistic purpose of educating, having a farm to kitchen concept and passion for composting.  Do come volunteer and learn from them- the 3 musketeers who founded this rooftop farm.👨‍🌾👨‍🌾👨‍🌾
