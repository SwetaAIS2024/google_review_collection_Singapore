Ed T,5,"Authentic Malay foods do not get better than this!

Had some time to burn and wandered into this coffee shop & the fragrance from freshly cooked Malay foods caught my attention.

Decided to give them a try and was pleasantly surprised.

Manning the store were 2 young guys, it is always heart warming to see the younger generation stepping up to fill such shoes.

Keep up the good work guys, will be coming back again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118071263998897226945/reviews

Elaine Soon,5,"Absolutely love their food! I happened to tried their Ayam Merah, Fried Chicken, Lotong and Mee Soto! Really good! We even get them to cook for our family’s gathering and everyone love their cooking!

I’m really surprised that the Chef is really young and able to cook such authentic dishes. His Ayam Merah reminds me of those I’ve eaten more than 30 years ago during a Malay Wedding. Really love it!

Their friendliness and service is beyond words.

Just do take note that by 2pm, they are almost sold out! If you want to try their food, do drop by before 1230pm.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114667831072595519921/reviews
