Vienna,5,"Unlike most water parks, the water here is very shallow, like a stream. But interestingly, the design is clever with winding water. The children are very happy here. I can see many birds come here to drink water. It should be noted that water only comes out from 8-11am and 4 - 8 pm every Thursday to Sunday. Very nice place for all!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103415808392827589559/reviews
singing sunflower,5,"Newly opened after renovation. Kids enjoyed the park very much! Suitable for toddlers and kids as the water is shallow, flowing from the small pool to ground ‚Äî a mini pool which only one child can sit inside.
There is toilet nearby with shower facility.
Good weekend activity for kids to enjoy in nature!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106441384417742206227/reviews
Lim KHF,5,Nice and wonderful to hang around.  Walk around the pond area and you may spot the otters.  Wonderful place to take a slow walk and enjoy the peace and tranquility.  This place is less crowded than the the other Bishan park across the road.  There is a Carpark nearby and toilet facilities.  You can grab drinks from the vending machine outside the toilet.  There is a schedule time for the water play.  A shelter nearly serves as a resting spot from the hot or wet weather.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103724546457763700175/reviews
