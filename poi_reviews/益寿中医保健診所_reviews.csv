e. owada,1,"They don't know the price, and they don't explain it clearly, so they add oil and mud fees. Moreover, it's bad Singlish, so it's different from what I confirmed. This is clearly a scam aimed at tourists. They didn't even check to see if I had allergies, so my back was swollen from the mud and I had bruises on my arms. The important part of the massage is that you don't use your hands, you just get stroked by a weird machine, so it's not really a massage. Please avoid this place at all costs. In this place, Shinglish speaking therapists are not honest and if you’re travelers they’ll try to cheat you without giving you enough price information; their typical way is to put some oil and muds saying that it won’t cost that much; however they charge you more than double price they gave you first. I was suffered from allergic symptoms afterwards since they didn’t tell me anything about allergy when they used the mud-like stuff. In addition, the therapist used a machine instead of hands, which cannot be called a ‘massage’ at all. Be careful and better step away from this so-called “medical clinic.”",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101190308549129456386/reviews
王青华,5,"As soon as I entered the store, I smelled the aroma of mugwort and medicinal herbs. I had a strained muscle in my lower back. I was introduced to this Chinese medicine clinic by a friend. They received me warmly. Dr. Huang diagnosed me and told me that the muscles in my back were high on one side and low on the other. The tension was unbalanced, leading to scoliosis. At the same time, due to age, the Mingmen fire was weak, leading to spleen deficiency, imbalance of transportation and transformation, and reduced muscle tensile strength. He suggested that I undergo a traditional Chinese medicine physiotherapy on my back, which included half an hour of massage to relax the muscles, bone-setting and spine adjustment, scraping and cupping to quickly remove the clogged garbage in the meridians, and then moxibustion mud on my back and far-infrared physiotherapy to warm and unblock the meridians and replenish my vitality. After a few courses of conditioning, there should be great improvement. I said that I would do it once to see the effect, and he arranged for an assistant to do physical therapy for me. His technique was very professional and superb. During the osteopathy, I made a series of clicking sounds on my back. He told me that the spine was not straight. Over time, the small joints of the thoracic spine are prone to dislocation. These sounds are the sounds of the joints returning to their positions. When I was scraping my back, he took photos of me. There were many Sha, and after the hot compress with moxibustion mud, my back felt warm and comfortable. After the entire physical therapy, I felt like I had been reborn, very relaxed, and in a very comfortable mood. I asked his name, and he told me it was Ahua. I said thank you very much, and I signed a package for a course of treatment. The trip was well worth it.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108124301218597461889/reviews
