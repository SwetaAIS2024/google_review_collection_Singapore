      "text": "Lil hole-in-the-wall gem tucked in a back alley in Joo Chiat ‚Äî blink & you‚Äôll miss it. No indoor seats, just a couple of spots outside under a tree, but that‚Äôs kinda the charm. I had the iced peanut butter coffee with oat milk ($6.50) & it was smooth, creamy & hit just right. The peanut butter adds a nice nutty richness without overpowering the coffee, & the oat milk just ties it all together. Chill vibes, friendly crew & defs a cute spot if you‚Äôre wandering the area or need a quick caffeine fix with a twist.",

One of their most popular drinks, peanut butter coffee, is really delicious and has a similar texture and consistency to the famous egg coffee in Vietnam.\n\nIf you care less about the origin of the coffee or what moon phase it is harvested at, and just more into how people can marry coffee with different ingredients and create new exciting flavours, do drop by and have a look.",

The coconut coffee was on the sweeter side, and I think I was secretly hoping it would match the ones I had in Vietnam. It didn‚Äôt quite get there, but it still had a nice savoury edge that made it enjoyable in its own way.\n\nThe space is tiny and tucked away behind a barbershop on a backstreet alley which gives it a bit of charm. Worth popping by if you‚Äôre in the area and want something familiar with a little twist.",
