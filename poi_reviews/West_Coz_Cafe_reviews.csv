Dave Ng,4,"We had a 10 pax dinner set, with probably 8 course dishes (and we added one curry fish head). The serving is plentiful and the taste is well acceptable. The service is surprisingly good and attentive. Also, the set come with drinks and the restaurant is Halal certified.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102670815999657293644/reviews
JJ Jen,4,"One of my family's favourite restaurant since they opened. But standard definitely dropped alot. We enjoyed the Oyster Omelette, Nyonya Ladyfinger and Salted Egg Sotong.

Ash Ash,3,Just average. Used to be very nice many years ago. Standard drop a lot. The fuyong omelette was unappetising and very thin. Loaded with more onions. $10 for this is not worth. Pinoy staff was damn annoying was singing and humming while walking pass the table. Nothing wrong with singing to yourself. But it was so annoying coz non stop.
