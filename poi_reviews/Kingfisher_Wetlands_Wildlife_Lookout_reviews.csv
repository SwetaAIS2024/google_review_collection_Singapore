Damcho Tshering,5,"Kingfisher Wetlands, nestled behind Satay by the Bay, is a hidden sanctuary within Gardens by the Bay, offering a peaceful retreat into nature. This beautifully designed wetland features lush greenery, cascading waterfalls, and tranquil ponds that attract a variety of wildlife. It is a haven for birdwatchers, with species like kingfishers, herons, and egrets often spotted among the trees and water edges.

Strolling along the wooden boardwalks and stone pathways, you can take in the calming sounds of flowing water while observing fish, dragonflies, and other wetland creatures. The reflective ponds, surrounded by rich vegetation, create a picturesque setting perfect for nature lovers and photographers. Unlike the bustling Supertree Grove or Flower Dome, Kingfisher Wetlands offers a quieter, more immersive experience, allowing visitors to connect with nature at a slower pace.

This serene spot is ideal for those seeking a relaxing walk or a moment of solitude amidst the city’s greenery. Whether you’re exploring the Gardens or stopping by after a meal at Satay by the Bay, Kingfisher Wetlands is a must-visit for its scenic beauty and rich biodiversity. A perfect escape from the crowds, it’s where nature thrives in harmony with the urban landscape.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116833702802756994837/reviews

Meng Fai Yip,5,"Instead of the usual hike from Stadium MRT Station to Marina Bay Sands (via Tanjong Rhu Suspension Bridge, Bay East Garden, and then Marina Barrage Dam), I planned for the following unconventional route:

Marina South Pier MRT > Marina South Promenade > Marina Barrage > Marina Barrage Dam > Breakwater @ Marina East > Marina Barrage Dam > Marina Barrage > Lotus Pond/Kingfisher Wetlands (both of which are part of Gardens by the Bay) > Bayfront MRT

Here are some photos taken at the Kingfisher Wetlands. It was better than I expected, and there were lots of lush greenery. If you do decide to come by on a weekday morning, you may want to consider having a quiet and peaceful soft boiled egg/kaya toast breakfast at the nearby Satay by the Bay. You won't be disappointed!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109238839349859158213/reviews
M M,5,"Tucked away within Gardens by the Bay, the Kingfisher Wetlands Wildlife Lookout offers a refreshing nature escape right in the heart of Singapore. My visit began with a gentle stroll from Satay by the Bay, where a bridge led me into a landscape alive with water cascades, lush vegetation, and the tranquil sound of mini waterfalls pouring into natural rock pools. The area feels thoughtfully designed, with winding paths that meander around the Lotus Pond and Kingfisher Lake, encouraging visitors to slow down and take in their surroundings.

The highlight for me was the Wildlife Lookout deck, a dedicated platform beside the Lotus Pond. From here, I could quietly observe a variety of birds and other wildlife in their natural habitat. Informational signboards around the lookout provided fascinating facts about the resident and migratory species that frequent the wetlands-including several types of kingfishers, ducks, and even the occasional otter or monitor lizard. The educational aspect made the experience especially engaging, as I learned about the importance of mangroves and the role of urban wetlands in supporting biodiversity.

What stood out was the sense of serenity, despite being so close to the city’s bustle. The wetlands are open daily from 5:00 am to 2:00 am, making them accessible for early-morning birdwatchers or those seeking a peaceful evening walk. Admission is free, and the area is suitable for families, nature enthusiasts, and anyone looking to reconnect with nature without leaving the city.

Overall, the Kingfisher Wetlands Wildlife Lookout is a hidden gem that combines scenic beauty, educational opportunities, and a genuine sense of tranquility. It’s a wonderful spot for wildlife observation, photography, or simply unwinding by the water’s edge, and I’d recommend it to anyone visiting Gardens by the Bay.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114442474015223259254/reviews
