HS Lim,4,"Frontier Primary School ÂÖàÈîãÂ∞èÂ≠¶
One of the newest primary school I  Jurong West, it gives more option to family with younger children within the region. This young school, Frontier Primary School will have their 1st PSLE in 2017.
Good luck to all school goers and teachers.

Like some other people mentioned, the floor is  slippery and u need to climb up 5 levels before reaching the courts.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100137768494883536544/reviews
Aidan Loh,4,"(In the perspective of a former student)
Frontier Primary is a really good school. Food is fine. My science teachers really know what they are doing. They are strict but funny too. Lots of activities to do during recess. They even have a game room opened during recess! Students are fine, some are naughty but smart. üëç",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101468739564590036557/reviews
Blue Helmet,1,"If compare with all the primary schools from Boon Lay area up to Jurong West , based on chats among parents , I will give this rating and I believe the school have no means of stretching the academically and holistically.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100460460255678376535/reviews
Nextcloud 947,5,"I only went there for booking badminton court, so I will tell you how to get in. Upon facing the front gate, turn towards your left and keep going until there is a gate. Walk into the gate and walk up the staircase. Just keep going until you reach level 5 which will be a bit tedious, and then there is the ISH and then open the door. All schools in Singapore are good schools, which means that this school is a good school too!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101064730163717417192/reviews
