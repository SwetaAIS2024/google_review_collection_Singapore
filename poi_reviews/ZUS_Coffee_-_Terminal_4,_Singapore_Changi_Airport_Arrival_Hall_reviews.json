We were surprised when two baristas, Marissa and Nadia, popped their heads and welcomed us. We told them our experience and recommended amazing drinks to reward our work outs. The Buttercreme Spanish Latte, Double Chocolate and Zus Lemonade was refreshing and delicious! Thank you so much Marissa and Nadia for the impeccable service, the both of you deserve a raise in your salaries.",

      "text": "I planned to try Singaporean coffee and, based on Google Maps recommendations, chose ZUS Coffee. Unfortunately, the experience was disappointing. The staff were unhelpful and unnecessarily long-winded, especially when all I wanted was a quick, contactless payment process.\n\nWhen picking up the coffee, the barista was extremely slow, causing frustration among several customers ‚Äî I even heard some openly complain, saying ‚Äútoo slow!!!‚Äù This really impacted the overall experience.\n\nI hope the service can be improved, especially in terms of efficiency and staff attitude, as these are crucial for a good coffee shop experience.",

Great for light coffee drinkers seeking a rich, smooth, and sweet experience. üëç\n\nAustralian Chocolate ($5.90)\nA rich, chocolatey drink crafted with 100% Australian cocoa. Its natural dark cocoa flavour and milky sweetness deliver a luxurious \"melted chocolate\" vibe, though it amusingly resembles a premium Milo! ü•∞",
