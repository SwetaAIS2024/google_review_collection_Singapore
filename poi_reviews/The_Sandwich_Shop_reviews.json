      "text": "Monday morning 10.20am. I ordered a Make Your Own Breakfast with a raisin bagel $3.50 with butter spread $1, avocado $4.20 and mushroom $4.20. Coffee is a double 12oz Flat White. Breakfast is great, the grilled mushroom is fabulous and avocado is ripe and buttery soft. Flat White is delicious. They have many salad and sandwiches to take away. Highly recommend this place for a quick breakfast, which isn't very crowded at this time. However, the spotlights near the side are super warm, not environmentally friendly in our tropical climate in Singapore. I was perspiring while having my breakfast.",

      "text": "My favourite sandwich shop in CBD but I gave it 4 stars. Read on.\n\nI have been patronizing this place for lunch sometimes since 2018 when I came across it. I introduced my colleagues and any business visitors who maybe were not accustomed to the Asian food.\n\nThere used to be a variety of sandwiches over the years, my all-time favourites were the beef one with dried tomatoes and when that became unavailable I went for the salmon brie baguette.\n\nIn the second half of 2023 the sandwich options have been reduced and to my sadness, there are mot that many good options. The prices have been constant over the years which probably makes it more difficult to have a better variety (the exception is the soup, the price increased from 2$ if I remember well to 4$ now for a small cream soup).\n\nAnother thing that’s been consistent: Service has always been super friendly.\n\nNevertheless I hope the sandwich list will be revamped in 2024 so I can enjoy a good lunch when I am in the office.\nPS: they have salads too but as the name states, it’s a “sandwich shop”",

      "text": "Pretty busy on a lunch time but still made my sandwich to order very quickly.\nMy issue was more that they had mayo on literally every sandwich as a butter substitute which is a classic way to make cheaper and lower quality sandwiches. I asked for butter instead, and was given a sandwich with no spread at all. The bread was a little bit dry, which I guess they fix by putting mayo on usually.\nIf I had to make a comparison I'd say it was about the level of a Tesco pre-made sandwich but for four times the price.",
