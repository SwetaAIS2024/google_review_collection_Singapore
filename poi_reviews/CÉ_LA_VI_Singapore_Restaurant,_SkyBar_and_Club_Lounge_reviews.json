      "text": "Went to the CE LA VI bar at Marina Bay Sands around 3:30 PM on a Monday. As expected, the views are absolutely stunning—definitely a highlight and worth seeing once if you’re visiting. The $38 admission includes one well drink, which was fine but nothing special. Drinks overall are pricey, as you’d expect.\n\nWe were able to find a seat without much trouble, but the space itself is showing its age. Opened in 2010 and it feels like little has been done since to keep it fresh. The bathrooms, in particular, were surprisingly run down for such a high-end property.\n\nAll in all, it’s a solid one-time tourist stop—great for photos and the view, but probably not somewhere you’d return.",

      "text": "An absolutely unforgettable experience! Cé La Vi rooftop in Singapore offers a breathtaking view of the skyline — simply magical, especially at sunset. This place is a must-visit in the city! Head to the top of the iconic “boat” at Marina Bay Sands for a moment you won’t soon forget.\n\nEntry costs around $30 to $35, but that amount is deducted if you order something to eat or drink at the bar— definitely worth it! The vibe is chic, the service is excellent, and the cocktails are top-notch. Perfect for a memorable night with panoramic views of the entire city. Don’t miss it!",

We did have a 400 singapore dollar minimum to spend in order to get a sofa table that overlooks singapore. It was well worth it with stunning views and excellent food. Our server was amazing. It was sunny and she took the time to get us sunscreen In addition to being very attentive. We will come back!",

The food is really good, making it worth dining here. The atmosphere is also very pleasant and beautiful. From the pub’s terrace, you can get a stunning view of Singapore from above—the Marina Bay is quite tall. I highly recommend the visit!",
