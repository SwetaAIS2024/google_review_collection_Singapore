Faith,5,"Located in Kopitiam Hillion Mall (L2). Pretty good experience with this place. Staffs were patient and friendly. Place is halal. Food was good and portion worth the price. I couldn't finish what I ordered. 1 French fries. 1 Seaweed chicken. 1 Fish fillet carbonara pasta. Had to takeaway last min so I bought a takeaway box for 30cents. ($19.90 excluding Kopitiam discount and take away box)

Lots of variaties from Salad to Pasta to chips. I'd rather eat here than Pastamania or any other fast food chain. Will be back again.

Wheelchair friendly too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100533378757177204438/reviews
Es Kwa,1,"This dish is supposed to be ebi baked rice. It is different from the photo outside the stall. Sauce is brown not red. Instead of big leafy vegetables, I got a thin slice of broccoli and a small tomato. The whitish spots on the sauce are cheese. When I complained to the counter the reply was outside the stall was only a photo, implying not to expect what I purchase to look like the photo!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105018573288558302846/reviews
Lonesome Boss,4,"I enjoyed a delicious salmon aglio olio at the kopitiam food court. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and I appreciated the option to customize the spice level. (the staff added extra chili padi for me). The addition of broccoli, chicken, and mushrooms made the pasta even more flavorful. The salmon was also nicely cooked.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113993294785867614530/reviews
Mohamed Haniffa,3,"Located above the Bukit Panjang Bus Interchange...
1st time trying out here...
Got the Grilling Chicken Crossiant to go..
It look like a sandwich in the pic but actually when i opened the box, the crossiant was cut most of the way flat, with the chicken on top.
Had to cut the chicken in half inorder to eat it like a sandwich.ðŸ˜ƒ.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106001901776455159598/reviews
Bylur Xu,4,"For once, was steered towards trying this stall out.

Had a dish of Grilled Salmon with two sides and food was awesome - fish was hot, pasta and salad were decent.

But I would not order again just for the free ice cream, which I was curious prior to the ordering as the ice cream wasnâ€™t worth it.

There, your salad + protein bar in a foodcourt environment.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100739939185962660240/reviews
