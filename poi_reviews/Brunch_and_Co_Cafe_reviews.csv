Carol Ng,5,"Enjoyed the lunch dishes. We order brussel sprouts, breakfast platter and meaty Mac and cheese for 2 adults and 1 child. The platter was very generous. The meaty Mac and cheese is a tomato based spin off of the usual Mac and cheese which is a nice touch. The brussel sprouts were very tasty with the toppings and the  ponzu sauce. The cheesecake was light but not quite my personal preference. The Nutella milkshake has a nice balance.

The place is quite nicely decorated but kind of squeezy and has limited capacity. Would advice to go earlier before lunchtime if you do not want to wait. :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108967381779587502243/reviews
Elisa Liew,5,"Had brunch here with friends, ordered Big Breakfast Platter, F&C, Mushroom Aglio Olio and tater tots. Portions are generous and food is tasty. French Vanilla Latte was a lil too sweet to our liking though but still good coffee.
Prices are reasonable & staff are friendly.
Will be back !",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103099928962179152213/reviews
Jeff Lim,5,"Personally thought the food was good and reasonably priced (no service charge as well)

Staff was polite and the food also came out fast

Highly recommend others to patronise (and maybe try their jelly cake, it's pretty unique). 10/10 would come again :)",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110633994570090294000/reviews
Luke Elijah,5,"Tasty, hearty, and generously portioned Western dishes at reasonable prices. Their best selling healthy options such as Miso Salmon and Charred Brussels were sold out. Everything that we tried was perfectly seasoned and we licked our plates clean.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106202026537588687217/reviews
Michellesw lee,3,"Went for their V day lunch..i think the set meal for 2 pax at around 60+

Their Vday set come with 2 mains choice between pasta and mains,  2 ice tea drink, soup of the day and cheesecake.

Order their pesto pasta mushroom, presentation at least with some nuts though the dish does not really have much of the nutty fragrance...overall it was good, not too oily.

The dessert set, the icecream taste like normal walls vanila flavour. The jelly cheesecake does not taste fresh already.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109815085101358051514/reviews
