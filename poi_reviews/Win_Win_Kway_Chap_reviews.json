The broth for the kway (flat rice noodles) is amazing, helmed by an elderly chef owner, the innards are all cleaned well and quite fresh. A hearty traditional tasting meal.",

Kway on the other hand was diluted and not to my liking. Chili just feels like those package chili , then the auntie add vinegar to it. Itâ€™s not really to travel all the way down for it, but if u r around the area this is worth it",

Pieces are cut pretty unevenly but itâ€™s is a one person manned shop. Kway is a bit soft for my liking, albeit generous.\n\n$6 for one person portion of small and big intestines and pork skin is really good value.",

      "text": "Dec 2023\n\nFirst, please read all before you based it on the stars rating. Google havenâ€™t evolve yet and its rating system maybe is something they are not focusing.\n\nKway Chap (4.25/5)\nThis kway chap is something Iâ€™ll definitely come again. Very hard nowadays to eat kway chap that is fresh and doesnâ€™t have that smelly odour.\n\nEven thou it is at a ulu industrial park and only have 1 old auntie manning everything. It doesnâ€™t stop her from maintaining what is the most important thing for food, the taste and quality. She also keep the stall very neat and clean. (Top notch for coffeeshop standard)\n\nIf need to say something I would wish better is the quantity, maybe its because of the rising cost of everything. Maybe she could add something cheaper to make the things at least abit filling, like beancurd skin or more kuay. This location majority is male workers doing heavy lifting, they need more carbs and proteins, the additional kuay and beancurd would make it more filling. When you can sell more, could bargain for more discount from supplier, supplier would also like to grow their business, one trip shop get more item, most cost efficient, cost down, sell more, the profit margin would also go up, happy for all, customer, supplier and shop owner. ðŸ™‚",
