Those who love to sing.... sing away! They have a great library of songs on Karaoke. Hungry? You'll be spoke for choice with the incredible Japanese food – fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. Best way to describe Pat's.... \"Where everybody knows your name\" Highly recommend for anyone who appreciates Japanes food, great drinks and a welcoming vibe!",
