      "text": "I‚Äôve been following up with Dr Wee for my collarbone injury since last year November and I truly appreciate the excellent care he provided. From the start, the diagnosis was clear and thorough, giving me confidence in the recovery process. Dr Wee took the time to explain my condition, answered all my questions and assured me that surgery was not necessary, which was a great relief. Thanks for his guidance and advice, my recovery has been progressing well üòÅüëçüèª",

      "text": "Had a fall in Aug 2024. I met Dr Alvin for a consultation a few days after.  After meeting him, within the same week of the fall I already know I had Ligament tear. Due to work etc, planned the surgery at Alvernia in Dec 2024. So of course, I had the most princess treatment ever! I truly recommend seeing Dr Alvin if you have any type of orthopedic issues. He is knowledgeable, kind, expertise in his work and will take care of you very well! Within 3 months I can walk well and of course with physio (another amazing princess treatment) I managed to gain strength and slowly begin to gain strength in my knee. Thank you Dr Alvin and team for looking after my being and my knee!\n\nP/s: the scar gel the clinic recommended is so amazing! I can hardly see the scar !! Just the big one. You could hardly see the other two #superlove",

He handled the whole process professionally & answered all my questions satisfactorily. A man with few words, but he showed that he is humble , sincere & caring. I will not hesitate to recommend anyone who needs his help. I wish him well & that he will continue to do his excellent work serving the community.",
