Nicely redone from the previous cafe with full length glass panels so light filled and serene. Food is usual B&C fare. Like the beetroot energy salad, very refreshing.",

I ate a wonderful chocolate eclair paired with a nice pot of green tea. The combination was wonderful. I am a disabled person and needed to use the toilet, the friendly staff Nicholas kindly and patiently guided me to the toilet outside the cafe and also opened the door for me. I had a great experience with this cafe and I wholly recommend it to everybody who appreciates great bakes and tea!",
