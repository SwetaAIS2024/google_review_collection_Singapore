Ad Tan,2,"The school is literally tone deaf or has very bad sound engineers or teachers who fail physics. While I applaud their efforts in organising a sports day for their students, this year it is on 24 august, there is no need to turn up the volume of your speakers to the maximum affecting homes in the neighborhood as far as 1 km away.  The whole neighborhood in siglap don't need to share your joy..thanks.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100219788131800702985/reviews
Val Cardinho,2,"Pros> Mala Vohra from the Admission team, she come across as a proactive, assertive and approachable lady. Quite an asset to the school. Met us at the appointment time and thoroughly explained the admission process including the small details.

Cons >I felt the management utilizes funds on the sales and marketing department and is blinded towards the rest.

The facilities are run down, even though its an old school. That is not an excuse!
The money that is being earned through such a profitable school for the shareholders and investors, can be well spent on renovation and further improvement..... but NO!!

The security is not vigilant and lazy, there are live wires hanging without proper mounting or brackets.Â  There are rusted and broken drain covers, that is just waiting for an accident to happen. No proper lighting in the classrooms and the cleanliness is not up to the mark.

Take a tour to get a good insight and proper justification of their asking fees!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104562020472282593322/reviews
Harsh Goyal,2,"Very old campus . fees is too high and getting increased year on year. Last 2 year fees increased by 20-25%.
Also teachers attention to kids is minimal. Class strength can go from 20-33 also in CBSE.  ECA and CCA and not worth .. in most of the cases it just for sake of advertisement.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116878922756469195600/reviews
