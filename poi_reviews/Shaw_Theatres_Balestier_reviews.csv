A Minecraft Movie. Clean, fresh and good natural lighting. Very welcoming. Decor is retro of the 70s which I guess Shaw theatre was birthed right here. Seats are comfortable, good leg room, cosy and intimate ambience with right air con temperature. Hall 2. Sound system is great too despite the small size as expected will be deafening but no, not at all. Distance from screen to my row, 2nd row from one and only entrance/exit was good, not glaring. Very enjoyable movie and experience. So much better compared to before renovation.', 'languageCode': 'en'}","{'text': 'Was at the Shaw Balestier cinema for the first time after the major renovation.

The cinema has also undergone renovations in the past.

The theater provides a comfortable feel and is easily accessible by bicycle. We managed to park our bicycles well, as long as we didn't cycle with a large group of friends. One or two bicycles in any theater would be just nice. When visiting the mall, I always remember to park my bicycle near the back or close to the handicap area.
