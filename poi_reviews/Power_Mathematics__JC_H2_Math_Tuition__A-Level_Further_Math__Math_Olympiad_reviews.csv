Y. L,5,"Since joining Power Mathematics at the start of J1, I've seen a huge improvement in my understanding and performance in math. Mr Wu is an incredibly supportive and patient tutor who always goes the extra mile to make complex concepts more digestible. Beyond the teaching methodology, the resources and practice materials provided have been extremely useful in helping me consolidate my understanding of each topic. His advice on presenting workings and answers has also been particularly valuable. His guidance has made my JC math journey much more enjoyable, and I highly recommend Power Mathematics to any student who wants to excel and cultivate a love for math at the same time!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117943715705382146613/reviews
Prawnsalad1991,5,"I would highly recommend joining the Further Maths ‚ÄòA‚Äô level classes here. I found this class very beneficial. Mr Wu is a dedicated teacher that put in a lot of effort into creating quality learning materials that is very well organised, concise and easy to follow. These same materials could not be found online without being incomplete, extremely long winded, or out of syllabus. What I found memorable about the class was that all the material was printed in A4 with adequate writing space so I could read clearly and practice the questions. Some material were printed in colour. The detailed solutions were issued to every exercise, and Mr Wu responds at the first opportunity to any questions asked online. The learning environment is important. Around the same time, I attended some other tuitions that gave students tables which were less than the size of a seat to work on, and learning materials printed sideways on half an A4 page - it was not the case with this class. I can unequivocally say that not every teacher upholds such high standards and dedication to their students learning. Thank you Mr Wu!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103203190516039640744/reviews
