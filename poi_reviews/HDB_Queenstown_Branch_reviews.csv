Chee Hong Wong,5,"Positive Experience! This branch office is easy to find thanks to the clear and helpful signage. I also had a fantastic experience with Liyana. She was incredibly understanding and helpful when we relate the issues encountered with the web portal during the rental approval process. Liyana went above and beyond to work through everything with us interactively, making the entire process much smoother. Highly recommend!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103077909422889939310/reviews
M Z,4,"It is very convenient to have a service office within the housing estate. So we don't need to go all the way to Toa payoh for a small task like uploading documents for application. The staff was also very helpful. It is generally not so busy and the queue are not very long. But some period may be busy, I suppose. I have been there 3 times and all the times there are only 4-5 people in front of me, if not less.
