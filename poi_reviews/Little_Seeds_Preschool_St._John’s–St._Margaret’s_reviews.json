      "text": "I had transferred my child from another preschool due to the longer commute, and we have never been happier with this decision. Within the first month, I saw how my child had gained independence and confidence in doing things for himself. Almost 2 years down the road, and I am still extremely satisfied with how the school manages gaps for improvement - be it staff shortage which happens everywhere as we know or providing an improved curriculum. There's a strong sense of community here and while we are not a Christian family, we have always felt comfortable to request having our child sit out of some religious based activities. This inclusiveness and respect they have for everyone is a big draw for me. It filters down to how the teachers and staff are outstanding examples for the children. I have not encountered a single teacher who didn't seem fully qualified. We can also see how wholeheartedly they are raising the children alongside us parents. Another unique factor has got to be the joined activities between the nursing home and the school. Even without the activities,simply having the children share that same space with the elderly has countless benefits. My child looks forward to school everyday and goes in not just willingly but full of joy!",
