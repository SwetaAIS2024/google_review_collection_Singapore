DORIS ANG,4,"Located next to Kent Ridge MRT and with plenty of eateries, NUH medical centre is modern and convenient. But like all public hospitals, crowds and long wait time are a feature, in contrast to private clinics.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105258967250652112672/reviews
Tee Dil,1,"When I went to see a doctor today, the nurse said that the doctor had not come yet and asked us to wait until two o'clock. Then, we waited from 11 o'clock to 2 o'clock, and the doctor finally arrived. Then suddenly the staff told us to see a baby first. However, my family wanted to know the situation, and all they saw was the nurse playing and laughing with the baby, and the doctor disappeared. Is this a major? My family is in crisis and waiting for medical treatment. What kind of broken hospital is this? I don't even want to give a star, so you'd better not go!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104047727123700466548/reviews
Audrey,5,A mini mall serving the nus students and nuh crowd. Recently a local cafe called New nanyang opened up on the 3rd floor (beside starbucks). Finally something that actually tastes good and is authentically nanyang style!. Kopi was also strong and thick. Recommend the dry ban mian and big breakfast french toasts as well as the assam steamed fish! 5 stars,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112146156465836463329/reviews
Grace Tan,3,"Clinic B is not here. Do not be misled by the Zone B (same alphabet). Despite having 26 alphabets, apparently Clinic B is not in Zone B but in Zone F. At least till Sep 2025.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108151388092821564194/reviews
Amin Yusoff,1,"Whoever design the lift system in NUH medical system should be fired.
There is never an empty lift.
And once a lift arrive at the designated level, the other lifts doesn't stop.
It's forever full as at any 1 time only 1 lift is operational in going 1 direction.
This is ridiculous and stupid.
Useless to call yourselves top.rated hospital.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100870833459756481796/reviews
