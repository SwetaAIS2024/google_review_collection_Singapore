      "text": "Not worth the exorbitant school fees, if you ask me.\n\nMy biggest gripe is with the diet. Children were often fed empty carbs such as mantou with no filling, or suspiciously green pandan bao. Refined, processed sugar too, such as Milo. The meals are not prepared in school but in a central kitchen, transported to Vanda and reheated.\n\nEtonhouse prides itself on its mandarin program, but in my opinion it is no use to teach children tang poems and SanZiJing when they have no idea what they are reciting or even just the context within which these poems were written. During our time with Etonhouse there was a high turnover of Chinese teachers — 3 in a year.\n\nWe chose this school in part because it had a big, beautiful outdoor space (albeit right beside a big traffic intersection) but it was so underutilized. Children did not play outdoors daily, even in good weather. Granted, this was during the pandemic, but if they can be in a classroom together I see little reason why they cannot spend time outdoors.\n\nThe facilities at this school were often broken. Almost every time there was a thunderstorm there would be a power outage. There were also a few times when the toilet facilities broke.\n\nThere are some good ideas, such as a communication booklet with which you could correspond with your child’s class teacher. But guess what — our questions and comments in the book were never responded to or acknowledged.\n\nI think etonhouse does try to prepare children for local primary schools (get ready for weekly spelling and tingxie at age 5!) but for the money EH charges, the diet and state of the facilities are just unacceptable. Fees increased by ~200 right after we left the school. It feels like we are paying for EH’s PR efforts and head offices, rather than for the well-being of our little ones.",
