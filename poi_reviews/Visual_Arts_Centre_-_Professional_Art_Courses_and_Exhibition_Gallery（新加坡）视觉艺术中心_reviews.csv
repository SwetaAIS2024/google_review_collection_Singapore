Lee Jean,5,"This is truly one of the best adult art courses in Singapore! The entire experience is thoughtfully designed and incredibly professional ‚Äì from the teaching methods to the course structure and materials provided. The instructors are not only highly skilled but also very professional, patient, and passionate about helping every student grow.

What I really love is that the centre offers a wide variety of mediums to explore ‚Äì acrylic painting, watercolour, line drawing, and more ‚Äì all taught in a clear and encouraging manner. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience, this is a good professional course to deepen your skills and creativity.

The location is super convenient, right in the city centre, and the studio environment is clean, inspiring, and well-equipped. It‚Äôs the perfect place for working adults to relax, recharge, and pursue art seriously or as a hobby.

Highly recommend this studio to anyone looking for the best professional adult art learning experience!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102157567689544920222/reviews

Yuet Yean Teo,5,"This was my first attempt at creating batik, and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience! The workshop provided a perfect introduction for beginners like me. I came prepared with some design ideas of my own, but the teacher also offered a selection of images that were very helpful and inspiring.

The instructor Ms Jackie was patient, clear, and made the entire process enjoyable.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114145384622127760110/reviews
Von Von,5,My colleagues and I recently participated in a mural art activity with Visual Art Centre. It was an enjoyable and fulfilling experience! Everyone got involved and the end result was surprisingly impressive especially since we themed it around our company values. It was a great way to bond and do something different from the usual team activities. Both our instructors were helpful and friendly. Highly recommended for any group looking for a unique and meaningful team building experience. üëç,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114710392605841873513/reviews
