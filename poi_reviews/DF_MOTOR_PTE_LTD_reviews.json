Total price is 20 over bucks when it's honestly something very simple. Then they mentioned that my fork has some issues, it would cost 200 over dollars. My usual repair shop would be 120. Would nt recommend unless ur in urgent need.",

      "text": "This workshop charged me $30 for just a new metallic black rear bike plate but with incorrect / improper alignment and spacing..I requested for acrylic type but they said they didnt have availability for this type and they just simply proceeded to make the metallic plate without confirming with me.\nI found out that the other workshops charged $15 for the replacement yet they got it sorted and right. You can try Wing Yap Motor for good services if you are looking for bike rectification nearby.\n\nAlso, they did not fix my original headlight properly when it had a missing screw after changing back from the modded headlight which did not pass the inspection at VICOM sin Ming. probably because they asked me if i was going tO VICOM sin Ming so that they could change back to my modded headlight but I ended up going to VICOM kaki Bukit. they said they couldnâ€™t do anything about the missing screw.\n\nNot so Deaf-friendly. They seem to be lacking of knowledge about bike rectification for re-inspection.",
