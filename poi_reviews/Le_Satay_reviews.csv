lydia ng,1,"‼️WORST SERVICE EVER‼️
❌DO NOT RECOMMEND❌
lady talked as if talking to ants ( wearing mask some more ) , double checked price and still couldnt hear her , then guy beside her shouted the amount to me , wanted to double confirm again as was getting takeout and wasnt sure if they charge for plastic , and she raised her voice at me and rolled her eyes at me too
if u wanna talk SO softly in such a noisy environment , dont expect ur customers to be able to hear u
boyf went back to collect food and she spoke VERY rudely to him as if he owe her like bro ur customers dont owe u anyt .
