Zach Lee,5,"A very balanced yet tasty bowl of mee-pok. You can customise your order to suit your preferences, like no fish cake, or no meat ball, etc. I like it without ketchup or chilli, and a little bit of black vinegar. Brings out the original taste of the noodles and meat. Noodles are cooked well, springy and not too overdone, which is the way I like it. Highly recommended if you are looking for a place for breakfast along this road.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118234679045268022849/reviews
