Ed,4,"Tried this for dinner over a work weekday after seeing long queues previously.
Rice texture on the harder side but chicken and tofu was good. Service was great and can ask for more cucumber. Affordable meal at $4.50.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104056554846052732887/reviews
YEO WEN JUN ROY,5,"One of the better chicken rice stores in Singapore, often seen with long queues.

The rice is fragrant and has a nice bite to it. The steamed chicken is tender and juicy.

The chilli sauce is good too.

Definitely worth a try.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110368122443353685000/reviews
Another Big Bite,4,I always give up trying because thereâ€™s always a long queue on weekdays lunch time! I was glad I managed to try this fragrant chicken rice. The firm flavorful rice   & lovely chicken texture. Valued for the generous servings. Will perserver on the Q to reach my turn next time. Highly recommend!,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100408883882614888601/reviews
Ryan Tay,4,Ordered 3 packet of Roasted Chicken Rice for takeaway. Price was decently cheap at $3.50 per packet. Service was very fast and friendly. You might notice the chicken meat is pretty nice but the rice is a tad bland. But it is the Chicken Rice stall with the longest queue in this Hawker Centre and lots of old folks patronise them. Reason is because it is more healthy due to less fat in the Chicken Rice. Will recommend this stall to people with dietary restrictions.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100123425159940281976/reviews
