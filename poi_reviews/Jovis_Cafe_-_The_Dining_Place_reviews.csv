Bee Lee,5,I absolutely enjoyed the food and service in this hidden gem found in a landed housing estate. It was a trip worth making. Parking was easy and free. Warning ⚠️ the waiting time can be long so go with a good friend whom you want to spend lots of time with.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101923544766086944078/reviews
S S,5,"Really great family place.  Massive western size portions at very reasonable prices.  Service is ok, just you order at counter and get your own cutlery.  Water is 50 cents and get your own.  Definitely a family place with children toys and play area.  Curry chicken was my favorite, but all dishes were good. Serve wine and beer, but a bit pricey.  Will come back!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102477210376424622111/reviews
Chang Tuck Min,3,"First visit and perhaps my last.
I ordered the Mummy’s Curry Chicken, Spaghetti Carbonara, and a drink called Passionate. Overall, the food was average. The carbonara leaned heavily on the richer, more intense side of flavor, which might appeal to some but felt a little overwhelming for my taste.

The drink is priced at $8, which feels steep given the modest cup size. Even plain water comes with a $0.50 charge and it’s self-service.

Service was surprisingly slow, especially considering there was no crowd. The curry chicken, for instance, was pre-cooked and simply scooped from a pot, yet still took longer than expected to arrive.

Aesthetics and concept might draw you in, but for me, the experience didn’t quite justify a return.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103490464945795563481/reviews
Caroline,5,"This place is truly a hidden gem. It has a cosy, family-friendly atmosphere that is welcoming to families with young children.

We had the chicken curry and fish and chips, and I was impressed by the food. The rice that came with the curry chicken was fragrant, with a faint scent of what smells like pandan leaves. The curry serving was generous and came with potatoes and four chicken drumsticks that were fork tender. The fish and chips came in generous portions. The fish had a thin and crisp batter that complemented the fish very well.

Service was also prompt and we did not have to wait long to be seated and for our orders to be ready.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112102725102762608961/reviews
Ong Zhi Yuan,5,"Jovis is a cosy little café tucked deep within Faber Road. Parking is limited, so if you’re driving, you might need to park along the roadside.

Their menu offers classic comfort food like pork chops, fish and chips, pasta, and pizzas. Since we came for a team lunch, we ordered a variety of dishes to share.

The food arrived quickly—within 10 minutes—and everything was well-prepared. The pasta was cooked al dente, and all the proteins were perfectly done, making for a satisfying meal.

Beyond the food, the café itself is spacious, beautifully decorated, and has a warm, inviting atmosphere that adds to the dining experience.

Overall, it was a great meal in a lovely setting. I’d definitely come back. 8/10.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104417804420531473764/reviews
