Kia Guan Ng,5,Very good üëç service by the pump attendant. I saw this attendant helping a car owner pump her tyres while she took cover under the shade. I think his job is to help pump petrol and not pump air. Good job!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108972979221461010763/reviews

CCS,3,"Very, very, very good service from cashiers to forecourt attendants. In-house mart well stocked and great merchandising display. Restrooms are the best this part of Singapore.

Really, which station's cashiers answer the phone. Well, this one did. Not once but three times.

We needed to check the availability of something (almost life and death to me). And she saved my day.

Never pumped Caltex for decades but today, I filled up full tank. And will definitely come back again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
Jay S,5,"Loved their service,. All of them presented a very positive attitude and service",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103783445153793643024/reviews
Muhammad Junaidi,5,Great place to relax near the exit while waiting for job orders for delivery riders and private hire drivers. Very polite staff and helpful. I've been in an accident twice and went there to wash the blood off my injured hand but the staff will immediately tend to my wounds with first aid. Prices are the same standard everywhere. Just be careful of the u turn when coming here as it's near a bend and oncoming cars might not see you clearly.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105392481883369829660/reviews
