SH Y,5,"New Mala Xiang Guo taken over Dragonfly.
Tried 3 times and they are much better than the last one,  much cheaper too compared to the Dragonfly mala as their price increased. Noticed this store is cleaner too and best part is they prepared their food more meticulously, potatoes are sliced thinly and vegetables are washed and cleaned before they bundle up as compared to last tenant.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117900533784023420929/reviews
