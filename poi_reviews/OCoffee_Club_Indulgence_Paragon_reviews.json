Tried it first for a media tasting and was impressed by how attentive and friendly the staff were. Thought it might‚Äôve been a one-off thing, but when I went back a few days later for a second visit, the service was still top-notch! üëèüèº\n\nFood-wise, the Grilled Chicken with White Wine Cream Sauce was an absolute standout‚Äîrich, creamy, and so satisfying! üçΩÔ∏è And of course, the Belgian Waffle with Ice Cream was the perfect sweet treat, especially in Singapore‚Äôs weather. ‚òÄÔ∏èüç¶\n\nThe space is small but cozy, making it a nice spot to unwind. If you‚Äôre in the Orchard area and looking for a spot to chill with good food, desserts, and even some wine, I‚Äôd definitely recommend checking it out! ü•Ç‚ú®",

      "text": "This is my first time going to Coffee Club cause a few influencers recommended it ... and it won't be my last. I'm not one to spend a lot of money on food, so when I saw the price  tag for the meal I wanted, I wasn't so sure I wanted to order. But then I saw other people's orders and thought maybe it would be worth it. And it was.  We order the a few tea and coffee. The flavours were great and the portion size was respectable. Especially only one staff run the operation and he seems really good at one man show. He is very knowledgeable we enjoy about him.So we choose outdoor area and we are very happy cause Customer service was outstanding. Peter makes reasonable waiting time for food but we enjoy food and drinks. Especially what we love his decent service & his food and drink preparation is beyond perfect. The place was a bit crowded for my liking, but , so probably the same for most places along in Mall. After all we spend more than a few hours because of him.",
