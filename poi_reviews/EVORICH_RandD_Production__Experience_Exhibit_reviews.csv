Edward Alias,5,"Engaging Evorich was 1 of the best renovation decision we made. We decided to get the vinyl package from them separately. From day 1, Owen engaged with us and explained everything well. Followed up what needs to be done prior to installation. Despite our changes here and there Owen was very patient and was accommodating to our request. When the vinyls were installed, at first glance we fall in love with our whole house flooring and we were so happy.
Thank you Owen and Evorich.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107503502381169959111/reviews

LYNN WONG,5,"Grateful to Evorich for the trustworthiness, reliability and the super customer service. I would like to give special commendation to Louis for his efficiency and professionalism despite the long delay at my end. In a short notice, he managed to make arrangements to set up my TV console beautifully. Everyone at home was very pleased and even considering buying a bigger TV. I would highly recommend Evorich to be used in your home renovation. It is worth it!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112549794458902858221/reviews
