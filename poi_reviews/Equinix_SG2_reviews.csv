Az,3,"I personally don't like this DC because of multiple reason.

Miles away from City
❌ 24*7 Restaurant
❌ Nearby supermarket
❌ Shopping Malls
Hard to get private taxi

Alky Alky,4,"Pretty secure facility that only allows authorised access with prior arrangements only. Have a resting area towards the right, after passing thru the 1st security area. You could simply wait there if you're waiting for your deliveries to arrive.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100209455395129518760/reviews
