There is plenty of food to eat we had Indian food every day is a 1-2 min walk which is open 24/7. The train is about 10-15 min walk but that train will take you straight to the airport. Same train will take you to many attractions since there may not be any popular attractions near the hotel most of them you would need to take a train to get there. The train you can use your Credit Card and it works so you buy a ticket every time.",

The rooms are quite old but spacious, although cleanliness could be improved. If you prefer a more modern and cleaner room, Hotel 81 Gold, located just opposite, might be a better choice. The location is convenient, with a nearby bus stop providing easy access to the city center.",

At the front desk, they couldn't find my reservation details or booking number although I showed my booking screen and booking number, so I was forced to pay again at the front. They assured me that once my Expedia reservation was found, the payment made at the hotel would be refunded. Later, they did find my reservation, but the hotel never refunded the amount I had paid at the front, resulting in a double charge. The hotel staff showed no sincerity, didn't even bother to respond, and behaved unprofessionally. This hotel is completely untrustworthy, and I strongly recommend booking another hotel instead. I will never stay here again. I would like to share my worst experience all over the world",
