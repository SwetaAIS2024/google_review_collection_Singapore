      "text": "Hock Tai Noodle Stall is located in 628 Ang Mo Kio Food Centre stall #01-90.\n\nThe wanton noodles is a little pricey at $5.00 but the price is very clearly stated so everything is fair game if you do decide to buy it.\n\nDisclaimer aside, the wanton noodles are actually very delicious. The noodles were cooked al dente, just the right firmness. The char siew was soft unlike some places which can be hard because the meat is too lean. The soup given is not just peppery water as I think they put some soy sauce in it. The meat filling of the wanton was firm and tasty as well. The sauce also coats the noodles really well and brings to a dish a savoury and spicy flavour.\n\nOverall a very decent plate of wanton noodles.",

      "text": "A taste of old-school wanton noodle; brought me back to my school’s canteen. QQ noodle, a dash of sweet black sauce, balanced chilli, tender char siu and crunchy vegetables made me yearn for more. Soup for wanton could improve though; tasted mostly of pepper, and I think, “ki kak chai” (preserved vegetable). $5. One size, and one size only. Unless you want to wrestle with the tattooed chef for more noodles. Enjoy!",

      "text": "Super delish wanton mee- The black sauce and chilli coats the noodles beautifully. I especially liked that the noodles were very springy and they used the thin version. Charsiew was also soft and moist, not like the usual dry and hard type. Wanton was nothing to shout about, just decently sized.\n\nSlightly more expensive at $4.50 vs the usual fare at the hawker so maybe that’s why it’s not as popular.",

      "text": "Nice noodles but portions are rather small, so considering the price, it's not great value.\n\nI ordered a chicken feet noodles for $5.50. It tasted good. The noodles were QQ and light. The chicken feet were tender and it was easy to tear off the skin. But there were only two chicken feet for this price. The noodle portion was quite small too. In contrast, the chicken feet noodles from the BBQ Charcoal Wantan Mee stall in AMK Central Food Centre offers three chicken feet and it is priced at $4.50.\n\nStill, the food tasted good here. So am rating the stall 4 stars.",

      "text": "My favourite wanton mee since i was a child. It's been almost 30 years. This is the taste I can never find anywhere else.\n\nI also get that they are always the 1st to raise their prices in the whole market. That's just how they have been over all these years. Just to to chill & work, not have too many customers yet still can finish selling and end work at 2pm.\n\nThough i do eat chilli as an adult now, i still love their black sauce and tomato sauce combi. I also felt the chilli version to be quite normal. But the tomato sauce combi is love. Noodles are so al dente too.\n\nFyi, The new wanton mee stall in the middle row is just mehh. It's a soon soon franchise which i totally dislike.",
