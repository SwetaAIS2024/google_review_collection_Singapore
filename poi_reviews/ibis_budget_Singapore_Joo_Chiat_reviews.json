      "text": "For me, the check-in experience at this hotel was good. The location is convenient—close to Geylang and shops like 7-Eleven. However, if you're driving, please note that on-site parking is very limited.\n\nI would like to suggest that the front desk staff be more friendly and approachable when dealing with guests. When I checked in, two male staff members appeared very serious and didn’t smile. Interestingly, I noticed they were much friendlier to a foreign guest. As a fellow Malaysian speaking the same language, I felt a bit confused and disappointed. All guests, regardless of background, should be treated equally and warmly.",

Buses to town and Sentosa near by.\nHalfway between the airport and the city.\nRoom was clean, tidy and well serviced.\nWe will book again, but get a room with a window as it is too easy to sleep late otherwise :)",

Very calm and quiet area, no outside noise from our room.\n\nHad someone on the desk to check us in even though we arrived really late/were delayed until 4AM\n\nRooms were comfortable, nice firm mattress and soft sheets, hot water and the best water pressure (may have been because we showered at 4am). Drinking water tap, TV with a few channels, very dark when curtains closed so great for sleeping. (Sorry bed pictured is not made as we went straight to sleep on arrival)",

Room service was efficent as well. We were also able to get 3 room keys which I know doesn’t always happen. I think the hotel is a great place to stay at for a cheaper room and if you’re only here for a couple days.",
