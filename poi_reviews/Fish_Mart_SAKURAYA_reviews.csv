Pauline Ng,5,"The food here is always fresh & good quality.
Had the Mother’s Day sashimi set. Enjoyed it.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101874735818986806547/reviews
Ken Tan,4,"First time dining here tried a few dishes.  Grilled salmon overcooked tasted dry and tough.   Sake Chazuke tasted light and good.  Agedeshi Nashu delicious soy sauce not too strong with grilled eggplant at right texture.  Gindara Teriyaki grilled well and tasted delicious at right texture.
Traditional deco indoor and generally comfortable / spacious dining environment though maybe noisy.  Minor gripe about staff sweeping floor right next to my table when dining…",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100121205735734303463/reviews
Yen Trinh,5,"Our family goes to Fish Mart Sakuraya at least once a month. What a lovely, family friendly place for fresh sashimi (especially fresh uni) and sushi. I especially appreciate how vegetarian friendly the place is for my husband (he always has at least 4-5 options here between the soba, tofu, potatoes and salads). Service is prompt and non fussy. Highly recommend!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106124579273314676288/reviews
AC Chan,5,"These maki sushi rolls is made on the spot and is surely a must try. Each eight-piece maki comes with chunks of crispy prawn/deep-fried soft shell crab/grilled eel with omelette, cucumber and sushi rice. Our favourite of the lot is the the ebi fry maki topped with a savoury mixture of sesame seeds, crushed bonito flakes which added a different flavour and texture.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
Phëbè Łáï Ćhî Hűèñ,5,"A simple homely Japanese restaurant that has a great variety of fresh sashimis to choose from. Their cooked foods are not a disappointment either and am so happy to see they have updated their menu to have more selection of dishes. They will occasionally surprise you with a seasonal menu to deliver foods that are in season with Japan, offering you a unique experience that you don't often find in other restaurants. I have been visiting this restaurant for years and I am never let down every time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109538274855916053716/reviews
