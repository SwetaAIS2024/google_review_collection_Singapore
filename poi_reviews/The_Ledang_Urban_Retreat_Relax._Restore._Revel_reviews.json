We were initially suspicious of the location as the place looks abandoned. However, it turned out to be a great experience. The retreat centre itself was well maintained. I like that there‚Äôs shower available. The massage was great, my husband and I both loved our masseurs, mine was Carla and his was Dan. Will definitely visit again in the coming weeks or so!",

It's not even a club anymore, not a place to enjoy for nearby residents and not really an event place either.\n\nFor now avoid it at all cost and hopefully this will be taken over by some new more capable tenants in the next period of time for us to enjoy again the great place it once was.",
