The guys here put their best foot forward to ensure that my car was properly washed and vacuumed and tyres shined. At RM20, it's really a job well done! It's a nice find and I hope that their business will continue for a long time and expand.",

      "text": "The marketing of this shop seems good so I paid visit after setting appointment. Went there for the worker to say I cant do normal wash and I must add on wax. I said no as my car is already coated with wax. Then they proceed to say the carwash centre just open and I need to wait. I said I set appt at 11am and now its already 11.20am. Then the worker asked to check my whatsapp to verify the appt time then only proceed to ask one worker to start washing my car while these 2 workers have their early lunch and smoking right beside the waiting area. The car is NOT clean. They did terrible job in terms of hospitality and service. Money wasted. Maybe they are only nice to people taking their expensive package. Will never come back again. And I do not recommend this shop. Never been so disappointed. But the 2 women taking care of counter are friendly.",
