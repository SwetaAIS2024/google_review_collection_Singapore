The soup was definitely steaming hot which is great at least. The chicken rice itself isn‚Äôt notable in that it‚Äôs just your basic chicken rice dish. I do like how cheap the prices are since it was only $4 for the dish, helps that the environment is also clean and tidy. Overall, good chicken rice but not much to note.",

Saw that the roasted meat stall has a queue so i ordered from roasted dang gui duck (their signature) and roasted pork. Hubby ordered char siew rice. They were all tasty, especially the duck. Meat tender and moist with the sauce, pork skin crispy and crunchy. Rice is fragrant\n\nWent back there again yesterday evening to try the roasted chicken, not disappointed as well. Value for money (2 meats combo cost less than $5, probably slightly more for combo with duck which is understandable), they are not stingy with the portion. Highly recommended!",

Don‚Äôt really taste anything difference when eating tho.\n\nThe crisp of the duck skin is quite uneven though, some parts overly crispy and some under but meat wise is really soft and fatty. Charsiew and roast pork is good too",
