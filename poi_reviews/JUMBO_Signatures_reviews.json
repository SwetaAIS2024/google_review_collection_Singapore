We had a reservation for 6 seated in a VIP room. It is our first time visiting, and we are not familiar with the menu. Staffs are super friendly and patient with us. Made couple recommendations for the a la carte menu. Staffs are very attentive, constantly offering water and switching plates. We enjoy all the food and services during the visit. Thank you for having us!",

      "text": "I recently dined at Jumbo Signature Marina Bay Sands, and it was an unforgettable experience! From the moment we arrived, the ambiance was stunning‚Äîelegant decor with a breathtaking view of the Marina Bay skyline.\n\nThe service was impeccable; our server was attentive and knowledgeable, recommending the perfect dishes to try. We started with the famous chili crab, which was absolutely divine‚Äîsweet, spicy, and bursting with flavor. The presentation was equally impressive, making it almost too beautiful to eat!\n\nFor our main course, we enjoyed the steamed fish and the black pepper crab, both cooked to perfection. Each bite was a delight, showcasing the restaurant's commitment to quality and authenticity.\n\nTo top off the meal, we indulged in their signature desserts, which were the perfect sweet ending to a fantastic dining experience.\n\nOverall, Jumbo Signature Marina Bay Sands offers a perfect combination of exquisite cuisine, top-notch service, and a stunning setting. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to indulge in a memorable meal. I can't wait to return!",

The food was surprisingly delicious 10/10 compare to other Jumbo outlets i have been to. Even though the price is on the steeper side and limited choices, overall it was very worth it!

We did the tasting menu that had everything plated per person...and items like the lobster and crab were already removed from the shell and easy to eat. Everything was great and got a good mix of food in the menu. Service was very attentive. Everything was very nice...would love to eat here again.",
