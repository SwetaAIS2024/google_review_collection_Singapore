Steak and pasta are still great but due to the cold air from the air conditioner, the food get cold fast, esp in a cold raining day. Probably can use a air diffuser to disperse the wind flow or increase the temperature around the dining area.",

The food is consistently good – can’t say this enough! I’ve tried the chicken chop, ribeye steak, foie gras, and mushroom soup… all super tasty and well-prepared. You can tell they put in the effort with every dish.\n\nThe lava cake with ice cream – my favourite. And the service? Always friendly, prompt, and they never make you feel rushed. It’s such a gem of a place – comfy vibes, solid food, great service. Definitely deserves five stars!",
