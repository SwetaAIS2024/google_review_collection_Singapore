Perri Young,5,"Highly recommend this hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful, check-in was smooth and efficient despite being busy with a large group when I arrived. Room was spacious, bed and pillows super comfortable. Will definitely stay again. Enjoyed the golf course views from my window.
Close to Changi airport is a bonus.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105326987886524023375/reviews

Lorraine McGowan,1,"Booked as a stop over what a disaster. Hotel shuttle bus failed to pick us up as it does not run after 6.45. We got through at 6.47 it left without us.
Room smelt of fumes. Room Keys were not programmed correctly so got stuck on floor one no help from staff.  Just kept telling me to go to floor 2 to get it reprogrammed but was not able as key did not work??? Eventually found a cleaner who helped me get to reception. My advice hotel looks nice but don't book it most unhelpful place in Singapore.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113412921669564510451/reviews
Yvonne Yeo,5,"Very beautiful place, nestled in nature. Tranquil and serene... Great place to unwind and relax. Morning and night gives different feels. Love the ambience.
We went swimming late evening/night, the Lifeguard on duty was very hardworking and diligent, doing his rounds and using a torchlight to check on the surroundings of the pool. Chatted with him for a bit. :)

One thing to improve on, the fish spa. Even though it was free to use, I didn't dare to use it as it looked poorly maintained and wasn't inviting.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111216792339069329571/reviews
Louis Koh,4,"Excellent hotel with location located at the east side of si gapore extremely clean & comfortable . Checking in took almost half an hour, which i think they should improve the speed. Requested for higher floor but give lower floor, bit disappointment. The room is nice with full equip of towel, shampoo and toiletries. Pool is also great for kids. They enjoyed the most. For people who want quiet and rest..this is a good place.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102223180660231622331/reviews
