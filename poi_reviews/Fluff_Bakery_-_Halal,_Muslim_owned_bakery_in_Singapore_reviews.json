Lets dive in!\n\nFood:\nDessert and cakes....nothing can go wrong unless bakers cant make it.\n\nService:\nStaff was always smiling, so yeah, keep it up ya!\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe place is not big but sufficient for customers. There is actually a visible baking area but it may actually be for class setting..\n\nIn a nutshell, this would be one place we will recommend if you are near Sultan Mosque. It will be a waste if you are near but skipped this place..\n\nSo yeah, come on down!!",

Luckily managed to reach home without any issues with my 2 cakes and 1 cupcake.\nStandard for cakes still there - I last ate their cakes and cookies 2-3 yrs ago.\nCupcake wise, I think the flavour is a bit mild even though the cupcake itself is sufficiently moist.",

However the taste of the cake was delicious and for that I gives 4 stars.. I hope Fluff Bakery can make some improvement the delivery service in future.",

Base cake was moist!\nVery good! Location itself maybe not as convenient as it's not too near MRT station, but it's quite worth the travel.",
