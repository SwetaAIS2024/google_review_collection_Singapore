Steven Chow,4,"Newly opened here. Not all stalls are occupied yet. There's Tze Char, Vegetarian, Wonton noodles, Carrot cake/fried rice and economic rice stalls here. Will be good to see Malay, Indian options added. Will get a bit crowded during lunch but still able to get tables. Once there are more tenants will get even more crowded.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107985246054805441513/reviews

猪脚面 pork trotter noodles (or rice) well cooked, soft and flavoursome n usually will pack some home also
