mark Lim,4,It’s a hawker Center. Don’t expect super clean tables and NO birds. Nice breakfast place especially for Malay food stalls. Very obvious which ones are the popular ones. A few non halal food stalls. A very short ride (5mins) to ECP via Bedok underpass which u will end up near OBS campus.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116731841150118446599/reviews

Normawati Selamat,4,"Waited for more than 30 min for the satay. Satay meat - beef & mutton - were very tasty. The satay gravy was thick & yummy with crunchy peanuts. 👍🏼 However, satay was not well grilled as there parts burnt & others uncooked. 👎🏼 Hokkien Mee was good! 👍🏼 We dabao-ed Roti John & found it to be miserably thin. 👎🏼",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102238462280999361288/reviews
