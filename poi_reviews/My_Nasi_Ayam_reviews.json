If not probably gotta get a second helping.\n\n——\n\nReally love the taste of their chicken rice, even though it’s expensive and the portions are small.\n\nUsed to see long snaking queues before Covid, but not so anymore. Still good though, just more expensive.",

The chilli paired well with the chicken, and the soup was tasty too.\n\nService was also polite and efficient. I would say that the chicken rice here falls into the top 5 chicken rice that I have tried island wide.",
