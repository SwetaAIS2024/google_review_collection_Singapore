Carol Foo,5,"Although I have been playing tennis for many years, Jordy is able to improve my technique to help with my game. Our whole family takes lessons with him and we enjoy playing matches with him at the tail end of each session. When I first started lessons with Jordy, I did inform him that we don't like ball feeding from the basket the whole lesson and prefer more live play. He has been able to tailor the lessons to our needs. He is also easy going and fun to play with.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113245978437503962516/reviews
