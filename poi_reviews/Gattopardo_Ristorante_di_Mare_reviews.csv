Dwk Y,5,"Came here on a Friday afternoon and had the ‚ÄúSicilian Journey‚Äù 5 course taster menu and was thoroughly impressed. I try not to give too many 5 star reviews but my lunch was faultless. Service was very attentive and ambience was great.

Regarding the food, the highlight for me from the menu in my opinion was the prawn and truffle ravioli, which was creamy without being overpoweringly rich (I could have drunk the sauce like a soup it was so tasty). Also the dessert was an  amazing finish to the meal, the tart having a perfect texture to it providing just the right amount of bite and complementing the other textures on the plate including the beautifully constructed mini Italian meringues which I loved. Also the red berry sauce giving a perfect offset to the nuttiness of the pistachio cream.

Surprised that this place was not so busy given the quality of the food and without naming any names the offering here is far superior than other comparable restaurants in the area. Will for sure come back again with another group and this time try the wine pairing.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111465757132011813548/reviews
Sook Yin Au,4,"The Mister brought me here for my birthday treat. Very friendly service team. Food was tasty. I especially enjoyed the scallop carpaccio and pumpkin flan. Swapped the tagliatelle for an uni pasta for an additional 18$. I preferred the la Norma (husband had that instead; but he preferred the uni!) Found the uni pasta a little too heavy and rich. Wagyu short ribs was melt-in-your-mouth perfect. Worth coming for special occasions. üòä

I wish they had more reasonable prices for their wine. The bottle we had, we found online for a third of the price. üòì will avoid ordering alcohol next time!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105521640661640430293/reviews
Xialing Chen,5,"Every seafood dish was Umami, and the service was warm. Have been to Italy twice, I would say this restaurant is authentic in terms my own understanding on ‚ÄòItalian cuisine‚Äô. Not Sicilian, though, cause I have never been there before.
The pistachio tart was so ‚Äòpistachio‚Äô, love it.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115704653759406985203/reviews
Bernie Chin,5,"My first visit to the one & only Sicilian restaurant in Singapore. Came over for Restaurant week! And of course I had an amazing dining experience. The crew in Gattopardo was lovely and friendly. Loved every course that I had. They were tasty! The wine was lovely as well. They have a great selection of Sicilian wines. Had such a wonderful time dining, I would definitely come back to try different set menu‚Äôs next time.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109214621085246958273/reviews
justin goh,4,"Excellent deal when they are offering their one-for-one specials, and probably still worth it without. Fish and shellfish cookery was as good as it gets. Would give it 5 stars if the wine prices were a little less steep.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102365469976440387172/reviews
