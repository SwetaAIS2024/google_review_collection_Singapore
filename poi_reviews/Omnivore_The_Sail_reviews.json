      "text": "My weekly staple (and totally underrated). I go to Omnivore 3x a week, and honestly, I still look forward to every bowl and think it‚Äôs the best salad protein bowl in üá∏üá¨. The low ratings really don‚Äôt reflect the quality and consistency of this place - it deserves way more love.\n\nFor $12.90, you get a super fresh, generous salad bowl. My go-tos are the tuna tartare and the duck as protein - both are excellent. Their pickled tomatoes are another standout - bright, tangy, and they make everything else pop.\n\nThe ingredients and balance of flavour make it one of the most solid options for clean eating. Highly recommend!",

Unfortunately they don't have any contact email, website or social for me to feedback and this is the only platform.",

For a basic bowl (cheapest price point), the amount of proteins given here are in abundance as I had tofu, chickpeas, egg whites together with sweet potatoes, tomatoes and cranberries with honey mustard sauce. Value for money compared to other healthy bowl places that give more carbs than proteins and yet charge more.",
