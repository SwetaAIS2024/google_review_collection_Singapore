Called clinic and customer center few times, no one picked up.\n1020am, received a call from customer center and said will check with Marine Parade clinic.\nAfterwords, received a message from customer center at 10:24am said wait for another 10min. At this point, no apology from the clinic nor their customer service.\n\nSubsequently received a call again from customer service said go to the clinic and press the door bell. Also told me that they were there since 10am which is untruth.\n\nTheir customer service lack of sincerity and no unrepentant to be late. Unfortunately I did not receive their service so I can‚Äôt judge their treatment skills, but if you‚Äôre a on time person, don‚Äôt waste your time here.",

Doctor treatment plan is very thorough and holistic and not at all pushing for high value procedures but to put my skin desired outcome 1st. Super happy with the results and i am now a frequent customer",
