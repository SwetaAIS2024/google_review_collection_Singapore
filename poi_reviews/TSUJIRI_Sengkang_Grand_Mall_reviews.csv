Jechtto,3,"Personally I'm not big on Matcha desserts, hence do consider coming here if you are. I was dragged along by my partner who loves green tea by the way. She claimed the matcha pudding with its Creme Brulee like topping was god tier, to me it's ok wouldn't come all the way to SK Grand just to have it though. Personally I had a refreshing sorbet to cleanse my palate, which was pretty average.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106407471320614893952/reviews
reiko peng,3,"Poor and slow service for average tasting Matcha. Most matcha places have the final price including GST on the menu however, this place does not. Instead of making guests surprised with the final price, why not just say the price as it is on the menu? Seriously misleading. Expect rlly slow service, 20min for a cup of matcha. I understand that it is during peak hours, however, other matcha places have been able to keep up with the pace of orders",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110071525196270856182/reviews
