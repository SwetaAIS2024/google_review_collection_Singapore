I love their oats and muesli, they have for kids and adults, we buy dried fruits and nuts, pasta, and their flour is excellent for baking (i make my own sourdough bread with their rye and wholewheat flour).",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103995770172376468154/reviews

Marion Müller,5,"Coming from Switzerland, I missed Bio organic products in Singapore until I found Bio Deutschland. I love their Dinkelpuffs, Decaf Coffee and think rice cakes.
