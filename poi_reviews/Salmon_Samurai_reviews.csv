Eve W,1,"Behold the salmon sashimi don petite size: $14.90 for 3 slices of salmon. The avocado is actually 1 slice but with added cuts to look like itâ€™s 3 slices.

At double digit prices, this should not be the amount of fish and avocado provided.

Food was subpar as well. Salmon was average, about same quality as donki. Broccoli is unseasoned and tasteless. Seaweed for the edamame had a fishiness to it that wasnâ€™t very pleasant.

Pass by this place every day for work and decided to try it today. Once is enough. There are plenty of lunch options nearby with better food for better value.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101446499316168538102/reviews
