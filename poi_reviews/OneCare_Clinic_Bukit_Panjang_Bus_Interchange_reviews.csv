Thae Thae,1,"One of the doctor "" Anshuman Jha"" always rude to the patients. Whenever we visited to the clinic,he never asked the patients and he said "" You want MC today , right?"" Then never checked to the patients. We experienced that not only one time, everytime we visited that we experienced it. Is it a doctor's  manner? All of the staff and other doctors are okay. He is the only one the worst.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117443834975014338438/reviews

Angel sai,1,"Staffs are very disrespectful towards patients and rude responses while taking to patients. I having breathing difficulties today and get half day from work and came to see doctor but staff Nur Siti are don’t even care about what I’m saying and she took my temperature and informed me to come back @ 2pm. But I reached clinic @ 12.35pm before closing registration. I’m a nurse too but I prioritise patients due provide quality services. While I’m enquire with your counter staff Nur Siti, and she replied me that , ‘ I don’t want to waste my time to argue with you’  this is how they treat patients. I ask her for her name to give feedback but she refuses to give me her name. I get her name from another staff. I keep repeating about breathing issues then only she went to ask doctor. Doctor services seriously don’t have any quality of handling pt cause if patients refuse nebuliser instead of puff to control my asthma but he makes me wait till 1310 hrs but no one attends. Since I’m in same industry I’m very surprised that how come they are so irresponsible and ignorant. Really disappointed with the service.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106391227510208653152/reviews
K J,1,"I visited Dr. Anshuman Jha at the clinic today, where he prescribed medication and referred me to the hospital.

Upon arrival at the hospital, the doctor there advised me not to take most of the prescribed medications, as the antibiotics’ purpose was unclear. The hospital doctor noted that the clinic doctor had not conducted a proper examination of my abdominal pain and other symptoms which is true.

Out of the four medications prescribed by the clinic, the hospital doctor recommended taking only one.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108652716831607872977/reviews
Nurul Huda,5,"Maybe it depends on the staff or doctor for the day. But everyone today was extremely patient  helpful and friendly. And thats very hard to come by cos everyone is usually so stressed especially front liners. I didnt note the doctors name but she was so good. We were on the same page on everything and she explained in detail which is again, very rare these days w doctors. Thanks guys, keep it up.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116090130371820592134/reviews
