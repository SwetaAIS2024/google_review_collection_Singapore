      "text": "This is the place you get your MBS physical membership card. This is also where you dispute missing transactions being added to your membership account. There are also counters for you to exchange for parking redemptions (but do it on your app, it's faster and cheaper).\n\nThe customer service folks are very nice and patient. Very helpful as well, as they helped us with our MBS Membership concerns really quickly.\n\nIt's located near to the Sands Theatre, Marquee side of the building. Closer to the Helix Bridge or the Art Science Museum. Right outside Sephora and Oakley, if you're still in need of a bearing.",

Staff Ronnie was quick with processing my upgrade, and also informed me of the various perks I will be entitled to, and he was also patient to ask me if I have any further questions.\n\nAlso, shout out to the other staff (gentlemen) standing near the queue for helping me check I had everything I needed before I got to the counter for my upgrade.",

Definitely doesn't look like professional work going on the computer. Another staff, Alan was hostile towards our requirements and enquiry, merely hoping we leave the counter soon. Terrible experience. Worst customer service in Singapore.",
