Emilie Yeo,4,"Great use for an old monorail station. We used this trail to join up to Imbiah trail.
Not crowded and it costs nothing!
This part is flat and good for kids and elderly folk, there are no stairs to navigate. Needs a little upkeep to make it sparkle again.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116887973096497242776/reviews
