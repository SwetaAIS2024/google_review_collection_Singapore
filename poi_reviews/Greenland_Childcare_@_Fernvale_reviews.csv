Lee Liang Cheng,5,"Greenland childcare is a premier childcare that provides pleasant learning experience for children and certainly a preschool that prepares the children well for primary school. The staff were nurturing, understanding and relatively accommodating to parent's request. My son recently graduated while my daughter is still attending class in Greenland. I am always amazed with Greenland's pedagogy as my children are able to recite and speak languages that I find it difficult to teach them.

On the team of teachers, the childcare principal, Ms Puva and her team definitely stood out for developing nurturing approach for the children in Greenland childcare. Their passion for early childhood education was evident in the way each teachers interacted with each child, meeting their individual needs with patience and kindness. There are always different engaging activities planned for the children, from hands-on learning experiences to imaginative play sessions and outdoor learning journey as well.

The learning environment at Greenland was nothing short of impressive. The classrooms were bright and inviting, filled with colorful educational materials and age-appropriate toys that sparked children's curiosity and creativity. The curriculum was well-rounded, encompassing a variety of activities that catered to children's social, emotional, cognitive, and physical development.

What stood out to me the most was the sense of community and collaboration fostered within the childcare center. Children were encouraged to work together, share ideas, and respect one another's differences. The teachers also worked seamlessly as a team, ensuring that each child received personalized care and attention throughout the day.

As a parent, I can confidently say that Greenland provides an exceptional learning environment for young children. The dedicated childcare principal and her team go above and beyond to create a nurturing and enriching space where children can learn, grow, and thrive. I would highly recommend this childcare center to any parent looking for high-quality care and education for their little ones.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103893324047095172243/reviews
