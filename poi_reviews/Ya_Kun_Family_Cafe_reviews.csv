Weijia Ho,3,"Ordered via grabfood.
The crackers from nasi lemak set was soft and unfresh.
What if children whom are unaware of the differences ate it and had a tummy upset?

Ya Kun, Jurong point.

Alicia Hock,3,"Just discovered that I can buy a cup of plain hot water for 80 cents. If I buy a drink like coffee or tea, I get a small cup of hot water for free! So if there is two of us, we only need to buy one drink. Soft boiled eggs are very consistent, not too runny.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103670743926486862407/reviews
Belle Oh,2,"Had been patronising them since day 1 they opened at JP. Service is not consistent at this branch, depending on who the cashier was, who the drink maker was on that day. Today, the cashier seemed lost and needed to keep on repeating my order as if she was not listening and unsure. The service overall was on most occasions NOT friendly, no smiles but only black faces. I ever encountered very lousy customer service from the kopi auntie who assumed the drink I ordered, added more hot water into my kopi C when I requested for more evaporated milk due to the bitterness. She even showed bad attitude and argued with me when I asked for more milk instead of water. That staff needed training very badly! Today, the ikan bilis and crackers served in the nasi lemak were chewy and not crispy. The staff should maintain their freshness in airtight containers. Prawn thick bee hoon was kinda tasteless though the prawns were pretty fresh. The kaya toast were not well toasted, looked unappetising and not crispy too. Can the HQ take a good look and find out what is going on with your HQ branch's standards???",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111480789657010313446/reviews
Eric Tan,1,"Ordered steam bread and kaya toast, then came bck in ~15 mins to look for my order, the cashier staff told me that because i came late then asked me to wait, meaning they gave my order to other customers just because i missed my order number? Is it reali work that way? They also never check for order and just gave me my incomplete order after i waited, i told them my order is nt complete then one of the aunty sounds very unfriendly like i did sth wrong? Such unprofessional service and unsystematic management",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110640892880816268217/reviews
