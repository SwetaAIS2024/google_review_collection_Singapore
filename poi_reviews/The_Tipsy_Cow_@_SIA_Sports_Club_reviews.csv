ÈòøÂÆù,3,"Thanks to relatives‚Äô invitation, I got to visit this place for some food & wine on a Sunday night.

The place was not crowded, even though it was a public holiday‚Ä¶.

The pizzas are big and rich in ingredients!  If not for diet plan I could have taken even more :-)))

Service staff are fast and efficient in terms of service.  Friendly & easy to chat with too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews

Rennie Lee,4,"A nice quiet place at SIA sports club. Btw, you can only dine in if someone from the group is a SIA sports club member. Spacious restaurant with plane windows along the walls, cute concept. Food is not bad, recommend the pizza which tastes quite like Italian thin crust oven baked type. Pasta was good too but aglio was too spicy that day.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104896149882118051128/reviews
