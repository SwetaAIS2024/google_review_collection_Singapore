Aby Chelsea,2,"Dr J is knowledgeable but I don’t advise to go again. I was diagnosed with so many unnecessary illnesses. I would trust him but the symptoms I’m explaining to him and the symptoms that he wants to hear are different. I was not done a thorough assessment and he ”diagnosed“ just by listening to the selective symptoms. No scans were done to finalise. After “diagnosing” my “illness” verbally, Dr J never gave a referral letter for me to consult the specialist or whatnot. Dr J is knowledgeable, yes. But learning by books without learning the lifestyle of the patient before diagnosis is a flat NO for me. My husband went to the same clinic and he was diagnosed with so many other illnesses that he never heard of. It’s good to diagnose, but no referral letter was given to consult specialist. We were only told to come back to clinic. which doesn’t make sense cuz it’s always advisable to refer to the specialist if there’s a diagnosis.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107499871587729837833/reviews
Richard T,5,"Dr Jee is patient and his confidence helps assure us of the treatments. He is swift and his skills are top notch. I came in for my daughters stomach virus and also to consult about removal of a lump on my back. He proceeded to remove my lump on the spot and within an hour, I was ready to go home. The stitching was excellent, very nicely done. Impressed!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113945163605339399664/reviews
