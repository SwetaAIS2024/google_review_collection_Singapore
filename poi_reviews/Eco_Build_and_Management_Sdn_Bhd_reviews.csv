henry wong,5,"With the recent completion of works at Leisure Farm, we would like to thank the whole team from Eco Build for their hard work and diligent in carrying out this challenging project that was finished on time, on budget and looks fantastic!

We have been very impressed with the positive attitude from Eco Build, which has resulted in a very good working relationship with the consultant team and meets the client's expectations. Throughout the project, Eco Build performed in a very professional manner and were very proactive in helping to resolve all site based issues which arose. In dealing with changes, the site and management team behaved in an exemplary manner at all times.

We look forward to working with Ecobuild on future projects.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106480464538537678954/reviews
