Chia Yn,1,"Very expensive clinic,  I went there just for cough and sore throat was charged close to $90. I will avoid this clinic in the future.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112534086480558677463/reviews
Cyan Neo,1,"Dr Mahtani is very good and experienced. However the visits are always marred by the poor attitude of the receptionists and the counter staff dispensing the medicine. The 2 staff (a middle-aged Malay lady and a younger female Indian dispensing medicine), were not helpful and gave wrong advice on the medication. After having to clarify again, they got impatient. Very unprofessional.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111934393733989868036/reviews
L Chua,1,"The lady (cashier & person dispensing the medicine) was rude and had no respect for patients. As I had a bad cough, I waited outside the clinic. But the lady did not bother to notify me when my medicine was ready. She processed several other people (people who consulted the doctor after me) and just left me waiting outside. When I finally got tired of waiting (about 30 minutes), I went in and all she could say was she was going to call me.

If one has no passion for customer service, then he/she should look for a non customer fronting job. Otherwise, change your attitude towards your customers (patients).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113577837134858737822/reviews
Cheryl Lee,5,"Seen Dr Suresh Mahtani, basically he is a very passionate and patient doctor, not those where they just consult and say bye bye, he tries to solve your health problems properly in the best manner, a live saver but waiting time for him is long, most importantly the fees are very reasonable!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107813037784059923389/reviews
Joanne Chu,1,"dr ng is so rude to anyone remotely young, overcharged and gives unnecessary medicine to up price. doctor very rude and offers odd unsolicited advice like ‘stop cracking your knuckles its bad’. $67 for a sore throat and refuses to give mc, flaunting that he is upright and strict and giving out mc. would not recommend unless its the other doctor, there is another clinic across the road. save your time and money",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100553561749030378164/reviews
