Chong How,5,"Had a really great experience here on 6 Apr 2025 at 2+pm when they were closing. Order the plate below for $5.50 (3 meats: char siew, curry chicken and also stir fried lion mane mushrooms.)

Curry was super hot, portion was not stingy, and the lady provided me a bowl of hot herbal soup!

Menu attached for reference.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116852952092019913610/reviews
cabriolale Cab,5,"Only 1 vegetarian stall left as the other vegetarian stall closed in Sept
$4.3 for curry noodles with 1 egg. Very good serving , value for money.
However, a bit thirsty after meal which is normal for drinking curry gravy .
I tried the dumpling noodles previously and it was quite good @ $4.5

Yellow Bear,5,"One of the 2 vegetarian stalls in this hawker centre. Sells Asian/ Chinese vegetarian food with no alliums. (*Food is mostly vegan, as it doesn’t contain dairy products. Only a handful dishes like Mee Siam contains eggs, but you can opt to have the eggs removed if you’re vegan)

Food is delicious and affordable, all below $5. Enjoy.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489311735261065689/reviews
