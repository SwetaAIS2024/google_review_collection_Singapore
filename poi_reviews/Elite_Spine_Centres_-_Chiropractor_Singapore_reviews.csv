Dr. Mike is a true master of their craft. Their expertise, patience, and genuine care for their patients' well-being is truly exceptional. They took the time to listen to my concerns, explained everything in a way that made sense to me, and developed a personalized treatment plan that has made a huge difference in my life.

The entire staff is friendly, professional, and dedicated to providing top-notch care. They make you feel seen, heard, and valued. The Clinic is clean, modern, and welcoming – a true reflection of the exceptional service you'll receive.

I've already recommended Elite Spine Centres to friends and family, and I'll continue to do so. If you're looking for a chiropractor who truly cares about your health and well-being, look no further!

SP,5,"I had some issues with my shoulder and was recommended to Dr. Mike at Elite Spines.

Dr. Mike explained clearly on the term ""biomechanics"" before relating it to my issues of concern and the plan of treatment.

Home exercise was shared too, so that we do not rely wholly on the treatment especially when we are unable to go for appointments.

My shoulder pain has significantly reduced after less than 10 visits.

All thanks to Dr Mike and the team who are always very friendly, caring and professional in carrying out the treatment.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117196314713403023343/reviews
