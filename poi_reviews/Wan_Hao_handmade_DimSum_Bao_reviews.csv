Kwong Fei Yee,4,"First time trying it. Ordered the lotus leave glutinous rice (the lady said it was limited so try it out) and also siew mai. They also sell a variety of paos but too full to order. They make all the dishes on the spot. Can see them very busy preparing paos.

The lotus leave glutinous rice has a strong lotus leave flavor, the meat well marinated and it was juicy. The siew mai also taste good. Unfortunately find the overall taste masked out a bit by too much sweet flavor.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118030178376808365901/reviews
Jo S,4,"Char siew bun was soft, fluffy and filling was moist. Lotus paste in the bun was just a little too sweet for my liking. These were freshly handmade at the store.

The chee Cheong fun however is plain with no filling, doused in overly sweet sauce. While it was soft, really was not to my liking.

However, for $1.40 for the chee Cheong fun and 90cents each for the small buns, I think it's a fair deal overall.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106877170813991386159/reviews
Wee Tang,5,"Never fail to come by this coffeeshop with the handmade Pau whenever I have to drop off the car for servicing.

Old school handmade buns with nice savoury and juicy meat stuffing.... I dare say, one of the best around... Come give it a try and support them!!!

Price for the bigger than usual big Pau is only at $1.80 per bun.... Enough for a meal washed down with a cup of Kopi O kosong..... Enjoyed this pau so much.... Bring some tissue as the meat juice can take you by surprise. Enjoy peeps!!!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112085840480791970569/reviews

Smr 12,1,"First time having chwee kueh and given a tiny amount of cai po. If you ask for more, they ask for more money. How to eat chwee kueh with only a tiny bit of cai po? Hello!!! It's cai po. Need to be so niao? If you want more money to give enough cai po, price up. Don't give tiny amount and ask for more money.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109391567425368858188/reviews
