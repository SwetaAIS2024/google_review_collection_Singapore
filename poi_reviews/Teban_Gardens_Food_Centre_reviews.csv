Big Roy [eatwithroy],5,Probably one of the few places you still can get food for $3 per serving. Large variety which caters to an aging population at Teban Gardens. The mixed veg rice stall is yummy and affordable.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114399014237804415281/reviews
Simon Lo,3,It is a neighbourhood classic food centre. Two main good things are worth the price and good kopi. But due to most of store owner is elderly their daily operating is not consistent that need to be noted. Respect them in maintaining good food at a reasonable price.

Mahmudul Hasan,5,"Teban Gardens Food Centre offers a diverse array of local hawker delights that cater to every taste. One of my personal favorites is the Mee Hoon â€“ it's always cooked to perfection with the right balance of flavors. The Nasi Lemak stalls are also worth a mention, consistently serving up delicious and satisfying meals. Prices are very reasonable, making it a great spot for affordable and tasty dining.

The food centre is clean and well-maintained, typical of a good hawker centre, yet it still retains a friendly, neighborhood vibe.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105138338113710741633/reviews
