YS C,5,Value for money Mookata with good portioning of ingredients for a 2 person set at $28. Decent sauces offered and service by the two owners was good too! Would definitely recommend anyone to try this over Siam Square for a value for money meal,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102680985470134340419/reviews
Kairul Effentee,5,"Very affordable Thai Mookata and very good service and chill boss and employee. Me and my wife were there late but they still accommodate to us and let us have the mookata.

The black pepper pork chop is my favourite and the Thai instant Tomyam noodles in the broth is just super.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100164634332710528722/reviews
Eleanor,5,"Affordable Thai mookata. Ordered the set for 2 and meat selection was good. I loved the chili dips that accompanied the set. And the beef cubes were so good too! Just make sure you don’t cook it too long because it’ll be tough, if not the beef cubes were so tender.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118015160359706421100/reviews
Ghising Subash,4,"We  had a Mookata and BBQ separately at this place. We ordered a Mookata set for four people, priced at $48. We added extra meat and other items, resulting in a total payment of around $78. It's a good spot to enjoy beer with a variety of snacks. Highly recommended.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113406421935429275952/reviews
Zach Wong,5,"My go to whenever I crave for mookata. It’s operated in a spacious coffeeshop but when packed with diners, it can get a bit smoky.

Their garlic platter is a must order. It comes with chicken, pork slices, prawns, scallops, squid, fishball and a basket of vegs. The meat is well marinated and covered with lots of chopped garlic.

The beef cube was tender and well marbled.

Their moo-ping is a must order. It tasted better than some of those which I tried in Bangkok.

Will definitely revisit.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108857350605307278686/reviews
