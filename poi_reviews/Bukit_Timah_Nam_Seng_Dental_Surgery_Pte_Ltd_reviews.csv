Yok yee Tan,5,"Dr. Tan Kai Shawn is gentle and nice. He tells me in advance what he will be doing and what i might feel during the treatment, this relieves my anxiety.
I also see him checking in on an elderly personally after the treatment as she was feeling light headed.
The nurse assisting him is also very attentive.
I recommend this dental clinic to anyone who are undecided to which to go to.
This is my second visit after 2 years. I think wasn't attended by Dr Tan then.
After these 2 visits, I can say they are both excellent doctors and I don't regret coming here for dental treatments.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115216184048777877156/reviews
