Turator,5,"Came for in-chair whitening service & it has a great positive impact on my teeth colour & gum healthiness. My teeth has become more whiter. I still feel pain because of the sensitivity during the procedure but the staffs said it is normal & that it will last for 3 more days. They even gave me a gel to apply on my teeth if i have this sensitivity pain popping up here & there. Overall, it is a Great experience. Great affordable price as it is now a promotion for 1st timers who wants to do the in-chair whitening treatment.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114304750571572763745/reviews
