      "text": "Japanese Garden in Singapore is a beautifully designed, serene attraction located on an island within Jurong Lake Gardens. Opened in 1974 and inspired by traditional Muromachi and Azuchi-Momoyama Japanese landscaping styles, it features classic elements like arched bridges, stone lanterns, koi ponds, and manicured greenery — all arranged to create a sense of peace and balance.\n\nThe garden is remarkably quiet, with few people around, especially on weekdays, making it perfect for a relaxed stroll, a peaceful jog, or simply soaking in the tranquil surroundings. Key highlights for me were the Water Lily Pavilion and the Sunken Garden, both offering particularly scenic and calming spots to pause and enjoy. I’d rate it a 5 out of 5 — a beautiful, under-the-radar escape in the city.",

One may say that the supernatural is bound to haunt these lands, but being a brave adventurer, I went there at such late hours, and not only was it serene and calm, it was a nice escape from urban places.\n\nAlthough it was dark, the illuminating lights are like a path for me to walk. It is quite daunting, since I didn't know where I actually was going. I didn't rely on any navigation tools, just solely walking and taking pictures. I have to say, it really feels good to be here to have some solitude. Overall, if you do have the guts, do drop by at the darkness. The ethereal beauty and tranquility would sure be a mesmerising experience.",
