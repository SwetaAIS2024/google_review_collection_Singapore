Ram Thiagesan,5,"Service was great the moment  u step into the clinic
The staff attending was very polite and courteous and the dentist by the name of Dr Benard Lee was remarkable..he was very patience and friendly and  along the way explained the procedure with simple terms which can be easily understood . He made the visitation such a pleasant one that I am actually  looking forward  to my next visit.

weiyi lee,5,"Dr Bernard Lee is my fav and go to dentist whenever I have teeth issues. He does not hard sell or upsell. He would listen carefully to my description of the issue and thinks through all the possible options before providing his diagnosis and recommendation. He is a very seasoned, skilled and down to earth dentist. Dr Lee also consults at the other outlet at marina square. Thank you Dr Lee!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105916636950225510260/reviews
