Julyen Loo,2,"Visited the OWNDAYS MBS Premium Concept Store on 4 April around 1pm for the first time—but left disappointed. I booked an eye test to check for glasses prescription and included additional remarks to include contact lens, yet only the latter was done. Although the optometrist did his good job in finding a contact lens prescription that fits well, the overall experience was lacking.

Despite mentioning several times that my spectacle frame was broken, no one followed up or offered help while I browsed frames as they packed my lens order. I asked if my prescription would be saved to my profile for online ordering— the lady staff said she’d check but didn’t, and proceeded to cash out instead.

Later, I found the recorded prescription in my account didn’t match what the optometrist told me. When I asked how to get my glasses prescription, his response was simply “subtract 0.25 from each side.”

Poor attention to detail despite me being the only appointment customer at that point. Definitely not the service I expected from a flagship store. Won’t be returning to this MBS outlet.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114805935437223246811/reviews
Kevin Park,5,It was my first time visiting OWNDAYS and it was super convenient with great styles and prices. They’re from Japan and they made my glasses with prescription lenses within 20 minutes! I also got a free exam included in with my frame/lenses!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101068918188054913669/reviews
Jed Abrenica,5,"We decided to take new specs to this branch and fortunately, we were welcomed by their friendly and professional staff.

They gave proper eye scan and measurement then recommended the best glasses to us.

Shoutout to Ms Swee Heong for giving us the best assistance!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111809224203157985186/reviews
Tim Koerwers,5,"Friendly professional, competent staff.
Selling point really is the sub 20 minute glasses which are manufactured in store. Great experience.

Just for a disclaimer, I got a free lens cleaner for this review. Still, these are honest 5 stars.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103540481459640262029/reviews
Christine,5,Staff are really friendly and they really ensure gou get the right checkup for your eyes. Got surprised with the third step on checking whether your eyes are healthy (which the Philippines stores lack). Very worth the visit.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110211744981765852115/reviews
