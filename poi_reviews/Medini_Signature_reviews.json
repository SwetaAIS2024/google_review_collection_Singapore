      "text": "I felt very uncomfortable with the behavior of some staff near the pool area. As a woman, I didn’t feel safe walking alone—especially because the gardener and pool cleaner were constantly watching me in a way that felt intrusive and inappropriate. They weren’t doing their jobs, just sitting around on their phones and watching people. This appears to be a daily issue.\n\nThe pool and gym areas often felt like they were dominated by these staff members, making it hard for residents—especially women—to enjoy the facilities. It's no surprise the pool area is usually empty. There needs to be better supervision, professional conduct, and accountability from management to make the space feel safe and welcoming.\n\nHighly not recommended if you're considering renting or buying here. The place also looks a bit rundown. I suggest looking elsewhere.",

      "text": "We stayed here for 4D3N as part of Airbnb. The condo is well managed and the security guards are on the ball. My unit at Tower 2 was superb.   The gym is well equipped but basic. Maintenance is necessary to upkeep the condo better. For example, the aircon at lobby at P1 is out of order, signs of wear and tear albeit not serious are showing. The toilet near the guard post is not kept to good standard. Toilet seat cover is detached and there is no toilet paper. On the first day there, you have to be guided by security within the car park as it’s quite confusing. Make the best use before age catches up.",

Unloading luggage is difficult\nCondo looks torn down with many vacant units, almost look abandon\nStupid Drivers driving & speeding against traffic flow in a dark carpark area. Almost hit me!\nSignage in carpark is confusing with many blocked routes\nNo amenities nearby. Almost nothing around other than few other condos\nDirty pool seems to be poorly maintain\n\nOur unit was clean and almost full furnish. But overall I woulndt come back.",
