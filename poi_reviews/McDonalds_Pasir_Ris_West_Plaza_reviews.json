The staff are courteous and attentive, and special recognition must be given to Manager Manda, whose exceptional service consistently goes above and beyond expectations. Her dedication is truly appreciated and never taken for granted. Congratulations, Manda, on a job exceptionally well done!",

McDonald took over, renovation was well done, very comfortable, all staff I interact with are very nice, McDonald done a good job by providing clean and comfortable dining space, with relatively reasonable prices.",

It has been left out for super long even tho it’s abit warm, but can taste that it’s not fresh. Macd is reknown for your hot crispy fresh French fries but this store don’t have it.\nDisappointment. It will make me not come bk to this outlet again if you don’t improve.",

I find that they could have made half of their kitchen space for more dining space.\n\nThey even have sink to wash your hands and a dedicated tray place for those who order mobile order takeaway.\n\nThey also have chargers at certain seats. Really nice atmosphere.",
