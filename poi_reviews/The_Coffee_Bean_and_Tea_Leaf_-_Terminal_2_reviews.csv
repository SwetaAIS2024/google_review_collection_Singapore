Robert Pearson,1,Terrible. Asked for capuccino with cinnamon and got soy cappuccino disgusting. They even read the order back to me and still got it wrong. Ham sandwich made me feel sick eating it. Muffin was rock solid.  How old? The robot tray collector provided the best service. Should have checked the 2.4 star rating first.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110480988360128744249/reviews

Phong Nguyen,1,"Be careful with an Indian staff/cashier. I want to use all my SGD coins before leave this country so I look the the menu and make sure it fit with my coins. I gave him SGD 13.9 (10 + 2 and 1.9 coins) to buy a hot dark chocolate big size (SGD 8.9). He take my money and didn't give any money back (SGD5), at first I kinda confused because I tho he will give money back later but no, i reminded him, tried to ask why not give my money back. Even used my phone to show how much money I gave him. Then he gave back to me SGD 1.5 (1+0.5 coins), after that he said I only gave him SGD8.9 (5+2+1.9 coins). After that I gave up took SGD1.5 coins instead SGD5. If he was right, he didn't need give me back SGD1.5 lol.
That how I leave SGP with a bad mood. Its not about money, it is about the trust.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109470951785329220521/reviews
