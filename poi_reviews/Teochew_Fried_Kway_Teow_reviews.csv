Avocado,5,"Light weight CKT. Dark sauce is not overpowering. Wok Hei is just right. Not too dry. $3.50 flat rate. Portion is small though but good if you not too hungry. Portion of ingredients was good too, not stingy! Two thumbs up!

Update Aug 2024
No longer flat rate but slight increase in price. $4/$5 now. Last pic is $5 portion.
Tastes as good! Support the old uncle and auntie!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102582755252278407198/reviews
Teck Chye Yeo,5,"I blew a tyre, and one of the best things that came out of this is I found this gem of a CKT stall nearby. Smack in the middle of a quiet coffeeshop is this nondescript stall without a name, but a sign that simply describes what they sell. It's run by a very nice elderly couple too.

Ok. My first litmus test for good CKT....Must Have Pork Lard! Ticked. Must Have Sweet Sauce! Ticked! Must have Wok Hei! Ticked.

Now you get a plate of sweet, dark kway teow, coated with garlic and egg strands, strewn with crispy pork lard on request, and chilli that isn't quite obvious visually, but bite into it, and you know it's there.
They use 'Hum'; those tiny ones used in pasta sometimes, and they give enough taste without the overkill from those large ones (works for me actually!).

If you love your CKT a little ok the sweet side, then you Must try theirs.

Tommy Lim,4,"I visited this stall after reading the positive reviews. While I wasn't completely blown away like some reviewers, I found the CKT to be honest and comforting. The elderly husband and wife running the stall were very friendly.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115774852283121417440/reviews
Rei Axl Ye,5,"Saw a reviewer complaining that this have ""no stock taste"", sounds like someone dont know what is fried kway teow and just want to complain for the sake of it and act connoisseur. Ckt got stock? Then chicken rice got fish already. Been eating this for the past 10 years, the proper reviews tell you all you need to know.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115827926540149694576/reviews
Kelvin Wee,4,"Small plate of average Fried Kway Teow for $3.50. Quite a lot of egg, but only pcs of lup cheong & fish cake. Taste is quite good though. Sweet & savoury type.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108767345030655062698/reviews
