Metal Fins,1,"EXTREEEMELY slow. If you are hungry, don't come here. It's 20-30mins for a single rice dish. You can order anything else, finish eating and leave and the food hasn't even come.
Don't waste your time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107781776107831846894/reviews
Losly Lale,1,"This date and time … I say sis but because of your service .. I say aunty tall prob in your 30 plus …

The order was already done in a carrier and yet it’s not passed on the pick up table and yet you serve another customer walk so slow like you own the establishment , then I thought once you done serving you pass the order to the table and yet you went off and go somewhere then return back and place at the table . Why not just handle my order then get back to the front of the people of the eyes . It was there for some unnecessary minutes .

And because of that my order was wrong delivered . Lose some walk more that way can be faster",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102265693366308887391/reviews

Steve Lum,1,"Ordered a packet of yang chow beehoon from a rude plump counter woman. I'm in my 60s and I dare say this is the worst beehoon I've eaten all my life. Beehoon all broken up and soggy, few pieces of mock char siew, taugeh and shredded cabbages and you charged me $5.20! After few spoon I really had to discard it. Look at the pic folks",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114009492890524301541/reviews
yien peng lim,1,"Was there around 11 plus coming to 12 noon. Ordered 1 medium broccoli take away and it took 20-25 mins with no crowds. There are only 1 dish being served when I was there. Not sure why it took so long since there is no crowd.
Won’t ordered again unless no choice.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116202785278266795325/reviews
