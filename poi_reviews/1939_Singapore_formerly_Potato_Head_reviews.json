Fries were amazing and so were the chicken wings\n\nService can be improved.",

Unfortunately, newer burger establishments have sprung up and the Rambo of today did fall short both in taste and price.\n\nA meal in that picture plus a dessert and (non-alcoholic) drink added up to $100. Definitely better options out there for your burger, unless you were feeling a tad nostalgic like me.\n\nI‚Äôm so glad the new owners kept the original interior, but a serious refresh of menu offerings is needed to keep up with the fast changing, relentless competition in F&B",

I love the food every time I come, although I do miss the mushroom toasties from the old menu (pls bring them back!)\n\nThe service is excellent, all of the staff are so friendly and accommodating, the food is always delicious and the drinks are incredible. I've tried a lot of cocktails and they're all great, I personally recommend the coconut negroni.\n\nThe ambience and atmosphere are on point. All 3 floors have different vibes but equally great, Although the rooftop bar is my favorite. The DJs they bring sometimes also add to the experience.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend 1939/Potato Head. 5 stars üåü",
