David Daly,4,"This unusual piece of living artwork is located at the Ocean Financial Centre in Collyer Quay.

It is formed by nearly 57,000 pot plants and stands 19 metres tall and 110 metres wide and fills 2,125 square metres. It depicts a map of the world.

Rather interesting glass ceiling, with coloured panels, is above the garden.

It has been designated as a Guinness World Record for the Largest Vertical Garden.

A large sculpture of silver balls and Complex Simplicity are beside the Garden.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116921101035072801815/reviews
