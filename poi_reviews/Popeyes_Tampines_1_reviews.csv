Sylvia Tran,2,"Sorry it was just not good. The fried chicken was extremely dry and the fries were cold. I did enjoy the biscuit as I haven't eaten one in such a long time. The chicken was a let down. I give 2 stars, because staff was friendly and the food was served in a super quick manner.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117702893585870428413/reviews

Izat LongWei,1,"Placed my order at 7.12pm. Waited for half an hour and order was still not ready. At 7.55pm, I decided to do my prayers and come back again. Came back at 8.14pm and to my astonishment, order still not ready. Headed to the counter and they immediately prepared my order.
