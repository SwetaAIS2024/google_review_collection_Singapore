Amanda H,5,"Excellent food. Superb service.

I’m really happy we dined here! The food was so delicious. We got Kadai prawn, lamb rogan Josh, bandara kabab, onion bhaji, saffron rice and garlic naan.
The lamb was succulent and tender. The onion bhaji was super crispy but not oily.
My favorites were the prawns and chicken bandada kaban.- I will be dreaming of these 2 dishes!!

Affordable pricing, on drinks and food. We had excellent service by Pavav.

Highly recommend!!!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106066325266490077390/reviews
Vaibhav Agarwal,1,"Pathetic experience.

We are family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) and visited for dinner on Sunday night.

First time saw that in an esteemed restaurant, staff was drinking alcohol openly instead of focusing on customer experience.

Order was delayed by 45-60 mins and kids were starving, even after that, all order including drinks, appetizers etc. was received incorrect, even though the restaurant was not crowded. Hence we have to left without eating anything despite long wait.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117850253622157365029/reviews
HBN,5,"Very good butter chicken. Garlic naan is very fragrant and delicious. Good service, there is even an appetizer! (Some sort of chip and green herbal yogurt sauce) The chicken in the curry is also smokey and good quality.
