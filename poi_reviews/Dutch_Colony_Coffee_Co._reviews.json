Has the standard cafe offerings - brunch options (available during lunch), pasta, steak and salmon. Limited seating area so do come early. Also itâ€™s halal so great for gatherings with colleagues",

We had the regular blend which was smooth, bitter-free and no need for sugar.\nBreakfast - opted for the Avo Smash without egg - easily the best breakfast I've had this month. The textures compliment the food, and the taste - OMG so good! Delicious tang with the Avo Smash, smooth sweet white onions and ?chili oil on top ðŸ‘Œ\nThank you! Will be back for sure!",
