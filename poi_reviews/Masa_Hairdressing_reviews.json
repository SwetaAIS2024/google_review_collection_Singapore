I was there during lunch time and did a walk in, Ray attended to me without keeping me waiting long. He did the touch up so patiently and even wanted to blow big curl for me even though he had other customers waiting for him.\n\nHe shared me me the pros and cons of any treatment I asked truthfully and made me wanna get another treatment done. For sure, I’ll return to look for Ray.\n\nHe was so nice that I’m gonna consider my “office salon” as I’ll usually pick one near office and near to home. Thank you for everything Ray!",

      "text": "I had the WORST experience of my life in here.. I asked for argan oil straightener treatment, they mentioned they had some other japanese treatment that was better and also wouldn’t damage my hair and I believed it.. it ended up was some rebonding.. during the procedure the hair was damaged and they had to stop it and wash.. it was SO BAD that the (leading) hairstylist Ray Tham had to cut half of the hair in my head and cut my hair like maybe 15 cm for what was left in my head.. I didn’t have hair in half of my head, I was almost bald..  at least was the bottom so the hair on top could cover but i had no volume at all.. he still had the nerve to charged me the cost of the process (not cheap btw) and I was so in shock that I just paid and left.. I’ve been living a nightmare, hair is so important for women.. I have spent so much money trying to recover my hair and had to pay a lot on hair extensions and only until today I have the courage to post this because they make you feel is your fault as your hair was “weak”.. my conclusion is that for money they juts make any procedure without making a real assessment of your hair and what can or cannot handle.. the WORST experience ever! Would not recommend this place.. skip it please!",
