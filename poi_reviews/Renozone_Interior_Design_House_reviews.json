      "text": "Renovating a home isn‚Äôt just about construction, it‚Äôs an experience, a journey shared with the renovator. A good renovation goes beyond craftsmanship, it‚Äôs about trust, communication, and the feeling of being in good hands.\n\nRenozone has worked on both my flat and my brother‚Äôs, and each time, the experience was consistent, familiar, and reassuring. Their dedication to quality and attention to detail delivered results that were not only satisfying but gave us the confidence that our homes were in the right hands. Walking into the completed space felt like stepping into something thoughtfully crafted, made with care and precision.\n\nWhat truly sets Renozone apart is their people. The staff are warm, accommodating, and genuinely invested in bringing a vision to life. They don‚Äôt just renovate spaces, they create homes filled with comfort and character.",

      "text": "This is our 2nd time engaging Renozone for our major house renovation. The 1st time was around 18 years ago , and since it was soooo good the 1st time, it was natural for us to go back to them. Both Kelvin and Collin saw thru the project, and handed over on time just as they had promised, around in 10 weeks and earlier, just before CNY 2025. Collin was the ID creative ideas, while Kelvin was the person making it happen. The support was extremely positive, special note especially going out to Kelvin, who responded to our concerns promptly and fixing it very quickly. He was also very knowledgeable telling us what can do, what cannot. It made our renovation less stressful. As said, we did a major Reno, overhauling everything. They will work to your budget and make it work out regardless. Overall it was a good experience. Definitely recommend.",

He was responsible and gave sound advice on all my renovation queries. As a result, there was no hiccup in my renovation journey.\nThe renovation cost was also reasonable. Knowing that I would be retiring soon, Kelvin did not give me pressure to take on the more costly renovation items. The final result of the renovation is that my house is now cozy with good quality carpentry.",
