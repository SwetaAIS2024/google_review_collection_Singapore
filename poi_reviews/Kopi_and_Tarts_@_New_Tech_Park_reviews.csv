Lizhen property,1,"Good atmosphere to chill but the service standards really chase people off.

Kopi and tarts need to either train their workers here or rearrange manpowers who can serve better.

Bought a few tarts/muffins but staff pack all into paper bags. Ask for container and she gave a black face.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103071463649150760243/reviews

Vincent N,1,There were 3 staff on duty and no one attended to me even though I was patiently waiting and there was only one other customer in the shop. They made eye contact with me but did not bother to inform or say if they would attend to me. If they are going to charge $4.20 for a cup of coffee they need to work on having better customer service.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110317899711198965848/reviews
