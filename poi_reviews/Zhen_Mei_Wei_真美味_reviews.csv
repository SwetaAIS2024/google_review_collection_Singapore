Alan (Laowai),5,Tried her Fried fish lor mee and realised it's a hidden gem in the industrial area. Yellow noodle serve in the dish was cooked perfectly. Generous amount of garlic and secret chilly sauce that hits the sweet spot for this dish with a perfect subtle amount of vinegar that even someone who isnt a fan of vinegar like me appreciate its presence in the dish. Pork version is also available however the Fried fish combination surprises me. Definitely a highly recommended stall to visit.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100543085155350561469/reviews
