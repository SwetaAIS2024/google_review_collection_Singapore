Jo Lee,4,"Bayfront Station: Singapore's subterranean crossroads of adventure and leisure. More than just an interchange connecting the Downtown (DT16, blue) and Circle (CE1, yellow) lines, this is the epicenter for accessing Singapore's crown jewels. Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, and the tantalizing casinos all converge here, making it a predictably popular hub.  Brace yourself for the energetic flow of tourists, particularly during peak hours and weekends.

However, beyond the bustling platforms lies a surprisingly elegant and meticulously maintained path leading towards the botanical artistry of Gardens by the Bay. This station isn't just functional, it's a key that unlocks the magic of Marina Bay.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117066434074962659257/reviews
