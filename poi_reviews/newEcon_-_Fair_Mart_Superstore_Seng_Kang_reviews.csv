Phone ‚ÄúKarishad‚Äù Thawdar,4,"As a student attending a nearby school, it is very convenient for me to buy food from here during lunch breaks and so forth. However, during lunch breaks the shop is very very full. The food is well-priced. However the bubble tea experience is very bad. the boss is very rude when it comes to serving customers.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109401064009397372775/reviews
SBH Hanabi,1,"The old lady cashier was very rude. She has been rude to other customers several times but today it just hit me. I buy things from here all the time and always pay using paywave payment. But just now when I was about to pay she said to me ""next time tell me how you want to pay"" even though I was just holding the phone she should have already known I wanted to pay with. Even if I didn't tell her, couldn't she ask? she is like that deliberately provoking people's anger. I feel like I'm taking something for free from her so she acts like that. never buy anything from here again!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110993084734074602600/reviews
Ed Chua,1,"Very upsetting experience ordering bubble tea here. I ordered a peach milk tea and requested that the lady put my drink in my own drink container. Since my container was bigger, she told me to get the bigger cup at $4.50. I told her it was fine. As she was about to scoop pearls, I said ‚Äúno pearls, thank you‚Äù.
Drink wasn‚Äôt cheaper, but it‚Äôs still fine. I walked around to see if there was anything else in the minimart I wanted to buy.
When I came back, I was shocked to see my container filled with fresh milk.
I told her I ordered Peach Milk Tea, in which she replied in mandarin, ‚ÄúPeach Milk Tea and Peach Milk are 2 different things‚Äù. WTH üòÖ like I don‚Äôt know that they‚Äôre 2 different things? That‚Äôs why I ordered peach milk tea in the first place.
Then it was just a stare off. And I had to rush off for my class, so I just took my container and left. She had absolutely no remorse and was not apologetic for her mistake at all.
Absolutely ridiculous.
Anyway, the minimart is fine‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs frequented by the kids around the area. But this bubble tea ordering experience was absolutely the worst. I will never order bubble tea from here ever again.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115818807181592198440/reviews
