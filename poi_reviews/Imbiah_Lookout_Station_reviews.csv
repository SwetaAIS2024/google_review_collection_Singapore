Nur Iman Rostam,5,"Imagine having to spend just $4 on Sentosa Line Cable Car tickets for one day of usage is a fantastic deal that everyone should try out if they ever plan a day out or staycation on this beautiful idyllic island getaway.

The only catch is you need to present your Singapore Identity Card to be offered the local pricing. Also, do note that it is only for the Sentosa Line which runs on Sentosa Island and not for the Mount Faber Line which crosses the HarbourFront channel to reach Mount Faber Cable Car Terminus on Singapore mainland.

Sentosa Cable Car Line is defined by the bright orange colour of the Singapore Cable Car network. There are three stations and they are Sensoryscape Station (formerly Merlion Station), Imbiah Lookout Station and Siloso Point Station.

The entire journey takes about 15 minutes covering a total of 880 metres in length from one point to another. Do note that Imbiah Station is the Transit point for both Mount Faber Line (served by Sentosa Station) and Sentosa Line which allows tourists and locals to hop between the lines permitted the correct tickets purchased.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110287485091231667131/reviews
Myat Su Mon,1,"We bought 2 tickets for cable car , and cable car boarding officer(indian) attitude was so bad to us. We were trying to find the cable car which is vacant so that we can have privacy and we donâ€™t want to combine with other ppl.
We do see he assigned other ppl who wants to have a private ride , so we waited for empty cars for a while and he said we are not listening to him and wait for the assignment until another day. We bought tickets , not coming and having a free ride. I hope this staff can improve his attitude towards passengers and cable car service shud also provide privacy ride to the ones who need it no matter on crowded or ease period.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107224650969177123324/reviews

Ume-IYMAN,4,"This is part of the Sentosa beach day trip.
The imbiah lookout station forms part of the transit from Singapore main island, at harborfront or mount Faber cable car to imbiah station stop on Sentosa island. If you want to explore the area like go on the luge or nature walk or countless other things, you just get off here. But if you want to go to the western side of the island where siloso beach is, then you need to walk a little further and get on another cable car that will take you there(or you can walk there of course!). There are clear signs pointing you to siloso point station.
Remember, you need to pay for all this upfront to get a good price!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116095774061865499877/reviews
