Kasturi Subramaniam,4,"Simply amazing cheese. Lots of variety. If you're like me who can't decide, no worries; just ask the boss to create platter for you. You can also request for wine or sake to pair with your platter.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105257440419721108040/reviews
Jacinta Lim,5,"Ming is amazing. Everyone needs to come here at least once! It’s so rare to find someone with both the expertise and the passion that Ming has. Even at Michelin 3-star French restaurants, when we mention her, the staff light up and rave about Ming and her incredible cheeses.

We lived in Europe for 14 years, and honestly, Ming’s cheeses are better than most of what we found there — even compared to the best cheese shops. What I really love is that you’ll find cheeses here that you can’t find anywhere else in the world (like a Swedish cheese that tastes like pineapple!).

Ming’s passion shines through in every way. She doesn’t just sell cheese. She tells the stories behind them: cheeses crafted in towns of only 40 people, where generations have been making the same cheese. She’s even hunted down cheesemakers for years just to get a single wheel she believes in.

You really won't find anywhere else the heart, the love and the stories behind the cheeses you find here. Some reviews have said that Ming is curt. But if you engage her about cheese and wine, she's really nice and you'll find that she has a huge amount of love for what she does which is really inspiring.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104926212103578849227/reviews
Matthew Teo,5,"First time there. The cheese platter was really enjoyable. It was interesting learning about where each cheese came from and the accoutrements all paired really well.

The bread was especially good. I feel like I could eat it on its own.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106257133100496214103/reviews
JK Ong,5,"Chanced upon this inconspicuous place after a friend’s recommendation, discovered a hidden gem serving elusive artisanal cheese with liquor pairing! 🍷🍶🧀🧀🧀 This place is reservation only, and they only opens for certain period throughout the year. If you love cheese 🐭 , you can’t go wrong! The dining space is tiny but cosy, and the owner will seek out your preferences before recommending their “omakase” complete with wine and sake pairing. Great for hanging out with friends who shared the same fondness for cheese, and chat over some interesting pairing of white wine and Japanese sakes. They are served on platters and you are encouraged to eat in the order and pairing that the owner arranged.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111019396032378373784/reviews
YP Soo,5,"First time buying cheese here and was not disappointed. Great recommendations for cheese (was looking for aged Comte and was recommended fruhlingskase from Switzerland).
Also love the giant muscatels which complements the cheese. The shop also has good offerings as other dried fruits, crackers and wines. There’s an indoor area for customers to eat cheese and drink wine which was lovely, will definitely be back for “dine-in”.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107739220722281476081/reviews
