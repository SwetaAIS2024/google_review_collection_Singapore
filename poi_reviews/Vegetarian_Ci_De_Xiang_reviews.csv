Jordan Chan,1,"Worst customer service experience ever. Went there to eat. The chef told me he busy cooking, dont want take my order! ðŸ˜’ it was 2.40pm in the afternoon ðŸ˜†

As per photo, plenty of mixed rice left. Think 1 person order mixed rice worth too little for him ðŸ¤”",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100636479994781559330/reviews

Ricky Chea,5,Just found out about this vegetarian stall. It is inside the Koufu food court. The serving is quite generous and price is reasonable at $4.50 only. Quite delicious too. Will visit again when passing by.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102798941800934595629/reviews
Yi Chao Lim,5,"Thank you to the honest staff who corrected it and refunded me, after her colleague accidentally overcharged me.

Her colleague charged me twice for 1 dish thinking that I had ordered a double portion. I couldnt really understand her and had just paid the price quoted.

She saw the miscommunication and immediately stepped in to correct it and refund me the amount.

We need more of such people around!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105290609429746180578/reviews
