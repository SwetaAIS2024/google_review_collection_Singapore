Elizabeth YMMK,4,"Cake was good , but the cashier was speaking too fast . He seemed friendly but a bit impatient, which was understandable as there was a long line",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117388384213584237690/reviews
Cassia A,5,"This is a surprisingly vibey Starbucks! It’s in the middle of the mall, but it’s a nice place to sit. They have wifi and comfortable chairs, lots of tables.
The coffee was a bit worse than normal for Starbucks, but okay.
They were really friendly!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117662481746295955146/reviews
JM V,5,"We recently visited Starbucks at Jurong Point Mall, and as always, I had to get my favorite Java Chip Frappuccino. The place was great cozy, comfortable, and perfect for a quick break. I really enjoyed the ambiance, and the service was prompt.

It’s definitely one of those places I’ll keep coming back to",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113607140413131397124/reviews
Skye Cai,5,"Quite and comfortable place to stay for studying or meeting friends.
Very big space, got outdoor seatings and indoor.
However extremely slow service, too much ordering from the delivery and somehow the order was mixed up.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
