Raymond Seah,3,Was with a friend at this food centre and decided to try the western food. Ordered steak but the stall does not provide a steak knife. It's hard to cut steak without a steak knife. Food wise so so.  Maybe the management can consider providing steak knife for customers eating steak at the food centre.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113361663713818392653/reviews
L K,1,"Ordered a steak (which come with fries, mash potatoes and sauce ) delivered via foodpanda today. The food arrived in a mess.   Steak (which come with fries, mash potatoes and sauce )  are all packed in a squarish base plastic container. Sauce is packed in a sauce container which is good. However, the sauce apparently does not stay in the container.   In addition, sauce container  was placed along side with the mash potato in the squarish based plastic container which leave all the potatoes sticking to the sauce container and practically eaten up by it.

Squarish based plastic container was packed inside and over a narrow base plastic bag. Once you lift up the bag, the container will not sit properly in the bag causing the  sauce and food to slide towards one side and causing food to spill.  Hope there could be some improvement over the packaging.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112302274353002712632/reviews
