Ordered the bee hoon and the staff asked if want to add an egg and I told her okay.\n\nThe noodles was served cold and hard and felt like eating rubber bands. The only thing that's hot was the sunny side up. Highly likely the bee hoon was a canceled order and they served to me instead. Ate 2 mouths and that's it!\n\nIf any of you patronize this zi char stall, make sure they serve food hot.",
