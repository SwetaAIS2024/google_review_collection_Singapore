Dr. Arut Siva has developed a unique healing protocol over decades, and the center offers various health-promoting programs.\n\nEvery visit to MediTherapie Center is heartwarming, thanks to the caring team that treats you like family. Miss Yamuna, in particular, with her lively, caring nature, makes the interaction with her alone a healing experience.\n\nIf you're seeking a transformative experience, MediTherapie Center is the place to go.",

      "text": "Dr Siva at Medi Therapie is such a caring and knowlegeable man who makes everyone who visits him feel special. There is a wide range of holistic products and high tech equipment especially for those seeking treatment without side effects for  cancer, chronic fatigue and difficult illnesses.\n\nI particularly enjoy the oxygen therapy, vibrational beds and light therapy which really allowed my mind to be at ease and to release trapped emotions. The voice analysis software is extremely accurate and is a great tool for self awareness and to identify inner challenges. I also love to try the delicious enzyme drinks and superfoods that Dr Siva generously shares.\n\nThe space is centrally located between Novena and Toa Payoh in Balestier and is child and elderly friendly. I was even surprised to see a monk using his therapeutic services! I have met quite a number of wonderful people in Medi Therapie too as I am passionate in holistic health.\n\nI am looking forward to the new equipment he will be bringing in, as well as the health seminars and yoga classes that will be held.",
