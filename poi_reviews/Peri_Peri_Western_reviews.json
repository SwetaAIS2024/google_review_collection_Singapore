The only good thing worth commenting was the black pepper gravy - it was peppery (as expected) that's all.\n\nWas unimpressed when I saw the dish. The fries looks so bland. It tasted soggy with a hint of saltiness. The Mac & Cheese looks like it was popped into the oven and made on a whim. The cheese sauce that came with it was so diluted I couldn't even figure what it tasted like. The chicken chop tasted mediocre at best and it was sooo thin (judge by seeing the images). However, I felt that it was grilled sufficiently.\n\nMaybe the chef had a bad day, or only this dish was sub-par, I wouldn't know. But I wouldn't eat here again.",
