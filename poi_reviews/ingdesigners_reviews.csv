KingKong 99,4,"Will be reviewing the food court.

Most stalls are opened at this time. Good spread of food choices.

Place is big and airy. There is an outdoor dining area too for those who prefer sitting away from the stalls.

Good ambience.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110180464205420002754/reviews

Benjamin Barak Perisseuo,5,Widely spaced buildings with surface and sheltered parking for office staff and guests. I was at Block 24 level 5 and came across this shop that carries interesting Aromatherapy products. There's even a product for Eczema condition and it comes in both Children and Adult versions!,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105027307877600289247/reviews
Jeremy Tan,5,"It's very far from Marymount station, people who are going to grab office if you are walking it's about 20-25 min.
Better to travel by car",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105327159071020038267/reviews
Luke Phang,2,"A massive structure that is almost in the middle of nowhere, with numerous start up offices here. Standing at 8 storeys tall with close to a hundred units per floor, it's not surprising that they call this place a city. Getting here is difficult though, as the place is only accessible by car or foot. Closest bus stop is about 10 minutes walk away. Not an entirely convenient place.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117681118694147432030/reviews
