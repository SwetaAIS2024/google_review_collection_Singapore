Shehzahd Idnani,5,"Dr Reuben is amazing! I had scaling and polishing done and it was a great experience! So much care and concern was put into the whole process with Dr Reuben always checking in if everything is alright and making sure to guide me through the whole process. From explaining to me each step and to breaking down what current state of my dental health, such professionalism made me not terrified of visiting the dentist anymore! The whole experience was so great that I immediately got the membership and booked my next appointment. Thank you Dr Reuben & team for helping me overcome my fear of visiting the dentist! I have certainly found my go-to dentist!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101055373775789336736/reviews
