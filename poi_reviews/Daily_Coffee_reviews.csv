Fikri J,5,"I had the chance to have a simple dinner here on Saturday night. It was quiet and cozy. Not many customers around. The food was surprising good. Like no frills. The soft boiled eggs were great, kaya butter toast was crunchy on the outside. Price was reasonable as well. Iâ€™d come again for another simple meal.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115734785798057148033/reviews
Kester Chan,4,1st try at Daily Coffee today. The variation of food looks interesting & decided to try Nasi Lemak chicken wing set. Also ordered hot Teh. Portion is good & surprised have a serving of cabbage too! Egg is nice & chicken wing slightly dry. Teh is just right in sweetness. Overall is quite good value.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102571950141570448444/reviews
Natalie lim,3,"Small cafe with a good variety of food available. We ordered mee siam, mee rebus and an egg & bread set. Reasonable wait time. The food were all on the sweet side which was a bit odd since they were savoury items. Coffee was rather weak, disappointed since it looked dark.

Cafe was clean, service staff was friendly.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115016144668800125447/reviews
Mira,5,The rendang and crispy rendang chicken are a must try. Chicken is tender on the inside but super crispy outside. Rendang gravy is given separately in a bowl and packed with flavour. The lady staff at the cashier is very kind and patient too. Highly recommended!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105692298740490174509/reviews
