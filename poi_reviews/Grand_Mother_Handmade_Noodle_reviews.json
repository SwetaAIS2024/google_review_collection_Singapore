I would say the dry ban mee is better.\n\nThe broth tastes plain a bit disappointing.\n\nThere are many ingredients, but the minced meat also tastes plain. The good thing is that it's not frozen minced meat, so it doesn't have that fridge taste. The meat is fresh.\n\nI love the ikan bilis very crunchy and yummy!\n\nOverall, when mixed together, the taste is just okay. The pork oil flavor isn't very strong, maybe.\n\nThe price and portion are reasonable.",

It was clean yet not bland, topped with a generous serving of ingredients and only at $4.50!\n\nDefinitely a bowl of comforting noodles to be had, with the queue management being a buzzer system and additional plus since that alleyway is a little crowded at times üëçüèª",

They refused and said I should have told them if I want my egg to be \"undercooked\"??? Anyone who eats this dish knows that the egg supposed to be runny. Anyone who cooks eggs knows this is not just an egg that's overcooked, this is a dry and crumbled looking egg yolk that is severely overcooked.\n\nShame on you for refusal to make good a mistake and try to blame on your customer.",

Not much ingredients for the noodle and no soup.\nThe ginseng chicken soup has mild ginseng taste but doesn't have the intensity. The soup is a little mild. The chicken drumstick is soft.\nThis stall has many other dishes. Although I  am not impressed with these 2 dishes, I will give the other dishes a try the next time I am there.",
