Joshua Thoreson,5,"Really beautiful trail, lots of forest sounds from the trees and monkeys along the path. Many cool plant growth offers good scenery for pictures and admiring the beauty.

Further up the trail there is washrooms and fresh, cold water for filling up water bottles, along with places to sit.

Would not suggest eating there as monkeys regularly attack people for food! My brother was attacked and his food was stolen. As long as you keep it in your bag they are very tame.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109952807628569849506/reviews
