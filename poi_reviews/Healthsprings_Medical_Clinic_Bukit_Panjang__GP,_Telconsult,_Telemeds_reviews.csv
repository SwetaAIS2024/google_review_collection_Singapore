Yew Kay Yan,5,"Had really positive and professional consultation with Dr Sharon, she is really detailed and I feel she really cares for the patients.

The desk assistant is also very confident, knows her things well and explained medications really clearly.

Overall this clinic is probably the best in the area. Definitely the place to come to if sick but hopefully don't need to come in the first place! ðŸ˜…",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117168191281589507149/reviews
ivy sim,1,"Ydy was my 2nd visit to the clinic. I was utterly disappointed by the staff attitude. Especially with the long hair lady who took my blood pressure. On both occasions she presented no interest in her work. She behaved like an automated machine, no smile, no passion, no warmth, ALWAYS SOOOO MOOOODY.  When collecting the medications, there was no dosing spoon for liquid medicine until I asked for it, the nurse simply passed me a cup & didn't bother to explain the spoon wasn't  available, hence, replaced with a cup. What's wrong with the clinic staff? The team does not have any basic customer service,  they are just not the right fit for the job! Today I am sharing my experiences because I do not see any improvement from my last visit.
Hope something can be done before it is too late.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102785250287271125080/reviews
Onara Osman,1,"I was extremely disappointed with the front desk staff at this clinic. The receptionist was unfriendly and spoke in such a curt manner. It was as if she had no regard for basic courtesy. She would really benefit from some customer service trainingâ€”perhaps SkillsFuture credit could be put to good use here.

The only reason I brought my mother to this clinic was that her usual GP was unavailable all week. While the doctors themselves were lovely, the poor first impression left by the reception made the visit unpleasant. I wouldnâ€™t recommend this clinic based on our experience.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113859643326479419338/reviews
Mel Sha,1,"Everything was fine except for the front receptionist's behaviour.Honestly,if you dont like your job,donâ€™t work lah.You think patient(s) would feel welcomed? You dont know how customer service works ah? As someone working in customer service myself ,her attitude is extremely unacceptable.Not professional at all.Ask her go for classes to improve on her horrible attitude.Thatâ€™s all.The girl with long hair.Such a simple job but giving attitude.Donâ€™t work and ruin others day.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112623783034649305895/reviews
Emily Concepcion,5,"Always a breeze visiting this clinic, all the staff are kind and attentive. Plus Doc Sharon has always been our family doctor,  she's the only doctor my family trust and all my kids grew up under her care when we moved here in SG.
