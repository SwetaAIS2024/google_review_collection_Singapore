KingKong 99,5,"I happened to arrive in this coffee shop (Kopitiam) by chance.

First thing to look out for was to find a palatable dish to satisfy my hunger.

Yes...Hokkien Mee.
If you see in the picture an empty plate, you probably might ask why was it empty? Well, it is obvious that it is worth a recommendation.

The noodles are well cooked and the ingredients are generous. Given the price of $4.50 per plate, it is both an acceptable price range and it is delicious.
And again, the reason for the empty plate photo. Sorry about that folks.
Was sceptical at first and didn't bother to take a photo. After that, everything went in the stomach. ðŸ˜‚

Come and try.

Did I mentioned that they provide pork lard? Yes, self service before this place gets popular. LoL.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110180464205420002754/reviews
Alvin K,2,Ordered the larger sized fried kway tiao. Sad to say it was bland at best. Not even close to any decent char kway tiao. More like the kway tiao one would get from a vegetarian or economical bee hoon stall. Didnâ€™t even ask or add any chilli to the dish.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108357367649228137250/reviews
Gerald Tan (gt_yb),4,"This Fried Hokkien Mee is the ""clean"" version. Lightly seasoned with almost no wok hei. But I surprisingly like it, if you are really craving for a plate of hokkien mee, I think this will just about hit the spot. Two things that stood out was the spicy and slightly belacan-y chili and the al dente thick beehoon. Not bad.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105883740903357968477/reviews
