Eventually, I have to make a phone call. The operator does sound too happy to pick up my call.\n\nHowever, after all these, I was very impressed with the pizza. Influence by TV advertisements (Playing nonstop) I ordered the Festive Bonus, 1 regular Rendan Pizza and Curry licious melt, and I loved it. Especially the Curry licious melt, so chessily sedap!",

Sure. Secondly, when my order arrived, the rider looks like he’s in a rush..felt suspicious but let him go..then when I look at my order my garlic bread was missing…Called the outlet but to no avail..Thirdly, the pizza in the middle was warm and the crust was stoned cold…like how can you messed up a pizza?? forget my garlic bread alr then my pizza stone cold..call them also useless..maybe they change their management or something im not sure but after today onwards I think I will start ordering from Pizza Hut at Ghim Moh..and I think the outlet can just remove their telephone..call so many time and still wont answer..I know they have quite a number of staff there because I physically went there to take my food aswell..",

Horrible horrible. Their vegetarian pizza was bad too. The pizza base was equally bad. Forget the pizza, their fries was super dry, under salted, under flavored.  Why pizza hut why? Please don't go anywhere around here, find another place. Run, run, run",
