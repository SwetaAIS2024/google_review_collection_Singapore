Ping Hui Puah,5,"My husband received treatment from Dr. Ng Chin Hin over the last 9 months, during which we consistently experienced his kindness, compassion, and meticulous care. Dr. Ngâ€™s nurses Boon Leong, Sarah and Athena were sincerely caring towards my husband during every treatment session. Daphne and Shikin were friendly and helpful with admin matters. The other 3 haematologists involved in my husband's care: Dr. Lim Zi Yi, Dr. Lee Chun Tsu, and Dr. Joanne Lee, were also very professional and dedicated. Highly recommend this clinic for the consistently positive and supportive experience we received. Thank you to everyone at CFCH.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109829965231126540133/reviews
Eirini Pournaras,5,"Dr. Ng Chin Hin is a very professional, kind and patient haematologist and has been my doctor for over a year now overseeing my conditions. He does not try to oversell or cross-sell medications like a lot of doctors here in Singapore do, and I appreciate his approach to treatment.

Shoutout to Shikin who is the most friendly and attentive medical staff I have encountered in the last 5 years in Singapore. She is excellent at all admin matters, warm hearted and really cares for the patients!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115167866864075686854/reviews
