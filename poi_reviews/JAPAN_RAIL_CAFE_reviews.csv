Kiwi Kaw,5,"1st time visiting Japan Rail Cafe and it was for the Monster Hunter collaboration event.

The Kaisen Avocado Don that I had was very good! Felt it was worth the $18++. People with bigger appetites may find the portion small. It also came with a drink and Monster Hunter collab items.

Atmosphere was good too, as there were Monster Hunter decor throughout the entire place. Can't say for sure when the event is over.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101947121714966843599/reviews
Natalia Shah,3,"Went to the Japan Rail Cafe for the Monster Hunter collab, enjoyed the decor and ambience of the place - cute cozy cafe with outside seating. Very cold aircon though.

The collab menu was $18 for meal and drink which is outrageous considering the portion size was TINY. My partner ordered the Pork Shogayaki don and I ordered the Kaisen don along with the Beauty Tea and Citrus Green tea. Fortunately, the food was tasty and seasoned but $18 for a tiny portion of meat and rice is crazy. The drinks were subpar.

For some reason, fried food would've taken an hour to prepare which was quite disappointing. We dined in at 3pm midday so we had expected to not have any issues because we wanted to try the Chicken Namban don.

The coasters and placemats were cute at least. Coasters were made of good quality and the placemats were just normal printed glossy paper.

Overall, we paid $46 for 2 tiny meals and 2 bland drinks. Moving forward, I will not be going out of my way to return here as there are other Japanese restaurants nearby with better portions.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104076530449469684486/reviews

Riza Yoga,5,"They recently started adding back burgers into their menu, so I decided to check it out.

Chicken Katsu burger was large and juicy, very satisfying to eat! Could use a bit more onion rings, but overall worth the price tag.

The Sakura yakult ice cream shake that came with the meal was also really good, creamy but not too sweet. Will come back to try the other hamburger soon!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105137841087416115958/reviews
Edwin,5,"As a player of the monster hunter series
im very impressed with what Japan Rail Cafe did on the monster hunter wilds collaboration

Food was fantastic,  i ordered the Kaisen Avacado Don

Bunny Dango inspire by Rise was also pleasing to the palettes

BUT i was hoping that they have monster hunter related merchandise on sale...  but too bad they weren't available

I was talking with AFIQ from the cafe on how well they did for the theme,  pleasure chatting with him!

I WILL DEFINITELY come back again if time permits

HAPPY HUNTING!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109915083446683544431/reviews
