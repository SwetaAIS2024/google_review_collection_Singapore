The chill and sweet sauce is nice and the standout was the meat ball and the bean curd stuff with meat.\n\nAuntie was very friendly and called me ah girl. Ask me to come again and give feedback. Double thumbs up.\n\nAh girl will come again if I WFH as the YTF is really good.",

Absolutely incredible. The rice was cooked to perfection – each grain separate and bursting with flavor. And the mutton? Oh my goodness, so tender and succulent, it practically melted in my mouth. You could tell the spices were expertly balanced, creating a rich and deeply satisfying dish. Honestly, this is hands down one of the best Briyani mutton rice I've ever had. If you're looking for a truly tasty and unforgettable meal, look no further!",

Broth could be further improved but not too salty which is good. Not too bad given its $3 and add on bagedil. Portion is generous likewise the shredded chicken.\n\nTake away nasi padang includes their beef rendang, kangkong and thick sliced fried egg plus bagedil for $7. Beef is lean slightly on tough side but well seasoned on rempah. Fried egg portion is thick slice compared to some seen mediocre. Sambal belachan is sedap and am amazed by its spiciness.\n\nOverall not too bad and price point for nasi padang affordable given its location hideout.",
