Restaurant was quite empty compared to Sushi Zanmai and Genki Sushi next door.\n\nStaff were friendly, quiet place for dinner. Food quality is decent, as expected from Crystal Jade.\n\nThey have good mix of Cantonese dim sum, and various Shanghainese and Sichuan cuisine dishes. I highly recommend the egg white conpoy, Sichuan saliva chicken, Sichuan hot and sour soup and the Dan Dan La Mian. Portions feel a bit smaller than usual though, compared to Paradise Dynasty.",

      "text": "Food generally good. Menu was similar to Din Tai Fung. You won’t find the familiar Hong Kong roast meats here. Their signature Dan Dan noodles was essentially noodles in a dilute satay peanut sauce. Didn’t quite work for me, even though I’m a huge fan of satay sauce. 2 dishes that I really liked were the crispy duck and the braised pork. The red bean pancake was very disappointing. Skin was a little hard and not much red bean paste. The place was somewhat noisy. Service was not bad. I will go back just for the crispy duck.",
