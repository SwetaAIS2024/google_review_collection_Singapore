Nur Syazana Md Shariff,5,"I had a fantastic experience at Kuntum & Brew! We tried their creamy Tomyam spaghetti, chicken chop, and spaghetti carbonara ‚Äî and everything was delicious. The Tomyam spaghetti was especially memorable, perfectly balancing creaminess with just the right amount of spicy kick. The chicken chop was juicy and tender, and the carbonara was rich without feeling too heavy.

The caf√© itself has a lovely English-style d√©cor that creates such a cozy and charming atmosphere. On top of that, the staff were incredibly friendly and welcoming, making the whole dining experience even better.

Definitely a spot I‚Äôd love to return to ‚Äî highly recommend!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100698454702016204566/reviews
Amanina Sulaiman,2,"I went here for lunch and overall the experience is not quite good. Last week my friend went here and got roasted potato, today we go here again to try the chicken chop but got wedges instead. The food is good but not consistent.
I ordered Peach lychee tea & my expectation is there will be lychee in it, but noooo!! The price is not worth it with this kind of taste.
The service is terribleee‚Ä¶ we have to wait for 1 hour just for our Ayam Ungkep which should not be that long to arrive. One of my friend who also order ayam ungkep decide to takeaway instead of dine in because its too longgggggg‚Ä¶
Please improve your service, your food and better to put QR scan for menu order so that can improve efficiency.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102172786398857659183/reviews
