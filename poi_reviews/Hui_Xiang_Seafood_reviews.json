Bean sprouts were fat and juicy with generous amount of salted fish. Nam Yu crispy pork was not dry and tasted good.\nDo give this place a try.\n\nNote: Thereâ€™s an opening special of $12 for the steamed pomfret.",

If you are driving, parking could be an issue.\n\nStaff were friendly, order were taken and food were served shortly after. Ordered their signature Nonya steam fish, sauce was great, unfortunately fish turn cold fast. The prawn rolls and stir fried royale chives were equally good as well.\n\nPrice was reasonable and menu is pretty extensive as well. Can consider coming back again.",
