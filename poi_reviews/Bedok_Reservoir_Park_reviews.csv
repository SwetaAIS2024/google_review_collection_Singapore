Meng Fai Yip,4,"The water was soothing indeed!! However, there were not enough trees to provide shade for the path round the reservoir. Do also take note that the path is not paved but laid with sand. I started close to 7:55 am, and took about 85 minutes to walk one full round around the reservoir. This included taking photos along the way and two water breaks in between.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109238839349859158213/reviews
