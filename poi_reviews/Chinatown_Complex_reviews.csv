Navodya Ekanayake,5,"A lot of delicious food stalls for a reasonable price. There's a king ice cream cone, which is super delicious and attracts a lot of foreigners. The vibe is entirely different at night so I suggest visiting it at the daytime and night both. If you don't have time, choose the night time. You can find seafood, dumplings, and a variety of cultural food.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100578310696094020306/reviews
Gopi Bala,4,"Chinatown Complex is a very interesting place to spend time in.

There are some interesting stalls selling clothes and other goods on the first floor.

The second floor houses a rather amazing food centre which has probably around 150 stalls selling food.

There are various kinds of delicious food sold here depending on one's preferred palate, and so it is really hard to make recommendations on what's best to eat.

The only downside of the food centre is that it is cramped up in certain areas and the ambience is rather messy and chaotic.

It is indeed an interesting place to spend a couple of hours shopping and dining.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114775727475904526433/reviews
Why Verify,5,Had lunch here after a day in chinatown Singapore. Unpretentious delicious food at affordable prices for foreigners like myself. Love the idea of food courts/ Hawker Centres - one of the best things about Singapore. This Hawker centre doesn’t accept debit cards. Cash only!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114938021869395551562/reviews
Zoey Low,5,There’s something for everyone at this market and it’s worth exploring all the different sections for the full experience. Tourists often miss other good eats because they only focus on Hawker Chan/dumplings. There’s great kway chap here and even vegetarian options for those looking to go meat-free. This place is best experienced in the daytime/during lunch on the weekends.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103864965911796615142/reviews
