They don‚Äôt even see you nor acknowledge your existence, much less say a word to you.\n\nThe reviews here are accurate.\nAll I wanted was to top up my standard pills before I travel. Easy, would‚Äôve only taken 5 mins.\n\nAfter having no one speak to me still, I turned right around and went to Union Clinic, located right next door, where I experienced professionalism from the staff there.\n\nPlease, no need to copy and paste the same old formal ‚Äúwe will investigate‚Äù reply here. I can see the same reviews have been made about the same issues, dating back from 7 years ago till today.",
