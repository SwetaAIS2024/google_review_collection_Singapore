The charm is in the shopkeeper who doesn‚Äôt really speak English but who has a great smile and follows it up with his thumbs up sign.\n\nWe got teh tarik siu dai. Our ‚Äúless sweet‚Äù orders were still pretty sweet. I think the only way to get ‚Äúsiu Dai‚Äù is to tell him kosong. But all in all, 5 stars cause of the shopkeeper",
