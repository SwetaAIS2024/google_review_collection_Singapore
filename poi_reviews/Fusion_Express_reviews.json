      "text": "I eat here on a consistent weekly basis for the past 3 years, and I can guarantee 3 things:\n\n1) Big/Oversized portions for their protein (Value for money!)\n2) Taste is consistent across all my visits\n3) Waiting time when ordering in person is between 10 to 20 minutes\n\nMy go-to is the Black Pepper Chicken Chop with French Fries and Coleslaw. Black Pepper sauce lacks strong pepper taste, but it is still flavourful. More akin to Brown Sauce than Black Pepper. French Fries are shoestring and seasoned with salt. Coleslaw is too creamy and thick for my liking, sometimes I eat it all up, other times I do not.\n\nI recommend this place only because its one of the few halal options in the area, portions are big and price is affordable.\n\nHowever, I do not recommend the Fried Chicken Cutlet. Ordered it 5-10 times and have always been disappointed with the chicken. Cutlet is fried in a awkward shape and is difficult to slice. Too much breading as well.\n\nOverall, if you like it, lucky you. If you don't like it, too bad :(",

We ordered a cheesy fried fish, although it's still warm and tasted good, the fried batter was soggy by the time I reach home, better to dine in all the fried food.",

It's so good you can even eat it till you're full with leftovers. All-in-all, these for 8+ dollars? Why not give this a shot?\n\n(Better to get this dine in than delivery imo)",

It's a good bang for your buck and suitable for those seeking an affordable Western meal. The menu doesn't stand out in any particular way. Visited during a quieter time on Tuesday, waited about 10-15 mins for the order, no issues. Overall, it's an average Western food spot situated in a coffee shop setting.",
