Riska,3,"I came here by 8am, and there's already a queue to take photos at the famous spot, so I ended up taking from another angle.

I suggest to wear your most light, comfy clothes, cause itâ€™s very humid in here.

Imho there's a lot of spot to take picture, not worth if you have to queue >30mins just to take photos.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116932850400790867046/reviews
Alexandre Le Bris (Les Paresseux Curieux),3,"Such a beautiful place in terms of architecture for photo lovers. it is a very popular spot for social medias pictures, therefore there are a lot of people, have to line up for an hour to get your picture. People are just being people there, mostly disrespectfully and noisy

@paresseuxcurieux for more hidden gems in Singapor. ðŸ’¡",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114786019949309925106/reviews
Michael Wu PhD,5,"popular photospot with long lines of tourist waiting even if you get here at 9am. So you might have to come even earlier, or camp out here. It is a very unique place though. At least you won't be disappointed after waiting for a hour.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105061099394492403376/reviews
Mr & Mrs Rajja,5,"The Fort Canning Tree Tunnel is truly one of Singaporeâ€™s most iconic and picturesque spots!
This underground crossing, featuring a beautiful spiral staircase leading up to a magnificent Yellow Rain Tree, creates a breathtaking frame thatâ€™s perfect for photography. The walls of the tunnel are naturally adorned with lush greenery, making it feel like youâ€™ve stepped into a magical hidden world right in the heart of the city.

If you are planning a visit, I highly recommend going early in the morning, ideally between 7:30 AM and 9:00 AM, to truly enjoy the beauty of this place with minimal crowds.
We arrived around 10:30 AM, and there was already a small queue. By midday, especially on weekends, the area gets much busier, and you might have to wait quite a while for your turn to take photos at the popular spiral spot.

Weekends tend to be more crowded with both tourists and locals, so if possible, try visiting on a weekday for a more relaxed experience.

The Fort Canning MRT station is located conveniently nearby, making access very easy and hassle-free.

Overall, itâ€™s absolutely worth the visit â€” whether youâ€™re a professional photographer, a travel enthusiast, or someone simply looking to capture a magical memory.
Just be patient, plan ahead, and youâ€™ll walk away with some truly unforgettable shots!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107685768793518937435/reviews
Shirin Montebare,5,"Such an amazing spot to get Instagram-worthy photos. There is always a line, which usually takes about an hour because many Chinese tourists come in groups and tend to take lots of photos, which can be a bit annoying. So, be ready for that. Otherwise, itâ€™s a super lovely place.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102580939645164539419/reviews
