They only take cash and ask you to keep deposit as well  which means if you are planning paynow, PayLah! or paywave or ang credit card service forget it, there is no atm nearby so better to keep cash before you go there. There are some lockers and most we saw regulars coming be practicing, there is room for improvement but I feel it’s pretty much you get what you pay.",
