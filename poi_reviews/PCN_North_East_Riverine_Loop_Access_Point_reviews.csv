N. WONG,5,"I will say this is “5-star bicycle route” in Asia. You can ride from city to countryside with excellent view!  And most are flat road with easy level!

I recommend you can download SG bike mobile app before you come here, open an account and buy a day pass!
The benefit of using bike app is you can control your biking time, and stop anytime!! Just remember to park the bike at SG government specific parking area unless the penalty will be charged!

Please check the official website of “North Eastern Riverine loop” for more information!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108290688664498591201/reviews
Athena M,4,Seems like a popular place to jog and cycle. It was quite crowded when I went at 8am on a Friday morning and many were moving at a fast pace. I wouldn’t come here if I was just walking. There are no rest areas along the side. Canal water is not clean but the scenery still looks pretty.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103232186648182903163/reviews
Dr Reviews,3,"This route starts from Lor Buang Kok. The PCN though goes all the way past Punggol Waterway.

The route is  crowded during the peak exercise hours and can be hazardous  ⚠️⚠️⚠️ due to the speeding cyclists and PMD riders. A couple of Google reviewers seem to share my feeling regarding the inconsiderate cyclists and PMD riders.  I really wish something could be done to make this little lung space safe for Pedestrians.

The route  from Sengkang West Ave to Yio Chu Kang road offers a rare glimpse of the last remaining Kampung on the mainland.  In addition one gets to see landed property with owners growing banana & papaya trees amongst others. A lovely rustic sight.

The waters though did not look clean and seemed to have natural litter in them.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112747621045786494145/reviews
Den,3,15km to complete the loop. The views on some parts are relaxing. It gets crowded though along the PCNs due to more cyclist.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117073766112883323123/reviews
