Will,4,"Bright and fairly new hawker center. High and airy ceiling. Tables cleaned. Taps to let u clean ur hand. Brings more options besides Pioneer mall's koufu and macD.

Lots of choices, Yukee duck, HKM, western food. Yet to try all.

Emily Ho,5,"Clean, bright and spacious hawker centre, with lower seats for kids. There are sinks at various points of the hawker centre which makes it convenient for washing hands.

Fat cat grilled fish was good, especially the mala flavour. Sheng jian bao and dumplings were delicious and affordable. The fen guo was chewy with lots of ingredients, truly a balanced meal. Braised beef noodles was good too! As for the FHM, I spotted some moldy yellow noodles :(",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106638367480970822498/reviews

Angel Tan,4,"On my quest for herbal Bak Kut Teh, found this stall at Jurong West Hawker Centre, serving a dark broth along with off-the-bone pork ribs, beancurd skin etc in a claypot! To balance the meal, we had a plate of Iceberg lettuce drizzled with oyster/sesame sauce (tasted like a mix of both).

Ended off with Strawberry lemon tea, which was fruity & full of strawberry pulp, even came with a cute otter cup sleeve!

Ben Teo,3,"2 story non Aircon food court. Very spacious and ventilation is good.
Quite a number of variety of food available and not much of a queue or crowd on weekday lunch.

Food wise is average with the western food and curry rice slightly better.

A typical meal is around $5, abit more pricey than the usual coffee shop.
Parking lots are very limited.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113516373342190358380/reviews
