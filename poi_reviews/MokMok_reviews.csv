KAMMY TAN,5,Good place 30 mins away from jb customs. I liked the food - chilli crab pasta was savoury n sweet some may find it to jelak and honestly I think 2 ppl can share the pasta. Mushroom soup was nice if thereâ€™s smtg I would order again is the soup and that yellow drink smoothie mango whatever the name is with the sprinkles ontop. Wouldnâ€™t get the lychee rose lime taste like does plum asam candy  ur if you like that taste then go ahead. Overall great taste and value nice cafe located near eco botanical a lot of food shops around.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102768260245042464875/reviews
Ina Amyza,5,"this is the cafe that makes me feel of coming back and recommending to others,, one of the best pumpkin soups ive tried so far as it riches in flavour and consistency. they were out of breads atm and we were given a discount for that haha.

chicken curry katsu is fulfilling, the curry finished before we even realised and the egg was nicely cooked.

their signature- souffle is okay, not as airy as others but such a great idea to serve along w the flakes & muesli. (the cream is a bit sweet imo)

the drinks are full bodied! this cafe conveys how matcha should taste & be strong like.

staffs are so welcoming & helpful and would always refill your drinking water without u having to ask. overall i love this cafe!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108099091464159045862/reviews

Beng Fai Mak,5,"This restaurant is located a short distance from the 2nd link. Good place for stopover before returning to Singapore.

Classic Italian and Japanese style dishes and value for money",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106314344411529300332/reviews
Aphad Fadhli Y,3,"ðŸ¤•I believe thereâ€™s a design flaw with the stone pebble flooring, especially near the tables along the window area in front of the bar. This poses a safety concern. I almost tripped while walking to our table, and unfortunately, on our way out, my pregnant wife fell on her knees while navigating through the crowd in front of the counter. If the staff had informed us to be cautious in this area, it might have prevented her fall. She is currently recovering from the incident, and I hope nothing serious happens. ðŸ˜¢

On a positive note, the food was good. I ordered the Chili Softshell Crab Pasta, and the combination of spices and umami blended well with the texture of the pasta. My wife had the Salmon Mentaiko Don and Truffle Foie Gras Chawamushi.

Overall, the service was prompt, and the food was enjoyable. However, due to this incident, we are hesitant about returning.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105960682941845186307/reviews
