aglio olio,5,This place deserves 5 stars. The response from the customer service team was very prompt and they went above and beyond to get me my test results really quickly. Dr Tan is also very kind and non judgmental. He spent very long listening and addressing my concerns and truly went beyond the extra mile. Bedside manners are commendable. Highly recommend Dr Tan.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105769733282830883717/reviews

moo deisshiks,5,Doctor was very patient in listening to your worries. Clinic has a triage hotline who will allow you to ask queries before going down to the clinic. This gives patients a lot of assurance and more confidence. Thank you for the great healthcare coverage!,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105293658074480684192/reviews
