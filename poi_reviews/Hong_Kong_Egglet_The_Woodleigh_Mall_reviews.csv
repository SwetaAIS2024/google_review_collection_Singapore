nat reviews,3,"Normal service and atmosphere for a takeaway food stall, so 4/5.

Food: 3/5
The batter needs to be improved. I got my waffle fresh so it was probably a good sample to judge. I liked that the exterior was crispy, but the insides were hard too. Because of that reason, the waffle felt kind of dry. Taste wise, was pretty standard - vanilla scented and not too sweet.

I will not be back.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105973186058375958042/reviews
Fairy,5,"Very delicious peanut butter waffle. The waffle was hot and tasted of eggs.

The egglets are also very tasty and warm.

They are crispy outside and soft inside.

True Hong Kong style.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110707374703256523409/reviews
Katherine Happiest,4,"Durian waffle! A premium item on the menu

It didn‚Äôt disappoint. Durian was delicious
Waffle was nice and fluffy

Generally happy

It‚Äôs a kiosk, so no where to sit",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103056298337699105255/reviews
Doreen Luah,3,"Ordered a few times from this stall but its quality is quite inconsistent cause sometimes it‚Äôs good and sometimes it‚Äôs bad.

If it‚Äôs good meaning the texture is just nice and taste standard.

If it‚Äôs not good meaning the texture is so tough to chew and taste bland or bitter.

I can say that this stall always prepare egglets in advance that their egglets are not served hot. I will only buy if I have craving for HK Egglet otherwise it won‚Äôt attract me at all.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115013917741354521755/reviews
God's Amazing Grace,3,"First time the chocolate waffle was really üëç
But now a different female took over the stall and the choc waffles turned out to be so lousy. Not firm!

Won't be patronizing again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110193993289607517210/reviews
