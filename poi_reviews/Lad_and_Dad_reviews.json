One of the most authentic chippies I've been to this side of the UK, and I was happy to see mushy peas actually on the menu and malt vinegar on the condiments.\n\nSpecial mention to the fish batter, which is light and crispy enough that one minute you'll be admiring it and the next you'll be wondering where it went and why your arteries are dying of happiness. Order this on an empty stomach as the portions are fairly generous too.",

The batter is fragrant yet doesnâ€™t overpower the natural sweetness of the seafood. It's truly delicious.\nThe decor is minimal, and the environment is simple, yet very clean, spacious, and comfortable. Sitting outside in the evening, watching the storefront, the scenery, the passing people and vehicles is a perfect way to unwind.",

Iâ€™ll give it 7/10\n\nThe fish and chips haddock fillet is 10/10 , I prefer the original fries with double Tartar sauce (you can choose from 4 side sauces) .\n\nScotch egg was 9/10, very nice side dish with purple cabbage slaw at the bottom which was very complimentary to the taste.\n\nOnion rings were perfect ! 10/10 . We finished it very quickly in no time\n\nFor drinks we recommend the Earl Grey Ice tea 10/10\n\nThere is a 15% discount with grab dine in while stocks last.",
