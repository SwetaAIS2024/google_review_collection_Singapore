kevin ong,5,"I'm writing to commend on the exceptional service of a Ms Yvonne from STA Sin Ming (the branch that I'd called to enquire about the OBU installation). I'd earlier called LTA, out of exasperation after several failed attempts to secure an appointment from the LTA approved list of workshops. They'd all cited that they do not do installations for Jaguars. The very well spoken and extremely cordial and professional gentleman from LTA, Mr Ryan, then kindly referred me to STA for their assistance. Initially a very helpful Ms Ah Ling assisted with my enquiry. She had to check in with her colleague/s before ascertaining if STA can do the Installation given the make and model of my car. Shortly after, Ms Yvonne called and assured me of an alternative workshop. Her communication with me was exceptional throughout. I was thoroughly impressed with her level of professionalism and customer first persona. Definitely world class... and we certainly need to have more Yvonnes in our service industries right here right now in Singapore. Kudos to her.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100220272474499251127/reviews
SoonTeong Yeoh,3,"The inspection itself was fine. Smooth payment, inspection and car collection. They could place better signage at the entrance leading to the inspection lanes. There was a bit of confusion there. All said, this is an exercise for nothing. A perfectly good car, less than 10 years old, just going through the motions of inspection. More suitable for cars above 10 years. Price was also pretty steep for such an easy process. Would have been fairer if they charge $30 instead of $76.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117631989121500325190/reviews
Kahar Rahim,1,"5 stars for staff and technicians doing inspection üëç
Would have given 5 stars for overall experience but because of 1 guy who did the pasting of decal who was so lazy and not bothered to do a good job .
He pasted the decal not aligned to the sides and with air bubbles which he said it's ok!
Told him to do the rear properly but seems like he was in a rush n did the same without measuring the sides.  If I am not mistaken there is a certain measurement from the top and sides to be followed but this guy seems like in a hell of a rush. I would estimate he did both in under 3 mins!!
Wish that he had more passion in his work.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108283585189333711971/reviews

SG lee,5,"I would like to thank the counterstaffs who have helped me to seamlessly get my car for inspection and conversion to Private Hire Vehicle.

Thank you so much for their friendliness and politeness. And also the guys outside doing the inspection. Fuss free. Thank you for the pleasant experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107463051858005611332/reviews
