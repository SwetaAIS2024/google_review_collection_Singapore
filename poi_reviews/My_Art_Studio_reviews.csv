Laura Foo,5,"Dora and Naomi love the holiday workshops at My Art Studio. There is a good variety of workshops and both of them are able to understand the description in the brochure and choose the workshops they are interested in. During the workshop, they also enjoy the process of creating their own masterpiece and have joy in explaining how they crafted the items. Thank you for organizing new workshops every holiday!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118434123047333941268/reviews
Clari T,5,"Had fun last year with my friend so back for a second workshop! Teacher Husna and Teacher Mala are both very patient and kindly walked us through each step and gave us lots of tips - really liked how they encourage us to find our own style.
Left with a beautiful piece of artwork Iâ€™m really proud ofðŸ’•

Perfect for anyone who like to try something new and creative!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112760692292006466125/reviews

Sid Ha,5,"I took a clay lesson there before. Teacher Husna was very friendly and patient when conducting her lesson. She makes sure my masterpiece was done up nicely as she helped with touching it up to make it look so much nicer. Because of her, I want to take up more lessons, so I'm looking forward to more affordable short lessons if there are in the future :)",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117617160222891116265/reviews
