They are also well known for their chicken and chicken rice.\n\nThey also do reunion and new year dinners, with great varieties in their sets each year, catered for 6 and 10 people.\n\nWould recommend if you are in the area for a family dinner or just grabbing a quick bite. While not cream of the crop, their food has never failed to disappoint. 8/10~",

The service was great and very accommodating for a large group spread across two tables. Every dish that we shared was delicious and the beer paired well with all the dishes. Highly recommend!",
