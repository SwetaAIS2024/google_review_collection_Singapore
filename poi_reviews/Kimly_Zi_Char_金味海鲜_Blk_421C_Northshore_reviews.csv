LP Pua,1,"Attracted by the $18 promotion for the Assam Fish Head, we decided to try it. We also ordered 2 bowls of rice and a plate of French Beans. After seeing the miserable portion of the $8 French Beans, we wondered if it would be more economical to order a similar plate of French Beans from the Cai-Fan stall beside it. The rice and French beans were served quickly but the fish head did not come until a good 15 minutes later (and this was after we had to go to the counter to intercept the fish head because they were serving to customers who had ordered later than us). By then, the rice and French beans were cold. The rice was lumpy and impossible to eat without pouring the assam over it. And the fish was not hot. We had to soak it in the Assam sauce, the only hot food on the table by then, to warm it. Overall, we did not enjoy the meal.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews

Xandra Lim,3,"Craving for Hokkien mee that cooked with cripsy fried pork belly.  $4.50 portion just good enough for me (girl). Food serve very fast, as i come for very early dinner at 5.30pm.

Pang Pang,1,"I used to enjoy eating from the outlet but after they changed all the staff, the food standard really drop to minus zero.
The fried rice is like plain rice. The horfan is all lumped up and the prawn is not fresh, the sauce cant even see if they put egg in or not. the service staff is also not friendly. I will not bother going again.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106784460426219560208/reviews
