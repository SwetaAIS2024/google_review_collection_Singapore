      "text": "Really nice camping site. We hired a van to reach there with our stuff. Van costs SGD 20 per one way. There‚Äôs no signal to phones so it is better to confirm your next day morning pickup too.\nYou can find plenty of dead woods for fire while roaming around before getting too dark.The view here is really great with sunset. No monkeys seen after 6pm but they came next day early morning.\nSo avoid showing them plastic bags and smelling food items.\nThere are cement tables,  sitting areas and logs around fire place to sit.\nSome mosquitoes and Ants  came around our huts.\nSo use insect repellent. Carry mosquito coils with you.\nThere‚Äôs no drinking water. So make 100% sure to bring drinking water with you.\nWashroom is not very well clean. But can be managed.\nWe brought toilet clean product and toilet brush with us to clean by ourselves before use. üòÉ\nIf you are lucky can see a 360 view of sky with stars ‚≠êÔ∏è.\nWe celebrated a birthday there. So it was magical.",
