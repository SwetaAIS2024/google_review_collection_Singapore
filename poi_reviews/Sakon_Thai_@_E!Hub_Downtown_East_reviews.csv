KOMBUCHAR,5,"Surprised that the Thai food here is so authentic even though I had walked pass this restaurant many times. It's the first time I tried it and really a hidden gem.
We ordered their Tom Yum fried rice and Tom Yam seafood noodles. The Fried rice smell of wok hei and it tastes as good as it looks. The Tom yum noodles soup was thick and sour and spicy just the type you get in Thailand. Perfect broth and my friend say it's definitely not the instant type! Even best is that it's halal which you can meet your friends who need to go to halal restaurant here!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107220740275487744474/reviews
Jan Ng,5,"Brought the family over for a meal where we each had a set meal that comes with a main + a drink.
There was a promotion ongoing when we went, and we have gotten their Crispy Fried Chicken for free. Who couldn't resist it!

Delicious meal with friendly staffs attending to us.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116886363669696960176/reviews

Emily Lim,5,"We ordered  4 main, 4 drinks and 3 side dish to - share!
- Tom Yum Noodle soup (red) : It's tangy and spicy! Super shiok! The prawn are huge, fish are fresh and the noodles are pad thai noodle!
The portion are huge too! Perfect for a cold weather!!
- Pineapple fried rice: Pineapple and rasin are super sweet! The chicken floss add on another dimension to the rice!!
- Salted egg fried rice: the salted egg taste is just nice, not too empowering, I can taste the creamy egg and well coated on the rice.
- Fried beef kway teow: this dish taste exactly like the Chinese char kway teow but with beef! Beef is tender and the noodles are just nice! Sweet and savory combined as one!
- Prawn egg omelette: classic dish that will not go wrong!
- Fried crab cake: Classic dish! I love the sweet and sour sauce! Super shiok and can't stop!
- Stir fry mix vegetable: another dish that will not go wrong! Cabbage is üòã!!
- Milk tea (green/red) : a bit sweet but definitely less sweet than those in Thailand ! Perfect to end the meal with the drink! Shiok!!
Shout out to the staff, they are kind of understaff and keep apologing to us, but the food was served pretty fast and hot!!! The staff are really polite and sweet!!! Kudos to them!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114150605317016699887/reviews
Rennie Lee,5,"They offer weekday lunch sets at $10.50-$11.90, which comes with selected mains with rice, plus a drink! Super value for money! Here‚Äôs what we tried from the $10.50 menu~

üçõ Thai Basil Chicken with Rice - Super fragrant and had the right amount of spiciness. It didn‚Äôt have any of those fatty bits you can‚Äôt bite though!
üçõ Honey Chicken with Rice - Sweet, yummy and addictive! Non-spicy. Went well with my rice!
üçõ Turmeric Chicken with Rice - An aromatic dish~ I forgot to ask for this less spicy, but recommend to do so!

ü•§ Thai Iced Milk Tea - Yummy and not too sweet!
ü•§ Thai Iced Milk Green Tea - Nice jasmine aroma, not too sweet either!
ü•§ Hot Lemongrass Tea - Fragrant and goes well with Thai food~

üç≤ Red Tomyum Soup, Seafood ($10.90, ala carte) - Ordered this less spicy. It went so well with rice. Couldn‚Äôt stop drinking. Good amount of ingredients too!

Overall, we enjoyed the food and will definitely return! The taste and portions are really good~",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104896149882118051128/reviews
