      "text": "Had the $18 Chicken Claypot Rice and was pleasantly surprised. The rice was fragrant with a nice smoky char at the base, and it came generously topped with tender chicken chunks, flavourful lupcheong and yuencheong. I loved the addition of crispy pork lard which added an extra layer of texture. The portion was hearty and definitely great for sharing among 3 pax.\n\nWe also ordered the pork omelette and potato leaves and both were delicious & ‰∏ãÈ•≠!\n\nThe service uncles were friendly and welcoming, and the rest of the staff were equally helpful.\n\nDefinitely a value for money claypot rice cooked with love and patience. IMO, it‚Äôs one of the best authentic claypot rice spots in SG!",

      "text": "Wanted claypot rice and we loved the food when ate it before their move here. Called to pre-book the claypot rice as it usually takes 20 minutes to cook. When we arrived, there were a couple of empty tables. The claypot rice came 10 minutes later. The server mixed the rice for us.\nFirst taste of the rice confirms that the standard has been kept. The boneless chicken pieces were tender, juicy and flavourful. The rice was properly cooked. Crispy pork lard was added into the pot of rice for extra flavour. This claypot rise is at least one level above the rest. The only thing is that it doesn't have much vegetables.\nThe stall also serve zhi char dishes.\nService is friendly and efficient.",

      "text": "2nd time trying their claypot rice. Standard of food pretty consistent.\n\nOrder a mid size for 3 ppl. Would say not big, can fill about 5 bowl of rice.\n\nIngredients is really a lot for $18. Many chicken given and they are very tender and well marinated. I added extra lapchong ($3) which is pretty decent. It gives the rice more favour. Too little salted fish. Can‚Äôt taste much. One very interesting thing about this claypot rice is they add in pork lard, which is very crispy and gives the rice another favour which is unique. üëç but can gets a bit overkill if too much.\n\nHomemade claypot toufu is too eggy for my likeing. They replace roast meat with slice meat. Which tones down the favour.\nDecent taste.\n\nPrawn roll is very nice. Highly recommended to order. But would hope to have more prawn than meat haha. But still very nice.\n\nSweet sour pork is more lean type. Sauce is just nice. Not too sweet.\nBut would be better if it‚Äôs more crispy.",
