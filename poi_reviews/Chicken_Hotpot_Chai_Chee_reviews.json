Kids who were trying this for first time could not get used to the taste. Do not like the type of Fish they use inside 酸菜汤 (feels like tasteless fish fillets) but overall good value of money.",

Choose from three levels of spiciness and add as many fresh vegetables and additional meats as you wish. And keep eating, the more you eat, the more flavourful the experience.\n\nWe choose the SMALL spicy.\n\nThis has to be one of the best tasting hotpot for me!\nThe soup is flavourful and you will never get enough with the numerous top up of the soup!\nThe soup goes so well with rice!\nYou can even finish a bowl of rice just with the soup!\n\nWe can also order ingredients to go with the Chicken Pot.\nWe ordered some quail eggs, spinach, enoki mushrooms.\n\nFISH IN A POT 酸菜鱼\n☆☆☆☆☆\n\nCatch of the day (Snapper or Grouper) specially marinated and cut into fillet strips. Served in a simmered broth of preserved picked vegetables.\n\nGenerous servings of fish slices and the soup is as equally flavourful too!\n\nOverall 4.8 / 5\n\n3 to 3.5 - save the calories cos bo ho jiak\nto 4 - can try if no queue cos ay sai lah\n4 to 4.5 - highly recommended cos ho jiak\n4.6 to 5 - Must Try cos jin ho jiak!

As many reviews pointed out, the portion of the ingredients e.g. chicken meat (quite bony) or prawns (4 pcs) are a bit less than desired - both small pots. They do have their regular customers I guess since they have survived here for many years. Service wise is very good.",

Ingredient is sufficient and shop is generous and prompt in topping up soup for both.\n\nTip#1: order one pot to share since unlimited soup top up. Then order ala cart ingredients to add on to the pot.\n\nTip#2: look out for discounts/ vouchers such as on eatigo platform. The shop also offers a couple set for $38 which is quite value.",

First time tried their fish hotpot, taste good too with salted Vege soup. Drink wise: Fruit punch juice and add on Korean yuzu sofa, both are refreshing for me.\n\nFriendly staff attention to our request. Overall good dining experience.\n\nThe next visit maybe should try 1 medium hotpot with add on Vege for two pax.",
