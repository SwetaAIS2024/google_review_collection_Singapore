Megaworld Asia,5,"For a more enjoyable sightseeing experience, take the Jering Boardwalk which runs around the edge of the MacRitchie Reservoir. Note: The distance from the junction to the amenities centre is approximately 4 km. At regular interval along the Jering Boardwalk there are information placards about the vegetation and wildlife one can expect to see along the way. Look closely in the shallow areas of the reservoir (near the seated rest stops) as there’s a high probability of seeing turtles. The Jering Boardwalk, although quite long, is an easy and relaxing hike due to the nearness of the waterway. The trail eventually leads to the final sightseeing attractions, just a few hundred meters from the amenities centre.

Safe travels,
