      "text": "My desktop computer stopped booting up and due to various complications, I had a tough time solving the issue. Before even coming to have a look at my desktop computer, S-team gave me a bunch of tips to try to see if any of them would help identify or resolve my issue. Although none of these helped solve the computer issues,  I was very grateful for the help.\n\nNick who came to help me was very knowledgeable and entertained my many questions on computer repairs and on what he was doing to help solve the problem of my computer not working. It was a fairly complicated procedure that ended up taking 2 hours and I definitely appreciated his approach to try the simplest paths to try and retain the information before we finally had to resort to a fairly drastic option. He stayed to help reinstall drivers and update the computer and ensure everything was running and all the information was still accessible and even helped resolve a few other unrelated issues.\n\nI definitely recommend S-Mall and Nick for all computer related problems!",
