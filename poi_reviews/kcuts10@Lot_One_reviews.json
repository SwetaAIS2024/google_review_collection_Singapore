Had to get a haircut urgently before flying off and decided give Kcut a try as it is conveniently located at a mall near me. May Chua was friendly, techniques were superb and recommended me hairstyles that would suit me and gave me a really good overall first experience. Extremely worth the value as well. Would be back to patronize again!",
