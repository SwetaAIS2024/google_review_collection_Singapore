      "text": "I ordered delivery and ate so fast i forgot to take photos.  The braised pork curry rice which comes with fried cabbage looked underwhelming and perhaps on the dry side but the first mouthful was a delight.  The pork and the skin was wonderfully tender and flavourful.  The fat melted into the rice as I chewed and the curry gravy (just thick enough to coat without being too gloopy) added just enough spice to complement the pork.  Cabbage gave a slightly crunchy texture and a burst of sweetness.  I normally can't finish a single portion of pork belly curry rice but this one disappeared real fast.  Don't order if you are trying to manage your carbo intake.  Seriously delicious.",

The thick and flavourful taste of curry was slightly sinful but worth it!\n\nThe pork belly, woah, now look at the beautiful pork fat and meat, that delicious and succulent layering, those few pieces like not enough leh. More!\n\nThe fried egg was also another tasty one, the light, fluffy and crunchy eggs. Also not enough, so good!\n\nThe little hack here I suppose, they don't have chili to go with it. But the stall beside it, the one that sells wanton mee, they belong to the same boss. Take some of it and eat it with this curry rice! With the added kick of spice, even better taste!\n\n‚ú® Ambience wise: Great! Nicely decorated food court!\n\nü§µüèª Service wise: Great!\n\nüíµ Price wise:\r$5.20!",
