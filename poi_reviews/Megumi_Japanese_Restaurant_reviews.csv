Sera // IG: diningwithsera,4,"Had their sushis, steak and chawanmushi which were pretty satisfying. Sushis were fresh and steak was on the chewier side.

Service was a little slow, with an item being missed out, but the servers were quite friendly, which made up for the entire experience.

Overall would recommend if around the area :)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118301436723641326928/reviews
TB Ng,1,"Waited 45 mins for hotpot dishes that didn’t even needed to be cooked. I understand that the restaurant may not have enough kitchen staff but what the manager should have done then is to not accept reservations past a certain number. Their staff were over whelmed and it wasn’t even 100% occupied. Some tables cancelled part of their orders and left.  The 2 waitresses were trying their best but unfortunately, they had to deal with the situation.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110625332919769334294/reviews
Pixie Xian,4,"Teppayaki Beef, sushi and garlic rice are yummy. Sadly no salmon belly when we were there. We ordered a spicy noodle level one thinking it will be mild spicy but it turns out to be very spicy even at level 1; the noodle is soaked with the spiciness.

Ambience is great and price is good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116934440905721156319/reviews
Aashmika Varma,4,"Tried Soba noodles and tempura for the first time and found it quite bland even after adding some soy sauce and a bit of the other condiments.
Nonetheless, the tempura was quite crisp and I liked the Avocado Maki as it’s not often to find vegetarian sushi anywhere! :P",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104152931382854540911/reviews
Qing Jie,5,"Came here on a rainy Friday afternoon for lunch. The lunch sets are amazing value for value. Sashimi is thick and fresh, and portions are very generous. See photos attached
Friendly crew and very good service

Will definitely come again to try other items on the menu",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101570785514830341582/reviews
