Always love the service here, staff knows exactly what I want just from my face.\n\nWeekends seem to have only one staff in this outlet, so queue can sometimes be long during peak period. But staff was friendly and always get my order right.\n\nKudos to the service staff here - ain‚Äôt an easy job standing for so many hours. But they keep my eyes open with the great service and my daily caffeine. üôÇüëç",

And price isn't exactly cheap too.\n\nTried their Teh C Ice, hmm... average tasting, kinda diluted and not because the ice had melted.\n\nThere are better coffee/tea shops in and around SG.\n\nOutlet is located at level 1, facing the road.",

What‚Äôs the point of putting lime in the drink without squeezing it first? Am I supposed to fish it out from under the ice? It goes to say the drink is just a salty sugar concoction without much citrus taste. I had better ones from novena outlet.",

      "text": "‚ÄúI used to love coming to this tea hut, but today left me feeling incredibly disappointed. I ran all the way there, excited to get my usual coffee, only to find the shop closed far earlier than usual. This isn‚Äôt the first time it‚Äôs happened, and it‚Äôs becoming seriously frustrating. The sign said they‚Äôd be back at 12 PM, but I arrived at 10:46 AM‚Äîwell before noon‚Äîand it was already shut down. I can‚Äôt rely on this place if they‚Äôre going to keep closing without warning. Hopefully, they‚Äôll start sticking to their posted hours so customers like me aren‚Äôt left disappointed. But until then, I can‚Äôt recommend it.‚Äù",
