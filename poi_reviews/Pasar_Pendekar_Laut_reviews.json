      "text": "Fresh fresh seafood. They only sell seafood that's caught in the day itself by fishermen on small boats.\n\nSo, expect :\n1. Super fresh seafood\n2. Market price\n3. Excellent service but please be patient.\n4. Live flower crabs that are actually with flesh!\n5. Sometimes, expect to wait coz fishermen doesn't really follow a strict schedule as to when they come back. Although most of them b should be back by 10am or so.\n6. Buy seafood and have them cook for you at the warung for a fee.\n7. Quaint environment - its on a floating wooden pontoon by the rover and its mangroves!!\n\nBut don't expect:\n\n1. As many variety, as seen in normal market (they only take in catch of that day so, depends on fishermen's luck on that day)\n\n2. Immediate service as its usually pretty busy but they'll get to you.\n\n3. The same kind of seafood your purchased yesterday may not be available today.\n\nTotally recommended!",
