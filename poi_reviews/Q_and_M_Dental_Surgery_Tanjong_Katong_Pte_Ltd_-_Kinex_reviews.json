During my visit, I was particularly impressed by Dr. Kenneth's thoroughness in explaining each step of the procedure, which greatly alleviated my anxiety. His compassionate approach made me feel at ease throughout the entire process.\n\nNurse Shan was an absolute gem! She could tell I was a bit anxious, especially since it was my first time getting an injection. She gave me reassuring pats on my shoulders and hands, which really helped calm my nerves.\n\nGiving Dr. Kenneth and Nurse Shan two thumbs up for their exceptional care and kindness.
