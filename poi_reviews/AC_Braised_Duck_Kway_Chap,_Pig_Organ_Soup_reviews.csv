EQ Xavier,4,"Arrive early to avoid the queue because the stall owners really put in a lot of effort to prepare everything properly. The small intestines are clean, no strong smell or taste quite shiok actually. The broth is slightly dark with a nice savoury kick, and the duck is solid and goes super well with the kway chap. Prices still quite
reasonable, nothing to complain. Got plenty of parking just beside the coffeeshop, so very convenient. But seating really very limited, so better come early if you don‚Äôt want to wait long.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105533019712721928126/reviews
Yang,4,"Enjoyed a comforting Kway Chap ($5.70) featuring silky rice sheets in a herby, savoury dark soup with braised pork belly, intestine, beancurd, and a boiled egg.

The pork belly was tender, though slightly porky, and the intestine was well-cleaned with no smell. The braised items had a balanced flavour, not too sweet or salty. Generous kway portion, with fragrant garlic oil enhancing the dish. Still as delicious as remembered!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103078870952547064508/reviews
William Tan,5,"In an unassuming estate, this braised duck rice and kway chap stall really shines!
First and foremost, the yam flavoured rice is one of the best found as stall is generous with a balance chunks of yam with rice. üëç
Had duck, intestine, liver! The duck has the right texture, the intestine is well prepared without stripping away the taste intestine has.
Soup is flavourful to fill with the right hint of herbs and soy making it a wonderful side!
Chilli offering has an array and it compliment the food nicely.
Sat together with another customer eating Kway Chap and notice that the Kway is well prepared and affirm on its springiness. üëçüëç

Belle Oh,4,"Usually their intestines have no smell but today there is a bit. Otherwise, their Kway Chap is pretty good comparatively. Bought their duck home for dinner as well. Worth trying if you haven't.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111480789657010313446/reviews
