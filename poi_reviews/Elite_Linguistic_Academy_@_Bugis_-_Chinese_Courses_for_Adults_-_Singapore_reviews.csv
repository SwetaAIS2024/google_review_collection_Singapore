ujwal kumar Vellore,5,"I had a wonderful experience with Marina Laoshi during my Term 1 Chinese classes. As a non-native speaker, mastering pronunciation and tones was particularly challenging for me, but Marina Laoshi was exceptionally patient and dedicated. She ensured that we grasped the basics thoroughly, creating a supportive environment that greatly enhanced our learning process. We got to show off our rudimentary mandarin while ordering food during our term end class dinner.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101052932545210596905/reviews

Tetra Helix,5,Learning Mandarin with Elite Linguistic has honestly been much easier than my experience in school. The classes aren't just about reading a passage in the given textbook and as the classes aren't as packed the teachers can help students on a more personal level. From my experiences with 老师 Cruyff and Weina I can proudly say that my mandarin skills have noticeably improved.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102232211018896391914/reviews
