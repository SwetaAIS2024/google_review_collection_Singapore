Charged me $382 and when I demanded a refund, charged another $785 to my account. The second charge was eventually refunded after I lodged a Police complaint but still waiting for the first one.\nThe owner even sent me the CCTV video showing his manager distracting me by trying to kiss me so that I wouldn't see the amount being charged.\nStay away if you don't want to be robbed.",

      "text": "Avoid this place as there are only people at the bar who want to start a fight if you don’t bet over a game of pool. Even the owner is supportive of these kind of rowdy people at the bar only because they are regulars.\n\nSorry to say but the owner is explaining us that since you are in the country with a work pass it’s not worth it for you to get into a fight. First of all we never came to the place to fight but to have a good time and play a game of pool. Rather than explaining us, Instead they should look at the CCTV’s and see who is at fault and speak to the person aggravating a fight and have them out of the bar. I assume it is common at the bar with new people coming there to play a game of pool.\n\nWe definitely made a mistake of visiting this place and I would warn the others to be mindful to go to this bar. To be honest it is not worth a visit and there are many other places in the vicinity which you can go to.",
