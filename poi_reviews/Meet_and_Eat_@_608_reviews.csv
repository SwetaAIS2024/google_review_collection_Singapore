Kelvin Chye,5,"A newly opened kopitiam that took over the space vacated by the previous Mr Teh Tarik kopitiam. And I would say a big improvement from the previous operator, with newly renovated spaces, tables and chairs. It's brighter and better ventilated. The food stall mix is quite good as well, catering to different taste buds and preferences.
Personally I would recommend everyone to check out the nasi lemak stall, porridge stall and the vegetarian stall. Nice place for a meal if you stay near, with lots of parking available behind.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117999709976505884094/reviews
Yi Ling,3,"Fairly new coffee shop, and there are many stalls here that hearsay are popular franchise.

We had their Tzechar at a stall called 海鲜小厨 ""Seafood Kitchen"" for dinner.

Service is rather quick, and Asam Fish is pretty good, but lack of gravy. The tofu with minced meat, as well as Cai Po egg, is delicious and flavourful too. The others are pretty mediocre dishes that are not worthy of mention.

Would come back to this coffee shop to try other stalls next time. Western stall looks good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115707001285123682601/reviews

Stella Soon,5,"Had lunch there on a Sunday around 1.15pm. Not too crowded. Spacious and clean. Good selection of food. Love the Western food stall variety! My family tried the western food (truffle ham and mushroom baked rice), signature porridge, fish soup, and nasi lemak. Food is good and quite large portion. My teh o peng came in a huge cup! No wonder charge me $2.10. Would have preferred a smaller cup and cheaper as I couldn't finish it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110320888176328545673/reviews
