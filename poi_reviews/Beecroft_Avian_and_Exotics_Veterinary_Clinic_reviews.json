Everything has been great, from the very initial consult (he explained everything so clearly and answered all my annoying questions!) to the surgery to post surgery care. Costs have been very clearly explained. Follow ups and allowing us to call whenever we have questions has been extremely great. Shoutout to Zaylin and Dr Hannah, Dr Foo and everyone who has crossed paths with my very sassy and vocal Bella. Thank you to everyone, sincerely.\n\nAlso, the fact that you guys have convenient parking is a huge bonus too! Im very happy that i chose to go forward with you guys in the end.",

Their website guided me on how I could safely transport my 35cm koi from my pond to their clinic half an hour away. At the clinic, Dr. James did a thorough physical examination and asked a battery of questions to narrow down the cause, discussed the treatment options, and highlighting the associated risks before going ahead with the surgery. I paid $600 plus but it was money well spent. My koi is no worse of the surgery; the big wound is healing well. Thank you, Beecroft and Dr. James. Dr. James.",

Being a first time dog-parent, I was overwhelmed by what happened and was feeling so lost. Dr Julian assured me on the steps that are required for Mimi and helped to locate a potential blood donor which I am so grateful for. Also sending my special thanks to Dr Genevieve and Dr Sally who have also treated Mimi. Big shout out to the nurses for their love and care as well. Mimi is back to her joyful self and I am forever grateful!",

We were told the reason for the delay was that there were a few emergency cases that day.\n\nThe vet and nurse were experienced in handling my pet gerbil. The vet is a specialist in exotic animals and analysed with us the possible causes why our gerbil had not been eating normally and had lost weight, giving us handy advice. Another person on their team taught us how to feed medicine to our gerbil using a syringe.\n\nThey followed up with us after a few days, asking us how our gerbil was doing. We are thankful for their professionalism and care.\n\nThank you, Beecroft team!",
