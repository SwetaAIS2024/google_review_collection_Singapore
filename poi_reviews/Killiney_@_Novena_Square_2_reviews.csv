Whiskey Tea,5,"Had the laksa , it was simple and hearty. It‚Äôs a bowl of noodles in laksa broth , topped with tau pok, fish cake , prawn and one hard boiled egg.
Laksa was not the lemak type , it‚Äôs not the spicy type and hence friendly to most taste bud .",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111788781388191786320/reviews
Annie Lee,5,Good food options and all very tasty.  The chicken chop is my favourite and so good.  Am already thinking of chicken chop for my next visit here.  My kopi c is exactly the right texture.  Very satisfying meal üòã,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111012583065016463944/reviews
see you latt√©,4,"With link to/fro Novena MRT Station and sited on L2 of Sq 2 near escalators, this newly opened Killiney is in a rather optimal location in terms of accessibility, visibility and foot traffic. This space is bright, of good size providing a comfy spot for diners to enjoy familiar staples, a great cuppa and relaxation (outdoor seating available too). Also refreshing to see new food offerings (eg Chinese Dumplings and Grilled Salmon with Rice) added into its menu. Staff are courteous and efficient.
No prob getting a table of choice on Sunday morning. The following items are sufficient for sharing among 3 pax:
- Chinese Dumplings (8 pcs)
- Fried Bee Hoon w Egg, Luncheon Meat & Fish Cake
- Luncheon Meat, Cheese & Egg Sandwich
- Teh
- Yuan Yang
- Kopi O
All good except the overcooked eggs, and less than flavorful fish cake which are not to our liking. Will come back to try other food next time though.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109562020139406369328/reviews
Karen Lim,5,"Love this place for our weekly gathering for breakfast after Sunday mass. The service is good, the food serving is generous and delicious, especially the mee siam...one of my favorites. The coffee and ying yang are serve hot too. Definitely worth to try! Toast with kaya and chwee kueh are some great match with kopi..",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116601638110783384659/reviews
Timothy Teo,5,Located at 2nd floor near escalators. One thing not obvious is that they have an outdoor covered seating area which can host larger groups. Food is consistent with other Killiney so you know exactly what you'll get üëç,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109273027791328273356/reviews
