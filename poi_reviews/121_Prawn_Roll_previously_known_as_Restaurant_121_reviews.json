The service is friendly, and the food is consistently good. It’s a bit on the pricier side compared to other options, but the quality makes it worth it. A satisfying treat that’s well worth the visit!",

      "text": "Delicious curry fish head. Ordered 1 of the sets for 3 pax. Comes with curry fish head, salad pork chop, mixed vegetables, prawn rolls and 3 glasses of grass jelly lychee.\n\nThe dish to mention other than the curry fish head is the prawn roll. 1 of the best prawn rolls imo. Damn good.\n\nThe only bad thing about this place is they only have a few tables which means some waiting time is bound to occur if there are none available.",

      "text": "One of my favorite Malaysia style Zi Char in Hougang area. The food here is excellent and their bill was more than reasonable, very affordable. You must try their Claypot curry fish. The lemak curry is very rich and flavorful but not so spicy. The fish meat is very fresh and claypot was loaded with  other ingredients, ladyfingers, bean curd skin, eggplant, long bean and tomatoes. Another dish you should try is their Salad Pork Chop, which is a unique Malaysian-style dish. The meat was thoroughly marinated and blended well with the salad sauce. We tried the prawn rolls and sambal kangkong, they were equally good as well.",

Prices are quite reasonable and portion are ok . Set menu are also available for larger groups. Some of the special dishes I like to order is the petai fried rice. Rice fried with sambal petai beans with chicken bits, hot dogs slice and ikan bilis. Crunchy, spicy and flavorful. Crab tofu soup is another nice try on the menu. Silky tofu pair with mild salty crab meat with cellophane noodles broth. A lot of popular dishes over here, includes their famous prawn rolls, curry fish head and klang noodles. A decent tze char shop in Hougang area.",
