      "text": "I hope Google map will create zero or negative star rating! This is one of the worst rojek I tried. It‚Äôs a super duper expensive like hotel charging. I opted for Ala carte rojek(wrong choice) add 1 yu tiao and 3 taopor and 1 Century egg. Yu tiao $2.50 per yu tiao, 1 tap por $1.3 and 1 century egg $1.50, the stall uncle asked me want vegetables and I said yes( biggest mistake) I was expecting $7.9 in the end turn up to be $12.9. The veg itself cost $5 and not much. I will never buy from the stall again. It cost too much for rojek. Even more expensive than food court large potion rojek (jurong jem food court). The overall taste so so don‚Äôt even justified the price.",

So I ordered 2 fresh taupok in addition to the $5 small rojak. Total is $7.60 ie each fresh taupok costs $1.30.\n\nThe fresh taupok definitely good üëç. The stale ones that come with the $5 rojak needless to say can‚Äôt be good.\nThe sauce is good.\nNext time will just order the fresh ones. !",
