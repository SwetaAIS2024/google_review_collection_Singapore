The vibe is entirely different at night so I suggest visiting it at the daytime and night both. If you don't have time, choose the night time. You can find seafood, dumplings, and a variety of cultural food.",

Tourists often miss other good eats because they only focus on Hawker Chan/dumplings. There’s great kway chap here and even vegetarian options for those looking to go meat-free. This place is best experienced in the daytime/during lunch on the weekends.",
