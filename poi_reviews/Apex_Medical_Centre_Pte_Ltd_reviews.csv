yannicious,1,"I was told by one of the clinic assistant at 615pm that the doctor would be available at 7pm, with my turn likely around 8-830pm. This is frustrating, as if the clinic had answered my call earlier and issued a queue number, I could have gone home to have dinner, shower, and return on time. Instead, I had no choice but to wait at the clinic, as going home would have been too rushed and risked missing my turn.

I attempted to purchase medication but was met with unhelpful and poorly trained auntie staff who was unable to advise me on suitable options based on my prescription history. The lack of professionalism and competence from the clinic assistants is deeply disappointing.

I have decided not to return to this clinic and will lodge a formal complaint with the MOH and inform the area MP. Patients deserve better service and proper training for clinic staff to avoid such inconveniences.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116755412352717428162/reviews
P S Ang,1,"do not be in healthcare industry if you lack basic empathy. Counter staff in her 30s were extremely rude, shouted at my elderly grandma. We spend money to see doctor because we are ill, not to be scolded. Come at your own risk.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101513515216786900600/reviews
Irene D,1,"If you’re looking for poor diagnosis, wasted time, and rude customer service, this clinic is the place to go.

I had the unfortunate experience of visiting this clinic twice in 2024, both times being consulted by Dr. Goh.

1.	August 2024 – I sprained my thumb, and the pain extended to my wrist. I explained that I couldn’t move my thumb, and my wrist was in significant pain. Dr. Goh briefly examined my wrist and simply stated that it was sprained. He prescribed ointment, but the pain worsened over the next week. I later visited a polyclinic where the doctor provided a more thorough assessment, diagnosing a nerve injury in my wrist that required a steroid injection. After being referred to a hospital and receiving the injection, I recovered fully within three days.

2.	September 2024 – I experienced heavy menstrual bleeding for two weeks. Dr. Goh advised me to take Norethisterone for 20 days to stop the flow. When I asked if it was necessary to take it for so many days, he insisted it was. He also added that I should take high blood pressure pills, despite me telling him I don’t have high blood pressure. He tested my blood pressure three times and insisted it was abnormal. I explained that I’ve had low blood pressure most of my life and that the elevated reading might be due to panic after bleeding excessively. He refused to reconsider, claiming that high blood pressure pills would reduce the bleeding. When I tested my blood pressure at home, it was normal.

3.	Patient Privacy Concerns – There’s absolutely no regard for patient privacy in this clinic. Two of the counter staff (packing medication and collecting payments) are respectful, speaking softly when dealing with patients’ personal information. However, the two seated behind the counter never get up and instead shout out patients’ full names, NRIC numbers, house addresses, and phone numbers for everyone to hear. During both of my visits, I witnessed them shouting at elderly patients. On one occasion, an elderly man mentioned it was his first time at the clinic, and the staff loudly responded, “Why must you come here?” I also saw a middle-aged woman buying medication without her physical NRIC. Instead of proper verification, the seated staff simply asked her to recite her NRIC number and proceeded to sell the medication. Isn’t this dangerous? Why isn’t there a proper process in place? People come to the clinic unwell – the least they deserve is respectful treatment.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105755199362573534660/reviews
