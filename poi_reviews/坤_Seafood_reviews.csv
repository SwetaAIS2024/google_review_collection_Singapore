D K,1,"Worst zhi char in my life. Bought my family for dinner. My wife ordered 2 plates of mui fan and 1 curry fish head. The curry fish head was so tasteless and dilute. Mui fan also very tasteless and not much ingredients. Worst part we found a bug in the rice. So disappointed. I swear never will i patronize again!!! If my kids fall sick, i going to complain to NEA or MOH!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110195524684010077160/reviews
Esther Ong,1,"Decided to preorder a feast for my father's birthday after watching a tiktok video which highly raved and recommended  Had them all in takeaway.

Fish head curry was expensive in my opinion $30+
And there is no taupok!
Curry gravy has no coconut fragrance.

Cereal squid has very little cereal.

All the other dishes ordered were mediocre and very disappointing since expectations were high.

And food were salty and very oily.

Don't recommend.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101196033103412835566/reviews
Golden Bluewave,3,"2023Sep Closed @435A.
Seems no longer operating.
Maybe chefs are hard to find. Standard and quality dropped since 2023 after price increases. Taste totally changed.
Now 435A is taken over by One Ocean Seafood probably a brand under the same owner WuFu.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114903602990623509783/reviews
