      "text": "Went there for an early lunch, and oh my, it was really crowded even before 12 pm. We ordered 3 pasta, namely the mushroom aglio olio, vongole linguine, and vongole marinara. For both the vongole pasta, they are really valued for $$. It's hard to find a vongole pasta that comes with so much vongole. Taste-wise, they were great too, though I would recommend vongole linguine over the marinara one. We also ordered the fried calamari. It was good, but I wish they could cut the calamari even smaller so that it's easier to eat and chew. Overall, it's not cheap, but the food quality made up for it. Great place for families for occasional splurging.",

Each kind of bread was very well done - freshly baked/warmed with nice buttery-salty flavour\nDuck confit was fine - meat was tender and well seasoned, but thought the risotto was a bit too creamy\nItalian sodas were refreshing.",

      "text": "I recently had the pleasure of dining at Whisk & Paddle, and I can confidently say it was an exceptional experience from start to finish! The ambiance is warm and inviting, making it the perfect spot for a cozy dinner or a casual brunch with friends.\n\nThe menu offers a delightful variety of dishes, all crafted with fresh, high-quality ingredients. I tried their signature pancakes, and they were simply divine—fluffy, flavorful, and beautifully presented. My partner had the avocado toast, which was equally delicious and packed with taste.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the attentive service. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent recommendations. The staff genuinely seemed to care about our dining experience, which made the visit even more enjoyable.\n\nTo top it all off, the coffee was outstanding—rich and aromatic, it perfectly complemented our meals. I can't wait to return to Whisk & Paddle to explore more of their menu and indulge in another fantastic meal. Highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for great food and a welcoming atmosphere!",

The staff were very effective and manage the queue very well.\n\nThe food we ordered came quite swiftly and the taste remained good like before despite the crowd.\n\nIt is surprising and also commendable that it was well run and maintained a good standard on a crowded public holiday.",
