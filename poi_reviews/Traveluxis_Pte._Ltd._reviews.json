Those who enjoy water sports will have wonderful time here. The travel arrangements made by this agent along with the resorts people are well synchronized. No where we felt uncomfortable.",

      "text": "I recently booked travel package for Maldives with Yeshwant. Where should I start ? Yeshwant is the most humble guy in tour planning industry I came across.\nHis patience to understand the needs and criticality of time is remarkable. I was very reluctant to book a travel package with an individual whom I have never met but got reference from telegram/whatsapp group only. But all praises of him which were mentioned in group were 100% to the mark. He helped me get a pretty decent package for 4 adults for 16 days 15 nights in maldives in a very short notice(I asked him to provide me a package which would commence within 48 hours). His skills in terms of getting a great deal for customer were impeccable. Also since I am in USA and I was planning the trip for my parents in India, Yeshwant was always available round the clock, I never felt that he is not reachable. He ensured how things are going on at every check point. I would highly highly recommend Yeshwant to anyone who is looking for any travel booking. Building trust and transferring lacs of rupees to an individual a/c is a very tough task but Yeshwant built it so strongly that I wasn‚Äôt hesitant to provide him the business from my side. Great job done Yeshwant, keep it up like this always and you shall prosper !",
