Adi Rusydi,1,"If can give zero star i will give zero. VERY RUDE AUNTIE! Was collecting my shopee parcels and then its her own mistake for not checking first after scanning and gave wrong parcel, i went back after checking and then she tried to turn it around faults instead. And while i talk to her nicely, she raised her voice, when i raised mine back she said i was rude. Uhm hello?? What kind of customer service is this?? And the fact that she called me out like that infront of 3 other customers in store. And then i went here to check for reviews, omg i guess i wasnt wrong. Shes the rude one. Every review says the same thing. If the store owner does not fire her, idk if this shop should be called Fortune? Maybe change to Misfortune would be suitable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114904251713245482047/reviews
Y. Tan,1,"Rude staff. Was collecting my Shopee parcel and missed collection timing by 10min, thought to ask why cannot collect cos I was already there, and since the shop was not closed yet. The auntie rudely dismissed me when I was so polite to ask her why. Omg.. she ruins people’s day with that poor attitude of hers! On top of that, she allowed someone behind me to make payment for a drink. My small value and lightweight collection wouldn’t even take her much time given no monetary transaction but she made me come back another day within the specified 10am to 5.30pm - pretty restrictive duration huh? Stay away if you don’t want bad vibes.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112612774559270423424/reviews
