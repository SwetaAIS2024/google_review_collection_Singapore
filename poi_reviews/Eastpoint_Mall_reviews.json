And itâ€™s right beside Simei MRT Station make the mall location more ideal than others.",

      "text": "KUDOS TO SIMEIANS\n\nI went to Eastpoint Mall to buy some necessities. In my hurriedness, I thought I placed my wallet into my sling bag but I missed and dropped the wallet. I went back home without realizing it.\n\nOnly when I checked that I discovered the loss. I immediately made my way back to Eastpoint. While walking and on the line with one of my banks to freeze my card, I received a call from Eastpoint. The person on the other side was Guna, a Security officer of the mall. He assured me right away that my wallet was found and already handed over to them.\n\nI met Mr. Guna who handed over my items to me after doing the necessary documentation.\n\nI am indebted to the kind person (whom I wish will be showered with blessings and wellness) who found my wallet and immediately handed it over to the security team, and to Mr. Guna who immediately found my business card and called me. He had saved me much time and inconvenience with the banks and other authorities.",

The persistent lack of cleanliness falls short of basic toilet hygiene standards, making it a recurring issue for users.\nUnlike other malls under Frasers, the toilets at Eastpoint are particularly pathetic, highlighting a notable disparity in maintenance and upkeep.",

If you discover a spoiled item, they audaciously demand proof-implying the customer is responsible for the spoilage-before agreeing to an exchange. Essentially, they rely on customers to inspect product quality and monitor expiration dates themselves.",
