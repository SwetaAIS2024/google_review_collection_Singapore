Never clean and maintain the Condon properly. It is quite smelly in the carpark and the lobby area, but management never take any actions. The cleaner even put 2 racks in the condo public area to put  their own belonging. The security never do the job, even many ppl call them to report outside person enter our swimming poll. They never appear. When you call management office, they never pick up the call.",
