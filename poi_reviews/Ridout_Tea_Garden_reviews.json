      "text": "A strong contender for most beautiful McDonald's in Singapore - the buildings have been renovated and the new layout is very well thought through including a larger open air dining area + 'bar' seating at the windows and sweet 2 person booths.\n\nThe surroundings are gorgeous - aside from the water feature, chock a block full of turtles, the gardens have been landscaped Japanese style?\n\nIf you're a McDonald's fan, it's a lovely outlet to visit (paid parking alongside) and for us, beats the other Singapore park McDonald's at West Coast, Bishan  & opposite Jurong Point . . . which all lovely in their own right",

      "text": "A Hidden Gem with Generations of Memories\n\nRidout Tea Garden is truly a gem. My husband and I used to have dinner here back in the early 2000s after our classes at Singapore Polytechnic, and it’s been close to our hearts ever since. Over the years, we’ve continued coming back — now with our children — and the magic has only grown.\n\nHaving a McDonald's in such a serene garden setting makes it even more special. It's like enjoying a picnic by the pond, surrounded by nature. What makes it perfect for families is the free indoor playground provided by McDonald's, where our kids can play safely while we relax. It's a rare find in such a tranquil environment.\n\nThe plant nursery next door adds another lovely layer — our children love picking out pots and plants to bring home.\n\nRidout Tea Garden holds so many beautiful memories for us and remains one of our favourite spots for peaceful, meaningful family time.",
