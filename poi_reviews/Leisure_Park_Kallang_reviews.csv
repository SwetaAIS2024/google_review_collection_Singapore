Wil,5,Nice and quiet mall. Plenty of seats in cafes to chill,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111574327093882132576/reviews
SeungJun Kim,3,"Quite an underwhelming & empty shopping mall located near Stadium MRT. This mall has many empty shops, questionable empty spaces, as well as rooftop which is only accessible to the management office workers. I see a need for this mall to touch up on its space management and administration to make it more vibrant and increase the number of visitors",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100958975977925692266/reviews
Calvin Leong,3,"My children attend wushu classes on the second floor every Saturday morning. Today, however, we encountered a strong, unpleasant odor as soon as the school opened its doors. Within minutes, both my children and I experienced breathing difficulties and headaches, prompting us to cancel our class. The staff also had to vacate the school and contacted the security staff. We later learned that the fumes were due to renovation work in the neighboring unit on the same floor.

We love this mall—it’s our cherished weekend family destination—and we urge management to take prompt and effective measures to prevent such incidents in the future, ensuring the safety of all patrons, especially our little ones.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118437307902733487646/reviews
T0m2y Ch00,4,"It's not a place for entertainment anymore, left only ice skating. The mall does not have more shops or boutique if you are looking for one, but they do have a handful of food choices. My family favourite is the Unabara Grill Fish shop. Hope it can continue to stay, because hard to find one that serve good fish meal since Ottoya (use to be at Changi City point) closed down ages ago.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102727811964660447690/reviews
Arthur Feldman,5,"Much less crowded and deprived of natural light than its counterpart Kallang Wave mall, Leisure Park has the vibe of a big American mall. It has huge hidden spaces like a bowling alley and a movie theater.
Sadly its Cold Storage is closing tomorrow. I hope they don’t drop the ball and replace it with non-sensical stores or yet another NTUC FairPrice.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101717170849942608804/reviews
