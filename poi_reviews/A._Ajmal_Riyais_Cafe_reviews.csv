Yong Chang Peh,2,"Ordered Teh Halia less sweet and Ice Teh less sweet. Our usual orders.

This used to be our favourite stall with consistent products. Usually the 2 bros are very friendly too.

Today, they served both with full sweetness. Which is fine, we all make mistakes when we are busy right.

What was unacceptable was how when I gave feedback civilly, the stall operator gave me a smirk and walked away. The other lady moderated the situation and modified the drinks unwillingly before they disregarded me again.

The drinks also remained very sweet with inadequate tea potency.

Hope bros will regain their standard in the future.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109805975692860911382/reviews

CK C,4,Teh halia was quite good - ginger taste was strong but tea was quite weak. Large mug for only $1.50. E-payment available.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Josh Kuek (#jkgourmets),3,"Very friendly family business (I think). Serve many local drinks, from Tea, coffee to milo, hoclick to special flavor like hot tea with ginger juice. Not really cheap, but still a acceptable price range.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111255682252678932891/reviews
Mikah Lurma,1,"Becareful of this shop trap. They dont ask customer what size you want. Ordered cold drinks and all 5 cup came large by default and all 5 cups cost me $20 regardless of teh o, sugar cane, lime juice or lemon tea. Felt cheated and learnt my lesson.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106216296926611115143/reviews
