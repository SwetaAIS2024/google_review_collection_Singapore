I had trouble downloading and using your app and despite spending over 20 minutes trying—with no proper assistance—it still wasn’t settled.\n\nIn the end, I gave up and didn’t buy the 7no milk tea. I came for. It was frustrating and discouraging.\n\nI hope your store can consider having a cashier or alternative payment option for customers like me who are not comfortable with technology.\n\nThank you for your attention.",

Coffee taste is not that strong, but it’s great with the milk.\nThe staff is short of manpower in the morning.\nPretty much self serving.",

      "text": "I have to hand it down to my friend and colleague of mine who introduced me to Luckin' Coffee.\n\nWhile en route to Bowl Chap around the corner at Galaxis (literally a stone's throw away), I promptly signed in to their app and made my first online order: one iced coconut latte (least sweet).  First orders cost $0.99, or one dollar.\n\nThe drink did not disappoint, because it was a myriad of flavours rushing in my tongue.  Coffee beans, milk, coconut served cold was the greatest thing to experience in a hot day like today.\n\nI expected a long waiting time for the latte, but it turned out to be 3 minutes of waiting!  So I decided to take the iced latte with me and have it alongside my delicious lunch at Bowl Chap.  I'll be sticking around for more promising deals and/or promos, and see what is the next best drink I am going to try out. :)",
