Jake Lutz-Cruz,5,"School of my childhood (graduated 2017). Made mostly good memories here! The time I went featured a student population of many diverse backgrounds, all getting along nicely and harmoniously together. There were also many great teachers who I won’t forget. It felt like a tightly knit community there, and I’m still in contact with some peers to this day. Would highly recommend this school to parents looking to send their kids.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104869561911531211710/reviews

dino ABC center,1,"Had a horrible experience in the school. My juniors are also experiencing their worst time of their life here, not because of studies but the teacher's attitude towards the students. The principal is getting worse each time. The management of the school and how the teachers deal with the kids are horrendous. The teachers have 0 sense of responsibility. They often lose kid's homework/worksheets and blame the student for not submitting it. I myself have experienced this many times so did my juniors. If you want to experience a good school life, DO NOT enter this school.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112190178648890791532/reviews
