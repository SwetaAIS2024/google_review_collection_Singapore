Paul Pang,1,"I ordered beef steak, grilled fish and smoked duck penne (see photo). The steak was extremely dry and hard, the fish was tasteless and we cannot find any smoked duck as see in the photo. Service was extremely bad and rude. They took a long time to give me my change as the head staff said they donâ€™t have any more $10 notes. He was constantly shouting at the hired staff. If there was a minus one rating, I would have given it.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112646745105152671565/reviews

i_boop _your_nose,1,"Closes at 11pm but majority of the items aren't available. I came in at 2154 and tried ordering fried chicken wings but was told ""no more"". Saw fried chicken wings in their fryer basket, that is why I assumed it's still available. But alas, guess the staff wants to bring them home instead.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109078479575594007500/reviews

Vegas Lee,3,"tenderbest tasted a lot better before they expanded around the island. chicken was unfortunately too dry and the cream pasta had way too much water.
