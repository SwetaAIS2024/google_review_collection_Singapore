阿宝,3,"This stall has a nice and easy to remember name but the food is just average…

The soup was served like left over and the presentation of the rice set is really “chin chye”…. I can accept food without presentation if it is really nice but no thanks to something not yummy & not even effort to make it presentable 🥹😓",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews
Ma-ku Gan,5,"This is one stall that you shouldn't missed. It's not only cheap but delicious. Morning from 7 to 10 a plate of delicious wanton noddles costs only $2. It not only value for money but dirt cheap. Char Siew is one dish that is a must have dish. Except for the noddles every beats and pieces of the food are prepared at the the stall. After 10am, the food are still cheap and good. A set of ½ chicken with vegetables, 2 bowls of rice and wanton soup cost $8.80 only. So many other areas to tell you but best to visit the stall to find out more. I assure you that you won't regret visiting this stall.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111905054743170371164/reviews

Belle,1,"Wth don’t want work at 2am don’t work lah. Go home sleep. Open 24 hr for what? Attitude so bad. You mumble under your face mask, people can hear? At first I stand down there just ignore me somemore. You don’t want sell at 2am is it?? No sauce then I ask about other rice option. Reply until so buey song. Everything also not ready then don’t open. Pls close down and let other shop come in. Decent service and attitude also don’t have.
