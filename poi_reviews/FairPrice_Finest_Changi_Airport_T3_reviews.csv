E,3,"This ntuc is situated in Terminal 3 at level B2. It's sort of in the middle of B2 and it's directly opposite the Customer Service counter. This ntuc is pretty big so if you're taking a flight and suddenly got the urge to do some grocery shopping, you can certainly come here to past the time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103665268796109855493/reviews
Darren Nguyen,1,"I visited the store just now, I went in to buy oranges w my trolley. on top of trolley, there are 2 heavy luggage. i went 1 round, at the payment counter, 1 lady spoke in chinese that 'this cart can get in here ah'. The way she did her service is bad. if really people cannot take trolley in, just approach them and say 'dont do it next time' rather than gossiping in chinese. i done payment, she still follow me to the exit and intentionally point to the sign.
1. if people are so bound by rules without giving a helping hand with 2 big luggages, how i am going to buy oranges?
2. if the rule is so serious, she should have stopped me from entering.
i felt bad, really bad moood. Still call this place finest",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113007218391059857763/reviews
