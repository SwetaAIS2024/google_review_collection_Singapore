Johann DG,4,"The Woodleigh Mall is a beautiful, modern addition to the Bidadari area. It’s not just a shopping mall—it’s a lifestyle hub that blends convenience, community, and a touch of nature. The layout is spacious and clean, and the design incorporates a lot of natural light and greenery, which makes it feel less like a typical crowded mall and more like a chill hangout spot.

There’s a good variety of food options—from quick bites like A&W and VeganBurg to craft beer at Brewerkz. The 24-hour FairPrice Finest is a huge plus, especially for night owls or last-minute grocery runs. There’s also a large Food Republic food court, which is perfect for families or groups with different cravings.

I appreciate the eco-friendly touches too—lots of bicycle parking, showers, and lockers for cyclists. It’s also directly connected to Bidadari Park, so you can easily combine a park stroll with your shopping trip. Plus, having the community club and police post integrated into the mall makes it feel like a real neighborhood hub.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114702046352845681030/reviews
Capture Asia Photography,4,"Pretty decent mall with all the standard amenities and plenty of F&B. I particularly enjoyed the basement which is spacious, NTUC Finest is also available. Outside around the mall also got plenty of food premises waiting to be explored. The Woodleigh mall can linked to Bidadari park, Community Centre, Woodleigh village hawker centre and Woodleigh MRT station. Overall i enjoy the concept of the mall, rather refreshing as compared to other older neighbourhood mall.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113796572659279486041/reviews
Gan BT,1,"Review for Ten Points Porridge
Rating: 1/10

I had a very disappointing experience at Ten Points Porridge. The porridge was served only warm, not hot, which made it unappetizing. The texture was dry instead of smooth and comforting, and it lacked any real flavor—completely tasteless.

To make things worse, the egg was barely cooked, practically raw, and just sat there without blending into the porridge properly. It felt like no effort was put into making the dish enjoyable.

Overall, this was one of the worst porridge experiences I’ve had. If you’re looking for a warm, flavorful bowl of porridge, this is definitely not the place to go. Would not recommend.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104291729709741515214/reviews
Li Feng,4,"Woodleigh Mall offers a vibrant shopping and dining experience with a great variety of options. The mall is modern and well-maintained, earning a solid 4-star rating. However, the carpark gantry system could use some improvement for smoother access.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105807436200681938352/reviews
