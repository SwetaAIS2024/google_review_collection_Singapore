Entire shop is simple and you can tell its just very focused on producing good drinks, that's it.\n\nJust like how the Japanese does it, they focus on one thing and they do it to perfection, this is the vibe that Soon Heng Coffee Stall gives, just focus on the drinks, the rest nothing much. No need fancy lights, hanging decorations or big signs, even their menu is printed on A4 and self-designed all that.\n\nThank you for being here and serving the Bedok community with a reliable and trustable source of nectar of life, auntie and uncle!",
