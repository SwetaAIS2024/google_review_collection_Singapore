Since it is the rainy season now, this may cause dengue fever or hygiene problems. I hope effective unit can be sent someone to clean up this place and pay attention to this problem.",

      "text": "This town council have the most arrogant and estate cleaners that  no one even manages them. Comes out so late at night everyday at my estate roaming around. When confronted asking what he was doing, he said nothing but why is he opening the compactor to put items so late at night? He even dare to talk back to resident. Is the town council sleeping on the job? Are they picking items to sell late at night and why are they doing so? Is their welfare being taken care of well?\nWhy are they still working so late beyond their working hours? Even so, rubbish strewn around the common areas and recycling bins are not cleaned when he is here at night? So I ask, what is he doing at night and is it legal?\nSelling metal at board daylight\nMade police report already",

All the way up to top floors. Can you spare us that? Because later in the day we have to hear Bto construction sounds which can't be helped. Why allow this noise making activities in estate area, this early in the morning ?",

After which Town Council officers and their contractors came down for site visits and inspection multiple times but there does not seem to be any action being done by them. If there are, information is conveyed very poorly.\n\nEdit: I recommend anyone who sees this to report any issue you notice within your flat/HDB block through the LifeSG mobile app if possible. They are much more efficient and responsive there regarding the actions they'll take and any other follow-ups/updates. Plus you can easily see all previous and current cases reported in an organized manner.",
