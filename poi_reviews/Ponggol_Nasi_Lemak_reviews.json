From the cashier to the kitchen staff, the attitude was noticeably rude and unwelcoming. It really affects the overall experience. I believe the staff either need proper training in customer service or perhaps better remuneration to reflect their hard work. Great food deserves equally great service.",

Was craving for nasi lemak and my favourite stall at Tiong Bahru was closed as the TB market was closed for renovation. Dishes were so so only but I must say that brinjal was good.",
