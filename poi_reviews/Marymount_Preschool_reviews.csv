bryan chia,5,"Our girl was studying here for 1.5years. During the time we were there, the admins were really helpful and patient with many arrangements we need to make for our girl including taking her materials with her mid term when we went back to another country for a few weeks. She enjoyed her Mandarin environment very much!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102045793220518539615/reviews
john Na,5,"A commendable school with compassionate teachers. All three of my children, who started from playgroup till KG2,  now excel in top secondary and primary education. Reflecting on the past, I am confident that selecting this preschool was the right decision. The school not only provides a academic foundation but also prioritizes character development & well mannered kids.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103638419741452693719/reviews
JD,5,"Good school which provides a cohesive and safe space for children in an environment which provides holistic approach to education. My son attends this school, chose it over the cookie cutter “brands” and franchises” that exist - teachers here are dedicated and amazing led by the Principal. Highly recommended and my son is ready for P1 next year will definitely miss this school he joined as a toddler.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103118677718601843972/reviews
Gabrielle Lee,5,"My child has been going for abt 3 months to this school. Changed her school to Marymount becos of the full Chinese curriculum she can get in one class per level. Very thankful for this environment becos she is now obviously adding Chinese to her language use, and no longer monolingual!! I’m sooo pleased with that as we cannot provide her a Chinese environment at home at all, with me the only Chinese speaking individual…
The school is also making her an independent individual and she leaves school everyday a happy child. That said, she has some confidence each morning possibly due to the full English environment at home making it a real challenge for her in school at times, but really making a difference to her becoming bilingual! :) thank you Marymount!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101653721199649925945/reviews
