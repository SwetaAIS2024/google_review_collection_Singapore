LL A,1,"I recently dined at a hot hideout at junction 10 and had an experience that I believe warrants some feedback. While I appreciate the quality of the food and service, I was surprised to learn that requesting hot plain water to adjust the saltiness of a soup base was not accommodated. Instead, I was informed by a staff member at Hot Hideout that only tap water was available.

In my opinion, providing hot water for such a request is a reasonable expectation, as it enhances customer satisfaction and allows guests to tailor their meal to their preference. I believe a small adjustment like this would greatly improve the dining experience and demonstrate greater flexibility in customer service.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102698779366515973103/reviews
KW Yoke,5,"Queue was really long on a sat evening, but there was plenty of seating so that's great. The ordering system is quite efficient.

I was curious what was so different about this mala place from the others, and I got my answers. The deep fried lotus roots, the flow scrambled eggs in the soup, that singaporean-ness of the soup base that was more nourishing and less intense than the China version.

Also it was amazing that I saw zero PRC Chinese customers, and all were singaporeans.

I must say this was my most enjoyable mala experience, looking forward to trying another soup base with the scrambled eggs.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101653153694763341697/reviews

Tim THC,5,"Had a really hard time deciding to give the place a 5â˜†â€¦. Simply because we are afraid that one day this establishment will get super popular and super crowded! ðŸ˜‚ Really nice mala, and quite reasonably priced. Enjoyable atmosphere and good level of cleanliness. Will definitely come back to eat their mala dishes more often!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100241529284234381542/reviews
Keith Er,4,"Came and try after hearing and seeing it on social media

The service staffs great and friendly
Looks orderly and able to be allocated to the food and seats with good proper manner

Ok, back to the food review
The plus points are - good varieties of choices
Free flow of peanuts, complimentary sauces and onions and coriander.

The negative part - it didnâ€™t actually taste super special in terms of taste but I wonâ€™t totally say I wonâ€™t revisit because this first visit, I only tried their mala soup.

Till I finish trying out their other soup and mala stir fry then a final review will be given",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101648258475493647941/reviews
