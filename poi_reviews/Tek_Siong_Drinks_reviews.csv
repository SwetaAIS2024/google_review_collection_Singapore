Les Buckley,5,"Revised- still best beverages PLUS old style kaya toast with malt bread toasted, sliced with oats of butter and a slathering of kaya. Delicious

Easily the smoothest silkiest beverages at Marine Parade. I love the handcrafted style and attention to detail of the Boss.  I drink tea. Always fresh and hot.  Perfect amount of ‚ÄòC‚Äô.  The toast and eggs are also great

Kai Wee Toh,5,"I was having my bowl of mee rebus near the stall when I noticed the fairly long queue hardly moved by the time I finished my noodles. Piqued by the patience of the crowd, I joined the queue too. Then, I observed the reason why. The uncle making the coffee was fastidious to a fault. When he makes a new pot of coffee, he would spend minutes cleaning the filter sock in hot water, rinsing and wringing it many times. Only after he was satisfied with the cleaning would he proceed to brew the coffee, again in his meticulous way that cannot be rushed. When he makes each cup to order, he carefully measures out the exact amount of sugar or condensed milk or evaporated milk with a teaspoon held delicately in his fingers with the pinky extended. It was as if he was a conductor performing with his baton.

The result - my kopi c siu dai was nicer than that from any other coffee stall I know. ‚òïüëçüèª",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114038700418549783797/reviews
