th3 hiccough,5,"Ordered via panda, and was shocked with the huge briyani portion! Chicken masala was really good and great prata for my preference",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103584951064280074790/reviews
Vinod,5,"Been visiting this stall since the first day
The curries for the prata are very tasty.
The flavours are rich and right amount of spice. Including the variety of thosai.

Secondly the briyani in this shop, has stopped me from going to Little India to get my briyani fix, cooked in the traditional ""dum"" method, the portion and taste well worth your money.

Lastly the ""nasi padang or economic style"" dishes cooked for a meal is quite the spread. Always spoilt for choice. The taste has always been same, since the first day.

Probably once a week, 5 out of 7 days I'll get my meal from this stall. Writing this review as I'm buying food from the stall as well ðŸ˜Š",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106400043165415698452/reviews
