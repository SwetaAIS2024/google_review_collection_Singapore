Adlyn AH,5,"An oasis in Ubi to rest and relax. My iced white was smooth and strong, I enjoyed it very much on a hot Saturday afternoon. Different types of seating available for a coffee date, a group catch up, or an important meeting. Pleasant and friendly staff. Overall a lovely place to enjoy great coffee.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105558655639382446510/reviews

Ken,5,"Very clean, tidy and comforting environment. Had a chance to be in my Zen moment before my driving test.

The white coffee was well made, creamy and smooth, right amount of bitterness.

They were very generous with the egg mayo as well.

It's also very near cdc driving center (5min walk), perfect to go before every lesson and test.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105465408616027279584/reviews
Joanna Tan,5,"Good service by crew. The ambience is perfect to chill on a weekend afternoon. Though it was crowded, the place wasn't overly noisy. Ordered the cake and it was a balanced between sour and sweet. Great choice of coffee and tea too! Forgot to take pictures because it was too yummy!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104107665045731326466/reviews
Nelson Lau,5,"Solid specialty coffee, good food, extremely good value for money, in an unexpected location.

Yes, you can get pour over as well as espresso drinks here, and the coffee is surprisingly good. Food isn’t made on site. But it is quite yummy. And everything is very well priced.

This cafe is in the lobby of Aspial One. If you’re in the Ubi area, this is possibly one of the best cafes you can visit. Recommend!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111438725095439992472/reviews
