A must see if you visit Singapore.\nWhile most of the Gardens by the Bay can be enjoyed for free, certain attractions do come with an entry fee.\n\nThe Gardens by the Bay is easily accessible by public transportation. If you are taking Singaporeâ€™s efficient MRT, get off at the Bayfront MRT station, and the Gardens is just a short walk away. You can also take a taxi or a bus to the Gardens.\n\nThe best time to visit the Gardens would be in the mornings or in the evening to night and on weekdays. You can rent bicycle to explore MBS Garden Park or just walking around.",
