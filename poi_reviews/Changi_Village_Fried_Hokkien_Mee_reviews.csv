Trusten Ng Rui Han,5,"This is my first meal that I ever ate at Jurong West Hawker Centre. Like any other outlets, Changi Village Hokkien Mee is quite nice as always, even Jurong West!

One of the best options for me to eat Hokkien Mee especially at Jurong West! I also like the service as well, fast within 5-8 minutes despite dinner time.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100085888841473705278/reviews
Karen Kwong,4,"Uncle is friendly when I ordered from his stall as I don't have to queue for the hokkien mee.. it tastes quite okay.. 2 prawns only for $4/-.. payment wise, it's contactless payment mode.. I think they prefer cash instead ðŸ˜‚",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104675920877080787062/reviews
Rick Koh,3,"A very mediocre plate of HCM. I had the $8 Roasted Meat HCM. Lack flavour, depth and passion in the HCM. The squid slices were miniscule. Roasted meat has not crunch. The little pieces of pork lard were quite good, thankfully. Chilli is more meant for Nasi Lemak than HCM. Not worth the calories. I did not manage to see through the plate.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106510842319180067826/reviews
