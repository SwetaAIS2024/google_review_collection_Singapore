Xiang Yan Chan,2,"Generally, the dishes were served lukewarm with the exception of the hotplate tofu. We ordered the yam ring, salted egg pork ribs, prawn rolls and hotplate tofu.

The yam ring was obviously not deep fried on the spot, as it wasn't crispy at all. We were quite surprised that it was abnormally smaller than usual, with fewer ingredients too. Prawn rolls were a huge disappointment, as it tasted nothing like prawns. Hotplate tofu was... Hot? That's all I could describe as it was generally bland with minimal ingredients.

The salted egg pork ribs were good, but it was served lukewarm. It was probably heated up and stirred fried for a short while to save on cooking time. Rice was $1 a bowl, which is pretty expensive. Could have ordered from another stall for better rice quality. Total damage was about $60.

Service was spotty and they were clearly understaffed. The ordering system wasn't perfect, and many customers were left waiting in line, sometimes for the wrong queue.

Won't be patronizing again due to their subpar and lukewarm food.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107843977681740890736/reviews
Cedric Seet,3,"Food is decent, not many places you get sotong rice with different flavors. I got the black bean sauce one, sotong sliced a little thin but I can understand why. However, to add an egg costs 80 cents more and that left a bitter taste in my mouth as most zhichars add an egg already regardless of whether the cost is embedded in or not. Moreover the egg was overcooked, not runny and it looked like it came out of a microwave.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116120424406667932678/reviews

Wei Tan,4,"Generous portions of mushrooms and pork, and great tasting noodle, but I find the flavours somewhat mild and lacking a certain kick - perhaps I'm used to tasting vinegar in my BCM, which isn't present here (I think). Also, the meatballs were a little too hard, even for someone like me.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113727367121706943852/reviews
