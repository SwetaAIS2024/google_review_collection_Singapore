Go to nearby Upper Seletar Reservoir instead.\n\nWhy?\n- Nothing much to see\n- Bus access very minimal\n- Slippery path because of moss growing on part of it.\n\nI don't recommend to bring elderly here, for those who wants to include this in their long walk/jog, it's okay.",

When you are taking photos of the scenery,  please be watchful of these macaques. Make sure there are none at the trees above you. They will also creep up on you to seize any chances of snatching your bags.",

If the sky is clear with just sufficient amount of scattered cloud, thatâ€™s when the perfect photo are captured! Try going at different time of the day, there will be a different perspective!",
