      "text": "I was in the neighborhood looking for a preschool for my niece and decided to visit Little Footprints Preschool at Jurong West Avenue 5. Despite being busy, the principal welcomed me warmly and personally conducted a tour of the school with such grace. She took the time to explain the curriculum and environment, which I really appreciated.\n\nThe teachers were friendly and engaging, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere for the children. I could see that the children were happy and actively involved in learning. Overall, I had a very positive impression of the school and would definitely recommend it to parents looking for a nurturing and supportive environment for their little ones.",
