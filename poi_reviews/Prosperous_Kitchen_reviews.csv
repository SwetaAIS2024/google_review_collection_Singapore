Julia Teo,5,"A true hidden gem in the heart of Geylang East Central. We ordered Beef Pho, Spicy Beef Noodles and Fresh Spring rolls and it all cost $23.30! Love the taste and how fresh the spring rolls were. My friend really liked the meatballs in her Beef Pho. Will definitely come back again to try everything else on the menu.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116712432228920570433/reviews
Sean Goh,3,"Got to know of this shop selling Vietnamese food a couple of weeks ago when I came to nearby for dinner. Happen to be around the area and decided to pop by for dinner. I was quite surprised that the shop name had changed but still decided to have dinner here. The space wasn't that  big, there were only a few tables. Apart from Vietnamese food, they sell other local dishes like kway chap and mixed organ soup.

You can order at the counter before taking a seat. I ordered the chicken pho($SGD8.90) and the mixed ham baguette ($SGD6.90). Didn't have to wait long since there weren't any customers.

Pho'broth was pretty good. However, the chicken meat was tough. The baguette, on the other hand, was delicious. Bread was warm and crispy. Portion of the ham could be more generous.

Overall, the food and dining experience was okay. Can consider coming back.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Wan Jiun Tay,5,"Came here at a friendâ€™s recommendation. Ordered the beef pho and bun cha and both were flavourful and hearty. The Vietnamese lady running this place was warm and cheerful, she even offered us some extra Vietnamese herbs / leaves to go with our food. Will return!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114526888080484240214/reviews
KW Yoke,4,"Tried the traditional banhmi which was huge and the baguette was super crispy and crunchy. But the ingredients tasted a bit more meh, there was a generous amount of pate and veggie but they were cold and somehow didn't fit as well as I expected?

I feel like I just picked the wrong thing this time maybe, should give other dishes another go",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101653153694763341697/reviews
LHL,3,Ordered the beef pho and dried vermicelli pork noodles via deliveroo. Overall found the food average - the pho stock could be abit richer and was lacking umami,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116723119253898366977/reviews
