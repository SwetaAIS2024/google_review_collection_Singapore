CW,2,"The $5 set with a huge chicken drumstick is value for money, comes with some Achar & half a boiled egg.
The steam rice is as expected, too soft & mushy. The drumstick skin is crispy & the meat is moist, but tasted very bland, totally no seasoning at all! The curry gravy is also not very tasty & lack of curry fragrance. Not what I've expected after reading the good reviews.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113626212339632338435/reviews
Saiful Anwar (Saiful Anwar),5,"No matter which rice you’re having, there are different varieties of option you can add for your rice. Had the fried chicken breast option, it was so tender and soft. Most of the time I would think that it will be hard to eat, but this doesn’t disappoint. As with the other menu option, prices are really good.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117916840836722733797/reviews
Eugene Leong,5,"My go to for Malay cuisine at FoodHub. Will usually go for the Fried Chicken Thigh with steamed rice. The dish is paired with achar, and tangy sambal, giving a nice kick to the food. The curry poured over the rice is also really savoury, and all in all, is not spicy. Recommend!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113074711194859754693/reviews
Leng,5,"Take away.  Fried Chicken plus mutton curry.
Eat it 30 min later, still crispy.
Chicken is average good, less salt, not juicy but not dry at all.
The mutton curry is Wow.

Will definitely go back to try on other.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100806345391205394801/reviews
