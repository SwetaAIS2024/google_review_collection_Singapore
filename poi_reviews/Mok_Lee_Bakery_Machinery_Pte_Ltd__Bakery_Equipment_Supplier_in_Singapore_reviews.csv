The Flour Department,5,"Thank you Kelly from Mok Lee for always giving recommendations and advises on the machinery and equipment. Fast response and smooth delivery. We were very pleased by their both on sales and after sales services provided whenever we need assistance.

We will work together again, highly recommended!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112055806974936228926/reviews
Ian Ferdinand,1,"I am extremely dissappointed with your aftersales.

Your technician is unprofessional. In september. you charge me 100SGD to come for just a rewiring of my 2 door counter freezer.

Then you tell me just rewiring. This time it is the same problem. Same symptom.

But your technician simply tell last time is this problem now is different problem with faulty capacitor.
so why cant he change the capacitor in the first place? why do y'all just fix minorly and not address the underlying problems. If it is an issue with the compressor. that is different. but this is the same group of issue.
Why you cannot solve this the last time? it is literally same symptom. then every time break down I pay 100SGD?

Worse still is now for labour its 130SGD? this dont make any professional sense.

And when we buy Mok Lee Equipment. we are simply hostages.

Your staff talk bad about their other colleagues which has nothing to do with me.

I am so angry with your service. and I willl never ever come back to you anymore!

The industry is evolving and your competitors are more professional. Prices are not cheap as well. Terrible dated company.

For me to feel so strongly about this company is really something out of the ordinary.

Avoid at all cost!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116471601623623732656/reviews

Eunjin Kim,5,"I have a old Unox oven and initially I wanted to dispose them as I thought it could cost too much to get it fixed. Hence, I sent it to MokLee for disposal and Mr Wiliam (their boss) didn’t give up and explained that my oven is nice one and he helped to fix it at really reasonable price. With all Mok Lee team’s help I was able to bake my cake on time for my student and kept my promise to him.

The boss and the staffs are sincere and can trust.

Thank you so much!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103285065164181334159/reviews
