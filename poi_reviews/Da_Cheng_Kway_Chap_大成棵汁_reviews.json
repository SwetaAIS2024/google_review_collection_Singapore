All general ingredients were good but the most important part of the dish was the pork, the pork was tender and soft. This place is far from my place so I will rarely come here, but if I do pass by, I will come re visit again",

The meal comes with fish cake with chilli, pork intestines with a bit of funky aftertaste, tou fun which is pretty decent, braised egg which needs a bit more soaking, the pork belly can be more tender. Maybe I came about 8 in the morning, the ingredients are not soaked enough in the salty broth. Nice auntie cooking at the store and they accept cashless payment",
