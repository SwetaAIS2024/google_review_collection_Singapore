      "text": "Extremely grateful to Dr Gowreeson for his sane and incisive approach to treating a recent complex foot ankle and knee trauma. Unlike many in the medical and pharmaceutical industries, I believes he  adheres strongly to the principles of the Hippocratic oath and recommends what he thinks is best for the patient utilising his extensive skills and experience. He recommended and initiated immediate contact with a very skilled physiotherapist and ensured that he was updated regularly by the physios on a weekly basis to ensure that healing was going safely according to plan.",

He operated on my right ankle that suffered ligaments tear and it was a success. My recovery has been great so far, and I have no issues resuming my physical activities.",

Requested for a memo letter but was given one that is totally useless.\n\nHe wasn't helpful and all the visits in couple of hundreds were all a waste of money. He kept sending us for X-ray & scans but the root cause hasn't improve at all.\n\nDo avoid consulting Dr Leslie if you can, try other doctors.",
