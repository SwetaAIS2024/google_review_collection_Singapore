K A Y,5,"I send my P3 son there for maths tuition and he enjoyed it alot. No, he is not the studious kind who loves tuition. but he really enjoyed Teacher Horace classes. we have private tutor too but my son says that Teacher Horace explains better. Kiasu maths tuition centre has their own worksheets by topics but also go through other top school papers to make sure the students are on par with other schools. small group size, sometimes even one on one. what I love most about them is their flexibility on make up classes. I've tried many tuition centres and often frustrated about their rigid processes. our family travels alot and really appreciate this flexibility and not just miss and waste the class. Teacher Horace will communicate with me and work out something that works best for both parties.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106741371288854850532/reviews
Jonathan Kang,5,Mr Horace is the best tuition teacher I have met in my lifetime of tuition. He's able to explain the topics really well and is also willing to talk about plans. He definitely refrains from spoonfeeding and gives me tips while I do my practice papers. He's exceptional overall,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110332354848907998404/reviews
Stephanie Ng,5,Plus point that the tuition center is affordable yet provide  the students with attention like a private tutor. My daughter is not easy to handle but Teacher Horace is very professional. He can get along with my daughter like a friend yet strict enough to ensure she behaves and learn effectively.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108250283434288968735/reviews
