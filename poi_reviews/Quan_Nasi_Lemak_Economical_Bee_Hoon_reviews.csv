kennie toh,5,"Good old economic noodles which happen and still holds the economic pricing unlike other ""economic noodles,"". This is truly a store that holds the title ""economic"" at great value price. This has to be the most value pricing economic bee hoon store in Singapore. Come try with bee hoon, chicken wing, fish fillet, egg, Taiwan sausage or anything else and be surprised with the price.

Full credit to the uncle never ending frying at the back and the older auntie infront serving the crowd tirelessly.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115287252962054955508/reviews
Boon Sim “Booms” Ho,5,"i don't understand how they make profit. or are they just a non-profitable funded stall. i see people ordering a lot, and only pay so little.

for instance, one uncle in front of me ordered 2 plates of bee hoon, he added 4 sides per plate. in the end he only pay $4.90!

as for myself, i ordered bee hoon, 1 egg, 1 luncheon meat, half a ngor hiang, half a taiwan sausage (yes they allow you to choose half) and it's only $2.30! what!? where can you find this kind of price in 2025!?

of course it's not the best that i have tasted, but if i could, i would rather choose to eat at this stall than other stalls even if they taste a little better. like the one near my place, just 1 beehoon with 1 egg and 1 fish fillet is already $3.20 knn.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109243927974836330972/reviews
Justin Xiao,5,"Stall number 01-21.
There is always a long queue at this place because the prices are so good on a Saturday morning usually you get about 10 people in the line.
I don’t think they’re there to make a profit because the prices are so low as well per packet. I don’t think I’ve found a cheaper place in Singaporr. They sell bee Hoon packets",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114147367394477307367/reviews

jonathan foo,4,"Probably the BEST lowest price for budget meal for breakfast n early lunch. Couple in their 60s selling there for many years. They keep prices down for a reason, to support lowly income residents. Give tips if you can afford as a good gesture for their kind hearted service there.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117572741060532158968/reviews
