      "text": "Checked out the newly opened @kdolsot.bbq and it‚Äôs quite an experience!\n\nOpening specials!\nTheir Korean Teppan Chicken Set for just $1 (16-18 Mar) is an insane deal! And if you miss that, there‚Äôs 1-for-1 from 19-25 Mar ‚Äî super worth it too as U.P. is $5.50/set! The set also includes rice, soup & 3 kinds of banchan!\n\nWe also tried their Korean DIY Dolsot BBQ Set (from $19.80 for 2 pax), which comes with 2 kinds of meat, lamian noodles, 4 types of banchan & lettuce ‚Äî so value for money! Plus, their variety of sauces and condiments make the DIY grilling experience extra fun and tasty.\n\nAffordable, delicious, and perfect for a casual Korean BBQ fix. üëèüèº\n\nüìç KDolsot BBQ\n530 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10, #01-2379\nSingapore 560530 (inside S11 Food House)",

      "text": "affordable and delicious DIY Korean BBQ experience, this new Dolsot BBQ spot in AMK is a must-try! We ordered the 2-3 pax DIY Dolsot BBQ set ($19.80), and it was a great value for the price.\n\nThe set came with juicy chicken and pork, springy lamian, fresh lettuce wraps, and four types of flavorful banchan. Everything was fresh and paired perfectly with their tasty sauces. The DIY grilling made the experience even more fun, and it‚Äôs perfect for sharing with friends or family.\n\nService was friendly, and the atmosphere was cozy. Definitely a great place for a casual BBQ meal without breaking the bank. Will be back to try more!",
