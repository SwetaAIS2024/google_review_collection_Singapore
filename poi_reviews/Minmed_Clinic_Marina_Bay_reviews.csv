WT L,1,"Highly doubt the proficiency and skills of the doctors here. Was issued hydrocortisone steroid cream for eye eczema only to learn that steroids should NOT be applied around the eyes by other clinic. I was told that it could pose risks to my eyes such as cataracts in the long run.

Not only did I not recover from my condition for a month, but was issued something detrimental to my eyes instead?  ðŸ˜‚ do not recommend",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114412715415631793645/reviews

Never had I come across such a condescending and dismissive doctor - if you lack compassion or patience, you are clearly in the wrong profession.
