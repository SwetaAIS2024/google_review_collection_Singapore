      "text": "I went to the Fernvale branch today to consult a doctor because i was having covid symptoms. Doctor Goh was the one who served me, he did the ART quickly, didn‚Äôt even bother to wait 15 mins for the results and asked the staff to quickly dismiss me. When i was collecting my medicines, i asked the staff ‚ÄòThe ART results are out?‚Äô and ‚ÄòI thought have to wait for 15 mins?‚Äô. The lady said the results was out and it‚Äôs negative. I couldn‚Äôt do anything because there was many people at the clinic and i didn‚Äôt want to start any quarrel. When i come home i feel even unwell and i went to take ART at home again, the results is positive. Personally i highly do not recommend this clinic to everyone. Doctor Goh didn‚Äôt give a proper consult and the way he speaks feels like he was trying to dismiss me fast. üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª",
