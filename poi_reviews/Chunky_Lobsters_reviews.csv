Alvin Choo,3,"Chunky Lobsters has relocated to the basement of Havelock 2, and has expanded their menu to include Japanese rice bowls on top of their signature lobster rolls. There are a few counter seats at this location and I understand they still do their lobster rolls via delivery, though you can get the lobster rolls for dining in if you give the owner heads up.

I got their chicken teriyaki and beef rice bowl ($13.90). At this price, my expectations weren't high but it was a serviceable bowl of food. I thought the rice was quite nicely seasoned.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
Hiang Ar,4,"The lobster and scallop capellini pasta was slightly soft but well-separated. The lobster meat was a disappointment; it was a bit hard and lacked the flavor I expected on the other hand, the scallops, which were thick-cut, tasted incredibly fresh. Their tender texture added a delightful contrast to the pasta. The oysters were  fresh, not briny, and perfectly chilled. I was surprised to discover that the yuzu sauce, which I had to pay an additional 50 cents for, wasnâ€™t citrusy at all. I enjoyed the garlic clam dish, which was quite nice. The clams were tender and the garlic providing slight flavour",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101185220797498251612/reviews
Ann Meow,4,"Redeemed burpple 1for1 at $42++ for 2 mentaiko lobster rolls with fries (bill was $50).

Quite generous portion of fries that are crispy. Will need to request for ketchup/chilli. I enjoyed the mentaiko lobster and the buttery toasted roll~ sadly one of the rolls was a little charred.

Overall a satisfying meal but not that mindblowing ðŸ˜‚ the place is nicely decorated with some lobsters and rolls plushies but was really empty on Sunday 7pm.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103882782519150276010/reviews
Roan A,5,"We ordered the new original lobster roll,  surf and turf roll and truffle fries. Their rolls are so delicious that will make you think if you want to order another one. ðŸ˜…  But I must say that it's a bit pricey and the roll is just good for one person and not for a large eater.

The truffle fries is just so-so. Maybe i'm still looking for more truffle taste.

Overall, i will still give this restaurant a 5 star since their specialties really taste special and they have a good and fast service!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114613040629874192080/reviews
K,5,I still remember having chunky lobster at The Cathay a few years ago when each lobster roll was $16 and served with chips ðŸ˜† ordered the Liquid Gold Roll which has lobster and crab meat with melted cheddar cheese and it didnâ€™t disappoint me! Still as good as before (even tho the price is $24 now ðŸ¥²inflation is real). I topped up for the truffle fries ($4) which I thought was pretty decent. Overall I was satisfied with the meal and the price is actually quite reasonable as compared to other places offering lobster roll. Will be back again to try out the lobster pasta options on the menu!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101355792245171031769/reviews
