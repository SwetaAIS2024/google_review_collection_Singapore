      "text": "Food is tasty although it can be too salty. One star less because they're charging an extra 20% fee for the Lunar New Year period! Prices are slightly higher than that popular restaurant at Aljunied. You can order from the kiosks outside or by scanning the QR code on the table. The tables are small and the chairs are also small and uncomfortable. The owner cannot speak English and so she got to rely on her foreign staff if you can't speak mandarin.",

      "text": "Disappointment +1, they always missed out 1 or 2 ingredient(s). And one ingredient could be $3... After you told them, they will just add it in and refry everything together. End up ruin the whole Mala taste and ruin our appetite. So please please please do something about it!! Do not get me wrong, I give one star is because of this issue. The staff are really very friendly and nice. Love them. ( I will come back again for you all to redeem back the 5 stars ok! )\n\nLets talk about the food now. (8.5/10) Their Mala are different from those Mala outside. I always like their mala style no matter is Soup, more gravy nor dry. Kinda must try.\n\nTheir Chuan Chuan is good too, i like it!! Fish and other dishes standard is good and original taste too.\n\nI think this store use to be Labula. You can either choose, table qr scan, cashier payment or the machine outside. (Machine outside sometimes were quite laggy and the picture never display.) So also have to improve on that.",

Never have I tasted SiChuan 红烧牛肉面 in this manner.\n\nThis is my 2nd try at this Chuan Xiang Fang. Equally disappointing on my 1st try when I ordered 青椒烤鱼, where there is no 青椒 at all.\n\nVery disappointing as a beef noodle fan.\n\nPS.: sorry for missing out on sharing photos as the experience has been very bad, so no point in ‘feeding’ my camera.",
