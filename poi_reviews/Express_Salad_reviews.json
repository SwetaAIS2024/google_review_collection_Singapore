The portion is quite big and the vegetables are fresh. All ingredients are well prepared and served.\n\nIf you are looking for a quick bite, give it a try.",

I would say their portion is generous, and the breast meat was fresh and tender. The sauce that goes with it is spicy enough which I like it very much. Location is convenient because is near to MRT, anyone can just grab and go. Service staff has good attitude which make me want to return and try their beef and duck salad next.",
