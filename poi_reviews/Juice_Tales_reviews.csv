HF,5,"When I wanted to embark on juice detox journey in 2019. I did research and managed to find Juice Tales. They are more reasonably priced than other juice programmes. I gave it a try in 2019 and have on-off going back to it till now 2022 as I canâ€™t find one which is value for money as them. Always been my trusted juice shop. Their juice is not like those diluted kind from Fruit juice shop and it is 400ml.

It has been trusted and fresh juice delivery to doorstep everytime. You get notification when a delivery is made. The boss is also very accommodating and a friendly guy.

They definitely worth the 5 stars!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104515207161424518671/reviews
