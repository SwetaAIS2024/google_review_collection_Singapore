It’s got a pleasant aftertaste that is quite different from the usual Jasmine tea we get at Chinese restaurants. Enjoyed the tea very much and it goes well with the cake and apple crumble. So glad that we found this place.",

It’s almost like they’re asking people to “come in!” There’s a wide selection of teas inside with good coffee options too (kopi luwak) and once you’re inside, the dogs won’t really bother you. All they’ll do is keep you company. This place is so cozy and down to earth, nestled in the most unlikely location. Thank goodness we visited!",
