Genta,4,"Watched Wicked here and had a good overall experience! The audio quality was excellent, really immersive, but I felt the visuals could use an upgrade—the screen seemed a bit dated and didn’t feel as vibrant as what you’d find in newer cinemas.

The chairs were on the smaller side but still comfortable enough for the duration of the movie. Loved the cool air conditioning, which was perfect after walking around sunny Singapore!

As a foreigner, I really appreciated the easy online ticketing system—it was smooth and hassle-free. A convenient and reliable option for catching a movie, but an update to the screen would definitely elevate the experience.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117016178934992842533/reviews
Doraemon,5,"Kitty and I had a coupon for Golden Village, so we decided to use it this weekend to watch ""The Successor."" We read great reviews about Golden Village Suntec, particularly mentioning its spacious theater and comfortable seats, so we chose to spend our weekend movie night here.

The service was excellent, and the theater was indeed big and spacious, with really comfortable seats. The seats have armrests that can be lifted up to create a couple's seat, which is a nice touch. We were so comfortable that we didn't feel any discomfort even after sitting for two hours. The sound system was great, too, and the overall movie experience was fantastic.

We also loved ""The Successor""! It was funny, and we had a great laugh.  We really enjoyed the movie and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and entertaining movie experience.

We're definitely giving Golden Village Suntec a 5-star rating.  It's a great cinema with comfortable seating, a great sound system, and excellent service.  We highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great movie experience, especially if you're looking for a good laugh with ""The Successor.""",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112665277904119154671/reviews
tomyumdumpling,5,"Visited the Suntec City golden village for a movie. The ticketing area is quite spacious with plenty queue for the box office and foods.
You will need to take the escalator up from the arcade area. Overall, the place is well air conditioned with a variety of movie options.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108361107100333876893/reviews
Ashley Liew,5,"Clean, comfortable, and spacious cinema halls. The staff are always helpful too. Always a good experience here over the years, ever since I was in schooling days. Keep up the good work! P.S. love the option for hot food to be delivered to just outside the cinema hall when ready!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
胡佳恩Jia En,5,"Golden Village Gold Class Lounge area was spacious and there is a wide selection of food/ drinks/ alcohol with add on charges!

Love the huge adjustable chairs and blanket which makes your movie better!! However, the tickets is more pricey ($39 per ticket)! Will be better if they include free popcorn or drink!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112778829475776252617/reviews
