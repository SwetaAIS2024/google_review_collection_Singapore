Karan Gandhi,5,"Best school ever! Teachers here are so warm, our 3yo daughter had the best time here at the school and daycare. She left the school having learnt so many things to do by herself. But most importantly the qualities she picked up by the caring teachers and principal have really shaped up her personality well. Would recommend this school to everyone looking out for one.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105897588496189091587/reviews
NORMAN CHEN,5,"Dear Teachers of MindChamps @West Coast Plaza,

I am thankful for the holistic learning experience that all of you have provided for my son.

The awesome Teachers (“You”) have helped him adjust to the new environment (away from the comforts of home), and provided an attentive and nurturing approach. You are able to connect with each child in your care, and my son has benefitted from a supportive learning environment. I believe he has fostered a love of learning in the school which I am confident will stay with him for years to come.

The creative and engaging lessons have kept my son interested and excited about learning. And, from my observations (for the past 11 months), I am thankful for your exceptional level of care and attention provided to my son and his classmates.

Sincerely yours,

Norman",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104853950682355357321/reviews
