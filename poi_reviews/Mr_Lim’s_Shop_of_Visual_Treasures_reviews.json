      "text": "A shop of visual treasures indeed! I stumbled upon this gem of a gallery while I was exploring Singapore last May. I was mostly just looking for a break from the heat, but Lim sets such a relaxed, inviting atmosphere, that I ended up spending well over an hour chatting with him and hanging out.\n\nHe has an eclectic, well curated mix of pieces (mostly paintings, but also some installations and sculpture) by well known artists, as well as local and emerging. And the absolute BEST THING about this place, is the lesser known pieces are just as exciting as the big ticket items. I can personally attest to that, as I’m now the proud owner of one of Mr. Lim’s visual treasures - a stunning watercolor by Shang Cheng Xiang. Thanks again Lim! I will certainly be back for more.",

It’s a friendly space and you’re likely to get a great conversation with Mr Lim as well, and maybe with the artists who pop over. Put this on your map, whether you’re a serious collector or just curious.",

His knowledge far outweighs mine and I’ve learned some interesting things from him. On my most recent visit I bought a couple of limited edition prints by a British artist which I am delighted with. I’m looking forwarding to revisiting the shop on my next visit to Singapore!",
