      "text": "My wife and I tried the fish tail curry ( they ran out of fish head $25 at 6.30pm!) and prawn paste chicken $8 ( har cheong gai). The price is higher than the other Zhi char stall a level higher but more than compensated by the generous sized fleshy and super fresh fish tail. The curry was naturally sweetened by the onions, eggplant, and okra, and has just the right sourness including a couple of unripe pineapple slices. We slurped up almost all the curry.\n\nThe prawn paste chicken pieces are slightly bigger than the stall on the 3rd stall, and definitely more juicy.\n\nThere are many zhi char stalls in the same food center so it's tough competition. But this one has won my heart.",
