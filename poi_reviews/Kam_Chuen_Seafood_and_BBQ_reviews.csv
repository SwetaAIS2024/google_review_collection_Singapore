Fairy,2,"Teh C was nice.

Kaya butter toast tasted mediocre. The butter tasted a bit strange.

Wontons were tiny and the soup tasted of MSG. But I like the vegetables that came with it.

Shaun Lim Sheng Hui,5,"Honestly, I love the food here. The wanton noodle is always tasting great with the noodles, char siew and soup combined! The staff and manager there is friendly too. Pork rib king is very nice. Meat is fresh and tastes very good. Food takes a short time to be served. Affordable too. Highly recommend!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103828909860768100693/reviews
