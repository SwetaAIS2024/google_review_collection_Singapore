jpm,2,"Eh. Having tried once I won't return here. That about sums up my thoughts on this place.

It was off peak and I was the only customer. Yet the staff were more interested to chat among themselves and got my order wrong.

The rice is quite little. I have a regular male appetite and I had to get a bun afterwards in order to feel full.

Taste? Quite average. Price? Not so good compared to some of my regular places.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107587473700248132752/reviews

Duc Huy Nguyen,3,"The price is affordable, the food looks good and feels also good.

It seems always crowded.

There were almost no available table when I was having my meal today, a lot of families having hotpot together. So I had to share a table with three other people.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103411313343181585102/reviews
