Gini Violet,5,"Review
My wife and I have been coming to this clinic for a few years now. Dr Felix Tan is a kind and patient doctor who listens attentively and takes good care of his patients. He takes the time to explain the readings of blood tests, medications and how to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Even though this means a slightly longer waiting time, I think itâ€™s worth coming here for a visit. Keep up the good work!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108969897664496331446/reviews
Simply Me,1,"I am extremely disappointed with the service at Shenton Medical Clinic at Changi Business Park. My teenage daughter took a Grab ride to this clinic as it was the nearest to our home. The clinic's stated closing time is 5:30 PM, and she arrived at 3:15 PM, well before the cut-off time. However, she was denied registration by the counter staff, who claimed they had stopped taking in patients due to being ""overwhelmed.""

When I called to clarify the situation, the counter staff informed me that the decision to close registration early came directly from the doctor, citing a queue of 15 patients. I requested that she check with the doctor to reconsider, but she refused and instead told me to visit other branches.

I find this unacceptable. The clinic still had 2 hours and 15 minutes until closing time. It is absurd for a healthcare facility to turn away patients when there is still ample time to manage the queue. This lack of empathy and professionalism is disappointing, especially for a clinic that should prioritize patient care.

I hope the management addresses this issue and implements measures to provide more considerate service in the future.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106791999043573720833/reviews
Ricky Ho,1,"I had a mixed experience during my visit to the clinic this week. While the doctors were exceptional and very professional, my interaction with the receptionist was disappointing. Her attitude was dismissive and unfriendly, which is unfortunate because patients visiting a clinic are often already unwell and need kindness and understanding.

I hope the management can address this to ensure all staff represent the same level of care and professionalism as the doctors.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100262580389372509503/reviews
