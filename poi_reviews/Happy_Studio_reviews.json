To make it worse, she charged me twice the previous rate. One extra star because at least she was nice, just didn't cut hair well. Now I need to find a new salon because I won't go back ☹️.",

She got impatient and  she did not even ask if it was ok and just clean off, as there are other customer waiting. Shouldnt you cut the customer’s hair untill satisfied? Very bad experience, end results looked like did not even had any cut, paid $15 dollars for it",
