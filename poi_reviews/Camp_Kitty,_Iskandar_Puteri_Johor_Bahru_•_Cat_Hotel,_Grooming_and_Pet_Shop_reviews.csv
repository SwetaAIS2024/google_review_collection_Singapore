Noor Hazwani,5,"I boarded my two cats, Ollie and Ottie at Camp Kitty, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the experience! From the moment we arrived, the staff was welcoming, attentive, and truly cared about making my cats feel comfortable.

Ottie can be a bit shy and easily scared, but the team was so patient and gentle with him. Ollie, on the other hand, is more adventurous, and I loved that they provided plenty of playtime and enrichment for both of them. The facility was clean, cozy, and thoughtfully designed with cats‚Äô needs in mind. I also appreciated the regular updates and photos‚Äîthey really eased my mind while I was away.

If you‚Äôre looking for a safe, loving, and well-managed boarding option for your feline friends, I highly recommend Camp Kitty. Ollie and Ottie will definitely be visiting again and are already looking forward to their stay during Hari Raya! ‚ù§Ô∏è",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101662920480557576407/reviews
Eko Bachtiar,5,"Very caring, nurturing and accomodating caregivers. Spacious and clean environment for the furbabies.
Love the shop ambience too. Serene, tidy and modern looking. They sell various bites and pet needs, including the much needed vitamin.

The best thing about having our baby doing his staycayion here is that CAMP KITTY is CERTIFIED and TRAINED in managing pet care . So one less thing to worry about.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116070190574796420637/reviews
radziah,5,"I have been sending my cats to Camp Kitty for boarding and grooming since 2022, and I can confidently say that Camp Kitty is one of the top cat hotels and grooming services around. The place is clean, and the cats are well taken care of. The staff are also very friendly. I‚Äôve previously sent my cats to other places, but the service was not as good as Camp Kitty. That said, I do hope Camp Kitty can extend their check-in and check-out hours. Also, I really hope they will open a new branch in the Permas area, please!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106379186776685640951/reviews
