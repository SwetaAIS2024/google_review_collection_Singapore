Junpeng Huang,5,"Authentic Japanese Karaoke lounge. Not many in SG nowadays. Full list of Japanese songs as well as other languages too.
Brought my japanese clients there and they enjoyed so much as the pr manager can speak fluent japanese and the ambience is perfect for a japanese club.
Overall the spending is still lower than chinese flower clubs.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113005800297651385079/reviews

T N,3,"Girls are nice, but be careful with the black bald guy at the cashier: he tries to fraud customers. I confirmed with the girl that I ordered 20 drinks ($15 per glass) only, but he counted it as 45 drinks on purpose ðŸ˜…
So the difference was $375 ðŸ™„
Every time I order, they ask for my signature, and at that time the quantity is correct, but at the end of the checkout, the quantity suddenly increases. All Japanese people, be careful!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100297066496670623962/reviews
