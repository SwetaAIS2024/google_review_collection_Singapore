anandhi rajagopalan,5,"We recently enrolled our son, 9 year old on the autism spectrum at MIS. We relocated back to Singapore last year from the US and are pleasantly surprised at the inclusive and comprehensive curriculum at MIS on par with american standards. The entire team is so knowledgeable in understanding children with neurological differences and they customize their curriculum accordingly.  Through their unique arts based approach they provide  well rounded education by making learning fun.  My son gets to enjoy his school life just like his peers who are neurotypical. Wholeheartedly recommend MIS if you are looking for inclusive school with high quality education.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114780242656999246532/reviews
