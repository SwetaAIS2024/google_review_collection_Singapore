Calvin Teah,5,"Went for the Chicken Tikka Tandoori Set w/Naan for $8.50. I have the say I didn't have high expectations after seeing my plate as the naan and chicken looked dry. I couldn't be more wrong.

The naan was soft and chewiness was just right. The chicken was tender and juicy too. I was even delighted by the onion garnish that didn't have the raw taste so often found elsewhere. Overall, a surprisingly delicious dinner!

P.S. I was mildly surprised that the stall owner uncle didn't ask for payment upfront which is usually the norm when there is waiting time. He was also busy preparing dishes when I returned after 15 min to collect my food. Thus, I told him I will just leave the money on the table and he trusted me without checking. Truly see his commitment in ensuring his customers get the food ASAP and also the trust in the customers!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100257982429425413908/reviews
