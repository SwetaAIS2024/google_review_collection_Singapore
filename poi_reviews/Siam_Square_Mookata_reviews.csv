thelevitator,5,"Ate here with friends twice, and the mookata is amazing. There is free ice cream (a la carte free 1st cup, buffet is free flow i believe), something you dont find very often with mookata. Meat is also plentiful for the price. Will come again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102689218568385117662/reviews
Lmao Lol,1,"I do not recommend this. I ordered buffet and they said it comes with free complimentary unlimited drinks. However, while we were checking out, they charged us for all the drinks. Their seafood was not fresh as well and i would not recommend this to anyone. Unethical company!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106372115821860074644/reviews
Kendrick Wee,3,"Prices are very reasonable. There is a buffet option but items $4 and above are excluded. I think al carte option is good enough and perhaps more worth it. Fish paste noodle was best dish, did not seems to be found easily else where. Meat selection was great. I feel everything was generally sweet, not sure if itâ€™s just sugar or some seasoning. Drinks are reasonably price. Expect to wait during peak hours.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115793547912532718349/reviews
Lyn Lyn,4,"Good place to eat bbq in air-conditioning place. It has an exhaust fan above each table. The food was good and the prawns were fresh. And I like the chilli sauce too. Service was prompt but maybe due to busy timing, at multiple times the service staff literally threw the empty gas can into the waste bin which lead to loud noise. This was quite unpleasant. I hope the Operator can look into this. Other than that, it's a great place to dine.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111715484324240200504/reviews
Kelvin Teo,4,"Good aircon Mookata place. Ambiance is good with individual smoke exhaust per table. You will not smell like BBQ after meal.
Affordable price, Serve large portion at averagely 2.20 per plate.
Overall taste not too bad, worth the money.
the Thai milk tea is the only not so great option, too watery.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107858420908005296405/reviews
