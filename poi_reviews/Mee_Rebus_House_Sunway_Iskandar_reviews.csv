Vivian Ching,4,"We ordered mee rebus chicken most of the time, the portion was quite good. The restaurant offer self service, place order with QR code, pick up order at counter and pay. Fast serving. The area will be quite hot during lunch time. Convenient parking.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118362852105604467424/reviews
Peng Tang,5,Break away from traditional stall style and the upgrade is delightful from overall atmosphere to selection of furnitures. Taste is as delicious as the one in Taman Melody. Ice tea with lime is gorgeous especially under the sun. Good efforts!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108364107965679405367/reviews

Aslimah Ahmad,2,"Was here on 28 Dec 2023 at 11am.The mee rebus is nice...however it was served cold not hot. Even the fried burung puyuh is cold & not crispy and you know it is not fresh from the stove. Infm the staff and she claimed that all the food from hq and they only pre heat. But even if its pre heat it was not hot. Infm the 2 staffs and they claim ignorant.
I will only gv credit to the ambience but bcos of the food not serve hot & the service of the staff ..i can only grade 2 star for this. Staff need to go for training. Its a waste when the food is nice but serve cold.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105719789846600946842/reviews
