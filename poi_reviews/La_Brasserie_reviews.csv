Pampams K.,5,"We chose La Brasserie to celebrate our Valentine’s Day, and it was nothing short of exceptional. From the moment we arrived, everything was perfect 10/10 experience. The food was absolutely delightful, and the service was top-notch. The staff were incredibly attentive, always checking in to ensure everything was perfect. Their professionalism and warmth made the evening even more special. The ambiance is simply divine. It was elegant in its own ways. I would recommend this place for couples.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106757780440978318952/reviews
Sarah soong,5,"Really like the high ceiling, classy decor, color scheme of the interiors and the nice view. Looks very elegant and is a nice place for catching up with friends or for a date. Service is professional and warm. Tasting menu is good value and like the beef tartare and desserts. Good selection of wine by glass and champagnes.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110437386437684080335/reviews

Lina Duong,3,"I picked Là Brasserie to celebrate Valentine’s Day. Although service was good and food was not bad (fish was well cooked but beef tartare was chewy and foie grass didn’t impress us), I think this venue is more suitable for a casual or business dinner than for a romantic evening.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114650495933086250529/reviews
