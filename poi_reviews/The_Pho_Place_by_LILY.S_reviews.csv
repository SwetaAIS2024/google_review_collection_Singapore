Ed. C.,5,"Delicious Mala rendition of Minced Beef Pho. Mala flavour of the soup wasn’t too strong, allowing the savouriness of the pho soup to come through. Flavour of fresh ingredients come through the Summer Roll. House special beverage is a refreshing drink of mint, lime, lemon grass, etc. and Ice vietnamese coffee taste legit.

Great service of turning the air cooler towards my seat when a kitchen staff found out I was feeling warm. A life saver after a hike at the rail corridor. Enjoyed the quiet afternoon having lunch here.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111656975543850257355/reviews
AP.,4,"I actually enjoy my meal there in the nice clean environment. Bahn mi is tasty! I only wish the pho beef could be cook slightly under to enjoy the true flavours of the beef. As you all can see from the herbs, everything is so fresh and nicely done up! I will be back again if I’m in the area.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106056676459865700680/reviews
Joel Cheng,4,"Had the banh mi, pho, rolls, and pomelo salad.

I think the banh mi was the best item - bread was light and crispy, meat well seasoned and cooked, and vegetables were fresh.

Rolls and the salad were fresh and tasty as well - Tiger prawns in particular were done seared nicely.

We had the classic beef pho which was decent. Portion was in the smaller side, the sliced beef could have been put in slightly later (was almost cooked through when served). The broth was passable, I’ve had better (more complex, flavourful) elsewhere.

Overall still and enjoyable meal!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113835237492939022476/reviews
Timothy Utteridge,4,"The dishes were tasty, especially the paté and ham bánh mì, and the lemongrass chicken salad, but the shop is rather soulless and although the staff are efficient, it was in a sad, listless mood - not many smiles. The walls of the cafe are without decoration and the tables and chairs modern and functional; whilst tacky Vietnamese kitschy decoration wouldn’t add anything, a little bit of colour (?flowers, ?a plant, ?vases, ?prints) would make it more personal and lively. All rather gloomy and flat. The opening hours are now just Friday to Sunday, but recommended if around King Albert Park and looking for a bite to eat on those days.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112984146789151884811/reviews
Alan Liem,5,"I love hot, clear and flavourful soup especially on a rainy day. Always satisfied with Lily's Vietnamese broth that is full flavour and so easy to finish. I alway love their specialty pho with beef short ribs cooked so tender and delicious. Last week I tried their braised duck pho which blew my taste buds! Definite worth savouring with a cup of smooth drip coffee to perk up a beautiful day. The restaurant has friendly and attentive staff. Manager Trevor is thoughtful, accommodating and friendly with his excellent service. Will come again and again!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109757653166670829551/reviews
