For $9.90 nett it is really cheap.\n\nDining environment is cosy - good music, peaceful and clean. Staff are polite.\n\nThis place is a hidden gem.\n\nLots of parking lots in Joo Chiat Complex.",

I would consider it slightly overpriced because the portion is way too little but again, it isn't very expensive.\n\nWould I recommend eating there? No.\n\nWould I recommend drinking there? Probably but it won't be my top few choices when I think about places to drink.",
