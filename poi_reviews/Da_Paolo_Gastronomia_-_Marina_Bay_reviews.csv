Ivan Loh,2,"Da Paolo Gastronomia at Marina Bay Sands offers a great location with stunning views, making it the perfect spot for people watching. Unfortunately, the food didn‚Äôt live up to the setting. It felt below average, with many dishes seemingly pre-prepared and just heated up when you order. For the quality, the prices are unreasonably high. While the atmosphere is lovely, the food didn‚Äôt justify the cost. It‚Äôs a great place for drinks or a quick snack, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it for a proper meal.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114542374982525257775/reviews
