There are happy hour offerings that further enhance our experience, complemented by the added bonus of reasonably priced dishes on their enticing menu. Although we never order any food as we have other plans we will consider next time :)",

It had that “stinky” old bar smell of stale beer and mixed cooking smells. It was dark inside. They only had two beers on tap. Heineken and Guinness! No craft beer! They had a good collection of bottled spirits though if that’s your thing. The Pizza was r 1/2 bad, and the Filipina server was pleasant enough. I won’t be back though. It was gloomy and smelly. No thanks!",

      "text": "There really is something special about this place as only fun and interesting people seem to visit here and when you combine that with the incredibly friendly and professional service it creates a truly awesome atmosphere that makes me repeatedly come back for more. The beers and whisky prices are the lowest I have come across in Singapore, take home bottle prices are even cheaper than a supermarket. The Smoked Salmon bruschetta is really lovely and so is the Chicken Tikka masala!\n\nLooking forward to my next visit here, it's a great excuse for me to do my whisky shopping at the same time!",

Portion size was v generous, and at the original price it would have been still considered good value. Two lady staffs were friendly especially to our children. Serving was fast, and draft beers were super fresh. Ill visit again.",
