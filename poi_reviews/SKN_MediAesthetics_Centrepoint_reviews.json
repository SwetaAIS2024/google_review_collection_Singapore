My skin has improved, pores are smaller and the scars are less deep.\nMy family members can see the difference as well.\n\nI have oily skin and skin clogs easily. Liz, who is my therapist, is patient and very through with facial extraction. She is friendly, professional and service oriented.\n\nI have been lucky to benefit from their expertise. Their service and results have been excellent and I would happily recommend their service",
