Emmanuelle Berger,1,"After surgery, surgeon advised to change dressing during 1 week on my helper's wound. She went to this clinic: Doctor Lau asked her to come every day during 2 weeks, criticized the way the surgery has been done, wanted to redo the work at his clinic. About cleaning and desinfecting, he refused to prescribe the products to my helper, saying that he wont share the details of what he is doing as it is his business. On the other way, he prescribed tons of antibiotics.
This doctor is not honest at all and abuses of people weakness.

Edmund Ong,5,"Recently, I had an accident that caused a laceration on my foot. Dr Lau and nurse  offered to help me change my wound dressing daily for free and to check for any signs of infection in my wound.

Dr Lau and nurse are both warm, caring, and genuine people. While their clinic may not have the most modern appearance, they certainly do not lack expertise or quality service.

Hi Dr Lau and mdm, if you are both reading this: thanks for the chats and remember to take breaks and rest both!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106729072459815962651/reviews
Kenny Zhang,1,"Tactless in telling my wife she needs to lose weight, and after she said she has lost 10kg through exercise over some time, commented “then how come still looks bloated”. If someone lashes out at this clinic one day I’m not surprised. Was only here because we were in the area. Should’ve just gone to the regular clinic the next day.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114710665483657813415/reviews
Risaki Sanako,5,"Someone I know introduced this place to me, she had a skin disease for a very long time and she went to many places but cannot cure. But then she went here and they gave her medication and her skin disease got a lot better. I also have a skin disease so she told me to come here. I also went to many places but my skin condition still worsened. But then I went here a few days ago and it really surprised me. When I went to other places, they only told me the medications to take but here, the doctor told me very specifically some causes of my skin disease and how to prevent it. When I went to other places, they never told me what kind of skin disease but just eczema. But the doctor here told me it was fungus eczema and he also asked some questions (eg. How often I change my bed sheets, whether or not I use rackets) then he told me what I should do so that my skin condition doesn't get worse. I thought I was going for lessons hahah",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113686762810718079752/reviews
