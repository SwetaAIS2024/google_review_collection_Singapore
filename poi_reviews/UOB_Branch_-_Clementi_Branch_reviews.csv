celinemy,3,"Went there to open a savings account account (foreigner), better to queue 10-15mins ahead. Staff was friendly but seems their laptop was too old and system was too slow, I ended up there almost two hours to wait until they finish the process (and still need to wait for a week for approval, activating your account in person again)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113590329818045001653/reviews

Jinzhi Pei,5,"I was at this branch yesterday and was served by Ms Noraini.
She was pleasant and efficient.  She never seemed to get flustered and steadily completed the 2 transactions I had to do without any difficulties. She knows her work well. Her pleasant demeanour and kind personality make it a pleasure to deal with her.
Wishing her the best in her career and congratulating UOB for having such a wonderful staff.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104016069544962341012/reviews
