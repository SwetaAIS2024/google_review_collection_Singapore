Ashley Liew,5,"Katong Shopping Centre may be an old mall that had been around for decades since I was a kid but is still going strong. I appreciate how their car park lots have been widened. The indoor food court Gourmet Centre at basement one is fantastic with famous stalls like the chicken rice stall. It also has many legitimate and trusted maid agencies, and we are grateful for our foreign domestic worker coming from one of the agencies here. Even has a charming aquarium too. Will be back! üôèüèª",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews

Kent Wu,4,"Iconic shopping mall. Despite malls like Parkway Parade, i12, Katong Square, Katong Shopping Centre is still serving the katong area well. I am particularly impressed by the parking lots. They are larger than Changi Airport's parking lots!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117916171298040384511/reviews
Karen Y,4,Have not been there for close to 30 years. Went recently and was pleasantly surprised to see more food places. The yummy chicken rice is still there and still as good. Shopping centre looks frozen in the 80s IMO. High time for a revamp but still gives off the old is gold feel.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115682234911734888127/reviews
