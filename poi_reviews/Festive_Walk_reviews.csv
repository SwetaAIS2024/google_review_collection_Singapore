Daniel Sin,4,Festive Walk in RWS is normally filled with crowd even for weekdays if not for COVID-19 that tourist kind of disappear and now only local visit Sentosa.

Kaptain Kerr,4,"This place is a cool part of the excellent Resorts World complex. Best way to describe is a very wide walkway with a combo of steps, ramps and escalators, going between the main Resorts World area and the Sentosa Merloin. It's under a really high roof with a lovely spacious feel, with water fountains and restaurants on both sides to complete the atmosphere.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111145456892345385117/reviews
