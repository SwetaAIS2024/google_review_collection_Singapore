Jill Li,1,"Can u believe this is the portion of S$15 asparagus, I'm not sure about the price of asparagus in the market, maybe is just too expensive to serve a proper portion.
Other than that, I think it has been years that I had this kind of lousy dim sum around the whole world, I can only taste msg in the  deep dried carrot cake, honestly I really don't understand how this restaurant score 4. 7,  now I know why the restaurant is so empty during Sunday lunch time, if u wanna find out, feel free to waste your money and try your luck.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101894799314957008738/reviews
Di Di,5,"The outlet is clean and brightly lit. There is not much customers even though it was lunch hours as the renovation works might have blocked the restaurant. The noodles were served hot and rather promptly. The tables were cleared promptly too when I left.

I could taste the five spice powered in the beef brisket noodles and the shallots added a flavour and crunch taste to the dish. The soup tasted more of that for duck noodles. Nonetheless, I love the soup so much that I finished drinking it.

It is not my first time here. I remember that it was pretty crowded during lunch hours previously and I had to wait to be seated.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews
Ridduan Kasman,5,"Went to Dim Sum place for lunch after going to Expo for the convention. Was greeted by friendly staff that ask if i needed a baby chair as my toddler was with me. Seated us at a table with the baby chair already place there.

Ordered food via the QR code and the food came quick which is good as we were starving. The garlic fried rice with onsen egg was very delicious. We also had the deep fried carrot cake, egg tart and chee chor fun. We paired with pu er and chrysanthemum tea.

Overall food and service is excellent.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105958796541225012548/reviews
