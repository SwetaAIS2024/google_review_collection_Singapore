      "text": "I had the pleasure of dining at Kaveri Vegetarian Restaurant at Singapore’s T3 airport, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the masala dosa, initially expecting it to be bland, as airport food often tends to be. However, when it arrived, I was blown away by the incredible taste! The dosa was crispy, perfectly spiced, and had a rich flavor that I didn’t anticipate. The price was very reasonable for the quality, making it a worthwhile choice.\n\nIf you’re a fan of South Indian cuisine or simply looking for a flavorful meal while waiting at the airport, I highly recommend Kaveri Vegetarian Restaurant. It’s a great spot to indulge in delicious food without compromising on taste or value.",
