Seah Jia Hui,3,"Average curry rice, definitely not one of Singapore top rated food unfortunately. Tastes like average caifan. Price wise, normal. $3 for 3 veg. Portion wise, personally  I think it’s ok as I’m not a big eater but my colleague thought it’s too less.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109933240025657790273/reviews
C Irene,5,"Reasonably priced at $3.50 for 1 meat & 1 veg. Taste wise is acceptable - ordinary home cooked food that's enjoyable. Bean sprouts are crunchy, not overcooked. Aubergine is lightly seasoned & not oily. Curry is light & non spicy. What I like most is that food is not overly salted or sweet.

While the the timing says 9am, this stall is open as early as 7am.

Accepts PayLah & CDC vouchers.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118420782488606352263/reviews
