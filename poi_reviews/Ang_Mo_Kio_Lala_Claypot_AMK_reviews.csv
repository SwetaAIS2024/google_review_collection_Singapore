S Neo,5,"Lala Pot is a must-try! The soup base is incredibly delicious, and they offer a fantastic variety of ingredients to choose from. What really elevates the experience is the impressive selection of chili and sauces, ensuring there's something to please every palate. Oh, and don't leave without trying their fried chicken – it's absolutely delicious!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114217743275843483519/reviews

Andrew Lim,5,"If you’re in the area or not it’s definitely a place you want to try. The charcoal hotpot, the quality of the ingredient used, the most friendly staff, it all adds to the great experience. Expect that the costs are very reasonable, the staff always helpful and there a tonne of condiment like chilli, sesame oil etc that is on offer for you to make sauce.

A must visit and eat for sure",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101180085240697824940/reviews
Ming,2,Felt bloated the whole after dinner here and vomitted the next morning and fell sick with fever and diarrhea. Actually the lala hotpot soup was nice but this experience won't make me wanna go back again. Could be hygiene issue that you need a strong stomach to eat here :(,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109226628464118431877/reviews
