kvindou,4,"Cook food is not bad but not the bbq meats. Bbq meats seems like over cook and doesn't have enough taste. But the bbq 韭菜suprisingly is the best I ever eaten. Tsing Tao beer is very cheap, only $4 per bottle. Price for food is counted cheap too. Overall still ok.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117626381610896987417/reviews

Gerard James Rozario,5,"First time we tried 1 months back. It was really good. Yesterday again, still good. They increase price to some of their items. Overall very affordable. Real hidden gem in Pioneer North. They sell their own china beer also haha. On yes and we order the the bun, not in pictures but it’s really good too.

Chan Chuan Lun,4,"The whole food court is filled with wooden round tables, doesn't look like a typical food court, like a restaurant or mixed. One side selling tze char, Indian food, hk roasted delights, the other side is North-eastern China food. Looking at the menu board, it has 100 items, and more not on the signage. Not my first visit. But this time I only had a mapo tofu rice, at $4. Pretty rare price.  Authentic taste.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117750242658819103505/reviews
