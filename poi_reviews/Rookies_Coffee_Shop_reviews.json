A highlight is the cafe latte, which is noted for its creamy texture and delicious flavor.

Didn‚Äôt expect too much but the coffee was actually really solid. Smooth, strong, and really really enjoyable. Overheard the guys talking to other customers about coffee and can really tell they're knowledgeable of their craft.  Place has a chill vibe, not too crowded on a Tuesday afternoon. This joint is worth checking out.",

The distinct notes elevated the whole experience (Is there tangerine ??)\n\nVery unassuming place, glad I made a trip specially for this coffee. Totally no regrets!",

You can tell he‚Äôs completely mad (in the best way) about coffee and genuinely cares about giving you a great experience. The kind of person who‚Äôll make you a brew and a believer.\n\nHighly recommend trying their single origin ‚Äî it‚Äôs like a flavour burst for your tastebuds. And if you‚Äôre feeling a bit cheeky, go for the latte with coffee jelly. Sounds odd, tastes brilliant. Honestly, I‚Äôd come back just for that wobbly little surprise in a cup.\n\nIf you‚Äôre anywhere nearby, pop in. If you‚Äôre not, travel there anyway ‚Äî it‚Äôs worth the pilgrimage!",
