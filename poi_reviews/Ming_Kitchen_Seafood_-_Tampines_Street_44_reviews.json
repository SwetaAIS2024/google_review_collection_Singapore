      "text": "The food portion was so horrible and less. The price for the salted egg prawn ball is $20 and the portion you can see from my photo. The prawn paste chicken is $14 and totally not worth it. The assam fish is a bit oily. I will not patron the place again as the portion is not worth the price. We can get better food with generous portion. Pretty disappointed with the food.",

      "text": "Food here is a 3.5/5.\n\nSome days the food is incredibly good, other days it can be meh. It's a bit of a mixed bag, but I'd say most days the food is pretty good.\n\nMy subjective take is that the food tends to taste a bit lacklustre midweek, especially for the Thursdays lunch service. The portions on the lacklustre days also seem smaller than the norm.\n\nDishes here worth trying: the spare ribs; kong pow chicken; ginger and scallion pork; mee goreng; salted egg chicken (get the one with the added sauce); sliced fish soup.\n\nIn terms of service, well the eatery gets the job done ie ensure that you are fed at a reasonable price.\n\nQuick tip: when ordering for take out at peak hours eg 11.30am to 1pm or 6pm to 7.30pm, be prepared to wait up to 40mins.",
