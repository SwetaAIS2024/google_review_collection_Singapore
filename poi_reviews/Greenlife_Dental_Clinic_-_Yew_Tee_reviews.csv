gloria abcede,5,"Dr. Judy Cheng provided excellent care, and I felt she went above and beyond in comparison to my previous dental experiences. She cleaned my teeth thoroughly, and I could feel the difference in how deep the cleaning was. She took the time to explain my dental situation in detail, making sure I fully understood and offering helpful advice. Her assistant Angeline was also very attentive and kind, which made the visit even more comfortable.

Win Lei Lei Myo,5,"Review for Dr. Dennis Soh,
I went to clinic for dental treatment and teeth cleaning. He is an extremely meticulous and careful dentist. He checked every tooth carefully and was very gentle during the dental treatment process. I did not much pain or discomfort at all. After the session, he gave me some tips on improving dental health such as the proper type of toothbrush to use and what I can do to improve my dental health.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115865930793141287750/reviews

F D,5,"I had my first visit, and it was a great experience. Dr. Ben attended to me, and I must say he's excellent at what he does.

Additionally, his explanations were clear and transparent, outlining all potential risks so I knew exactly what to expect.
