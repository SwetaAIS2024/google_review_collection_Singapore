Only way to activate is bring NRIC down to branch. Now they eat up all my money with available balance zero due got freezed up. No transaction allowed! Worst bank. Awhile later increase wait more than 4hours! Really absurd! Why canâ€™t they emulate like other bank where u can activate domain account online thru internet banking? Now we have digital NRIC via Singpass.",

I have wasted my time calling helpdesk the whole day to settle the issue. During the account application, she told me to download the app and wait for her but when the whole application end, she didn't help me on the apps. I also feel that the whole crew from this branch is unapproachable.",

BOC has a more thorough detail protocols submission than other banks. As such the time consume for each customer is much longer. Generally I find the counter staff very friendly and approachable. It was a pleasant & fruitful banking for me. Thanks Mdm Cheong.",
