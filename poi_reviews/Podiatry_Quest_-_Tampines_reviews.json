      "text": "Aaron is well versed and knowledgeable in the medical field of the foot, literally. He is patient in his diagnosis and does not rely on purely eye power; he'll actually feel for the injured part and recommend relevant treatment. After two weeks and only two sessions with him, I feel better on my achilles tendon already. He also gives advice within and out of scope, such as when I can start training again, if I can do pilates to strengthen my muscles and even suggesting a \"Return to Run\" plan once he seems fit. Highly recommend to anyone who requires any medical attention to their legs!",

I’m looking forward to making a full recovery!",
