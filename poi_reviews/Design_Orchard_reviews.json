      "text": "This place is amazingly unique in Singapore. It’s like the one stop shop for all the local brands and the space keeps changing I went there during before Singapore Design week on the week itself and the next week it’s different. The brand prices are actually pretty reasonable it’s mainly female oriented it seems but there’s some brands that are for guys and kids . A lot of different Jewelry brands and fashion that are so local I’ve not hear about and have not seen them in any of the regular malls where international brands are common.",

I found it interesting to have a printed biography about the designer in each stall, so I can learn something about their background and their design philosophy. The staff are friendly and helpful. The single-floor space is a nice contrast to the mega brand malls that line Orchard Road. Come here and support local makers, and go home with a true original from Singapore.",
