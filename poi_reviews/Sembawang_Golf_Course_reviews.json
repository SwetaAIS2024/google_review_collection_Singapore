      "text": "Wonderful golf course,  challenging for all levels with variety of hazards to play with.  Water, dog legs, rolling fairways,  slopes, uphills and downhills , some holes have narrow fairways.  You will have the opportunity to test your skills on this course.  Despite the challenges, it‚Äôs quite fun and playable course and you will love it.  Due to current maintenance only front nine is open,  so you get to play two rounds of front nine over 18h.\n‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®üëç",

      "text": "This is a quite challenging golf course in Singapore, for those who ever tried champion golf course, you will feel it like the 18 holes of it... For some long holes, you can see which direction to aim and the greens are always very difficult as from hole to hole, the speed is so different and not one of them is even for easy putting...\nFor those who like me usually play in MBGC, it's quite hard to adjust... Ha\nBut it is a very beautiful course, have to try it to really know your capability... And then face the reality by finding where to improve",
