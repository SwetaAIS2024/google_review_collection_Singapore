Good for those who cannot stand coldness.\n\nI likes XW signature fried noodle or fried rice especially, and add on luncheon meat at affordable price. Taste is just nice and not salty.\n\nOverall is good. Will still come for dinner during night shift.",

      "text": "The food was mediocre at best, and there was absolutely no sense of service. When we arrived, there were only 3‚Äì4 tables occupied, yet the two of us were seated right next to another couple closely, even though plenty of other tables were available‚Äîand remained empty even after we finished our meal.\n\nI really dislike this kind of waiter, acting as if everything is up to him. As a paying customer, the experience was extremely disappointing. All the guests were crammed together, making it unbearably noisy.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a relaxing weekend brunch turned into an unpleasant experience, thanks to this restaurant. If you care about ambiance and service, do yourself a favor and skip this place. You‚Äôve been warned. Dear management, Kindly bring this matter to the attention of the restaurant high level of ur management.",
