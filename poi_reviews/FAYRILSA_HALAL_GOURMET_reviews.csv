Jeremy O,4,"Affordable meals for students. Don’t taste bad. This is a good canteen for students to settle their no-frills meals daily.

During cool windy days can sit near at the edges for a very relaxing meal. Totally enjoyed my experiences here.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104204111510566143703/reviews
chee wee,5,"Malay nasi goreng is very very very tasty it's amazing! A flavour packet and so well-cooked (but I think they need to increase price otherwise abit hard for them). HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!  Wow

Ask for nasi lemak rice and add ingredients. Their rice and ingredients especially the chicken and the sambal goreng + the sambal itself is insanely good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101027921055079775526/reviews
Pearlyn Chew,4,"Soup stall’s great, the soups are flavourful and there’s even brown rice. On the other hand, The drink stall is a huge disappointment, most drinks are pretty much pre-made in pitchers so they taste yucky and flat. Ugh.

No aircon here as well but the place’s airy and open so it’s still bearable.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103972058981055212448/reviews
Stephenie Ng,5,"This is a great place to eat: airy, open and canopy setting!
But watch out for the birds, don't leave your food unattended, the birds are ready to pounce on your food!
We had the soup with rice and side dish. Very very good! The soup is tasty and clean in taste. We had seaweed porkribs, old cucumber pork ribs and lotus root pork ribs. For sides we tried spicy chicken (so so), spicy seaweed and vermicelli (yummy!),  cucumber (yummy!).
After lunch, relax n have a nice cup of teh or kopi n enjoy the breeze.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107174324753509310653/reviews
