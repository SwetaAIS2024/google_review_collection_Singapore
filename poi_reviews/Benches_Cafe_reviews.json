My friend had a similar experience where he went and ended up talking with the lady there for a long time. The grilled cheese and ham sandwich was delicious and I really enjoyed the atmosphere there. I wish I had more time to visit again!",

Auntie Doris who runs the quaint cafe is super kind and always happy to chat and share about her day. Cute cafe up in the Clementi park in a part of the Chatsworth school. Definitely do pay a visit for some good vibes, good food, coffee and a park view. üòä üëç",

      "text": "This chaming little caf√© is in the same building with primary school in Clementi woods park, a pleasant peaceful place. The food exceeded my expectations. I tasted the eggs Benedict and savory waffle. The Egg Benedict had poached eggs cooked to perfection with bagel sesame. Crunch Lettuce is a wonderful companion to the apple slices. The waffles were thick and chewy, satisfying in texture, and went perfectly with the toppings. The owner,  Doris is creativity and attention to detail. She is really a thoughtful and lovely lady. She adds unique ingredients to your preferences, such as custom salad dressings and a little bit of nutty crumbs, just by chatting with you.\nHighly recommended to anyone seeking a personalized and exceptional dining experience!",

Very pleasant chat with Auntie, that gave me a very homely feel to this cafe. Auntie is a 1-man show, taking orders and serving food, but she would take time to chat. Will be back to try out the other items on the menu.",
