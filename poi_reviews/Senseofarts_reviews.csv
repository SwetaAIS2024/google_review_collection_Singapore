Jack,5,"🌸 Beautiful Products with a Heart 🌸
Sense Of Arts creates stunning Singapore-inspired pressed flower products, souvenirs, and gifts. Their workshops with recycled real pressed flowers are fun for both kids and adults!

What I love most is their Community Pressed Flowers Project, which supports mothers, needy families, and individuals with disabilities by providing income opportunities through handicrafts. Such a meaningful cause!

Their outlets at Gardens by the Bay and Singapore Botanic Gardens are easy to find, and the website is super user-friendly. Highly recommend checking them out for unique gifts or a creative workshop!
