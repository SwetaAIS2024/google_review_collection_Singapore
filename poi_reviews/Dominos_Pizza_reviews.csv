Vanessa Allison,1,"Would give them 0 stars if I could. Please do not buy unless you want unfresh pizza. Pizza hut or any other pizza shops are still better. We were appalled when we ordered delivery, and they had the cheek to give us individual slices of pizza made into a ""whole pizza"". Who knows how many days old are these slices.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105735101090774333929/reviews
Amos Goh,1,"In short: 1.5h late delivery, left food out in the rain, no response from them throughout.

In the morning, I scheduled an order for 10.15pm later that day. At 10.15pm, order tracker said it was baking. At 10.25pm, order tracker said to rate the order. I waited from 10pm all the way till 11pm and there was no pizza delivered so I left the delivery location. Tried calling this branch, no one picked up.

At 12am, I saw several missed calls from 11.45pm. I called back and the rider said he left it outdoors IN THE RAIN at the delivery location. Went back to the delivery location and the state of the food was what is in the picture. Soaked throughout.

Dear Domino's, I strongly urge you to sort out this poor service. And if you simply reply this with a link to your feedback form, I have tried filling it up and it doesn't go through, and there's no actions taken. If I am unable to successfully get a refund, I can only resort to filing a complain to a higher authority.

Thank you.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115817756747627844396/reviews
xavier yeo,1,"If only there was a rating below 1.

Ordered a delivery scheduled for 9.30pm as I was making my way back home. Reached back at 9.15 pm and pizza was already at the door, and left on the shoerack, beside the shoes.

Ordered a standard Hawaiian pizza with New York crust. Upon opening the pizza box, boy was I dismayed at the toppings and presentation of the pizza. (See picture).

If this is the standard of the pizzas that dominos are proud of serving to their customers, I will definitely not be returning. For the price that I paid for that pizza, I'll be better off spending it at other pizza places for better quality.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102575856254786904484/reviews
Peter Pin,4,"Food was good. Staff was helpful and friendly. However, the Cheeseburger pizza I ordered is quite different from the product picture I saw from the App. Please see attached. Thanks.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114881585445397207109/reviews
syawal razak,1,"Ordered 4 large and it says 12 inches, got it at 10 inches+ not even close to 12 inches. Plus the toppings is so scarce. Might as well eat toasted bread with home made toppings.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117606636358312681128/reviews
