Lyka Venessa Bendanillo,5,"Bought our MRT Tickets via klook and look what we got, a priceless experience with Red dot museum. After roaming around you can eat or drink via their cafe which serves snacks. Very kid friendly since it is situated near a playground.

Andres Roco,5,"Really great design museum, lots of inspiring designs and methods on showcase with fun activities on each floor. Covered everything from product design, advances in manufacturing, innovative architectural designs and furniture. There was a lot of AI related work which I'm not a fan of, but that just seems to be the way the industry is going, so not really a flaw of the museum",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105116016852711045686/reviews
Ivan Y,2,Underwhelming. Was there on 30 March. Perhaps they were refreshing the exhibition but for $12 I there weren't sufficient prototypes and items to make up for it. You gotta read the descriptions and most of them are situated high up and that strains your neck unless you're tall.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104178552914828539312/reviews
