WeiRong Kang,2,"Had a late dinner and see only a few stalls open, Seng Teck Kee is one of them. Ordered a seafood fried rice, paid $6 for it and to my surprise it was ready in about 2mins. Good for the faster than fastfood service speed. However, was utterly disappointed with the meal. The fried rice came with a few pieces of sotong, 2 prawns and plenty of oil. The prawns were not fresh and it was actually cold when I bite it. Usually I'm not too picky and would just eat it, but this time round it felt really not right. I hope they can improve their cooking and not rush it. Fried rice is the simpliest asian dish that should not be messed up. For the price and being in a popular place, they need to live up to the standards.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110859671227746669466/reviews
LP Pua,4,"Ordered a plate of 新洲米粉. It was moist and paired well with their sambal chili, almost resembling a bee hoon version of Hokkien Mee. I'd rate the food 3.5 stars and give an additional half star for the friendly service.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews

Alan Wee,5,"High level of Wok Hei in their San Lou Bee Hoon, with streaks of burnt Bee Hoon added to the mix creating that desired smoky flavour.  Will be back to try again and other dishes!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112330659733909822180/reviews
