YEO KEE SIANG,5,"Amazing transaction and service

1. Needed a medicine and did not have the needful prescription. They quickly arranged for a tele consultation for me. Great, they did not brush me off but listened to my needs.

2. Though I did not see them face to face, I could sense their sincerity to help, service and listen. Doctor Nick, staff in this transaction.

3.i have sent the order and made the payment after the cut off time. They knew I needed the medicine. They made some exception for me. I received the medicine on the same day.

I definitely recommend this service.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112899881668649324851/reviews
