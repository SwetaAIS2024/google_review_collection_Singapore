Melanie Tam,2,"Located in the food court of the Marina Bay Sands Shoppes food court, it's exactly what you would expect. Overpriced mall food for tourists. Unfortunately, we had no choice because we were starving, didn't have time to venture outside of the Shoppes area, and we didn't want noodles, which is what most of the other stalls in the food court were serving. Dan Ya serves clay pot rice and we had a pork one. Although it's not really authentic clay pot rice because they just scoop cooked rice into a clay pot and heat it up. But I guess since it's a food court setting, food needs to be churned out quickly so that may be their only method. Overall, it was pretty basic and a little too salty.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103707591633272033722/reviews
melson teo,5,"i like the claypot pork ribs. the bones are mostly removed. the meat is very tender and flavorful. the rice is slightly charred on the bottom adding flavor to the dish.

a buzzer is given to us so we could find seats while waiting.

it didn't take very long for the claypot to be ready, about 10 minutes, considering there are other orders before us.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107386731297360583879/reviews
Shan Shan,1,"Ordered food through Grab. During pick up, they indicate that they never have Grab and shoo me away. I informed that I have paid for my food and i recheck the address. They said correct. Then they went to check with chef, the chef told them why you wrap the machine inside plastic. They then proceed to prepare my food. The staff (girl) keeps pointing fingers at me when they prepare my food. After done, they put my food out like 10 mins before she used her hand to gesture me to collect instead of ringing the buzzer I had on my hand.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111993868859419642286/reviews
Justin Chan,1,Had the 田雞煲 and rice on 26th February 2023 noon time. The 田雞 was too salty and unfortunately not delicious. The biggest problem was that I developed diarrhea and sickness 7 hours after the meal. Definitely unrecommended. Service in the restaurant was also poor- they usher you away by saying “it takes 10+ mins to cook this!”,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107907620054404254565/reviews
