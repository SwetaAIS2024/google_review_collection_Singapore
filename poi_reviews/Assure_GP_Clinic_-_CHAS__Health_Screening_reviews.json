The clinic was very clean, and the nurse at the reception was very polite in guiding me through the registration process and handling it. I'm glad the clinic was highly effective. I was soon able to see the doctor and complete the process, including obtaining the necessary medication. It's worth noting that the receptionist nurse also offered me a mask for my runny nose and cough during the registration process. I appreciate the positive experience I had during my visit. Thank you.",
