Rei Axl Ye,5,"I'm usually quite skeptical when a place tries to sell too many things on the menu. Decided to give Sam a try and was pleasantly surprised, ordered the hokkien mee and unlike what they usually serve outside, this has the distinct home cooked flavour, they also added shallots in which is uncommon but gave a dish a good boost in flavour.

Only hope that the fried lard is crispier and serve ld with lime + sambal by default. Will return to try the other dishes.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115827926540149694576/reviews
gary ngiam,5,No frills  honest  food not bad in anyway . Portions are good for the price you pay  . The chilli crab sauce prawns and hokkien mee have the potential to be their star dish if more emphasis could be put in it .,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100681195859384404027/reviews
Lilis Soh,5,"First visit with friends, although the place is small, but good ambiance tended by welcoming and friendly staff.

We ordered Yang Zhou Fried Beehoon, Cap Chai vegetable, and peanuts with lotus soup, portion is generous, taste is really homely-cooked feel and delicious!
The home-made sambal really kicks!
Best of all, the price is very affordable, too!

I will definitely be back for more!

Deserves a checkout for sure!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114419065371769377544/reviews
