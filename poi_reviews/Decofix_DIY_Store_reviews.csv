Edmund Lian,5,"I recently purchased a BBQ gas grill pit from this shop, and I couldn't be more satisfied with both the product and the customer service. The shop owner is extremely knowledgeable and helpful, providing detailed instructions on how to properly treat the BBQ before and after use. What impressed me most was his responsiveness—whenever I had any questions, I could easily reach him via WhatsApp, and he always replied promptly. The level of care and attention to detail made the whole experience hassle-free. I highly recommend this shop for anyone looking for quality products and exceptional customer service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106443187623711103541/reviews

Mathieu S,5,"If you’re looking for a bbq grill and someone who can help and explain everything to you before buying it, aim there. I was looking everywhere in Singapore, no shop had any stock. Not only Lawrence has the bbq grills onsite but he will take time to listen to you and guide you to buy the one for your needs. I showed up there on a public holiday and was delivered the next day! Amazing service!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112031199025407599020/reviews

Chewielicious T,5,"Super good deal, cooking grate at $70. Bought a 2nd hand Weber off carousell but was missing the cooking grate 57cm.

Weber was selling it at exorbitant $150, we went to bbq warehouse and Weber store and it was both >$150?! But we managed to buy one at $70 here.

Owner was so friendly, even educated us on the different coating. The cooking grate fitted in nicely as seen in the video.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112973732117339181795/reviews
