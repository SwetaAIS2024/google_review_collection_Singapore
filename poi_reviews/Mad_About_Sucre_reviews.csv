Anju Patwardhan,5,"We enjoyed a wonderful meal there. This is such a hidden gem. Food was great and the desserts were outstanding.

P.S. we got a bit confused by their 4-course lunch offer. That just means 3 starters (small portions) and 1 main course. It’s not 4 courses and does not include desserts.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111214767148820086362/reviews
Jamon Mok,3,"Went there for the 3 course lunch, came out still hungry lol. Portion wise really a little too small. Service was really good and staff took care to explain all of the chefs intentions which were well appreciated. Not all of it came through but the intention is definitely there so sometimes didn't match up the the really beautiful narrative portrayed by the staff. Friend was really blown away by their rum cake which I thought was decent. Their dinner menu looks way better though.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109575627440754796685/reviews
Nigel Lim,5,"I recently dined at Mad about Sucre for their 13 course spring tasting menu, and it was an unforgettable experience from start to finish. This gem perfectly blends Asian and French cuisine, creating a unique and delectable menu that left my taste buds in awe.

The food was simply outstanding. Every dish was a masterful fusion of flavors, beautifully presented and bursting with creativity. The Foie Gras, in particular, was a standout—perfectly balanced and exquisitely prepared.

What truly set this restaurant apart was the impeccable service. The staff was attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely passionate about the menu. They made excellent recommendations and ensured that every detail was taken care of, making our dining experience seamless and enjoyable.

The ambiance was elegant yet welcoming, making it the perfect spot for both special occasions and casual dining. I highly recommend Mad about Sucre to anyone looking for an extraordinary culinary adventure. Five stars all the way!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113182916906592314037/reviews
