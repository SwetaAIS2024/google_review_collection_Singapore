Sabrina H.,5,"I started on a one year package for a monthly SHR removal session. Yesterday was my last session and I decided to leave a review.

When I first started this session, I felt like the sessions were alright and after Iâ€™ve finished a little over half of my packageâ€™s sessions, I felt like the results werenâ€™t outstanding. Each session, there will be a new different therapist in charge, so the service was not consistent. I felt like there wasnâ€™t much results. This went on until I met Joan (I hope I remembered her name correctly)!

During the very first time I had my very first session with her, I could feel like she was different and she made me feel very comfortable. She was very attentive and targeted tricky areas with precision which I really appreciate. After our first session together, I decided to request to have her as my therapist for the rest of my sessions.

After my first two sessions with her, my hair growth slowed down significantly. From then onwards, the hair growth doesnâ€™t grow as much. The hair texture has also become finer and no longer as thick as before.

I am very pleased with my results now. I wish I had met her earlier. Next time when I decide to start on a new package again, Iâ€™ll definitely request for her again. ðŸ¤—",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103737791922660212307/reviews
Bess Sim,5,"Went to the Farrer outlet for SHR hair removal, pricing was reasonable and Staff Shirlyn was nice and gentle. The experience was pleasant and there was no hard-selling. The environment was also clean and comfortable.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105631751469702276919/reviews
Cara Chang,1,"I donâ€™t know if this is considered Microdermabrasion because there was no â€˜abrasionâ€™ at all. It was just a tiny suction device, which you can get off the internet at $68-$100.

I also felt that my â€˜therapistâ€™ was not well trained. She missed certain spots on my face and was extremely rough.

The machine was tugging at my skin so hard and it did not feel good for the skin at all because my skin was being pulled so hard with every stroke and in all directions.

Iâ€™m left with what looks like blood spots/ skin hemorrhages on my face and on my forehead especially.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115046065797772725789/reviews
Anne Lee,5,"I opted for SHR unlimited prestige and it was well worth it. Joan was very friendly, professional and made me feel completely at ease during my first session when I didnâ€™t know what to expect. There was also zero hard-sell involved here so I didnâ€™t feel pressured at all to purchase a package and only did so after I was sure that I would return. Would definitely recommend!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105935925760119834549/reviews
