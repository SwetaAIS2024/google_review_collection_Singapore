Mohamed Irfan Bin Mohamed Jufri (trdasho_alt),5,"Wide array of items. I especially liked the variety of snacks present for celebrations (such as Teacher's Day) including cookies, chips, chocolates, ice cream and more.

Barbette Strauss,5,A relatively large Fairprice supermarket that isn‚Äôt super crowded even during circuit breaker.  There is alot more stuff added to this branch after a major makeover.  My favourite Thai organic red brown rice is still available.  And I would like to thank the TL for the relevant section for ordering the Taiwanese green max brand of multi grain ‰∫îË∞∑Á±≥ rice for me.  Highly recommended to visit this outlet as you won't be disappointed with the good variety of products and also the sushi and baked chicken. The staff are also very helpful with our purchases.  Highly recommended!,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116995110127835257886/reviews
