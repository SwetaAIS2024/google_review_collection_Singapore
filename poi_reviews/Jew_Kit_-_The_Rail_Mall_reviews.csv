Riki Koe,5,"Tried Jew Kit chicken rice for the first tim e for family dinner. Juicy tender & tasty steam poach chicken with fragrant chicken rice - really recommended ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹. Fried chicken cubes with truffle it's a gem. We also tried mix veggie & Thai style tofu. Overall the food was good, nice environment with aircon. Though it's a bit pricey.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101883927031130828006/reviews
C,5,"Back here again for Hokkien mee and nanyu veggies. Still amazed by its Hokkien mee, especially its pork lard and sambal! Perfect!

Opened not long ago & tried on Hokkien mee and fish head curry; as I was craving for Hokkien mee so badly & saw that they also serve curry fish head (red snapper). Both dishes were good & didnâ€™t regret; love the pork lard in the Hokkien mee! Also, love the fact that they are still using deep fried foo chok in the curry fish head, the fish head was really fresh!
Will come back to try their chicken rice and other dishes since I read much reviews on the signature.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110704375820971665962/reviews
Ma tt,1,"While I appreciate the good service given, the food was a disappointment.

1. Meat ball in the soup was overly salty.
2. Requested for chicken thigh and I was given half thigh with breast meat making up the other half.

While the steamed chicken was tender, the amount of meat given was on the lower end. $7.96 after gst is not particularly cheap for a plate of chicken rice. So even with the rice being fluffy and fragrant, one will likely end up munching on just the grains without careful portioning of the meat.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102382313505418526836/reviews
Jason Ong,4,"First time at this particular branch. Overall the food was good, the chicken was tender and tasty. The chicken rice itself was delicious too. Worth a try if you're around the area.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101337983538091125134/reviews
Abraham Lee,5,"Just opened a week ago, and pleased to say that the steamed chicken is of consistent quality and tasty! Seating is somewhat limited but nice ambience and staff are attentive and polite. The menu differs slightly from the one at Bukit Timah shopping center, but the main stays are similar.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews
