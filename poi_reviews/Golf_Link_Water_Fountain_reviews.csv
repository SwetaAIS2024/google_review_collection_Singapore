Megaworld Asia,5,"From the Zohan Pump Room, the trail skirts the edge of the nearby golf course for approximately two km before arriving at the Junction of the Jering Boardwalk and the Lornie Trail. En-route, the golf course be-comes more visible as the trees lining the trail begin to thin out. About half-way along there are some pic-turesque water fountains in one of the golf course waterways.

Safe travels,
