      "text": "This local brewery at Gillman Barracks is an absolute gem! If you’re an IPA lover, their Dear Star and Stars & Bars are must-tries—hands down some of the best I’ve ever had. The beers are full of flavour, with just the right balance of hops and smoothness. Their Charcoal Pizza is another standout—crispy, smoky, and topped with fresh ingredients, it’s heavenly good.\n\nThe service here is top-notch, especially Maxwell, who was incredibly attentive and handled our special vegetarian food requests flawlessly by coordinating with the chef. His attention to detail really made our experience seamless.\n\nWhat makes this spot even better for families is the bouncy castle—perfect for keeping the little ones entertained while parents enjoy some great craft beers. Overall, it’s a fantastic place to unwind with excellent food, drinks, and service. Highly recommended for both beer enthusiasts and families alike!",
