Joshua Ding,3,"April 2024

Came in 2:40 pm, waited for 16 mins with 2 persons in front of me.
Branch manager is pretty helpful in resolving my dad’s issue since he is unable to travel from oversea.
Problem unsolved yet, since he is going to reschedule out to me since I left my contact to him. Hopefully, he will follow through.

Let’s see how this goes.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103976109092529886889/reviews
Angel Lam,5,"I was so professionally served by Jane at this branch, which has a cafe, omakase restaurant, bookshop, travel agency all under one roof. I only needed Jane to help me reset my ATM PIN but she went on to help me with my various other enquiries, which led me to split my bank account to a new 360 salary account and apply a new credit card for minor online expenses. She also gave me a briefing tour of the branch and its various retail offerings. Thank you Jane for spending time with me and being a good ambassador for OCBC!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102190736676191320804/reviews
Khurram Khatri,5,"Visited the branch to open Bonus+ Savings account on 15th March. Was told initially it would take at least 1 hour for my queue number to be addressed. Despite 4 people being ahead of me I was promptly attended to within 40 minutes.
The process was smooth and quite fast. Special mention to Ms. Kim who was very patient and explained to me the account features. She made the account opening process very simple for me and it took less than 30 minutes for me to have a new account ready.
She even went so far to assist me in activating the banking app. Although the One token could not activate due to an app glitch, but thats something I can overlook because of the exceptional customer service provided by Ms. Kim.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102308483469052712681/reviews
Di Di,5,"I walked past and happened to see books on sale. After searching on online shopping sites, I realised that the prices are cheaper. There is a 15% discount for OCBC card holders. When I went to the counter, it was fortunate that the cashier told me that I would be entitled to an additional 10% discount if I purchase 3 books.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews
