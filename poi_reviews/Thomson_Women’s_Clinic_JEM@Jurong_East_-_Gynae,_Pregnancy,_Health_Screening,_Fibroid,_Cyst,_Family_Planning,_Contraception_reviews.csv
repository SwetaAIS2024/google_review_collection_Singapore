Cherilynn Ang,4,"Had a pleasant experience throughout, Geraldine the receptionist/nurse welcomed us kindly and we settled our registration quite quickly. There was only 1 patient before us and we waited about 45mins or so to enter. Dr. Tan was very gentle and addressed all our concerns well - overall he was also very patient and listened to us too. He offered alternatives and provided good advice.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118186621593370196101/reviews
