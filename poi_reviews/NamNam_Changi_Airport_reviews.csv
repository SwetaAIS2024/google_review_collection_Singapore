Sherman TBH,4,"One of the restaurants I will have meals before I fly, is fast and good. Not crowded and relaxing. The toilet is so near and has a good cost of meal for less than $20 dollars. The broth bases are good. Try the beef pho.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113225615342914080738/reviews
Paijo Gundul,3,"Nothing really special here. Not so bad if you really miss Vietnamese food. But, don't expect too much. It taste different,,not in a bad way. Maybe because I already experienced too many Vietnamese Restaurant so my expectation little too high",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113711074640642497866/reviews
Theticus _,2,"Pho I was served is not what I expected to be. It was served without bean sprouts, culantro nor lime. Soup taste is below average and almost half empty in a big bowl. I wouldn't go back to it. Quite disappointed as I was really looking forward to enjoying the Pho I love. But their lime cold drink was good.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106447661671019636722/reviews
