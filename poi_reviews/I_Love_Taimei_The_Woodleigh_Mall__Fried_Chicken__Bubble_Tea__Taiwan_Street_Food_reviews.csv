Jomaine Chang,5,"Good, ordered the Shake shake fries w garlic seafood, then the staff asked to join membership so can get a drink with it for $5.90. Was worth it. Got the Tofu fries sour plum flavour as well. Overall good.

Mason Tay,4,The staff are very smiley and friendly - are great attributes to provide good service. Service wise is excellent!! I only tried the bubble tea so I can’t comment about other food even though I tried their cutlets many years ago. Their bubble milk tea has failed to entice me to repeat purchase as the bubbles doesn’t go very well with the tea. I cannot explain but I can only rate it 2 out of 5. Unfortunately I am unable to separate the bubble from the milk tea. I will definitely give their bubble milk a pass.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108195777674730720034/reviews
Chun Wui Tan,5,"The fried snacks are really good! Sweet potato fries were especially good. The fried chicken was tender with a crispy exterior too. Definitely worth a snack on if you're looking for tea-time options in the area.

Milk tea was alright, there are other better options boba tea options in the mall.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106047394467182149594/reviews
