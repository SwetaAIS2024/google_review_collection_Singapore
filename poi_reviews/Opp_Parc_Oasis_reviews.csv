Victor Au-Yeung,5,"Many Routes that go many places. 198A Ends Here. I also live in a green bin beside the bus stop so it is technically my home, and If it gets a bad rating I fear than they are going to send the authorities to investigate, and evict me. Please give a good rating, this has been my home for 15 years and I don’t know where I would go without my bin, and the trash/food offerings I get when people walk past me. Other than that, it’s a great place!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117148890890668564351/reviews
