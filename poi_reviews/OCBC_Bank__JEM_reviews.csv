Robin Cher,5,"I like to sound out Service Ambassador Angie for her patience and dedication in helping me to accelerate my cc application. Without her help in liaising across OCBC department,my application will be stuck in a limbo without any clear instructions.

As a premiere banking customer,I am disappointed greatly by the service rendered by my RM and premier hotline customer agent who seems to be clueless or just can't be bothered to own the issues that I was facing.  I will be planning to swap out my RM in the near future

The saving grace is having dedicated staff like Angie that ensure customer are well taken care of",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112504145927678547803/reviews
Tony Too,1,"Horrible service . The lady at the counter very unfriendly. Despite no one in queue, refused to give me a 1 minute advise on how to access specific online function and insisted me to take a queue number. Actually that's the reason for her existence yet she don't want to just give a 1 minute advise",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102687658535264276725/reviews

Ivy Soh,1,"Was at OCBC at 9.45am on 17 Jan 2025 to queue for new notes at ATM. There are 2 queues but no one guided customer as to which is for ATM and which is for counter exchange of new notes. Atm and counter opening hours are different by half an hourðŸ¤”ðŸ¤” i manage to get to change the new notes at ATM machine but only for 2 bundles exchange. After I have done and I kindly asked a young man staff for red packets but he says only at 11.00am. Then i asked do i have to queue again and his unhelpful answer is no. He told me he is new which i do not accept his way of reply. Whether new or old staff should reply in a professional way as in the eyes of customer, he is representing the bank. I also feedback to one of the lady staff outside the bank to say that OCBC should operate slightly earlier during this festive season. I saw many many elderly waiting to change new notes and some could not stand too long due to their age. I could only say OCBC is one of the top bank but lousy serviceðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Žjust hope the bank will improve this area in the future. Thank you",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102628073314988742850/reviews
