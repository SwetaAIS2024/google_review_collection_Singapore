disa novianty,5,"Dr. Ranjiv is really patient and give clear and thorough explanation about my mother's thyroid case. He explained all the risks for the operation. One thing that I really appreciated is that he asked whether we want to know more detail about the CT scan result, so he opened one by one the scan and explained really detail about all the aspects that we need to know. Different to the other doctor we met that only explained the summary.
Joey the assistant also really helpful. Proactively she asked about all the information that the doctor needed and also provided us with all information we asked for.
All in all, Dr Ranjiv clinic is the right solution for everyone who are planning to do thyroidectomy.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102184984037809464586/reviews

Andrew Menon,5,"Amazingly attentive, skillful and knowledgeable doctor! Dr. Ranjiv performed a total thyroidectomy for my hyper thyroid condition. I spoke with 3 different surgeons but everything about Dr. Ranjiv gave me the confidence that I would be in safe hands. I am much better now and in a matter 3 months after surgery, I struggle to even notice the faintest scar on my neck. The clinic staff, Joey, was excellent at providing all the necessary information I required for preparing for the operation through to aftercare advice. The recovery was a walk in the park and i could not recommend Dr. Ranjiv enough. Best, Andrew Menon",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104752637649742065310/reviews
