      "text": "Relatively good carrot cake and fried oysters here! Usually, I see quite a few people buying their white carrot cake, so I decided to give it a go.\n\nü•ò White carrot cake lacks a little wok hei, but other than that, portion size is quite good, and I can taste and feel the crunchiness of the sweet pickled radish.\nI rate: 3.5/5 üåü\n\nü¶™ Fried Oysters were surprisingly plump and fresh. The wok hei in this dish was quite prominent and the char at the side of the starch was nice as well. Slightly over done, but it's still not bad, my opinion. I rate 4/5 üåü",

Upgrade to 4 Stars.\n\nBought char kway teow back. It is the dry version. It has a few pieces of fish cake and some cockles. Not much bean sprout. Taste is quite bland and no wok hei.\nHad tried the fried oyster previously and it was much better.",
