Anushka Perera,1,"I had an awful experience at Tang Ren. We ordered the Mongolian Chicken Rice and it was absolutely horrible. The chicken tasted spoiled and had an unpleasant, watery texture. On top of that, the dish was way too sweet—completely off from what Mongolian chicken should taste like. The rice was a joke: bland, dry, and barely enough to call it a proper meal.

The entire dish felt like it had been thrown together with zero care. I left feeling disgusted and cheated. I don’t know what’s going on in their kitchen, but they seriously need to step up their game—or just stop serving this disaster altogether.

Avoid this place at all costs!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106389320156360385323/reviews
Eve C,2,"This is a highly raved cafe that is popular. The main reason why I rated it as 2 stars is mainly to the disappointing kaya butter toast. We have eaten many kaya butter toast in sg and Malaysia. This is the first time I feel so cheated for this particular toast. Take a look at the photo on the butter. I have never seen any kaya butter toast that look generous butter on the side and when I opened up the bread it tells an entire different story.

The wanton noodles is decent. I have eaten better ones in food court around JB.

I definitely won't patronise again.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109756518746414930822/reviews

Patrick Kam,4,"Unintentionally, we found this coffee/ breakfast shop. Unexpectedly, the food is good and authentic,  and the prices are reasonable too. I came back for 2nd time and definitely will come back, but hopefully, they can maintain the quality and prices. :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117776402341038579413/reviews
