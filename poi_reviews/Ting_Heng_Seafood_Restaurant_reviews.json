The poached mega prawn, fish, and chicken were absolute standouts—so flavorful and perfectly cooked. I’ll definitely be back to explore more of the menu! Highly recommend!",

Pre-order cold crabs small in size and was totally ripped off! 1 500g cold crab simply costs $125+- with gst and service charge crazy!\nKong bao frog legs don't even have ginger nor spring onions....and kind of sweet!\n\nDragon chives with beans sprouts totally can't make it... both vegetables were kind of old...\n\nThere are many more places worth spending than a place like this.\n\nIt's totally not recommended.",

      "text": "Had supper for 6Pax at this place, having high hopes for it but unfortunately, it was far from a good experience. The soup was bland, and there are definitely way better options for fish soup steamboat in Singapore. The food quality was disappointing — the raw beef served for the steamboat was actually stir-fried beef, thick, tough, and had a very strong, unpleasant meat taste. It was by far the worst beef I've ever had in my life\n\nTo top it off, the bill came close to 500 SGD, which was a complete ripoff and unjustifiable as We didn’t order anything extravagant. In my opinion Many ingredients are of low quality and definitely does not reflect the high price.\n\nI won't be coming back, and I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are far better alternatives at a fraction of the cost.",
