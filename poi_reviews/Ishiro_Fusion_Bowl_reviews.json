      "text": "Went there to pack lunch for takeaway. I was early at around 11:45am and staff was having his lunch. I told him to finish first as I can wait but he insisted on preparing my orders 1st. Much appreciated.\nWe had the grilled chicken, meitaiko chicken and beef rice bowls with 1 set of fried ebi. The rice was delicious with tempura crumbs with mains and a bit of sauce. Serving size is enough for an adult male. The only thing lacking is vegetables.\nThere's no extra charge for takeaway containers.\nThe place was rather empty, not sure if we're early or it is regularly like this. There're other food stalls and bar there, foodcourt style. So your party doesn't have to all eat the same food.\nI like this rice bowls and will return.",
