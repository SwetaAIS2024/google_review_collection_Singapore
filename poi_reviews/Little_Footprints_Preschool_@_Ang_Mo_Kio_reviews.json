Your warmth, kindness, and dedication have a positive impact on our little one’s development. Seeing her full of smiles and excitement going to and leaving the school is reassuring to know that she is in a nurturing and loving environment. ❤️",

Over the last 5 months, the teachers have been constantly providing feedback and updates on our child.\nAs a first-time mother, I was very concerned over handing over my child’s care to someone else; the teacher called me before his first day to have a better understanding of his likes/dislikes and methods to comfort him.\nThe teachers appear to be committed and caring towards the children and will upload weekly photos of our child engaged in the activities. They are also open to feedback regarding our child’s care.\nThey are consistent in checking the child’s mouth, hands, and feet at every check-in and will report on health incidents (eg HFMD, Herpangina) on the app promptly.\nThank you Teacher Lav, Teacher Krist, Tracher Irlianna and Teacher Kathleen for your love and care towards my child! We appreciate you!",
