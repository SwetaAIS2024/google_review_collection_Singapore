      "text": "Came by this hawker centre for dinner on the May Day public holiday. I picked this stall because the aroma was so alluring. I ordered Yang Chun noodles ($3.50) and Sheng Jian Bao ($4.50) and was given a beeper. My noodles were ready in just five minutes, but I waited close to 20 minutes, having already finished my noodles.\n\nPlease don't let the unassuming appearance of the noodles fool you. Granted, it was simply noodles in broth with some minced meat, but I was really impressed by the flavourful broth and the perfectly cooked noodles. I actually think it's better than some budget restaurant offerings. The Sheng Jian Bao, while good, didn't justify the long wait. It has a good size, decent dough and were very juicy. The meat filling just didn't hit the spot for me. Perhaps my expectations were elevated after trying the viral Chinatown stall. Overall, I have a feeling this stall is going to be a hit, and I will come back to try other items, especially the noodles.",

      "text": "Unexpectedly great find.\n\nThe pan fried bun have a very crispy base with squirting juicy filling. Best eaten with caution.\n\nPrawn wonton with chili oil is very appetising with is vinegary sauce, low spice level, add on chili if needed.\n\nNoodle was pretty standard but the soup on the side is surprisingly real bone broth. For the price they sell, using real bone broth, it’s super worth it.",

      "text": "Located on the 2nd level in this hawker centre.\n\nShenjian Bao has 2 versions - pork and prawn. An order of pork was 3 pieces. The skin had a slight crisp on first bite. Marinated pork was excellent with good balance. The downside is 3 pieces for $4.50 is kind of excessive, especially in hawker setting.\n\nWanton in chili oil was plump and fresh. Its chili oil had a hint of Sichuan pepper and savory.\n\nZhajiang noodle was surprisingly very good. Noodle was Al dent and minced meat was well balanced in flavor and taste. The key difference is its julienned cucumber was cold, giving it a good bite. Small detail like this makes a key impact. A splash of vinegar lifted the entire dish.",
