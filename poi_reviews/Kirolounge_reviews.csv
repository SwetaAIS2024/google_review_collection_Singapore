Derrick Wu,5,"My family and i have been visiting Dr. Limin for chiropractic care, and I cannot recommend her enough! From the moment I walked into her clinic, I felt welcomed and at ease. Dr. Limin is incredibly knowledgeable and attentive, taking the time to understand my concerns and explain her approach in a way that was easy to follow.

Her treatments have made a significant difference in my overall well-being. I noticed improvements in my back pain, neck stiffness after just a few sessions. She combines professionalism with genuine care, always ensuring that I am comfortable and informed during each visit.

What sets Dr. Limin apart is her personalized approach and attention to detail. She not only focuses on immediate relief but also provides advice on long-term wellness and prevention. It's clear that she is passionate about helping her patients achieve better health.

We are so grateful to have found Dr. Limin and would highly recommend her to anyone looking for effective chiropractic care!

Annie Wu Tzu Hsuan,5,"My mother has sought treatment here for quite a few years to help alleviate the stress on her back that's caused by her Parkinson's disease. Going to Kirolounge has always been relaxing and comforting for her. The chiropractors are very professional, warm and kind. The staff are also very caring and friendly. 10/10 Would recommend.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101682757942674688331/reviews
Kyle Chen,5,"I have been going for my adjustments regularly for the past few years, having been suffering from back pain due to work.

Without the dedication and care from the Kirolounge team, I would not be able to give my utmost to the company that I’m working in.

Even my daughter now has become a regular after my wife has seen improvements in my health and well-being.

Would like to say a big “Thank You” to the chiropractors and the staffs for always making our session in the clinic warm and friendly.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116594779678056752727/reviews
