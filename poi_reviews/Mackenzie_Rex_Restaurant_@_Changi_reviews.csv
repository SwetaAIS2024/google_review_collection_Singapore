Rin A,4,"$5.9 for set rice+chicken+soup is abit expensive imo. Rice is quiet dry but fragrant. Chicken is very salty, soup is just soup. Ngohiang is okay, the meat is generous. Point plus the service is okay.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110753008982270629612/reviews
Fikri J,5,First time having lunch at this outlet. Cozy little restaurant tucked along the roadside. The place is not air conditioned but there are huge wall fans around to make the space airy. The food was served quite quickly. Didn‚Äôt order their chicken rice even though they‚Äôre known for that. Ordered the fish horfun instead. Not too bad. They added strips of ginger which I found interesting. Overall okay for lunch. Affordable and reasonable pricing as well.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115734785798057148033/reviews

Matthew Matt,1,"The food was terrible! I had the chicken rice. While it was edible, this is quite possibly the worst chicken rice I have tried. Maybe the chef just had an off day, or the other dishes are amazing. I wouldn't know though, because I won't be coming back.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489396877492524841/reviews
GK T,5,"We chanced upon this little no fuss outlet. It looked simple and clean. Owner and staff are friendly. Rice served is chicken rice ‚Äî cooked just right - not hard nor mushy. Crispy baby squids has good crunch with the right amount of caramelized coating. Mixed veggies was not overcooked. Lemon Chicken has a good portion of lightly-battered chicken fillet slices. They retained the crispiness too even though they were doused with tangy lemon sauce. All of us  of 3 different age groups (Above 80, Above 50 and Above 10 years of age) enjoyed this meal. Total bill came up to $40.55.

Today, we are here again for dinner. Now managed to add in photos of the almost-the-same-ordered dishes except today, we had sambal kangkong and tofu with prawns. The kangkong was not clumpy nor too oily. There is still the crunch, hence not overcooked.

Tofu with prawns dish has good-sized prawns that are fresh. The sauce over the dish was done ‚Äúhor-fun‚Äù egg-based style. So if you enjoy the ‚Äúwet‚Äù/‚Äúsup kum‚Äù style, order this dish.

Consistent good quality is important. Better still, the lady server still remembers us! üòÉ",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104290517188989922396/reviews
