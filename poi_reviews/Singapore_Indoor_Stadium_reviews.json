We didn't get our VIP gift on the way in by mistake, but it was really easy to find someone afterward and get it by just showing our ticket. I'll be back again soon I'm sure :)",

After all these years, the indoor stadium has held up and continues to be a great venue for world class acts and performances. For those who love Disney, don't miss this one. Only here for a week.

Access was quite easy despite the large crowd and we were admitted in the stadium in less than 10 mins including security checks and tickets checks.\nSmall food stall for drinks and some food inside the grounds.",
