Vivian Tan,1,"Disappointing experience.
1/ Conflicting instructions given. When we were standing near the entrance, the security guard said ‚Äúthe queue is there‚Äù, asking us to queue for services.
At different points of the queue, TWO staff, that were checking with customers queuing about their needs, told us we just need to queue after knowing we need counter service. But when we reached the front, we were denied entrance. Evidently we were not the only ones facing the same problem as 2 other customers standing at the side agreed that the staff should inform all those queuing that the counter is actually closed.
2/ Hostile customer service. When we reached the front, we were denied the queue number. While the lady in charge of giving queue numbers was nice enough to try to seek alternative, she also said ‚ÄúI am the one giving queue number‚Äù implying that what the other staff said were not accountable. The security guard said ‚Äúyou should have saw that the sign says the queue is closed‚Äù. But isn‚Äôt it intuitive to follow the instructions of the supposedly dependable bank staff rather than following a piece of paper displayed?
Well looking at the reviews that date back months and even years, I guess nothing much is done to improve the poor customer service.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112775154074393387931/reviews
zy,1,"Very bad experience when I tried to solve my bank issue at this branch. I queue for a very long time and the staff said WP holder must go for Kaki Bukit branch. However, I went for Tampines branch and they helped me to deal with my problem successfully within 30 minutes on the same day. Until now, I still wondering why Tampines branch can solve my problem but here cannot ü§°",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101674469992660805775/reviews
Jialli,5,"I would like to commend one of the  bank manager Syai and amalay officer as i forget her name for their  customer service. They were very patient and helpful. They took the time to climb the stair up n down just to explain everything clearly and made sure my 80 years old dad understood all the details.Their professionalism and efficiency made the entire process smooth and stress-free. And for bank manager Syai, she has a outstanding leadership. Her focus on customer satisfaction is evident in the way their team consistently goes above and beyond to help customers. Their effective leadership show the positive atmosphere and efficient service I always experience. Thank you very much.

Flair,1,"Lousy experience. Long queue for VTM machine for card replacement. When reached at the machine, still need to wait for officer to assist online and no available officer.

dorisyong,3,"The entrance is from outside the shopping centre. Exit Jurong Point mall from the door opposite Goldheart #01-26H, or between Giordano #01-22-25 and Yale Smart Shop #01-26. This is a bit confusing as there are more than one #01-26. Turn right at Dunkin when you see Decathlon",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101978539412430365487/reviews
