      "text": "If you are missing France/Paris this is the place to go. Nice soothing French music, wine and food. Ordered the foie gras of course and was pleasantly surprised at the portion (ok it wasn’t cheap either) I love the caramelised onion jam that came with it. Next the European asparagus is so good! Hard to find such quality asparagus in SG. The flatbread bacon and salad was nice. Another reason we came here was for the wagyu buffet. But we could only down two portions (surprise to be one pax but we ordered two mains so they weren’t too particular about us sharing. But you can’t order one and share by two). Of course we had to have the signature dessert which takes 10-15mins to prep so order in advance. The oozing salted caramel chocolate with the iskrim was so divine. Definitely will come back. Total was about $140 (cos we didn’t order any wine). Pretty good for the quality.",

      "text": "Unfortunately it’s hard my me to leave a fair review because I have to the original restaurant with the same name in Paris and London so I can’t help but compare. The restaurants in Paris and London are better than this one in Singapore. However, the food here was very good and if I’d never been to the one in Paris I would have rated the food 5 stars instead of 4. The lunch set menu is good value for money so I would definitely come again. There aren’t many places that do French steak frites in Asia so I would highly recommend people come and try this restaurant.",

      "text": "The shop conveniently overlay the table cloth with white paper which killed the ambience. They only change the mahjong paper after every costumer and not the table cloth. The steak was horrible, it was very tough and dry. The second serving (about 3 slices of steak) was worse, it tasted like a well-done steak even though we asked for medium rare. For the price of the food ~$50++/portion, you can definitely get better quality steak elsewhere. After eating the food, i regret not looking through the reviews before giving this place a visit. Not worth a visit and definitely not worth the price.",
