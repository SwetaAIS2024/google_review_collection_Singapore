Thanks a lot for Jes teaching S4 Math at very important times. Helping my daughter got A two from B three.\n\nAlex Toh is an excellent Chemistry teacher. He can help grasp the key points and teach everything my daughter doesn't understand. At first she worried about Science failure. In the end she got A One at O Level exam.\n\nJes and Alex are No.1 tuition teachers among all the tutors I know. Highly recommended.",
