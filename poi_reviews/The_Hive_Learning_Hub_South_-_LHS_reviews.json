Amazing architecture that never fails to disappoint in my opinion, though this was my first time visiting.\n\nThe tutorial rooms within are very nicely designed too - each table has 2 buttons which are used to toggle the connected computer (I presume) during presentation. Thankfully I think the rooms are unlocked during Open House day so I got to have a peek inside.\n\nWater dispensers (both hot and cold) are also available outside washrooms.",

The overall architecture and Design by Thomas Heather wick is fabulous. It's a craft piece in its own. Definitely recommend people to visit the space, it's free for all. The building looks over the biggest Engineererd timber building, the New Business School building in NTU.",
