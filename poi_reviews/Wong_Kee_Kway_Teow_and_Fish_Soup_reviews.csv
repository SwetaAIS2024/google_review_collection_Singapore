Reuben,3,"Signature dry noodle is qq with sweet & not spicy chili (subjected to individual standard). Comfortable environment.

Expensive, fish soup with 2 fishballs, 2 fish slices, some pork slices & 2 vegetables + dry noodle = $8.80.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101669279112152810608/reviews
Patrick Poh,5,Clean and pleasant environment. The fish soup was surprisingly quite good. Was worried that the fish might not be fresh due to the lack of turnover but it turned out to be fine. In fact I enjoyed the soup. The carrot cake was also above average. Will return again easily. I hope their business will pick up.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107673184510491093624/reviews
Dawn T,5,"I love coming here on weekends for lunch! It's clean, airy, and the staff are efficient and friendly. You can sit and chat comfortably while eating.

All the dishes I've tried are better than expected-- the fish soup is flavourful with firm, fresh pieces of fish, and they do the fried fish in a unique way here that remains crunchy. There are even other fillings you can customise your fish soup with, from different types of noodles to special ingredients like fish eggs.

But my top choice in the surprisingly varied menu would be the crispy pork noodles where the pork has been flavoured with fermented beancurd. The noodles are springy and delicious, and I'm so happy they include lard. The sweet and sour chicken, curry pork ribs (quite special), kaya toast, half boiled eggs, kopi, and teh are all good here too.

A really pleasant and reliable place for breakfast or lunch! Will keep coming here and hope more people give them business too, it's a good spot.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117687371745634241647/reviews
S. Chow,5,Discover this on the way to Kallang Polyclinic. The fish porridge was sumptuous for $8.5 and additional $1 for bitter gourd. - I wiped it clean. Coffee/tea was ok but they were good in the traditional cups.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116284177120706803406/reviews
Sherlyn Ng,1,"I ordered an extra portion of batang fish only to realise that there’s only 2 slices in my takeaway box. Don’t usually give poor feedback but I don’t think paying 11.80 for a bowl of fish soup w. meekia is justified. Not to mention, this is located below a HDB block.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100445958530335717780/reviews
