      "text": "I received Hoo Keeâ€™s hokkien rice dumpling and K*m Ch**â€™s nyonya rice dumpling as gifts. I steamed both on the same plate for 25 mins in the same rice cooker. Just comparing the dryness, Hoo Keeâ€™s dumplings had the right amount of moisture, while KCâ€™s one was a little too dry inside. The rice was especially fragrant and they were so generous with the portion of ingredients in the hokkien dumpling. Ingredients used were well-seasoned as well. My entire family is Team nyonya rice dumpling but they absolutely loved this. Grandma even asked me to buy more back for her closer to Dragon Boat Festival ðŸ¤—",

Although it's $6 a piece for the one with all the ingredients, I think it's still worth it given how everything else has increased in price as well.",

Worth my trip n definitely the price. Ingredients was of the right amount in ratio to the rice. Some bak zhangs too much rice n little fillings. Hoo Kee uses lean meat which I liked. Taste was just right. Strong fragrant bak zhang smell once I pry open it ðŸ˜Š.\n\nThank you for carrying on the tradition and selling the bak zhang at an economically reasonably price in midst of the economy where everything prices shot up.",
