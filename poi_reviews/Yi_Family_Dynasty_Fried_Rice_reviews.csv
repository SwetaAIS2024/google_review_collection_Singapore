Samuel Swee,5,"Located at the corner of the hawker center, this newly opened stall serves up fried rice. I got the grilled pork chop fried rice ($6.90). The food is served pretty quickly too. There were two people in front of me, and I waited around 5 minutes before my buzzer buzzed.

The pork chop was tender and well-marinated. The fried rice was fragrant as well. The only downside here is that the plate is small, so you might need to be a little careful when eating to ensure you keep everything on your plate!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117269474701481579934/reviews
javier plays23,5,"The rice were well separated, glistening and seasoned. The pork chop was also tender. In general similar quality to DTF.

However the only downside is the size of the plate. Otherwise highly recommended.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109356648728544745958/reviews
