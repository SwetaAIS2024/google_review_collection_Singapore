With the right lighting, it can be good a good place to take photos!\n\nSince it is a small campus, the facilities aren't exactly what I'm used to but it is still sufficient.\n\nStill the school will be moving to a different location in 2022 if I'm not mistaken. Hence, hopefully the facilities will be better. üëçüèº",

      "text": "Literally so many bad reviews on this school, the support system literally sucks, on the first few days of the trimester there's so many issues, so many staff & lecturers are unprepaid, so many attendance issues, academic issues that takes forever, to solve. Knowing that the school faces oveewhelming number of students with academic issues on the first week, there should be more staffs to assist instead of making student wait hours, on top of that academic issues need to be queued physically / physically take a queue number? why is there no online support / tech support? why is there no links to help and support and the timetable is absolute bullshit because why do they make students bid and choose if the school is just going to change the modules / schedule when the trimester / semester starts?! what's the point?? even after i graduate im pretty sure none of these issues will be solved or improve, wouldn't recommend anyone to come to this lousy school",
