Karfu Yap,5,"I am writing this review to express my sincere gratitude to Dr. Louis Ng for his exceptional care in treating my long-standing skin problem. For so long, this condition has been a source of significant distress. However, thanks to Dr. Ng's expertise and treatment, my skin has now almost fully recovered. What impressed me most was his integrity and dedication to his patients. After seeing such significant improvement, Dr. Ng informed me that a follow-up appointment was no longer necessary. This level of honesty and focus on the patient's well-being is truly commendable. Dr. Louis Ng is undoubtedly the best doctor I have ever encountered, and his medical ethics are truly exemplary (太有医德了!). I highly recommend his services to anyone seeking a knowledgeable and ethical dermatologist.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113879870508640754831/reviews
Sarah Lee,4,"This clinic which is often seen with patients queueing, yet has a rude grey hair dispenser who stopped me when I was about to ask her regarding my medication after seeing the doctor, she gestured me with her hand to stop, hinting she was busy, surprising she had time to put on her gloves. Happened on 24 April 2025 around 3.30 pm so I did what i was told and went back to my seat. Used to be the receptionist seated next to her, who seemed impolite, registering patients, likewise now is the dispenser turn to be rude.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109863890159976102965/reviews
ice star,5,I have consulted 2 clinics for my leg infection. The doctor from  Family Care Clinic was more caring and detailed. Dr Soh treated my wounds patiently and covered the infected areas with dressing.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116099358050128588796/reviews

Serene Ng,4,"Called for an appointment before 9am on Tuesday and was told the earliest availability to be on 11:15am. Came on time and informed counter staff, then told to wait around 30mins as there were 6 patients in front of me.
After an hour i went to check with counter staff, she mentioned that there is 2 more patients…

First time when I came on Monday, i was waiting about an hour despite calling upfront. Gave the benefit of doubt that it happened because there was unusually peak crowd on that day.

Seems like this is a frequent practice that appointments are not honoured..they could have asked me to come back an hour later instead of mentioning half the waiting time, giving expectations unnecessarily.

In short, an hour to see the doctor and another 15mins to get the medication and make payment.
Not too expensive, total was $50 plus
Last time was around this price as well.

Updated: Dr Ng called and explained that there was an emergency situation and apologised for the long wait. I’m grateful that there is an explanation offered and the effort given to my feedback was well received. I do understand and comprehend that they are working on improving the service quality and will therefore look forward for a better experience in future with this clinic.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113122419163846230487/reviews
