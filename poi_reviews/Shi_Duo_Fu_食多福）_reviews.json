The char siew was unique, coated in a deliciously sweet sauce that set it apart. The wantons were generously stuffed, and the chili added a kick that elevated the entire dish to perfection.",

I was in the mood for wanton mee, while Donkey opted for the laksa next door.\n\nThe Good:\n\n• The Wonton Mee: Although, there’s no wow factor but wanton mee tasted fine. The char siew was also nice, although the wanton was a little salty. The noodles were cooked perfectly. I felt that the price was very reasonable for this coffee shop set up.\n\n• The Service: The lady owner was incredibly friendly and went above and beyond to make sure I had a great experience.\n\nThe Quirks:\n\n• The Wantan: The wanton was a bit salty.\n\nDonkey’s Note: It will be great if the wanton is not so salty.\n\nMy Note: The wanton noodle tasted ok\n\nRating:\n\n• Food: 3/5 (Noodle is well cooked)\n\n• Service: 5/5 (Excellent and friendly)\n\n• Atmosphere: 3/5 (Typical coffee shop)\n\nOverall: 3/5\n\nOverall: If you're in the area and craving wanton mee, it's really worth a try.",

The meepok is nicely done, the charsiew portion extremely generous and wanton though medium size have full fillings.\nSeller is also rather polite and shows her sincerity by thanking her customer. A very positive impression.",
