Larktiss,3,"With limited reasonably priced food options in the Bird Paradise park, everything tasted extra nice — though that might have been the hunger talking!  The chicken tandoori briyani set had good flavor, the roasted duck rice was decent, and even the kid’s mac & cheese hit the spot.  But with the steep prices, we couldn't shake the feeling that our appetites were doing most of the convincing.  If we had a choice, we’d probably eat elsewhere — but hey, at least hunger made it a memorable meal!

Kieron,3,"Prices are of tourists’ wallets which are explainable. The only strange thing is that they want you to use Mandai app to order food and yet their staff (especially the Roast store) refuse to let you collect your food until they scroll through your phone. My food was left there for about 5mins because the staff said it was not my order, when it was. So why should one use the app to order when their staff do not recognise the app order and only recognise the buzzer?",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111127323203347067217/reviews
Nana C,5,"Foodcourt within bird paradise. Clean and spacious.
Network is terrible especially if seated near the Japanese stall. Signal is better when nearer to the coffee stall or ordering counter. Enquired with the staff at the order stall who replied that they were aware of poor network and suggested to use free wifi instead.
Patrons can either order direct from the counter and get a beeper to be informed when food is ready. Alternatively, patron can order online but it requires an app which must be installed. This is very inconvenient especially with the terrible network.
Stall staff were very polite. Food is unsurprisingly more expensive and tastes mediocre but are prepared fresh and hot. Special call-out to the stall selling fried udon. Chef was very nice and polite and willing to accommodate for less salty version.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116443206075218983017/reviews

Case Italiane,1,"Food was absolutely vile. We all picked different choices and they were one worse than the other.
How can a place like Mandai reserve which is spectacular have such poor, unhealthy and pricey food option??? Terrible",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112047884059353001812/reviews
