oXRYSTALo Ong,3,"190 Degrees Bakery: A Cozy Refuge with Delicious Bread & Waffles (But Meh Coffee)

Rating:

• Food: 3/5 (Delicious waffles and bread, but coffee and tea were underwhelming)

• Atmosphere: 4/5 (Cozy and inviting, perfect for waiting out the rain)

• Service: 4/5 (Friendly and fast service, especially from the Vietnamese owner)

• Value: 3/5 (Slightly pricey, especially for the coffee and tea)

Alright folks, Donkey, our friends, and I ended up at 190 Degrees Bakery after getting caught in a downpour. It was the perfect spot to wait out the rain and grab some coffee and snacks.  They have a great selection of breads, waffles, and authentic Thai food.

We opted for a few coffees and teas, along with some bread to enjoy while we waited for the rain to stop. The waffles were absolutely delicious, and the bread was also very good.  However, the coffee and tea were a bit disappointing,  they just lacked flavor.  The price point for the coffee and tea set, which included egg and bread, was $5.80, which we felt was a bit expensive considering the setting and the quality of the drinks.

The service was fast, and the Vietnamese owner who made our coffee was very friendly.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience, but the drinks let us down a little.

If you're looking for a cozy spot to escape the rain with good bread and waffles, 190 Degrees Bakery is worth checking out.  Just be aware that the coffee and tea might not be as impressive, and the prices are a bit higher than expected.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114556064085815871377/reviews

P. C.,4,"Came here for a casual breakfast. Menu was extensive with toasts, puffs, waffles, dim sum etc. Was most impressed with the efficiency of a one-man show at the shopfront cum kitchen. On top of all these, staff maintained good customer service with a smile and polite greetings. Please keep it up as excellent service cam be a key returning factor for many I believe.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117546915933478735490/reviews
Ravish M,5,Just happened to be here to get waffles as the place looks so clean and well lit. The staff is friendly and welcoming. They have good variety of food and waffles. Was informed that they have halal sources of the chicken although I just tried their waffles and curry potato puff. Do try if you are in the vicinity.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116138807654098240752/reviews
Darren,4,"Found this on the Quandoo app as I wanted to make use of the Valentine's increased cashback. Ordered the Mee Siam ($7) which came in a pretty substantial portion, though the taste is unlike the usual you'll get from those makcik & pakcik stores. More peanutty than sour. It's still good, but I prefer the Malay version.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116771157599704611382/reviews
