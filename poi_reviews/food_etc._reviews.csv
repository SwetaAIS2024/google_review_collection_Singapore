Keysha G.,5,"Absolutely delicious! The Nasi Briyani was packed with flavor, perfectly cooked, and generously portioned. Itâ€™s no surprise that itâ€™s well loved and consistently praised by our guestsâ€”everyone truly enjoyed it. The packaging was also very proper and thoughtful, sealed neatly with cling wrap to avoid any spillage during delivery. If youâ€™re thinking of ordering, this is definitely the right choice. This wonâ€™t be my last purchaseâ€”Iâ€™ll absolutely be coming back for more!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105393209293825483516/reviews

Zulfikar Mohd Ali,4,"Biryani rice is a bit dry. As for the lamb shank gravy would be better if there is more spices to be added in as for what we try taste is a little blend.

Overall food is good.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101384435330615270566/reviews
Fiszah Zul,5,"We've ordered from Food Etc a couple of times. We've tried their Nasi Minyak, Nasi Sambal Goreng and Nasi Biryani Lamb. Right from the easy ordering online to the efficient and reliable delivery and the tasty food. Each time we served the food to our guest, they will all rave about the taste and the quality of food. And they will always request to want to bring home some. The first time we ordered Nasi Minyak then we tried the Nasi Sambal Goreng and yesterday was Nasi Biryani Lamb. For someone like me who don't usually like Lamb, I was proven wrong. The Lamb was so tender and no smell. The masala was so good and the paceri nenas with ayam masak merah was just awesome. My guest all had more than 2nd serving. We ordered for 40 pax  for open house and the amount given was enough. Sadly because a lot request to want to bring home some, we could only afford to give little to each family. My husband and I have no regrets ordering from Food Etc. I highly recommend food from this company.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115154043199619546658/reviews
