Nicole Lee,5,"This is a popular dessert stall, Dove Dessert which was featured on Channel 8, Channel 5 and CNA.

On a hot and humid day, I love a bowl of cold Chendol. I would order another bowl of Red Bean Milk Ice $1.60 for the extra big red beans. I shall add the red beans to my Chendol which costs only 2.20. So refreshing and cooling. The Chendol Agar Agar is also a ‘Must Try’! It is a creation of Jenny, the boss of Dove Dessert. Need to order it in advance in case it was a sold out! A frozen version of the Chendol.

Hot red bean with orange peel, green bean with milk & Bo Bo Cha Cha is a steal too!

A long queue will form the whole day. Three busy bees working hard to fulfil orders.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112922041162594840870/reviews
Daniel Wong,4,"Popular stall with a long queue. The Durian chendol was good. The Durian puree was not the best but it was tasty and the generous amount red  beans were so soft and yummy.
Unfortunately the Cheng Tng was too diluted for my liking.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115145949078497107987/reviews
Chia Shin Yin,5,"Ordered the $2 chendol here, personally, i prefer this to the one at the other hawker. The gula melaka here is not too sticky but equally fragrant. Coconut milk is nice and fresh as well. Not too sweet. The red beans used are really nice especially when u mix the chendol together. The ice is finely shaved and gives a smoother texture when eating. Only thing is that it melts very fast and turns into ""soup"" easily. Will try their other desserts again, shop owner auntie is friendly and serves your order fast.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114968145119609830211/reviews

Nahshon,5,"Ordered an Ice Jelly, and an Ice Jelly with Soursop. The ice jelly was sweet and paired well with the lime squeezed on the dessert. We love it by itself, but there is the option of adding soursop, nata, longan etc for more flavour. Very refreshing after a meal in this hawker. There is a good, wide variety of desserts, both hot and cold.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117146047820211346341/reviews
