Fish is super fresh and saw the uncle slicing the fish by hand himself before serving for those having the steamboat. Had the fresh fish slice soup with thick bee hoon added fish eggs - clean tasting and wholesome. Will visit again with more people so I can order the other dishes - saw a family having the steamed red grouper bee hoon served on tray and it looks really good.",

Boss show me the fish (looks very fresh), Quoted 50, confirm ordered and wait for 10min.\n\nThe fish was very fresh and overall, the food was good, just that the portion too much for two. I think good for 3 to 4 persons.\n\nBoss very nice, ask us to slowly eat as we are the last customer (start eating at 8.15pm). He help to reheat the fish with candle after we finish about 50%.\n\nWill come again next time for other dishes. I saw many ppl come and eat also.",

No MSG, so I can drink the whole bowl of soup without feeling thirsty or having sweaty palms. If you like fish roe like me, can ask uncle if he has fried fish roe. He will only cook this dish if fresh fish roe is available. Do try his 2 homemade chilli sauces too! They both go well with the seafood.",

      "text": "The stall re-surfaces after a hiatus of 1-2 years. I ordered the steamed groupa with vermicelli (Bee Hoon) as a take away. It was my mistake for not asking the price and I had to pay $75 for a 1-kg red groupa and $10 for deposit for the tray to bring the fish home. I accepted that there could be surcharge as it‚Äôs a New Year Holiday but I told the boss he should have told us upfront the prices.\n\nSome reviews said the standard has dropped and the prices have gone up. I think the quality is still as good as before. But $75 for a hawker dish is pretty steep. I will be careful to order that dish again.",
