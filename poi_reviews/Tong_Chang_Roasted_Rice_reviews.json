      "text": "Little secret of residents in the vicinity. Hugely popular with a never ending queue of diners. Sells out really fast. Closes before 1pm as soon as the day's roasted meat is sold out.\n\nChar siew although from leaner cuts, but I can suck on this caramelized meat the whole day. Its char siew marinate is fantastic! Sio bak still retains its crunch and with flavoursome salty hits. Roast duck has a wonderful smokey skin. That charcoal smoke lingered in the mouth even an hour on.\n\nLove it!",

      "text": "Above average, superb for its price range. Simple menu and well executed dishes. Duck was not dry like many I've had. Roast pork has crusty skin and very tender meat. Char siew meat was well balanced perfectly complemented by gravy. Only rice no noodles. Their soup is $2.50 and exceeded my expectations, 4 types of soup and very tender meat even in the soup. Come early or you won't get to enjoy the soup later into lunch.",
