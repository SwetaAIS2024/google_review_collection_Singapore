Catherine Ling,5,I’m always thankful for good QQ noodles and this place usually never disappoints. My favourite chicken feet noodles happen to be just $3.50. Total steal. Chicken rice plus roast pork is also pretty decent. And the side bowl of broth tastes almost like Bak Kut Teh instead of dishwater! I did add a lot of pepper. Polite staff a bonus too.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104381248516022602975/reviews
Human Voice,4,"The taste is up to standard and should be acceptable for most people.

Price is reasonable.

All staff are friendly.

[Barbecued Pork Rice] $4.50
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
The meat is tender and flavorful. Black marinade and winter melon soup are a perfect match! 👍🏻
Plus chicken rice, chili + sambal. WoW👌🏻
Finally, eat cucumber to relieve your tiredness.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112231371052428143383/reviews
