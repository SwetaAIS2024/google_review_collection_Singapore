Revisit for late dinner.  Whole chicken really well fried, juicy inside.  Can tell oil used is quite fresh.  Salad & vege is fresh as well.  Surprisingly Fries is better thn M.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113622753213418799728/reviews

SY,3,"Came here with my hubby, sometimes with family quite a number of times for dinner after my evening walk. Standard dropped so much compared to when it first opened. This time round is the worst. Chicken not as tasty and not well seasoned, so there is a raw chicken taste. Ordered the chicken salad, can’t even get myself to eat it anymore after a few leaves. Salad not fresh at all. Cook didn’t check, Manager also didn’t bother. Maybe they changed the cook? Left unsatisfied and unhappy. 4 stars for serving staff services, 2 stars for Manager. Manager’s role is very important for returning customers and new customers. Can see that sales dropped quite a bit. Not going back again.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105747780294286305616/reviews
XiNERGY LiN,4,"Have to be early if you want to dine here as they do not take reservations. Got there at before 6pm on Sunday and had to wait 30min before a table is available.

Despite the long wait, food was ready within 15min of ordering. Everything there is self service,so just walk over to the collection counter.

Price is acceptable, food quality and portion is good too. As the restaurant is halal and under the branding of tenderbest, plenty of chicken items on the menu. The ambience of the place is not bad, located within the park.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109799344462279679791/reviews
Lydia Heng,2,"Pretty disappointing... Outlet to outlet standard differs. This wasn't good.

The food looked great, but unfortunately we won't be returning again except for the crispy chicken chop.

Inside AC seating was quite smelly to us so we sat outside instead which had a nice atmosphere.

Rating 5/10

⭐ Crispy Skin Chicken chop
Chicken chop was great with crispy skin, but the chicken was too flat. Better if it was bigger portion or thicker.

⭐ Half Spring Chicken with Aglio olio
- not al dente, overcooked
- aglio olio more oily but doesn't have the garlic taste

⭐ Hawaiian Pizza
Wasn't spectacular. Mediocre. Not the thinnest pizza as proclaimed. The bread dough was nicer than the filling itself",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110477061035605935081/reviews
