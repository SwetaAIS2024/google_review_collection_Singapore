Jumain Kalil,1,"Your Staff Nurul is very RUDE!! I bought 2 happiness plate 6 chicken. She only give me 5 chilli sachets. So i requested extra chilli, because theres many chicken. She said must pay $0.20 for 2 chilli. I tell her. Even KFC will give because it make sense. How are you going to feast with many piece of chicken with ONLY 6 chilli sachets. Think about it. when i walk away she said out loud ""Complain Ah, Complain Ah"". So i am doing it now upon her request.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116607837920880871630/reviews
Ng Heng Siong,2,"Ordered
1 x bbq half spring chicken with pasta(add pasta)
1 x 3pcs fried chicken.
1 x coleslaw
It's dinner time and needed to wait, which is fine. Eventually I got it after 10 minutes. Grab it and when home. Turns out, half spring chicken is missing......I think the food packer got confused by the word ""pasta only"". Something needs to be done to the menu.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111847372828079824979/reviews
sofiah,1,"ordered thru foodpanda multiple times and all those times not once have they made my order on time. every time i have to wait there for 30-50 minutes for chicken and fries. horrible service. two different instances. when i went up to ask wheres my order, they have not prepare it although i arrived 15+ minutes after collection time. theres a reason why we order thru foodpanda/grab but seems like they prioritise those who orders thru counter. (waited almost up to an hr today for chicken tortilla and fries lol.)",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110381826647353136038/reviews
Bluu,5,"Huge wings!!! Super flavourful, meaty and delicious. The chilli is also great, I like the sour spiciness of it! Reasonable speed of getting my order at the counter. Had this 3 times, never had any issues. No issues with the staff either.

I think it'll be good to just cut up the parts by default.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108575493607172405079/reviews
Jaslyn Lim,1,"Service is horrible. The Malay lady standing at the cashier is always very rude and has a black face, as if like customers owe her something. Ordered the bolognese chicken spaghetti and wanted the sauce to be put together with the pasta, not separate. She gave me a black face and said, “separate already”. It was just a simple request/question. No need to be rude lol.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109441526216784090224/reviews
