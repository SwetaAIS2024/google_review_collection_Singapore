Priced at $5.50 only, each set comes with a choice of meat (e.g. fish, beef, chicken, pork), vegetables, sliced fishballs/crab sticks, an egg and an individual pot of soup of my choice (e.g. chicken soup, mala soup, tom yam soup, herbal soup).",

Waiting time is a bit long, but given that it's just one uncle manning the shop, I can understand it. Saw quite a few customers just \"self-servicing\" where possible to speed up the process (e.g. taking their own extra bowls and cutlery from the racks). Will come back when I have some extra time on hand.",

Soup bases are chicken, mala, tom yum, or herbal.\n\nThe portions are generous and flavourful so it's definitely worth for money! Huge downside is the long queue - I queued for 1 hour on weekend. It's also a one-man store operation, really wish there was a way to speed up the operations.",

However the seller’s attitude is bad, he refused to provide us an extra bowl to dine even though we ordered two set meals together with side dishes. Will I come back? Probably not due to slow and unfriendly service.",
