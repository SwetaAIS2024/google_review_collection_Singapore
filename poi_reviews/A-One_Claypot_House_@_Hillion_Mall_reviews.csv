carol liem,4,"I love the Claypot porridge here. It is delicious and generous in servings. We ordered the lunch set, the set is very worth it. It comes with Sesame oil chicken and their home-made tofu with vegetables. We had an overall great experience dining here.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103700477221165577307/reviews
Lee Li Ying,1,"came here for grab’s tues dineout deal but think dont come here bahh its really quite overpriced and the food is like meh only caifan standard. the scallops in the broccoli scallop dish was also ridiculously small (understand the image is not drawn to scale in their menu but this is really such a clickbait) when jokingly pointed out the size of the scallops to the staff they also didnt bother explaining / rectifying. and indeed like the other reviewers here - the barley is really very diluted… food was served slow also. overall just a super overpriced (even after my grab discount) and bad experience, will not wish this on anyone. please go eat somewhere else and dont be like me :((",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107328944795307891799/reviews
Ryan H,1,"Ordered Chaipo fried rice…. It came without chaipo. Then when u asked for it. They charge u $1 extra. Paid 13+1 dollars (before service charge & GST) for fried rice. Didn’t know that Chaipo (chopped salted radish) cost so much these days.

Fried prawn ball & prawn cake came burnt. You tiao all cold & soggy. Don’t bother eating at this outlet again. Service from assistant manager Jocelyn …. Lousy.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117759623778134986910/reviews

SeungJun Kim,3,"I'll be very honest here.
Customer service: 5 stars
Price: 2 stars, overpriced
Food: 3 stars, average
This is the kind of restaurant rich Chinese families would go. Food tastes bland so they're definitely healthier for sure. But I wouldn't come back here with my family. However it's a great restaurant for rich Chinese families with elderly. Their customer service is excellent",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100958975977925692266/reviews
