Edo Lego,4,"It’s a festive season, there is a few types of lovely Christmas cakes. This one is velvet layered cake. Creamy and the sweetness is just nice. Paired with the white chocolate ornaments giving different mouthful texture. The best part is the small cake on top of the big one which is also sold separately. The strawberrry was fresh.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108654331369460936112/reviews
Ayesha Toe,1,"Photo 1 - Mango Mint from Paris Baguette Singapore 8.30$

Photo 2 - Mango Mint from other cafe in sg 7.90 $ serve with delicious and flavourful mango puree with good quality mint leaves and @Perrier Sparkling Water. (When I go to Arab street area, I often buy their Mango Mint 👍👍👍)

I was at the Jem Paris Baguette yesterday and the mango mint disappointed me so much as the drink came with huge mango cubes (no taste and no flavour) with soda water.
Since they charge 8.30$ for such a tasteless mango mint, hope they would improve the recipe. 🤞",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103763410657483637199/reviews
