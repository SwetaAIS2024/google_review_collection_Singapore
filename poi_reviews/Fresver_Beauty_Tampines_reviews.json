People here are generally friendly and  managers Ivy and Rena are personable and caring.\n\nI’ve been well serviced by the longer term staff - Irene & Tina , they are good with their facial services. Body treatment done here are with Xiao Jie is fantastic.\n\nThey do push for their packages and products time to time, it really depends on the individual whether to purchase or not. If you do not wish to get, just be firm and say no. They are accepting and understanding.",

The ambiance was calming and the products used were top-quality.\n\nThe best I like about this place is that staff will recommend you add-on (as per any other shops that I went) BUT they do not hard sell and keep pushing you to buy the add-on!!\n\nI highly recommend this service to anyone looking to rejuvenate their skin and enjoy some well-deserved self-care.",

      "text": "I've never been so stressed during a facial in my life. I already have an established routine they were gonna do for me, but the therapist kept recommending additional hydration treatments. Out of courtesy, I responded with polite “mm hmm” noises — my face was covered and I couldn’t speak properly — but somehow she took that as permission to register me for an expensive booster pack I never agreed to. When I clarified that I didn’t consent, she gaslighted me by insisting I had agreed and was now backing out, which was simply not true.\n\nAfter I declined, she went completely silent for the rest of the session. Once she applied a freezing cold mask and covered my eyes, she left the room for a long time. I was left alone, cold and uncomfortable, while I could hear chatting outside. It was awkward, stressful, and the complete opposite of a relaxing experience.\n\nTo make things worse, they pressured me to fill out a rating form while watching over my shoulder. I felt so uncomfortable I gave higher scores just to leave quickly. The final straw was being taken to a tiny room with two staff trying to hard-sell me even more packages. I've never felt more intimidated at a facial appointment. This experience was completely unprofessional and I would never return.",
