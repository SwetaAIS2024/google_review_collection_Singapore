Very attentive, and personal service. When my son doesn't drink green tea, she offered to swap it to ice water. Totally unexpected and we appreciate her initiative.\nYenny truly made tonight's dinner a very pleasant experience.",

My friend and I came in for dinner and were pleased with the large portions, variety of dishes, convenience of ordering via QR code and speed of order readiness. Note the specials on set dinners for S$29.90 and special deals on certain types of bank cards. There is a children's menu and lots of delicious ice cream. Many thanks to the restaurant staff for such a wonderful dinner. Recommended!",

Though there was a sign saying waiting time is 15-30mins, I was seated in 5.\nFood is nice, had a curry set plus some fried tofu. The chicken curry was delicious, being the main of the set, maybe the size was a bit smaller than expected, but by the time I finished I was full full. Recommended, wouldn't mind going back.",
