Anything 4 Food,5,"I ordered catering from Fong Fu for a church event, and wow (as seen from the pic) the food was completely wiped out by the end! Their dishes were a huge hit with everyone.

Not only was the food delicious, but the service was also super responsive and professional. The setup they provided really boosted the atmosphereof our event.

Highly recommend Fong Fu Food Catering. will definitely order again! Well done!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100702618053574492487/reviews

Jaslin Lu,5,"We recently used for a funeral buffet, and the food was excellent! We received many compliments, especially on the flavorful Eufu noodles.

They also managed to accommodate our requests on short notice, which we really appreciated. Highly recommend! 👍🏻",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112349431809568589705/reviews
Azel,5,"Catered for about 300 people.

Solid service, timely, and most of the dishes were great!

We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to Charlie and his team for going the extra mile—from menu curation, to meal sampling, to arranging the tables and chairs for us, and the set up and service during the lunch session.

Other than this buffet, we hold a lunch twice a month and because of Charlie and his team's diligence and quality of food, have decided to give the entire year's order to them. Thanks again Fong Fu!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103827500388485054929/reviews
