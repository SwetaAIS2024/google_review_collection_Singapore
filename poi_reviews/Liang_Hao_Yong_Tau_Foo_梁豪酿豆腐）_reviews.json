      "text": "Honestly, this is about the only place in Singapore where I eat curry laksa nowadays. I'm sure there are others equally good but I'm happy to stick with this!\nIt's operated by a very industrious and courteous couple. All the brightly lit ingredients are neatly arranged, plenty to choose from, fresh and of decent size.\nCrucially, their curry laksa is not watered down. It's not overly spicy and has a nicely balanced taste. I like it so much I don't bother going to look for alternatives.",

      "text": "Their curry was so rich and lemak, probably the best I had from a YTF stall. However, they do not refry the deep fried items upon order, not only that they actually boiled it with the rest of the items which was quite a put off , the curry gravy somehow saves the day and still makes the dish overall enjoyable, but can't imagine how would those 'boiled' deep-fried stuffs taste like if you're just having it in a plain dry version.\n\nStill I think this is a good place for YTF if you one that usually doesn't order the deep-fried stuffs.",
