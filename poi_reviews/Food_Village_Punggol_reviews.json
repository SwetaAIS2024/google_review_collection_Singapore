      "text": "This is another gem of a coffeeshop in Punggol. Location is airy and there are tables outside if you find it too noisy. Food-wise there is a good variety of food options. Personally I like the economic rice stall, mala hotpot stall, and the Bah Kut Teh (Malaysia herbal style).\n\n(Update 2024/April) The economic rice (za cai fan) stall is now cooked and served by the duo formerly from Punggol 312A (across Punggol Cove Pri School). Food is very tasty, not too salty, and portion is *GENEROUS*. Have tried many za cai fan stalls around Punggol and I can say this is the best you'll find in Punggol.\n\nThere's also a Claypot chicken stall. Will update this review again when I try it.",

Though soup are refillable. Worst of the worst I found a fly in my soup after I drank half of the bowl. I do not recommend and will never try this stall again.",

Great staples like Western and Mala, 2 unique Japanese options, and a new stall with Thai Tom Yum Goong and light bites.\n\nAnd while we love our Prata, I strongly recommend the Poori Set at the Indian Muslim stall. Made fresh and crispy, this treat is to wake up for.",
