Ev,5,"I had very stiff neck and shoulder that caused terrible soreness.
I went to a massage spa yesterday, did an 1 hour massage in these affected spots but still not improving much.

Hence needed alternative help. I received treatment by
TCM Physician Lin Chih Chiang, to my surprise, he actually cured it. My stiffness gone almost right away.

I was so impressed, glad the soreness was gone and I'm able to have a long awaited good night sleep!

Thank you very much! üôè",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105439494723492784969/reviews
Daniel Tio,1,"Well stocked and popular TCM with experienced chinese TCM.

But horrible counter staff. And an appointment/administration system that doesn't work.

Even with an appointment made in advance, you need to wait for 1 hour. It is as though it is on a first come first serve basis. And packing of medicine takes bloody forever

They give out queue numbers, and the bell rings, but there isn't a board showing the numbers?! It is purely for the counter staff to see, who will then shout out the names.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113055422804662537649/reviews
