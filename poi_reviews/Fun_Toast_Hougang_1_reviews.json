My coffee is cold already.\nThis is ridiculous.",

Do we really need 20+ min to make coffee?\n\nSlow until I’ve watched at least 5 customer in queue walk away.\n\nWorst thing? There wasn’t even a lot of customers sitting in the restaurant. Only 3 tables had people.\n\nSeriously either train your staff or get more because 20+ min for a cup of coffee when there’s no one on the restaurant is a ridiculous amount of wait time.",

I understand if it was $1 max but $1.80 seems abit far fetched. I clarified with the cashier and she just brushed me off. There should be consistencies and transparency in your pricing (note it down somewhere), so that customers can see and everyone abides by it. Now I don’t know if the price is accurate due to the inconsistency and lack of transparency.",
