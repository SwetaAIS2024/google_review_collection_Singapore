      "text": "I recently visited Kimly Coffee Shop in the Punggol Northshore area and had the pleasure of trying Bai Li Xiang Economic Bee Hoon. It's safe to say that this stall is the hidden gem of the coffee shop. The bee Hoon and mee they serve are simply delicious. The flavors are on point, and they offer a satisfying portion for the price, making it a budget-friendly option.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their food. The bee Hoon had a wonderful texture, not too dry or overly saucy, and it was well-seasoned. The accompanying ingredients were fresh and added a nice variety of flavors and textures to the dish.\n\nOne of the best things about Bai Li Xiang Economic Bee Hoon is that it doesn't break the bank. You get great taste without emptying your wallet. With such a tasty and affordable option in the area, I can foresee long queues forming as word gets out about this delightful find. If you're in the mood for some satisfying bee Hoon and mee, don't miss out on this spot at Kimly Coffee Shop.",
