Obviously a bit strange as the only client. He explained us there is a new menu but that some things we chose were not available yet. Also beers on tap was limited to one kind as they had an event the day before. The food we was not so good which we told him as he asked us to be honest. However, nice music and I can imagine when more ppl a pleasant place. We are willing to give it another try and chance",

Bar Room management changed and they’re “sisters” to Blu Kouzina now (probably been quite some time already since the last I came to Bar Room was a long while ago). Staff were friendly and kind to bring our dogs a water bowl even without us asking.\n\nAbsolutely loved the Korean fried chicken (a nice mix of sweet and spicy)! The salmon and cream pasta we had on the other hand was just average.\n\nWould come back again with our fur kids :)",

Atmosphere was lively, and although the place was bustling when we arrived, the staff attended to us immediately and I must say the service was excellent.\n\nReally decent prices for beers, and they serve some interesting Greek beer options too. I will be back to try the food",
