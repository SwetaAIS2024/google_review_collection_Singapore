She thoroughly explains every diagnosis properly and gives the best advice on how to take care of my health better. She's extremely attentive to her patients. She doesn't rush through her consultations and takes time to explain and this makes me feel safe and assured with her.\n\nShe's my family's go-to doctor everytime. I have a company subsidised doctor just a walking distance away where I can get company sponsored consultation and prescriptions but I always go to Dr Dina everytime. Simply because she's the best. Thanks Dr Dina! ❤️",
