      "text": "I had a pleasant dental cleaning experience with Dr. Sean Lee recently. As someone who has always been apprehensive about dental visits due to a fear of pain, I was especially relieved by the professional care I received.\n\nDr. Sean Lee was incredibly understanding of my concerns. He explained each step clearly and made sure I was comfortable throughout. I was impressed by his gentle approach, which made the entire experience far less stressful than I anticipated. The use of numbing agents ensured I didnâ€™t feel any pain, which was a major relief.\n\nI highly recommend Dr. Sean Lee for anyone who shares similar anxieties.",

      "text": "Two weeks ago, I went to Raffles Dental to get a replacement for my retainer and picked it up a week later. However, the retainer never fit properly. The orthodontist who helped me put it on didnâ€™t give me any time to check the fit or test it by biting down.\n\nAfter wearing it for two nights, I realized it was uncomfortable and not fitting right, so I called back to ask for help. Unfortunately, Raffles Dental informed me that I would be charged againâ€”as if I were a new patient. Disappointed, I ended up contacting my original orthodontist in California and asked them to ship me a new set instead.\n\nThe cost at Raffles Dental wasn't cheap. I paid S$500 for the retainer, which included consumables and two visits.\nIn the end, I see that S$500 as expensive tuition for a hard lesson learned.",
