Kim Hong,3,An old and quaint mall that is bustling with people. Walkways are very narrow. 3 floors with many aesthetic shops taking over the 3rd floor. Super neighbourhood mall.. but you'll get all your necessities here.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110474306946590265362/reviews
Reynash,2,"Mall overall great with lots of facilities but the toilets are unbelievably disappointing.
For the ground flour toilet, you have to pay 20 cents?! ridiculous
the second floor toilet for FEMALES only so for males it is very inconvenient as you have to head up to the third floor! The mall needs a change.

the third floor toilet is also very messy, usually alot of trash and tissue thrown in the sink",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116148392647099881848/reviews
CW T,3,"I visited this suburban mall on a Sunday afternoon. It was extremely crowded. The walkway passages were extremely narrow and there were also people blocking the way trying to sell insurance, credit cards and so on. There were many food and beverage outlets and other retail stores.  Overall it was a very unpleasant and stressful experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110213850832346635768/reviews
Roger Thomas Tan,5,"Nice place to go for easy walk about. There are many eateries here also popular bookshop, challenger and Japan Home. They also have 12 cupcakes and four leaves too! Prima Deli here sells very popular waffles that people queue up for. Many patrons go to ya Kun and Toast Box! Burger King here is nice place to go and relax! Just above Kovan mrt it is easily accessible! Toilets are located at level 3 for guys. Toilets for ladies are located at both level 2 and level 3. Toilets at ground level need payment for entry. For a small mall this place has lots of shops especially eateries!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106328611890771249243/reviews
