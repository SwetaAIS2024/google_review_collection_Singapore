Mushroom soup was nice if thereâ€™s smtg I would order again is the soup and that yellow drink smoothie mango whatever the name is with the sprinkles ontop. Wouldnâ€™t get the lychee rose lime taste like does plum asam candy  ur if you like that taste then go ahead. Overall great taste and value nice cafe located near eco botanical a lot of food shops around.",

      "text": "this is the cafe that makes me feel of coming back and recommending to others,, one of the best pumpkin soups ive tried so far as it riches in flavour and consistency. they were out of breads atm and we were given a discount for that haha.\n\nchicken curry katsu is fulfilling, the curry finished before we even realised and the egg was nicely cooked.\n\ntheir signature- souffle is okay, not as airy as others but such a great idea to serve along w the flakes & muesli. (the cream is a bit sweet imo)\n\nthe drinks are full bodied! this cafe conveys how matcha should taste & be strong like.\n\nstaffs are so welcoming & helpful and would always refill your drinking water without u having to ask. overall i love this cafe!",

      "text": "ðŸ¤•I believe thereâ€™s a design flaw with the stone pebble flooring, especially near the tables along the window area in front of the bar. This poses a safety concern. I almost tripped while walking to our table, and unfortunately, on our way out, my pregnant wife fell on her knees while navigating through the crowd in front of the counter. If the staff had informed us to be cautious in this area, it might have prevented her fall. She is currently recovering from the incident, and I hope nothing serious happens. ðŸ˜¢\n\nOn a positive note, the food was good. I ordered the Chili Softshell Crab Pasta, and the combination of spices and umami blended well with the texture of the pasta. My wife had the Salmon Mentaiko Don and Truffle Foie Gras Chawamushi.\n\nOverall, the service was prompt, and the food was enjoyable. However, due to this incident, we are hesitant about returning.",
