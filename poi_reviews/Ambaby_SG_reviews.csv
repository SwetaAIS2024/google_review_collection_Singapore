Shasha Malik,5,"I was invited to my friend's kid's birthday the last minute but my partner and I knew the best gift for the baby was a football jersey.
Even though it was only 2 days before the event, Nisa still took up this job and pulled it off fantastically in less than 24 hours!
She also accommodated to my request of renting a Popstation so I can collect it at odd hours only during which I can make it.
We are beyond grateful for her to be very accommodating and for taking up our last minute order.

Above all, the quality of the baby clothing is excellent! We feel this is the best quality every child should wear for a jersey!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110961319110802160970/reviews
