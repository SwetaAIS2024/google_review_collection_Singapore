      "text": "We’ve had such a wonderful experience at Advanced Montessori Bukit Batok West! Our child has been attending for several months now, and we’ve been so impressed with the way the Montessori approach supports early literacy, especially phonics and spelling.\n\nThe teachers are incredibly patient and nurturing, and they truly take the time to meet each child where they are. Our child has not only developed a strong foundation in phonics but is also gaining confidence in spelling words on their own. It’s amazing to see how they learn through hands-on materials and self-directed activities—it makes the learning process both natural and fun.\n\nWe’ve noticed a big difference in how they sound out words, recognize letter patterns, and even try spelling new words during the travel.\n\nWe’re so grateful to the staff at Advanced Montessori Bukit Batok West for fostering such a warm and engaging environment. Highly recommend for any parent looking for a school that builds a strong academic foundation while nurturing a love of learning!",

      "text": "My 3 years old child has been attending classes at the Bukit Batok branch and absolutely loves them. She always looks forward to her lessons, which is a testament to how engaging and enjoyable they are. Her teacher is incredibly patient, caring, and nurturing — creating a warm and supportive environment for learning.\n\nBefore joining the centre, my child was unable to read words, but now she has made remarkable progress. I'm truly grateful for how much she has learned. The regular updates and videos from the learning centre also give us great assurance and allow us to witness her growth firsthand. This morning she was given a newly printed certificate with her photo.\n\nA big thank you to the teacher and the entire team at the centre for your dedication and support!",
