Maha,5,"Pleasantly surprised by this cafe inside the Art & Scoeme museum. The desserts inside the glass display are whimsical and tasted delicious. The mini burger was delicious too with light sauce on it. Forgot to take a pic of the mocha latte, but that was good too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104114054415476068678/reviews
Kai Ling,5,Coffee and pastries place within Artscience museum. Can get busy so didn’t manage to get seats. Staff were well trained - maintained well composed politeness and went about various tasks in an organised manner. Drinks and cakes were nice~,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100635259993109346258/reviews
Vincent Lee,4,"There was quite a buzz around this coffee place, partly due to her celebrity founder, and  her clever packaging from interesting coffee drinks and whimiscal pastries.

For its location and brand power, the beverage and food come with a higher price tag... fine for a once-in-blue-moon indulgence.

The staff who helped us was friendly and very patient when explaining what goes into the specialty coffee we were considering.

A note for the owner/manager; consider retiring older serviceware to match the highend feel of its offering.

The glass used for our coffee has very obvious signs of wear-&-tear, which took away the enjoyment of a decent brew.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111417065994620089449/reviews
Natalie Lee,5,"林俊杰，林距离。First time here after attending JJ Lin concert last Sunday. A fanatic fan of JJ Lin who is drop dead gorgeous, a very handsome and modest 😍 ❤️ artiste with amazing vocals and multi talented. Listen to his songs everyday and never get sick of it. My mood is elevated with every song🎵 which is a masterpiece. 醉赤壁，修炼爱情，不潮不用花钱 etc .  A refreshing experience at Miracle. Ordered Miramisu,  blueberry tart and mac cheese which were all delectable. Price is relatively reasonable as compared to other cafes at MBS. Hope to see JJ Lin popped by his shop one day.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113674494623954863865/reviews
Don Christian Ong,4,Finally get to try Miracle coffee. They have some interesting local coffee choices but I went ahead with the conventional caffe latte. Their price is on the higher end probably due to their location and founder. Coffee is average. Only complaint I had was that their cushioned chairs were all soiled and stained.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115521753701642665783/reviews
