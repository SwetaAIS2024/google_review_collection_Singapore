      "text": "The syllabus is highly relevant and they offer enough practice. The subscriber YouTube re-cap for lessons is useful (if the student reviews mindfully). Not all classes have the same profile. Mr AJ has good awareness of student abilities and we discussed a better fit. My child works better & is less shy at a slower pace and she is asking questions with Teacher Fiona. High ability classes are available too. These are pacey and they stretch the highly numerate students who are also in the centre.  I realized that the marginal improvement was due to us being complacent because a better match required schedule juggling.",

      "text": "My child’s math had improved after attending Matrix Math. The material is focused on problem sums to train the student’s critical thinking and to strengthen their foundation. Teacher Fiona is very dedicated and provided prompt feedback on my child’s progress. She also went the extra mile to go through my child’s school work and request my child to reach earlier to go through his mistakes from previous lesson. Highly recommended!",

My kid only started Matrix for 2 terms and improved from 80%(band2, losing all the marks on problem sums) to 97% in EOY exam and scoring full marks for all her problem sums! I find the questions given during the lessons are very relevant to exam questions and especially so for their holiday booster which i signed my kid for was very beneficial in helping to recap previous topics. Thank u Matrix.",

The lessons synopsis are also very information to parents as well and the weekly review lessons online are very enriching for the students’ development so they are able to review, hone on their skills and keep track of their progress, knowing where they stand. We definitely recommend Matrix Math for students looking to improve themselves!",
