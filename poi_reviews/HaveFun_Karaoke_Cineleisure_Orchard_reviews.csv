jeland9,5,"Great sound system! The 2-hour package includes unlimited soft drinks and two types of snacks, which is a good deal. The price is very reasonable compared to other nearby karaoke brands. I also liked the interior lighting design and the nice decorations — overall a very pleasant experience.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116286967855976792618/reviews
Yoke90 Lau,1,"A friend recommended this karaoke chain, and we end up picked this outlet for its buffet dinner. The place looks modern and clean even the toilets!

We booked a VIP room for our company bonding celebration and enjoyed the karaoke spacious room , which had great additional pool table and darts. The sound system are good too!

Besides, the buffet dinner are simple and limited choices but overall, we had a good time!

However, the big downside was the service. The lady who are assist us at the reception was helpful but the staff who are on the floor assisting us ( not sure is it take charge to take care our room) seemed impatient and unprofessional when handling our request. Even in this environment we can see his face is not happy and unwelcoming to us. It is ruined the experience especially we are spending so much of money. Great venue, but the staff need to be train.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115266500389482084525/reviews
LiV3 LiFe,4,"HaveFun Karaoke is located at Level 8 of Orchard Cineleisure. You will need to take a lift up to the place. A big place with buffet provided for singing karaoke. It is charged based on room usage. No other choice is offered for only using the room without buffet. It can get quite costly at this location. Nonetheless, it is a good experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112429413622143366667/reviews
