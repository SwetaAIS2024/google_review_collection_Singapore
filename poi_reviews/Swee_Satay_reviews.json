Tried the pork and chicken satay, the portion on each stick is a little smaller than what you get elsewhere, the satay was also not smoky enough to make it top grade. The fact that satay is served in a coffeeshop does make it convenient. Maybe if one eats it often, it could be a really good satay for them.",
