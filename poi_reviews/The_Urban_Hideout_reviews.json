      "text": "Came in for dinner! Few patrons with pets around so that was very nice to see.\n\nMentaiko rosti was really goood..... Fluffy and crispy but not too oily and they blow torched the mentaiko which really helps elevate the flavour. Personally prefer it with less mentaiko as it can get Abit salty but my partner loved every bit.\n\nAlfredo was nothing to shout home about. Feels like a standard white sauce pasta (made from cooking cream) but used the oil of guanciale for flavour. Would not recommend this..\n\nWaffles was really good. Fluffy on the inside, not too dry nor too wet. The portion was great too, topped with an ice cream scoop of your choice. We went with pistachio which was pretty good and had pistachio bits.\n\nWill want to visit again to try their breakfast",

      "text": "1st visit. I must say it's a cozy pet friendly hideout. A fusion liked restaurant with the menu because it ve a mix like western, Indian & Japanese. I had the Chicken Curry rice, a signature dish recommended by the staff. Taste is good. Thick gravy that goes well with white rice. Perhaps a touch of lettuce will make it a more balanced meal. The Smash Beef Burger is great, Fish & chips with 2 large pieces nicely battered. A slight draw back are the fries because it's probably slightly over fried. Overall, I give a 5 star for it's ambience, personal attention.\nThere's even pet menu for our furry friends.",

      "text": "Came here for dinner as we were in the area. Love the concept of having your furry family member done with you. With an extensive menus. Great atmosphere as you gets to see lots of pets walk in and they were very well behaved expect the occasional bark or 2. The staff was friendly and our orders were quickly taken with a QR code system. Food was just OK for me. I ordered the fish and chips. Was fresh but just lacked a little seasoning. Wife got the rosette which was a little bit too well done. Overall still a great place to hangout especially if you have pet. Decor is great too.",

      "text": "Food exceeded expectations for a pet cafe. All meals were excellent with special mention for the smash burger. Forgot to photo. It was really really good. The beef patty was moist and well marinated and the entire burger was really so good. The sous vide chicken chop was nicely grilled but yet the meat was still tender and retained its juices. The fried chicken waffle also impressed. The waffle itself was tasty and while it felt strange to eat waffle (associated with dessert) with fried chicken, it was surprisingly nice. Tried the salted macadamia ice cream. Again, impressive! Both the ice cream and the cone was just really delicious. Sometimes a bad cone spoils a good ice cream. The meal experience was one 5 star after another. Staff service was great and the doggy meal was enjoyed by my dog. I tried the pumpkin puree from my dog's meal, and I tell you it's just delicious too hahaha.",
