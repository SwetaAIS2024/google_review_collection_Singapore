      "text": "Delicious old school chicken curry puff by uncle now in mid 70s. Crispy skin and delicious hot pipping fills. Hardworking old man doing his best for passion and living. Long hours and age is not easy for this old shop that makes fresh curry puff. Some mentioned irregular opening hours but let‚Äôs leave a bit of empathy on google to the tired old man. Technologies and reviews has brought down business for old business owners that are not tech savvy enough to update their pages regularly. Overall the taste is still as good. $2.00 now a piece compared to 80cts in 1993. Business is not easy. Pat on the shoulder and Âä†Ê≤π to the boss.",

These Chicken Curry Puffs were crispy, flaky and stuffed to bursting. The curry in these puffs packed a punch, and the generous amount of potatoes is just the icing on the cake.\n\nThe perfect snack on the go, you‚Äôll gravitate to these every time you head to East Coast Lagoon Food Village.",

The skin is quite thick and not crispy, which is still fine. But the filling is rather watery, and some potato pieces are not cooked. Now I am craving for the one at Hong Lim Food Centre.",
