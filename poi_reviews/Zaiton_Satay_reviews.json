They have an electronic tag and alerts you to collect when ready. Payment via Paynow was also efficient and seamless.\n\nSuperbly Delicious!",

I understand that occasional delays happen, but unprepared orders is unacceptable. I could have made alternate arrangements instead of wasting my time waiting.",
