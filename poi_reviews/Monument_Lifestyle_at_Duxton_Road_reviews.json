      "text": "Loved the place. Found this when I was talking a walk back to the Carlton City hotel. It's a cozy little place on Duxton Road which barely fits more than 10 people but it's totally worth the visit. The young bar lady was very nice and eager to help, coffee and cake was delicious. The place also offers (limited) outside seating. Come here if you want to stear clear from the large coffee chains and love local flavour. Will be looking forward to coming back!",

Wishing they had more food options, but I had their piccolo and sesame bagel with garlic chilli cream cheese, and both hits the mark! their cool-meets-quirky indie vibe was outstanding, and I'll definitely be back for more chill days.",
