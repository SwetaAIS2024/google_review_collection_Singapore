I have been to other piano schools but none of the teachers ever introduced if they are accredited to teach. There was one that left me dreading to return for another lesson. Whereas, after the  1st lesson with Joanna, I have become more interested and reading scores were not as arduous. I need more practice as I am a senior but it has become a joy more than a chore.",
