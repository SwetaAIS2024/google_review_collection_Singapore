Daniel Lee,4,"Good Bak Kut Teh, proper herb broth that is light and tasty. Bak Kut meat was fairly soft as well, which is good, but not the kind that falls off the bones when you touch it.

The sides were very flavourful and worth the order, got the salted veg, tau kee and peanuts which makes for a good pairing with the plain rice as well.

Herb soup BKT is still best!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102239755837783315960/reviews
Eric Chia Cher Cheng,1,"Not nice at all, not worth coming. BKT got no fragrance just soya sauce . I cook better than him. Sesame oil chicken worst still chicken not fresh, meat thaw too long, no ginger, no sesame oil smell.

Karen Heng,4,"Came here to try the herbal bak kut teh (Malaysia style) as recommended. The herbal is not bad, would prefer it to be more herbal. The pork ribs are soft and nice. The prawn noodles is good with a nice ‘prawny’ soup and fresh and crunchy prawns. Will come back for the prawn noodles next time. The location is good, right outside Springleaf Station on TEL.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102379501397919138214/reviews

Yang,4,"Hong Ji has been a beloved spot for herbal-style Bak Kut Teh (BKT) in Singapore since 1996. Their Claypot Mixed Herbal Bak Kut Teh ($7.50) offers a comforting, aromatic broth with tender pork ribs, pork offals, mushrooms, and veggies, reminiscent of Malaysian-style BKT. Dough Fritters (You Tiao) and Salted Vegetables ($2 each) complement the dish well. The Braised Pork Meat ($7) and Pork Trotter ($7) are rich, tender, and flavourful, with the pork trotter especially melting in your mouth.

Other highlights include the Pork Ribs Prawn Noodle ($6), though not as memorable, and the Braised Pork Noodle ($6.50), a rich, oily dish packed with flavour. The must-try, however, is the Dry Bak Kut Teh ($9.50), an exclusive at the Upper Thomson outlet. With easily deboned ribs and a rich, sweet-savoury sauce hiding chewy dried squid, it's a dish worth coming back for. All the flavours are perfect with rice!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103078870952547064508/reviews
