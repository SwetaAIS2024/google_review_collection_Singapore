Cheng Huat Soon,5,"Efficient and responsive service from bank staff even its very crowded. Saw two officers  running behind the counter helping counters.
The queue is never ending since opening till I settle my banking issue. Point of contact staff working hard to clear the queue, some uncivilised customers raising voices acting like a monkey. Salute to the staff maintaining their professionalism responding to those hoohaa.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108686999683274528039/reviews
