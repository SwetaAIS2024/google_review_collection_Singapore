I know you all want to cut down counter n expect people go online but doesn't mean we need too wait that dam long!!!! Worse than seeing doctor!!!!

Ashwini Nair,1,The waiting time here is horrendous and thereâ€™s hardly officers ready to serve you. Despite showing as one of spacious banks the execution of customer service and waiting time is terrible. Will not recommend anyone to be at this particular outlet of OCBC,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110680678815955945765/reviews

Ken Peh,1,"The waiting time was really horrendous. This branch opens at 11am. I reached here and got a queue number at 11:04am. To my astonishment, there were already 20 customers in front of my queue number. Moreover the branch has limited seating spaces and there are only 3 customer service counters. While I'm writing this review, I looked at my watch and the time tells me it's 12:15pm. More than an hour and it's still nowhere near my queue number. As a long time OCBC customer, I can't help being immensely disappointed.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113975004215945002265/reviews
