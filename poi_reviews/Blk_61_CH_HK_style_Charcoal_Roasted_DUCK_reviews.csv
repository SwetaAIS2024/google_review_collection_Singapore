CCS,1,"The stall used to be our family's favourite for the last two years but not anymore.

The crispy roast pork (sio bak) used to be well flavoured with the right amount of porky fat. The barbecued meat (char shao) is equally good and has the right amount of caramelized honey.  Have been eating this every other day since Covid-19 circuit breaker.

But for some reason, their meats had become unpredictable - mostly substandard. Maybe they changed suppliers?

Even worse is their attitude. Used to be 5 stars everyday because the lady boss was most friendly. The male helpers, ironically, have that day of the month mood swings every day. Grumpy, gruffy, and rude. Under serving several times.

We not going there anymore.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
