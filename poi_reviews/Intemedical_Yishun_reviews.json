The doctor was thorough and patiently explained my daughter’s medical condition in detail. I also inquired about using Medisave for the influenza jab. While they were initially unsure if my husband’s medical condition qualified, Dr. Damian quickly checked and provided a clear answer. I truly appreciate their efficiency and dedication to patient care. Thank you!",

It really helps to ease the patient mind when you don't make the whole visit into an interview. Lastly, thank you to the receptionist with the awesome tattoos. Your patience and welcome gestures made my day.",
