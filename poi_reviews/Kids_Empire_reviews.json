      "text": "Kids Empire is an excellent nursery! We’ve been very pleased with the teaching and overall learning environment. Our daughter joined when she was 17 months old and we chose this nursery after we were recommended it by a friend.  With so many huge international schools in Singapore, we really appreciated the small size of the classes as the kids get more attention and help from the teachers and also build up a closer bond with their classmates.\nWe’re glad that our daughter can still connect with her teachers and classmates via their great distance learning online classes (covering English, Mandarin, Science and Art) which are effectively running during the COVID19 pandemic. Her teachers are also working very hard with detailed worksheets and powerpoints emailed each week, and art and craft materials couriered to our home. The teachers are devoted to the children, and it shows! We feel very lucky that our very bright daughter is still excited to go to nursery each day after three years attendance. We will be sending our son to Kids Empire as soon as he is old enough to attend.\nWe will be very sad when she will be forced to leave and attend an international school where there are hundreds of children in each year, and she will lose the dedicated and 1:1 intimate tuition she receives at Kids Empire.",

      "text": "I wonder how such a good evaluation is possible. This school is more interested in money than in children. The principal's administrative ability is not good. Even if the child doesn't come to school, they never contact him. I've never received a personal report from this school. Every time I went, a child was crying and they didn't care. It's the worst choice of my life.",
