Leonard Chong,3,"Dinner dated 19 Jan 2025.
$4.50 pork porridge
$4 chicken wings 2 x
Personal thoughts, the pork porridge was not worthy. Chicken meat was ok. Condiment for the chicken meat enhanced the taste.
Maybe next time should order 2 x plain porridge at $1.50 each will be more valuable.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101585984216350252104/reviews
joven (Jovan),5,Fried chicken is the highlight ($3.20)for 2. Well fried and boneless. Old school ham and century egg porridge ($4.5) and bee hoon ($1.5) was worth the try as well. White chicken was good but mine have alot of broken bones.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102199672047050974375/reviews
Daniel Kiang,5,"Great old school cantonese style porridge. The boneless wings are also really good but the steam chicken is a must try. Soft, tender and really well marinated so you don’t even need any sauce. Just eat it on its own and it is delicious.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100223420825612770336/reviews
Darryl Lim,5,"Father and son duo operated stall. Most of the bad reviews here would be first-timers highlighting their demeanor which can come off as rude and ""dao"" because they don't speak much, literally. But regulars would know that's how they are - men of few words.

But you're not here for top-notch customer service, you're here because their food is delicious and affordable. If I ever die, I want their chicken wings to be my last meal - boneless, juicy and oh so succulent. Very generous portions of bee hoon and try their porridge while you're at it. Simple but has a tasty umami richness.

Come early because there's usually a queue. And if you're a jiak kan tang like me, its a good idea to rehearse what to order while waiting in line.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108707595337763857713/reviews
Steven Chow,5,My old neighbourhood. Have not been back since I shift out to Yishun 20 years ago. If not wrong they have been there since 1997-ish or earlier . Glad still found this stall around. Dad and son team dished out yummy dishes. Best chicken wing ever. They de-boned the chicken wing before frying. Eat with their fried bee hoon damn shiok! 白暂鸡also can eat.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107985246054805441513/reviews
