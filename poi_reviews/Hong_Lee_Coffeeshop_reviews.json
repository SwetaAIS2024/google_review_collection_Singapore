While the meat dumplings were plentiful and had a nice chewy texture, there wasn't a lot of meat flavour. The soup had a light flavour and was salty.\n\nUnlike many kopitiam the teh beng here is nice and rich, although quite a bit on the sweeter side so ask for siew dai.",

We tried their popular Monterey Jack Chicken and Fish and Chip (Pan Seared Salmon) and we really love it! Truffle fries not too bad too! For just $3.50 we get a full basket!  Best to eat in when served hot! Will definitely be back to try their other mains!",
