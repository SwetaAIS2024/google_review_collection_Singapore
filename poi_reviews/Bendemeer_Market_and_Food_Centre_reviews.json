Thereâ€™s a variety of food to choose from and you can enjoy different tastes from different stalls. Price is reasonable but the ambience can be hot as it is not air conditioned. I brought some of my American friends here for breakfast and they enjoyed our local food. Thumbs up to our Hawkers food. ðŸ˜‹",
