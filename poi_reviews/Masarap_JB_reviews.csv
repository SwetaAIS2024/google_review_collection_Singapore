Makdet Zaiman,5,"Alhamdulillah... If I could, I would give all the stars in the sky, but since Google Review only allows 5 stars, that’s what I’ll give. From the amazing taste, reasonable prices, friendly staff, and clean restaurant—everything is top-notch. Well done! I will definitely come again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107363004186621396646/reviews
Nurulnabila,3,"The food overall is quite good. But on weekends, it gets really crowded. To the owner, please add more staff—kesian the workers running around taking orders and serving everyone. Meja pun tak sempat nak kemas.

Please upgrade a bit and take care of cleanliness! The spoons and forks on the table mostly aren’t properly cleaned.

And to the kakak (maybe the owner?), please don’t scold your staff in front of customers—it really ruined the mood.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113672178845888317124/reviews
Shazaluddin Amat,4,"One of the best fried keuteow I had around, ordered the special, portion was big u can tasted the smokiness, can request for dry or wet version, we ordered the dry version. Also ordered the mee bandung, they used the thinner type of yellow noodles, portion also generous full with meat, pouched egg and decent amount of big prawns, can tasted the udang kering in the broth, but the broth little bit too sweet for my liking. Shop surrounding was calm, u may sit outdoor. Based on their price and portion it's definitely worth for your money. They had other food options on their menu, surely will try on our next visit. But still their keuteow was their killer menu.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114777921820569532456/reviews
