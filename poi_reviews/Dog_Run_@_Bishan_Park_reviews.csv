T,5,"Nice dog park, very big and spacious. Super clean as well. Came on a weekday so the crowd was quite small. Will definitely come again and hopefully there will be more dogs dogs.

The park is split into 2 different ones for small dogs and big dogs.

There are many cafes in the area that are dog friendly too!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103458881562290659555/reviews
MC Liu,5,"This is one of the more popular dog park in the area. It consists of two separate cages, one for big and one for small dog. Each comes with water tap facilities for drinking or cleaning. The size is large enough for the dog to run and dissipate their energy. However, at times it is quite muddy especially when after rain. The car park is just beside, thus it is very convenient for dog owners.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100088785733373347934/reviews

Ying,5,Great place for dogs to socialise. I love the giant tree. Water was provided. They are having renovation now. I guess it will be even better after renovation. They have area for small dog and big dog. Most of the people prefer to the big dog area.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108469694173089419496/reviews
