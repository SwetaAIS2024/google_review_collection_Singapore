Lydia Yang,5,"By far the best water bottles an adventurer, traveller, climber, cyclist, hiker or even city dweller can have! Super durable, hardy, good size and most critical is the 1 hand manuveur where you can open the water bottle with just 1 hand,  such a critical and useful feature for action sports.
I have travelled with mine for 4 years and it has survived 15 countries and got thru every terrain, temperature and knock. Took 4 years before I had to have them replaced.
Best bottles ever!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117672025831420095402/reviews
Elaine Low,5,"Bought son’s school camp goods from Adventure World and needed urgent collection. The lady in charge helped me to expedite the fulfilment for next day collection. She was careful to check with me to make sure I got the correct pants size, which I actually got it wrong. She changed the right size for me on the spot. Really appreciate her help.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112124788358264696245/reviews

EL,5,"Very nice, friendly and helpful elderly couple who runs the shop. They have everything you need for camp or outdoor activities and would recommend what is essential for a school camp and what's not. Prices are also cheaper and quality is assured.
