Saedah A Latiff,5,"I did gum contouring last week and finished off this week with teeth whitening. Dr Dian is a very soft spoken doctor and reassured me. She explained the procedure and side effects to me well enough that I knew what I can expect when I went through the whitening process. I had a few other procedures I wanted to do to my teeth, but Dr Dian advised based on what would be good enough and I did not regret engaging her service. I loved the results. I did cleaning with i.Dental’s hygienist Ms Emy and she was very thorough. She explained how I could floss better and it is comforting because my teeth were sensitive, even through light cleaning. Thank you i.Dental for making my teeth look amazing!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102942605029637056947/reviews
CHEONG,2,"I have had a couple of visits to this practice, and while the dentists are excellent, there appears to be room for improvement in the backend office operations. Despite personally confirming my next appointment, my scheduled slot was still given to another patient. It seems that the confirmation process may not be fully reliable, and this could be an area for the practice to address to ensure a smoother experience for patients. Based on past reviews, I am not the only one who has encountered this issue, indicating that it may be a recurring concern.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100777291775426330314/reviews

Joyce,3,"We came to this clinic in 2022 for the sake of good customer service and Dr Tong’s professionalism.However since Dec 2024 everything changed. Not from Dr Tong and Ellen as they still gave us tip top service, that’s why I also entrusted my other child with them. However,Dec 2024 was when the customer service became atrocious. We’ve been here for about 3 years so I can recognise all the voices of the receptionist staff.  2 of your receptionists, Shuzhen and the other Indian lady which should be Shini (hope I spelled correctly) because she always intentionally cover her name tag at the counter.Before Whazel went on long leave, the service was satisfactory and the appointment and payment process was always hassle-free. After that these 2 staff started acting up, every time we came into the clinic we were greeted first thing by their black faces and unbothered attitude with impatient tone.We spent so much on this service, are we not at least deserving of basic customer service and decency? They spent all their time chatting with each other and made us stand there after the consultation with Dr Tong for a whopping 15 minutes then they started to process our payment very slowly. This never happened with Whazel or other staff like Katherine so I know that their delay and behaviour  was an anomaly. They have the time to specially plan in advance to go to the toilet together but can happily make us wait for them to process payment. I still can remember vividly when we were already waiting for so long at the counter , Shuzhen still had the time to tell Shini “wait for me let’s go to toilet together!” and straight up ignored us who were already waiting for more than 15 minutes while the other  staff were busy with other customers and phone calls. They were constantly chatting but when they did our payment it was super slow. Secondly, when we called up to make enquiries or change appointment, they enjoyed using fake names in order to shift accountability from their bad service. I remember when I called the clinic to change appointment last year, I clearly recognised Shuzhen’s voice and she was very impatient and rude which was why I asked if it was her, and she immediately denied and said she was May instead. Because we come here all the time, I knew May was no longer working there already and I recognised her voice so I knew she was lying.Another incident on Dec 30 2024 , I received the message that I needed to reschedule appointment as Dr Tong was on leave, so I called clinic back on 2nd January. I called a total of 5 times consecutively that day, and only got picked up the 5th time, after getting picked up by the staff and hanging up the call immediately the first 4 times, which made me incredibly infuriated, because I have to wait for the long  customary waiting time to filter the calls only to be connected to the “real people” just for them to hang up, which made the repeating the process more frustrating. (Hopefully) The last incident was when i arranged my eldest daughter to have an appointment on 15 Feb and a few weeks before that my youngest had one of her attachments drop off. So I called the clinic and asked if we could put my youngest within the same time slot, given that replacing one attachment was fast. The receptionist ( I don’t want to say the name since the person was using a fake name again) was very adamant that that was not possible at all, refusing to ask even when I requested to just check with Dr Tong, and insisted that I book a separate appointment just 3 days after 15 Feb’s appointment. She keep telling me “Impossible. Can’t do”. For one attachment. But when we consulted Dr Tong at ubi branch a while after that call, he actually said it was okay to put both on the same time slot since he said it was a fast treatment, and was also more convenient for us instead making us go so many times in the span of 3 days. I really hope the next time I come to idental Capital Tower I would no longer have to encounter them. Disclaimer my star rating is credited to everyone in this clinic except these 2.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104980611257734605864/reviews
CC Ong,1,"The customer service really need to improve. I called in for enquiries about Dr Cheng consultation for invisalign treatment, the CS (a chinese lady) that picked up my call was kind of impatient and rude. When I asked for her name, she refused to tell me. Lucky I have yet to start the treatment.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103835725818065581917/reviews
