      "text": "School Review\n\nThe students at this school are absolutely amazimg, friendly, hardworking, and full of talent. They make the environment vibrant and enjoyable, creating a sense of camaraderie that's hard to find elsewhere. However, the teaching staff is a mixed bag. While some teachers are inspiring and dedicated, others can be dismissive, unapproachable, and downright unpleasant, which detracts from the overall learning experience.Another major drawback is the state of the toilets. It's almost impossible to step into them without being overwhelmed by the smell. Many toilets are often found with unflushed waste or dirty floors, which is both unhygienic and an embarrassment for a school of this caliber.In summary, the school has incredible students and great potential, but it seriously needs to address its teacher dynamics and sanitation issues.",

My son has friends from all over the world.",

      "text": "Cantonment Primary: Aight, Not Bad\n\nSo, I went to this school, Cantonment Primary, and it was... okay, I guess. Like, it wasn't the worst, but it wasn't the best either. You know what I mean?\n\nThe teachers were cool. Some were funny, some were strict, but they were all pretty chill. The classes were kinda boring sometimes, but there were a few fun projects and field trips. And the canteen food... let's just say I didn't starve, but it wasn't exactly a feast either.\n\nThe school grounds were nice, though. Lots of trees and open spaces to run around. And the location was pretty convenient, so getting to and from school wasn't a hassle.\n\nOverall, Cantonment Primary was just... average. If you're looking for a good school, it's definitely worth checking out. But if you're expecting something amazing, you might be disappointed.",
