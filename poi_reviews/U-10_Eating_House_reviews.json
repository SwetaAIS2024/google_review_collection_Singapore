      "text": "Nice hawker in Ubi, always packed with working people during lunch hours. Wide selection of food options from mix rice, chicken rice, vegetarian, fish soup noodles, pork knuckles, Vietnam cuisine and Malay food.\n\nI always go for mix rice (1 veg + 1 meat @ $3.5), or Malay rice (1 veg + 1 meat @ $3-5) occasionally will settle with shrimp spring roll ($3) as a snack\n\nLove that they have indoors and outdoors (facing carpark and main road) area so I can bask in the sun during chilly days.",

The chicken was a little salty but I’m cool, the rice was a little oil but I’m cool. BUT the peanut soup was the highlight and the saving grace to satisfy my afternoon hunger.\n\nWill be back for affordable chicken rice and to try the other stalls.",
