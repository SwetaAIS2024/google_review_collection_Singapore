Kenneth Lee,5,"I had to do an urgent filling and I‚Äôm thankful that Dr Grace at Q & M could slot me in at the end of the day to rectify my issue.

Dr Grace and team were very thorough with the explanations and they were gentle yet succinct and precise with the procedure. Thank you so much for all your help!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101880682982581996030/reviews

Neelanjan Bhattacharya,5,"Visited Q&M at Novena. My kid 4 year old seen by Dr Stephanie.
Dr Stephanie could easily make my child comfortable with the clinical environment and treatment . As a result, my child was at ease. Dr Stephanie explained us in detail about his teeth condition and about the treatment. She goes above and beyond to help the patients and most importantly, she can connect with the little kids so well so they can receive treatment very well.
My child dental condition has improved after her treatment.
Strongly recommend Dr Stephanie and we look forward to see her again!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113382795498694484167/reviews
Carisma Magbanua,5,"From Orchard to Novena dental surgery..But I still looking for Doctor Sarah.
She‚Äôs very professional,kind and passionate dentist.
I just had my molar tooth extraction yesterday.
It‚Äôs hard to remove because the root was very deep.
But Dr.Sarah did a great job to removed it with the normal procedure.üí™
And as well she patiently and clearly explained about the other procedures to be done sooner of my other teeth.üòä
I acknowledge Dr.Sarah‚Äôs commitment to the patient wellness and showing empathy.
I highly recommend her service to those who needs dental care.
And also the assistant nurse was very helpful and the front desk receptionist are accommodating.
Keep it up the good work/service.
Thanks alot.üòç",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107218559571301006940/reviews
Zach Johnson,1,"Extremely unprofessional!

Book appointment and they don‚Äôt reply and I followed up with a call.

The receptionist mentioned that have to wait for email confirmation.

Since it‚Äôs three days away I was checking when they could confirm.

Only then she started checking and replied that the day and time slot I booked was not available.

Very disappointing",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102219351146741955945/reviews
