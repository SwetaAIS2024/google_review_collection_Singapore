I understand that itâ€™s Motherâ€™s Day and the volume of orders may be high. I decided to be patient and wait.\n\nAt 7:15pm, two self pick-up orders were ready, but neither were mine. I checked the slips - one was for GrabFood and the other was for Foodpanda. Both were placed at 6:58pm, and were given pick-up time of 7:15pm. So orders placed 20 minutes after mine faced no issue and were ready on time as promised.\n\nMy order was only ready at 7:23pm, a whole half hour after the promised pick-up time. Clearly thereâ€™s no effort to ensure customers are served on a first-come-first-served basis.",
