LeeJcc,5,"It's a relaxing airport, unlike Changi. Only Firefly flies there - it's almost like having your own plane. So far, the only destination is Subang Airport, which is closer than KLIA to KL and PJ.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106754183282029956192/reviews
Yap Hoe BENG,5,"Seletar Airport for small aircraft & a Subang trip. A 30 minute grace period for parking which we used to go to the wash room & a 15 minute rest  on the large carriage comfortable chair. There is only one stall selling mostly noodle & rice. A small airport, cool, & refreshing.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116220693681278781294/reviews
Alexey Subach,5,"A nice tiny airport with only 1, max 2 flights per hour. You can arrive 70-80 minutes before departure and it should give you more than enough time even to check in your baggage. The staff were good, the whole process at the airport is quick and efficient",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106339600033490415641/reviews
Jac Yim,5,"A quiet airport for only few airlines here. Mostly private jets land at this airport.
Service was good here. Only one coffee shop available here, but it is adequate to cater for the travellers here.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106702814414872266154/reviews
P A,2,"Going to Seletar Airport is relatively easy with taxi but coming back from Seletar Airport is an issue if you are travelling with a baby or toddler since Grab are usually not an option or very limited drivers with child seat etc. Taxi was non existence and there is only a long winding bus service 102 that can bring you to Sengkang MRT after a 35 mins bus ride. The staff at the airport was very helpful though. However, i think the transportation options need to be improve or ramp up to make travelling from this airport to town easier with more taxis around at least",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111671167201083099092/reviews
