Decided to give Sam a try and was pleasantly surprised, ordered the hokkien mee and unlike what they usually serve outside, this has the distinct home cooked flavour, they also added shallots in which is uncommon but gave a dish a good boost in flavour.\n\nOnly hope that the fried lard is crispier and serve ld with lime + sambal by default. Will return to try the other dishes.",
