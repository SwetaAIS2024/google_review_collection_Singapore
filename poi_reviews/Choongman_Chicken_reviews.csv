현상,5,"It had the familiar taste of Korean fried chicken, and I was very satisfied with it.
I was surprised by how different the actual food looked compared to the photo on the menu.
If you're expecting the large fried chicken portions commonly found in Korea, you might find it a bit different here. However, one great advantage is the affordable price, which allows you to try a variety of dishes without spending too much. I recommend ordering several different items and enjoying the variety!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117857537862025730461/reviews
