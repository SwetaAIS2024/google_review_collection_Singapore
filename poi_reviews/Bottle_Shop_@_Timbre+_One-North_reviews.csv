Flo Yeow,3,"It's a drinks stall at a coffee shop, but with a wide variety of different alcohols for the picking. Don't expect good service, given that it's like I said, like a coffee shop. Prices are fair, great for after work drinks if you're working in the area. We got ourselves some Guiness draught on tap. 3 for 33, one drink before heading home.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Ming Cheng,5,"There was a pretty good selection of craft beers and the cocktails were quite affordable. For instance, you can get two decent gin-and-tonics for only $22. Staff were friendly too.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117988198545701601245/reviews
S Wun,4,"Love the supermarket concept of a walk in beer shop. Choose and pay at counter.

Cashier was also on his toes as he alerted me that the drink I chose was non-alcoholic, in case I wanted a beer :)

But yes, it was the tea I was after....",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110012229164046535881/reviews

Vincent Lee,1,"Was drawn by the seemingly wide selection of craft beer, but thereâ€™s only 4 very normal beer/stout on draft. Staff are unfriendly and treat you as if they are doing you a favor. Prices are expensive too. No reason to patronise them again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104331045651320958220/reviews
