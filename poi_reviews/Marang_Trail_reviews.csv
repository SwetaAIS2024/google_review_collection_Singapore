Aung Po Po (Po),5,"The Marang Trail at Mount Faber is a hidden gem for nature lovers and urban explorers in Singapore. Starting near HarbourFront MRT Exit D, this 400-meter trail offers a short but invigorating hike up to Mount Faber Park.

The path is surrounded by lush greenery, with towering trees providing shade, making it a serene escape from the bustling city below.

The trail primarily consists of stairs, offering a good workout as you ascend approximately 100 meters in elevation. While the climb can be challenging for some, the effort is rewarding with panoramic views of the city skyline, Sentosa Island, and the cable cars once you reach higher points. The trail is well-maintained, with clear signage ensuring you won’t get lost.

Perfect for a quick nature retreat, the Marang Trail connects seamlessly to other attractions like Henderson Waves and Faber Peak. However, it may not be suitable for those with mobility issues due to its steep steps. Remember to wear comfortable shoes and bring water, as there are no facilities along the way.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116715682666130759535/reviews
Pooja Consul,4,"This is a short paved trail that takes you from Harbourfront MRT to Mount Faber peak.  The entrance to the trail is a bit hard to find due to the construction work going on.
The trail is well shaded and offers nice views near the top. It takes 15-20 min to climb up to Mount Faber peak without stops.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104995271692542393537/reviews
CK Cheong,4,"The Marang trail starts from the car park next to Harbourfront MRT and continues to Mount Faber Park. The trail is not long and takes around 15-20 minutes for someone of average fitness. The start is an uphill climb, hence can be a little strenuous. Not suitable if you have mobility issues",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114524725497942089541/reviews
Vincent Khoo,3,"There is no road sign from outside of the road to show you about this trail, and there is a construction going on near the entrance as well. So you may miss if if not careful enough. The trail is cover with mainly steps to reach Mount Faber in about 15 min or so. Still it is a good place to go if you never been before.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109845981260181580873/reviews
Vincent Lee,4,"This is one of the entry point to the trails and bridges along Southern Ridges near to Harbor Front MRT.

The trail covers an elevation of 70 metres (or the equivalent of a 24-storey building) with concrete steps and gentle slopes.

At the top of the trail you will arrive at Mount Faber where you can ride a cable car towards Sentosa or explore the rest of Southern Ridges.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111417065994620089449/reviews
