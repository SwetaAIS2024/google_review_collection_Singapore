C,3,"Crayfish all year round, so we always visit whenever we’re here. Tasted a little frozen this time round but the sauce is still really good. Petai was a little harder and sauce wasn’t as good but not too bad.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109477732884918793623/reviews
Derek Low,1,"It's extremely rare for me at award a 1-star rating to any eatery as I know F&B business is a very difficult industry in Singapore. Having said this, this place simply blows my mind. Taking their mediocre taste into consideration, this probably is the priciest Tze Char in Hougang. $10.30 for a box of salted egg dice chicken with white rice really teaches A-level student the meaning profitization.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111399497473986197450/reviews

Bryan Kang,1,Ordered in by Deliveroo. Wifes hor fun tasteless. my yang zhou fried rice is one of the worst i ever had. no wok hey for both. and my prawn is super  sticky unfresh. Didnt even give 2 packets of green chilli for this 2 items. only 1 to share between us. I think they don eat their own cooked food.  Had to use own sambal and pickles to just fill the tummy.
