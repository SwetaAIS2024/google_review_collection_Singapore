      "text": "I am currently a student at Matrix Math in primary 6. Although I do not see any reviews for Teacher Chermaine, I would like to tell everyone reading my review about her. Teacher Chermaine is a kind and caring teacher that spends her time after class going through my additional practice, although it is already her dinner time. She explains the class work given very clearly to me. And for all the reasons above, I now have a more positive approach to maths. I would definitely want her to be my tutor next year.",

      "text": "My child has been going to the marine parade branch and her confidence in Math has been steadily increasing.\nThere are many resources available- both online and offline. The teachers are very structured in their teaching approach and most importantly, I love that their admin is very quick in follow up. There have been many times where my child has been unwell enough that she is not able to attend the lessons in person, but the centre has been a marvellous support and will just switch the lesson to a zoom online with very little trouble at all. This is great support for my child. Thank you for the wonderful service!",

Over the years, the teachers have been instrumental in helping me not only improve my mathematical skills but also develop a genuine understanding and appreciation for the subject. (I have been a student of Teacher Felicia's E-Maths class for close to 8 years!)\n\nThe teachers are able to break down difficult problems into manageable steps, making it easier for me to grasp. They are always approachable, willing to clarify doubts, and never hesitant to give additional support. Thanks to their guidance, I am able to excel in my math exams, and more importantly, build confidence in my own abilities.\n\nI am truly grateful for everything the teachers have done for me over these years. I highly recommend Matrix Math to anyone looking for a dedicated, effective, and caring math tuition centre.",

My son (newly diagnosed w ADD) started with borderline capability when we started in Jan this year. Now in Sep, we have now steadily progressed to EL3. Phew!\n\nThis is only possible with the impactful weekly group lesson coupled with the weekly review online class which reinforced the learning. My son no longer dreads Maths and is set up with strong foundation for Sec 1. Thank you Matrix Math!",
