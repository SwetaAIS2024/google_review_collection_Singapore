Ordered for take away with 3 mains + 1 sides + 2 beverage and fries. 1 of the main + sides + beverages + fries came within 10mins. Then I waited for another 10mins and ask how about the 2 remaining main dish which didn't come. Then they bring it out to me after a few minutes.\n\nNot sure how their system work for takeaway. Nonetheless, worth to give it a try. Dine in customer does not have issues.",

It felt nostalgic.\n\nOrdered the nasi lemak with fried chicken (perfectly fried, not too oily, and the chili was spot-on), char kway teow, and roti canai with curry chicken. Everything was delicious! The staff were welcoming and friendly, making the experience even better.\n\nFor the quality of food, ambiance, and service, the prices were reasonable. Will come back again in the future.",

Of course must also order their hot fragrant Kopi O and Kopi C. Delicious breakfast for 6 people cost MYR130, decent pricing. Nice Kopi tiam atmosphere and friendly service. Highly recommended. #breakfastJB #JBfood",
