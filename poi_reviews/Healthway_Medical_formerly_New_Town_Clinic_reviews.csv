"Meng Hwei, Serene Chua",1,"The opening hours was until 6pm on Friday but when I called at 5pm, no one pick up. When I reached the clinic at 5:31pm, the clinic was closed! I even walked to the back door and the lights are still on and aircon is on..... i wonder what is happening to a clinic that should be operating to serve the public but could not bother to even pick up ur call.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115443521036858214409/reviews

Lim Huan Hee,5,"Dr Tan has been our family doctor for the longest time. She is very knowledgeable, patient and experienced. My mother and I feel safe and healthy under her competent and meticulous care. Appreciate that she always takes time to understand and explain our medical conditions patiently and clearly. The nurses at the counter are always kind and helpful too.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104120825110780413635/reviews
Amanda Lee,1,Worst clinic EVER. Don’t ever GO TO NEW TOWN CLINIC. What kind of service this is?!? Super unprofessional as nurse didn’t even let me into the clinic when I am tested negative for Covid and have a slight cough. Dr was even worst. He was a young man who also didn’t allow me into the clinic. The worst thing: he only allowed me consult him OUTSIDE THE TOLIET. What kind of a stupid SOP is this????? Not even 3.0 stars worth. -100 rating is deserved,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100776847040382684715/reviews
Raymond Lim,1,"i had covid, went to this clinic, but the counter staff ask me to go outside the clinic, and start to sanities my touch area. She then ask if im able to wait for 2 hours, whereby there are zero patients within. I said yes. She then said the whole bill will definitely be more than $100+, i said ok. She then ask me not to come in by front door later, to only come in by the back door. I said ok. She said nothing and turned away. I went to the next clinic, i was attended like any flu patients and with respect like usual. Guess i need to report this to the medical board.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112166553976978287390/reviews
