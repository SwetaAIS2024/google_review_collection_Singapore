Victor Chao,5,"Best Hainan chicken you can find in the world. From famous local family farmed chicken with succulent juicy tender yet firm meat, and soaked to perfection. The rice cooked in chicken broth that kept all the essence of the chicken, can't help thinking about a second serving...",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103716514485085346934/reviews

K M,5,"It's a chicken rice specialty store, or rather just a forker, but if you don't line up from around 11:30, there's no guarantee you'll be able to eat it, and the store will close as soon as stock runs out.
The chicken is incredibly delicious (the rice is average), and I feel like the number of customers is increasing every time I go, probably because word of mouth has spread. Mustard is also delicious, I wish they would sell this alone.
To be honest, I'm surprised that so many people flock to this remote place, which is difficult to visit even for the first or second time.

Chicken rice is a culture.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118351699029752074984/reviews
