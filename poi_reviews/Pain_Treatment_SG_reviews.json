Before that i visited the TCM which is so painful and my whole body turn blue black and became worst . Im very glad i engaged  Levan home services and he is very good and took care of me very well. I highly recommend anyone to try this treatment as the treatment is no pain at all. Last time i have very bad insomnia and can only sleep one hour. Now after the second treatment i can sleep soundly and througout the night. Thank you very much Levan for helping me.",

By the 5th session,  I was already feeling much better,  and after the 7th session,  I was nearly pain free, able to return to my normal activities like 5-8 km walks and my work routine. Initially skeptical,  I'm now now grateful I found Levan. His professionalism and expertise truly improved my quality of life. Thank you Levan.",
