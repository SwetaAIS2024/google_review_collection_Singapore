Benson Tay,1,"I was injured. I walked all the way from home to BLk 717 Yishun. i am unable to lift up my shoulder. I reached there early in the morning at 10 am. the receptionist told me, that i did not book to see a doctor. this is the ridiculous part. ask me to come back at 4 pm. I mean only those who are sick require a doctor urgently, if the clinic is meant for a full review/appointment base clinic, they should state it in their website or their notice. The clinic should not waste patient time and give such reasons like you did not book appointment.",10 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111375668506921912283/reviews
