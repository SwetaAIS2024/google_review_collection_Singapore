      "text": "Final year at LC Medini ‚ù§Ô∏è. Alhamdulillah, my child is getting smarter and better. When he started school at just 3 years plus, within less than a month, he could memorize many surah including Al-Fatihah. Almost a year at LC Medini, he already knows how to read and count. Before, he was only good at English, now he can speak in malay too. Can't wait for him to memorised surah Al-kahfi this year. Thank you to all the teachers and principal teacher Niza for being strict in educating all the students, teachers and parents as well. Semoga yang baik baik untuk teacher semua ü§≤üèª",
