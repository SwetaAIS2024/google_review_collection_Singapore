I been early they even not open yet. They already given to one of the last patient to mantion they closed for registration.\nWe leave nearby ofcos we unwell we need to go nearest clinic is convenience for us during unwell conditions. Thn once I enter this clinic with this kind of bad service redemption I feel disappointed the way they talk unpolite with their patients.\nThey have to do something abt their service.",

I went down to his clinic and he was leaving but he went back in and treated my wound. He’s very popular and the queue is always long. Good to call beforehand.",

Reached clinic at 8.25am, joined the queue and the receptionist passed the 'Closed for registration' card to the patient in front of me and walked off. It was my first time visiting this clinic and was confused by them and the process. Went into the clinic to clarify and was told off by them to read the sign card passed to the patient in front of me- which says 'Closed for registration'. She further commented that if I want to see the doctor, I should come and queue at 7am.\n\nUtterly disappointed by their service. They could have said it nicely and be kind to patients.\n\nTo the management of the clinic, pls revise the operating hours mentioned in your clinic and in your website to prevent confusion which resulted to wasted trip from patients. Pls also do a perf review your staff service standards and attitude. Patients are there to see the doctor, not to be lectured. Do train and educate your receptionists to be kind to patients. While patients are always reminded to respect clinic staff, the staff should respect patients too- mutual respect pls!!",
