      "text": "Average food experience at a higher priced condo cafe. Nice and quiet ambience with lots of glass windows for sunlight.\n\nWe ordered a steak sandwich and crab & asari clam pasta. Two coffees. Added up to over $50.\n\nThe steak sandwich was very average, topped with lots of crispy curly fries. Meat filling was lacking for $20 price point and the bread was too soggy with oil.\nPasta was disappointing in taste. For a seafood dish, it lacked the umami taste and was overwhelmed by lots of garlic. Covering up the lack of freshness in the seafood...\n\nCoffee was average too. My latte smelled and tasted sour. Not to my liking.\n\nOverall, a good place to sit for a coffee to enjoy the ambience. Not exactly the best value for food options.",

      "text": "Great cafe in a private condo. Robust and fragrant coffee, love their croissant, and their waffles are a must have!\n\n14/6/22 - Went for lunch. Pastas are done al dente and full of umami seafood flavour! Peanut butter brownie had a good balance of savoury and sweet. Only disappointment was the Mocha due to a change of beans from Honduras to Burundi simply because I don‚Äôt like acidic beans. Would have been great if customers were informed before ordering. Nonetheless, the rest of the food was good üëç",

      "text": "Lovely brunch cafe located inside D'Leedon condo. (Apparently only for condo residents & guests)\nNot very crowded on weekend morning. You can grab any table and order at the counter.\nPricing is moderate and definitely worth it due to excellent service and quality of food. Ordered Avocado toast with scrambled egg. Egg was cooked perfectly (not very wet or dry) and sourdough toast was perfect (not very hard or soft). Quite impressed with their cooking. Just fantastic coffee!!!\nOrdered iced latte, which was so creamy and brewed in heaven! ü§ü just wowww!\nWish to come back again.",
