Pls a male stuff with leg tattoo and lady with specs served me and I swear I think they donâ€™t really like working hereðŸ˜° there were no trays outside, when asked for the tray the lady just went to wash it at the back and come back to give me in the possibly most unhappy face that seems like she donâ€™t want to workðŸ¤¨ when asked for another tray because we knew we were going to order a lot the girl again looked frustrated??? Then I looked in and saw that the guy was putting the broccoli on stick with his bare hands? Without any sorts of glove. Sorry but WHAT??? Idk manâ€¦ the food also came over fried? ? tough day for them? Honestly 3 stars for the food only because the chilli and beancurd skin was goodðŸ¥²ðŸ˜© I donâ€™t expect top tier service but at least smile? dk if Iâ€™ll be back anytime soonâ€¦",

The items are fried evenly with the crisp feel and chilli is the bombz. Enoki mushrooms with bacon, Taiwan sausage, scallops and prawn paste mantou are must tried items. For those who need carbs can order the rice with seaweed as well. It is perfectly for dinner and supper. Will definitely come back again!",
