Knowing that it was the peak hours on a Saturday evening, I figured it might take about an extra 20 minutes. However, no updates were shown on the app even then. I called the hotline for a cancellation, where the operator told me I will be contacted by the store's manager.\nThe store's assistant manager (on 29th March 2025's evening) only called me 20 minutes later. He then told me that the order could not be cancelled, as the rider has already left the restaurant. From what I noticed while tracking my order on the app, what had actually happened was, the previous rider cancelled, and he deliberately waited for another rider to become available, just so he can tell me my order can no longer be cancelled. I told him adamantly that I still want my order to be cancelled, and that I do NOT want the rider to show up at my door, to which he agreed and promised.\nSurprise, surprise, the rider shows up at my door five minutes later. I declined to receive the food.\nI have no idea what circus they are running there, but I have been dealing with clowns every step of the way.",

Riza the manager on duty told me that she will write in a email to the management team and refund for the missing orders. After 1 week no refund was made back to me.
