Ruennshen Lew (Alex),1,"The dory fish and chips set lacks freshness, with a disappointing soggy texture. The pasta is overcooked, and its sauce lacks consistency, rendering it watery.

DeanJean Phng,5,"Decided to leave a review as the food has been consistently tasty with every visit. This is my 5th time eating at this stall ðŸ”¥
