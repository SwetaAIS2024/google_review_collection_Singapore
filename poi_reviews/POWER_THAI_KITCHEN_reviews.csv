nabilah,5,"We arrived earlier than expected for steamboat, and Haziq and Shahril were quick to prepare for our family of 7. We had a great steamboat experience, and despite being short-staffed, they were efficient and friendly. Flavour option could be more but so far its not bad. Highly recommend this dining spot for its excellent service!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110367278768253857149/reviews

Highly recommended. Will definitely be back.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107747836324064941926/reviews
Regina Woo,2,"Appreciate that it is a halal mookata, but personally feel the entire service is very disorientated.  Family of 9 but utensils were under served, have to keep reminding to give the condiments.  No spoon for soups and many other lacking services.  Food is not bad but presentation is very poor. E.g. meat are served to us in lumps.

Ordered satay, the sauce was frozen cold.

I urge the owner of the restaurant to send the staff for adequate training, so many staff but they are running around extremely busy, but not accomplishment the expected basic service because there are no properly planned workflow.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109608304257459567818/reviews
