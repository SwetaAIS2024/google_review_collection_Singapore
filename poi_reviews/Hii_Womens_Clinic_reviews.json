      "text": "I was recommended by a relative who engaged Dr. Hii for her 3 pregnancies. Dr. Hii has deep understanding and experience in his field, throughout my pregnancy I was very well taken care of and the delivery of my first child was quicker than I expected. I had a vacuum birth and during the delivery I was glad to witness Dr. Hii's professionalism and assertiveness in making sure the delivery went well. I did not experience too much postpartum discomfort aside the usual post delivery pains.\n\nMy husband and I enjoy going for our appointments, the clinic staff are friendly and pro-active. Dr. Hii is a man of few words (imagine a quiet father), but he is very reassuring and concise in delivering only essential and important information, which is exactly what we appreciate as oftentimes overly chatty doctors put us off.\n\nI was previously informed by others that the fees would be higher than other private practices, but for the level of expertise and care I received, and convenience of accessibility I felt what I paid for was well justified. I deeply recommend Dr. Hii to all expecting mums or ladies who need help.",

However, he's very calm during the big day. sometimes when im too ganjiong, he will still joke and gives me assurance. To him, nothing is a big problem to him. Thank you, Dr. Hii. Also, a big shout out to nurse Ann & Esther, thank you for being a part of my pregnancy journey.",
