Maryana Hermawan,5,"Dr Lee and Dr Chua have been our family doctors for more than a decade now; they are both very smart and they can quickly recall your history just by looking briefly at your file (I think partly amazing memory, the rest is reading speed). The medicine works wonders. For complicated case they can send you to scans, and here is special about them, they can let you know about the result by phone so that you spend less time worrying. Rest assure they will send you to specialists when you need it. I really recommend Dr Chua and Dr Lee as your family doctors. They are really smart, hardworking and quite friendly doctors. Thank you!!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105993157313344846198/reviews
J M,4,"Doctor Chua is my go to Doctor for my family since more than 30 years ago. She is kind and patient, most importantly both Doctor Chua and Doctor Lee were able to quickly identify our issues and give us immediate remedy, preventing our condition from deteriorating. However, I cannot say the same for their front desk staffs. New staffs will start off nice but gradually they will start to assimilate into this rude and unfriendly culture that permeates among the reception, their unhelpful attitude is so totally opposite from Doctor Chua's. So we learnt over the years to ignore the front desk people and try not to let them get on our nerves because Doctor Chua is just too amazing a doctor.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101325199786737198917/reviews
Yix Chua,5,Is a good clinic where the doctors are very down to earth and only prescribe the necessary medication. Charges are also reasonable compared to larger chain clinics which pile you with medication and a big bill. Have always liked coming here where bills are more affordable and service is very personal.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116924696909852605379/reviews
Ruyi Toh,5,"Have been seeing Dr Chua Bee Hong since I was young. She is gentle with children, and gives them sweets to make them feel better. Dr Chua is always warm, friendly, and has a personalized touch in her diagnoses.

The clinic is quite old fashioned, as they still use manual call numbers. Wait times can be up to 30 mins. Overall, a very pleasant clinic to get common illnesses treated ðŸ˜Š",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109872411986239350292/reviews
E Lim (Ravenblack),1,"Open at 8.30am on Sat, doctor comes in only at 9.30am.  Unwell elderly have to wait one more hour for turn to come.  Where is the compassion and professionalism?",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110762381324364533451/reviews
