M Ang,5,"Old school otah stall with homemade otah  grilled at the stall itself. We could smell the fragrance from quite a distance away which lured us to this place. ðŸ˜‹
Otah starts from 80 cents and I would say is a decent portion. Saw a few reviews saying it's too thin (maybe they improved?) and price increases need to consider real food costs money and labour. ðŸ˜…

Will definitely come back for more!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103937264274214717353/reviews

Gautami Nadarajan,4,"Went early at 830am and got
1. Spicy fish head otah (just nice level of spicy, has actual bits of fish head inside)
2. Big otah (spicy and flavourful but the texture was not there)
3. Normal otah (shiok, nice level of spicy)
4. Not spicy otah (meh, wouldnâ€™t get it again)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103485976331982018222/reviews
CK C,2,"Otah was flavourful, but overly salty and not warm. Also, too expensive at 80 cents a piece as it was almost paper thin.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Jayce Ng,1,"I purchased the non-spicy otah and was taken aback by the price of 80 cents per piece. However, upon opening it for consumption, I discovered that it contained a disappointingly thin layer of fish meat. In comparison, otah I've bought from elsewhere has proven to be of better quality and cheaper. Additionally, the people at this place tend to be quite persistent in their attempts to upsell other products. Never gonna buy from them again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116690294900718995958/reviews
