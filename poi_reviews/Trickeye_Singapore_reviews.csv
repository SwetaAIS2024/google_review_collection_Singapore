Teck Chong Law,5,"A very fun and self entertaining afternoon at Trick Eye Museum (using their AR App).

You need to be there when there is less crowd to really enjoy filming all the AR effects.  Great memories to keep and share with friends and families.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103886416957126587915/reviews
Rach Seah,5,"My family and I came on a weekday thanks to MOE! We had such a HUGE BLAST OF A TIME! don't be fooled by just 'picture taking'. There were so many hidden tricks and tips up their sleeves! From really engaging, hilarious and funny AR, all the way to the scavenger hunts (seriously, it's so worth it! The prizes for the scavenger hunt are THE BEST), to the super helpful staff (shoutout to Maye) for being so kind and helpful to us haha! My family and I had such a fun time, thank you all for help! Best day ever ❤️ thank God for all! Seriously, don't miss this place! It's a hidden gem!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103592762989838275000/reviews
