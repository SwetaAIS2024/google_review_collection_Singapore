Donkey and I were looking for a chill spot to unwind and enjoy some good craft beer. Banyan Beer Garden, located near the Punggol Har Bin prawning area, seemed like the perfect place with its “relaxed oasis” promise. And it definitely delivered on the atmosphere.

The ambience was versatile, offering a choice between two distinct vibes. The bar featured a rustic-industrial chic design with exposed brick, wooden beams, and a textured wood bar, creating a warm, inviting space that felt slightly aged and cozy. The dim, warm lighting and casual seating, both at the bar and under the covered patio, made it feel super relaxed.

The covered patio itself transformed the vibe into something more romantic and tropical. String lights and lush greenery added to the ambiance, while casual wicker furniture and ceiling fans made it feel comfortable and perfect for socializing. It was a perfect blend of a cozy indoor hideaway with a little touch of an outdoor oasis. The place was also breezy and not stuffy, which was great, especially in the Singaporean heat.

We decided to settle in on the patio, enjoying the breezy evening and the twinkling lights. The atmosphere was just what we needed—relaxing, inviting, and perfect for enjoying a good conversation over a few drinks. I had a 1664 Blanc with peanuts, while Donkey had a Connor’s Stout Porter. The beer was refreshing and reasonably priced. The atmosphere was enhanced by a light, soothing soundtrack of Chinese music, which added a nice touch.

The inviting atmosphere made us feel comfortable and relaxed, like we were in a hidden gem, away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

We feel that Banyan Beer Garden has a lot of potential to become a popular spot. The beer selection is good, the atmosphere is great, and the music adds a nice touch. It’s also conveniently located near Punggol Park, and you can even see people prawning nearby, which adds to the local charm. The shop owner was incredibly friendly and provided great service. He even brought me a ziplock bag to keep my leftover peanuts in, which was a thoughtful touch.

The snack menu offers a good selection of bar bites, with options like crispy chicken tulips, karaage squid, tater tots, fries, chicken nuggets, chicken popcorn, and cuttlefish balls. It would be great to see some more unique and interesting bar snacks in the future, but the current options are a good starting point.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114556064085815871377/reviews
