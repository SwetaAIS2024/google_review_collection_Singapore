      "text": "Donkey and I, regular patrons of this establishment, are excited to provide our feedback. Our favorite choice is the yakiniku beef and French fries set wrapped in a fried bun, which we find quite delightful. Despite its compact size, the burger offers a satisfying two-bite experience. Conveniently located near the Merlion, Bistro Aseana is always bustling with customers. Comprising three adjoining shops, it offers a range of options from ice cream desserts to bistro-style dishes like spaghetti and steak. Our top pick, the Tiger Prawn & Half Shell Scallop Aglio Olio, was elevated with an extra sprinkle of cheese and Tabasco sauce. We also took advantage of the beer set promotion at Review Inn.\n\nWhile there are varied opinions on Google reviews, personally, we found the food to be satisfactory. The flavors of the two-mouthful beef and fried beef burger bun were commendable, and the service met our expectations. Therefore, we are rating this establishment with 4 stars.",
