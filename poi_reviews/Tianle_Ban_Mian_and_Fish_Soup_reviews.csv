yasmin heyu,5,"good ban mian & dumplings! i mean canâ€™t really go wrong with ban mian. quite a nice portion at only $4.30. dumplings were 8 for $5.50 which i thought were slightly pricier at first but they were big. could only finish 2 lol & had to dabao. would definitely come back whenever iâ€™m craving a comforting bowl of ban mian / noodle soup ðŸ˜ƒ

went back again recently. their noodles & dumplings r still yummy! reliable choice for whenever iâ€™m craving a comforting bowl of noodles :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109862344718874464029/reviews
