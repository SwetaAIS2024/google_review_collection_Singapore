EL (Couch Blogger),2,The lack of care for hygiene in this outlet is hard to ignore. Tables are not cleaned. Used napkins left on the floor or side of tables while staff stand or sit around behind counter chatting.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114733509197305626225/reviews
Nicholas Lam,4,"Beautifully renovated location. Awesome place to enjoy your favourite cup of coffee.

However I’d like to ask Starbucks to reconsider putting straws at the self service counter.
It’s really sad that having introduced a lip drinking cap, we are still seeing 95% of people using straws and choosing to use a throw away plastic cup compared to using available cups for in shop consumption.

Please do consider and try to help educated us lowly simple minded people that every other plastic cup and straw plays a part in the saving of our Mother Earth.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104060762909080187984/reviews
S. Piw,5,"If you are a fan of Starbucks goodies, I really recommend this branch. They have considerable amount of stocks and pretty much almost everything here. Plus, it's not crowded, really good spot if you need a place to work on your stuff.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100012815331942924322/reviews
LILY ABBEY LEO,1,"Hi I have been calling since yesterday. I got burned on my lower lips as your service staff didn't inform me that the pie I purchased is extremely hot on the inside. There was no indication, no information at all. I took a bite and instantly I got scalding on my lower lips which I have shown to your lady staff but she completely ignored me.

Kim Hong,5,Nice place to hangout with the three tier seating area. Lots of natural lights and it doesn't feel suffocating. A lot of starbucks tumblers on sale with various varieties.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110474306946590265362/reviews
