Alice Tan,5,"I have been servicing all my cars here for many years and have always been satisfied. They provide excellent service, have friendly and experienced staff, and offer reasonable pricing. I‚Äôm also impressed with their recent renovations, which include a classy lobby and relaxing music. Additionally, thanks to their recent promotion on rims and tire purchases, I received free gifts, making the deal even more attractive. Thank you.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101280643705869155932/reviews
