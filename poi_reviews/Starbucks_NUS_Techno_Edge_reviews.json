      "text": "Love the vibes here, and as an NUS student who takes caffeine as life, I always welcome any coffee place on campus with study facilities (like big tables and plugs and wifi). So itâ€™s usually quite productive IF I am able to find seats. And during sem time, probability is very low, maybe 10% chance if you come in the afternoon. And as expected, everyone here stays for long hours.\n\nQuestion to NUS FM/OSL: do students who donâ€™t get Starbucks get to sit here? I mean I get this is school compound and in general, all students can sit at any open space to mug. But I see more than half of the students sitting here not getting a Starbucks drink. Many times I buy a Starbucks drink and I had to go elsewhere to sit :( first come first serve > buying a drink at Starbucks?",
