      "text": "Super crispy, super delicious bread with Vietnamese taste. I've eaten at many Vietnamese restaurants in Singapore, but this one makes me want to come eat every day. The loaf of bread is stuffed with meat and fresh vegetables. The restaurant owner is a bit enthusiastic, gossiping about eating at the restaurant but as if she were eating at home.\n\nThe banh mi is super crispy, very delicious, and truly authentic Vietnamese flavour. I’ve tried many Vietnamese food shops in Singapore, but only this place makes me want to come back every day. Banh mi is also packed with lot of meat and the veggies are incredibly fresh. The owner is also extremely friendly and chatty—eating here feels just like at home.",
