      "text": "From past memories... Old school. Eaten this stall noodle since my very very young days.. Faithful customers for their. 3 generations.  Will drive back every month even I moved out of toa payoh 20years ago. Their cai po added extra favoring and texture to the fried noodles. Yummy!\n\nWhat I dislike is their lack of professionalism, they will close and open when they feel like it since 10 years ago.  No pattern or routine for years.\n\nRecently this market finished renovation and reopened on 1 May 2021. They keep shifting their opening date till today (3 Jul 2021), still close. Just a torn paper... Closed till... With different dates overwritten and cancel.  I had been coming to this market every weekend from Punggol craving for it!\n\n========= updated 10 July 2021 ========\n\nFinally opened. Changed owner. Taste different. There gone my 40yrs of childhood memories, taste, and 2 months effort wasted waiting for it to open since 1 May 2021 after market renovation coming weekly from Punggol!",
