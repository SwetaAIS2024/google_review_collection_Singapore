Poh Hwee Nah,5,"Great atmosphere, relaxing and not overcrowded during off-peak times. Nice place to have a cup of coffee and some bakery and cupcakes.
Foods are delis and generous on the serving. Temperature of the mushroom soup can be hotter as only lukewarm when served, but tastes great, and we like it.
Knowledge of the cashier can be improved as she is not able to answer the ingredients of food we asked and is not sure about the coffee and tea all day promotion. End up we not buying any coffee and switch to other choices.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116691333169235773667/reviews
D. Lim,2,"A very mediocre at best -  to grab a snack if youâ€™re absolutely starving after flower shopping - if u really canâ€™t wait to move onto somewhere else.

The food standards is varying. The bread slices that came with my soup were as white as a face smothered in suncreen with white cast ðŸ¤£. Whereas the table beside me had golden brown toasts.

The truffle fries truly a joke. As you can see in my picture the cheese - literally u can count how many little bitsâ€¦ would rather no cheese at all if they are too cheap on costing to give an appropriate portion of decent cheese. Fries have no taste of truffle either. Save your $2 and just get regular fries.

Tables were cleared but not wiped down. Sticky and dirty - I had to clean it on my own.

The latte was subpar tooâ€¦

Next time after flower shopping, Iâ€™ll take a ride out to other food options. Waste of moneyâ€¦ even worse waste of my calories.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115127010370004932121/reviews
"Yong Hui, Ronny Tan",4,"+ Great for a nearby meal after visiting Far East Flora itself. Nice ambience and plenty of seats

+ Wide variety of dishes but prices are high, which is somewhat odd unless the restaurant operator is not Far East Flora itself but renting from the latter (breakfast set $6.50, Egg Benedict $14.90, Asian Laksa/ curry chicken set $11.90, pastas $17.90, Waffle ice cream $5.90)

= Parking available at d Far East Flora side of the building but given the limited lots per floor, you may need to drive pretty high up to find lots.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112103854866816776797/reviews
Joseph Liow,4,"All day breakfast place. Lovely alternative to places like PS Cafe and Providore. The Eggs Benedict were divine with melted cheese. Not crowded when I was here but I suspect that this wonâ€™t be the case for long once more people find out about this gem. Great place to chill, read your newspaper on a slow Sunday morning. Pro Hack: They offer $0.50 black coffee with your breakfast.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111159739546450395016/reviews
nads,5,"came here with my friends on a weekday around 3-4pm for ice cream

nice quiet environment to chill for awhile on a hot day eating ice cream. service was prompt and they made sure we were present before serving the ice creams to us individually.

one of the counter staff was nice enough when a friend of mine accidentally dropped his ice cream after taking 2 steps from the counter, the service staff gave him another ice cream

would come back here again for their competitively priced ice creams",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116774666579530979745/reviews
