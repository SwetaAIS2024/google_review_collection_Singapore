      "text": "A must visit if you are transmitting through Singapore.  A great place to refresh yourself before your next flight.  All the team here we're friendly and helpful.  The pool area was well laid out with plenty of seating and sun beds.  What let's it down is the following.  In the men's changing room a lot of the lockers were broken so there was nowhere to store our luggage.  When we came to take a shower after swimming there was no hot water so had to take cold showers.  Also the cocktail I ordered was really poor.  If you going to charge 20 Singapore dollars for a mojito it has to be spot on but it was just very ordinary.  It wouldn't stop me from visiting again but forewarned if forearmed.",

Only starts to operate from around 12pm. Why ist that? An airport like this is busy around the clock and people certainly up for a swim in the morning hours, too. Not interested in more business?",
