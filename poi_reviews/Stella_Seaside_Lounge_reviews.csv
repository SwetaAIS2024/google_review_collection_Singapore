Loh Ricky,5,"Very rare restaurant in Sg that can have such a beautiful seaview for dining, the place is well renovated and very classic.
There is a pool that can swim and also different chairs setting for selection.
They are shelter and open-air dining area, so no issue for people who prefer air-conditioning dining experience.
Pet friendy restaurant, food wise not bad.
We had smashed beef burger and seafood linguine, very nice, and portion is reasonable.
Will be back to support this restaurant.
Best to call for reservation as dinner time the place will be pack, best time to come ard 5.30pm to take nice photos.
The view of plane desending is very nice.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105538701864779732018/reviews
Alexandre Yeoh,5,"Had a great dinner at Stella Seaside Lounge on a cool and windy evening. It’s a chill spot tucked along Changi Coastal Road, with good food for the price and quick service. It wasn’t too packed, but had a nice buzz. The house beats, pool, and sea view gave it serious Bali vibes. Would come back again.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105525343007754662187/reviews
Divya Tewari,5,"We really enjoyed the food as well as the ambience. The drinks were good, i would recommend the mango margarita. Fish tacos and mushroom pasta were very good as well. It's just that getting a cab back was difficult, but the restaurant people helped us call the cab. So overall, I would highly recommend this place.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104832952654803947331/reviews
YY,4,"First of all the place has unbeatable ambience. If you drive (really hard to get here by public transport...) or take a grab here, you'll see what I mean. You are eating by the sea or almost above the sea, hearing the waves splash and watching surfers (if you come in the day) glide across the water. Really relaxing and great for conversations.

The food looks good but tastes...well... I tried the seafood stew. It was bitter and strange. My friend tried the pasta which was average and a bit sweeter than normal. Sweet potato fries were average, not soggy. A coke costs $6.

I suppose most people don't come here for the food anyway, but it would be nice if it was a bit better.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110326367700732433892/reviews
Justin Ngien,5,"We used to dine frequently at Belly View until it closed down a couple of years ago. Since then, we hadn’t really returned to the area. The last time we visited was at least once in 2022, after the place had undergone a major revamp some years prior.

For my significant birthday, my better half’s family hosted a celebration at Stella Seaside Lounge. I was pleasantly surprised—it turned out to be more of a beach club, reminiscent of those in Sentosa. The atmosphere was fantastic, with a relaxed, family-friendly vibe rather than the adults-only feel of some other beach clubs.

The music wasn’t overly loud, and we saw plenty of families with kids, even some with their pets. The sea breeze that day was just right—cooling without being too strong.

The food was decent, though a bit on the pricey side. But given the setting, I suppose that’s to be expected for a place like this.

What really stood out was the service. The staff were attentive and ensured that empty plates were promptly cleared, which made for a more pleasant dining experience.

I’d highly recommend going early—around 5:30 PM—to catch the best of the evening ambiance and enjoy the experience to the fullest.

Note: this is also a pet friendly establishment though certain areas are out of bounds for pets.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115948827199432222428/reviews
