anjali grover,5,"I appreciate the time and attention that Dr. Su Ann and her team offers each time I visit. Their commitment reflects genuine care, making me feel confident and reassured in their expert and compassionate hands. What truly stands out is Dr. Su Ann's integrative approach, which combines medicine, nutrition, and lifestyle adjustments, along with her holistic perspective that addresses the root causes of issues rather than just the symptoms. This comprehensive method fosters a healthier body and mind, which I believe is the ideal path to overall well-being. Thank you!""",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102838868587727076692/reviews
Chih Ming Hwang,5,"NOVI approaches medical screening from a very pragmatic angle, and does not do unnecessary tests. My last doctor repeated the same exact tests year after year even though some were not needed as i eventually have learnt. With NOVI, only necessary tests are done every 6-months to a year - the cost of my annual medical screening is now only about 20% of what I used to pay. NOVI has an app from which I can also monitor my healthy stats reports as and when I need, and can measure the trend over time. This is especially useful to keep my health and fitness on track.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116990008118067009175/reviews

rai!,5,"Was looking to do a full medical check up and found Novi health online. Looked good so I signed up. Had a wonderful experience with them from start to finish. The ability to talk to the staff via WhatsApp for all the appointments, sample collection, and etc was very useful. Staff was always very friendly and helpful, answering all the different questions I had. My experience with the doctor, Dr. Yeo, was also good. He was patient, attentive, thoughtful and answered all my questions and advised me well on next steps, etc. Blood tests and everything else was done smoothly too. Would surely recommend to others!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107700213459791524364/reviews
