Jason Tan,5,"The pepper prawn was a flavourful and satisfying dish. The pepper seasoning added a bold kick without being too overpowering, giving the dish a nice balance of spice and heat. Served hot and well-presented, this dish is definitely worth trying if you enjoy a little spice with your seafood.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103274218290039355072/reviews
Fern Wong,5,"Came for the unique prawn dishes.heard it is originated from Taiwan. 1st outlet in Singapore.

They didnt disappoint me at all. We ordered pepper, garlic and lemon special cooked prawns. The prawns were so fresh, flavourful and cooked just nice.. not too tough.. black pepper crabs, cabbage and even chicken were soooo nice. Will return again!

Keep it up chef!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103070026720622914944/reviews
Jia Hao Tan,4,"Tried the pepper prawn. It was one of the best pepper flavored dishes I've had in Singapore. Unfortunately, the size of the prawn could have been bigger given that they take supply directly from a freshwater prawn supplier. They should have opted for bigger prawn for their dishes (50% of the prawns served were the size of a chicken wing drumlet)... I think it's reasonable to increase the price to cover the cost of bigger prawns.

The staff were great, and the atmosphere was good too!

I'm looking forward to another visit to try their pepper crabs, which were sold out, unfortunately.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114160128968844903977/reviews

M Befree,5,Been hankering for this style of prawns since my days of regular trips to Taipei. Soooo happy to find them now in SG and more importantly it tastes the same and cooked by a Taiwanese chef!! Super happy meal.
