Gregory Ngoh,1,"Send them to repair a fridge at aged relative house. service report charged $400 plus to replace fan motor, coil sensor, and a long list of stuff. My relative said nothing was replaced because they did not bring in any part nor left with any part: questionable ethics. Be careful if u do call for their service. I won’t call again.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113797796738232502254/reviews
Yunfeng Liang,1,"The service provided is NOT professional at all. The technician identified the problem is PC board failure after a pretended diagnosis, and then asked to pay nearly 3 times of the market price for replacement. The worst thing is that the real problem is the compressor and you can get nothing correct if you pay him hundreds of dollars.

I didn't contact this service provider but only other ones with high ratings. This guy come out from nowhere and know I have fridge issue. Just a reminder to you that it's necessary to check which company it is whenever someone contact you. Call the official service whenever possible.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117690271639971065739/reviews
Laura T.,1,"Avoid at all costs. Their technician charged over $60 for inspection, told me that 2 parts of the washer needed replacing. Zero follow up the next day until I chased. The reply? He could not repair because he does not have one of the parts, and manufacturer doesn’t sell them.

I called the manufacturer, they came down, repaired it UPON inspection, and only ONE part needed replacing. The total cost? Just about $60.

Not sure if it was a complete scam but the level of service from this technician was absolutely non-existent.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100732055057023876176/reviews
