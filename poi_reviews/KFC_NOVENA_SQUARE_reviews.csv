Sam,1,The burger just gave up on itself. The patty was really tiny and the burger did't look like how the pictures presented it. It was a sad meal. Felt like I'm going through divorce all over again and my children coached to say bad things about me.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101906070280642889235/reviews

Laudinrose,1,"I ordered through Pandafood on Friday for 2 pax. When my order arrived, HALF of it was missing — no Zinger, no Cheese Fries. I only received a refund for the missing items, but what about my hunger? I was forced to reorder just to get the food I originally wanted.

On top of that, I specifically ordered the fried chicken à la carte (which costs more) and clearly requested THIGH ONLY, with the remark “NO BREAST.” And yet — you gave me breast. This is completely unacceptable.

Why do you think I paid extra for à la carte if you were just going to ignore my request? Why not just force me into a set meal and decide what I eat? Can’t you even READ the customer’s notes? This is inexcusable, careless service. Are you just rushing orders out without any basic checking?",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115511068437550602674/reviews
Zong Huan Hoe,1,"Hi KFC SINGAPORE.

Today evening When I patron the KFC at Novena square. I met a very rude KFC Crew. she was extremely rude to me. I don't like her telling me what to do. When I was about to take and collect my food she said hi take your things sir in a stern voice. As though I don't know like that. I was as taking it so why do you have to take me or take in a rude tone. I don't like being commanded okay so you don't need to tell or teach me what to do.

After I told her she is rude then she apologized. But he apology was not sincere. I was already collecting my food of KFC so there's no need for her to tell me in a stern voice take your things sir!!

And I realized now that i pressed dine in in the KFC app so she should put it in a tray and not in a plastic bag. she put my food in a plastic bag although I actually ordered is dine in so should not be in a plastic bag. Should be in a tray and not plastic bag. So actually I can counter back to her and tell her in a stern voice to tell the same KFC Crew. hi please take my food from the plastic bag and please it on the tray now thank you.

I even told the manager that your staff is very rude of course I will take I am eating it if I don't take how to eat the food. So is common sense to take so of course I will take so why do you have to tell.me to take as though I don't know I need to take my food?",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116081058538648439045/reviews
Kyle,2,"The price for one person is great, and the food is great too. However, coming here a lot of times, I notice that they have been getting my orders wrong. I ordered an Original Twister, but instead, they gave me an American Twister. I don't know why most of the time I come here for breakfast is that my orders are wrong. Please do something about this as this can impact service.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116291061341649403252/reviews
