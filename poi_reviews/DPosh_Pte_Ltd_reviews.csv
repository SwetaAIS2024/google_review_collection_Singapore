Mick Chan,5,"Walked into this shop, attended by Keith, a “salesperson”, “technician”, also the BOSS of D’Posh. A friendly, jovial and a humble guy. Keith is an experienced and full of knowledge in this business, I was given some advice and suggestions about my small renovation over my kitchen and bathrooms , the toilets bowls, sinks and taps needed to replace, Keith gives a very attractive prices and timeframe which I can’t resist, you may not get to see whatsoever big brands in the shop, whatever available in the shop the quality is as good, sums up everything,  I reckon the savings easily 1/3 of the cost from some ridiculous contractor and shop I got, one occasion, I got refunded as Keith suggested to me with a cheaper toilet bowl even though the payment for my purchases had already made. Best part is the coordination with the plumber and contractor, good workmanship and all done in 3 to 4 days .
Ultimately I need not to visit any other place for price comparisons. Indeed a big cost and time savings, a complete fuss free and smooth process. Come to D’Posh for your bathroom essentials and you will NEVER go wrong.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109442453705414756792/reviews

D N,5,"We highly recommend Keith and are ourselves returning customers. Previously engaged Keith for our previous home. This time our kitchen sink, taps, and majority of our bathroom accessories were from him. He's sincere and extremely helpful. Even going the extra mile to deliver 2 taps personally as he lives nearby. Thank you so much Keith! We will always go back to you:) After recommending you to a friend, she was a very happy customer too.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117163032955047591203/reviews
S,5,"Came here twice with my wife to purchase all the kitchen and toilet accessories for our new home.

We enjoyed the shopping experience as the shop offered a wide range of products at competitive prices. Also, Keith is a straight up guy who provided us with practical advice and recommendations, without hard sell.

Keith also helped provide measurement for a vanity cabinet at the shop when I was planning my carpentry. He also replaced a defective towel bar without further questions.

Thanks! Appreciate the great service rendered. Cheers.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104940088914798587469/reviews
