Lisa T,2,"Grab ordered plain prata, cheese prata and egg prata. Only the plain prata is edible. Cheese is using cheddar, not nice. Egg was not tasty. Gravy doesn’t have much spicy notes. Not satisfying. Not many good prata places in Punggol.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101998729191684176802/reviews
TTT,3,"This is a spot for prata in Punggol. It's served crispy and hot with either fish or chicken curry, which is a nice change from the usual dal curry. The service is decent and can be friendly at times. Just keep in mind that the stall only accepts cash.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117174446031825028588/reviews
Vijay Raj,1,"Never order from them if you’re vegetarian. I had the worst experience of my life. I received seafood fried rice when I ordered “no meat, vegetarian” and each time I indicate give dal (vegetarian gravy), I get fish curry. I am very unhappy. All other Srisun seem fine, it’s just this Punggol.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101863452474253541350/reviews
Preeti Veera,1,The service is ok but the food is horrid! We ordered food worth $50 but ended up wasting most of it. Such a disappointment. Please do not waste your money here. Only Prata was ok.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100380397011236104710/reviews
