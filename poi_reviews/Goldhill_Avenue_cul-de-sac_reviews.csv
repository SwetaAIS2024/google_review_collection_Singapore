Forest BK,5,"At the end of Goldhill Avenue, on the right, is a narrow road that leads to a cul-de-sac.
The road ends with a large lush vegetation. There is a old shelter, like an old-type bus stop. A locked up old metal gate with unkept vegetation inside. It's a very serene and quiet green space belonging to the State (State Land).
Great place for a leisurely walk for residents living around the area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
