      "text": "Had a company lunch there. One of the better halal swedish restaurant around.. Whilst there are some misses in some of the dishes, ie: their fika salad which had no dressing; cod fish cake which had more potato than fish and potato dumpling which was on the denser side, some dishes was definitely popular and must try. Fish lovers, do not hesitate to try their oven baked herb crusted halibut (but that’s seasonal, and on their Spring menu, and also whilst stocks last). For meat lovers, their steak with warm potato salad was flavourful however, do emphasise on your required temperature and I recommend to go for medium rare. Swedish meatballs is also a popular delight! Didn’t have any room for dessert. Maybe next time. But I would come back again definitely, though they were full house and we were a large group of twenty, they tried their best to provide their best service and smile!",

      "text": "food was alright, IKEA meatballs are better, waffle was yummy but small and flat; service was terrible—the two guys can’t take your order and need to ask for permission before they do anything which is so weird???? and we requested for our order to be taken THREE times (all three times they acknowledged us but never actually took the order which made the whole experience frustrating). All service staff were awkward and looked lost like it was their first day there. When we said “thank you” nobody would respond idk why everyone was so awkward honestly if the staff got replaced then this place would be good (and lower the prices)",

It could be due to the restaurant being understaffed as there were only 2 service staff during lunch hour and it was quite busy. The meatballs were good but would have preferred if the dish was served warm.",
