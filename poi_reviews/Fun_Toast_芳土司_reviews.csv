QqY,5,"Good promotion for this new branch at Hougang Rivercourt! The iced tea only $2 a cup and it is huge ! Tasted v good too! Love it!

Danny Yip,2,"$3.30 for Kopi C Ice tastes worse than any normal kopitiam... the coffee beans that you used are the cheap type, you will not go far with this.

Do you know that you need a blender to blend the coffee to make it taste better for the ice version? ... this is basic knowledge.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112662371704264657211/reviews
Joanne Cheng,4,"There is usually a lot of take away or grab orders. And you can find seatings easily. The place is not too big and maybe about 10 seatings. It is near to Sheng Siong, and will be crowded on weekend.

I like the fun toast honey French toast with butter. The coffee is nice and gao (thick) as I always request. Another drink to order is the hot almond cereal drink. But I will ask for no sweetness as almond itself has sweetness.

The chee chong fun is not the traditional type like pink sauce which I prefer. But it is still nice and goes well with the siew mai.

But the waiting time is longer for weekend but weekday will be good. Good place for catch up with friend over coffee and toast. Or you can have a break after your groceries shopping.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110408957347137900620/reviews
Ivy Yue,1,"Look it this 'milky' colour teh o peng kosong. Very bitter and 'siap'. Asked for more ice to dliture it's bitterness.  Staff crudely commented 'kosong is bitter'. Come more,  being drinking teh o peng kosong for more than 10 years,  good teh o peng kosong is smooth and nice without the bitterness and siap.  This rivercourt outlet serves 1 of the worst. Will not patronise again.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114781055428633853871/reviews
