Additionally, the excellent customer service and attentiveness of the staff member really stood out; provided thorough explanations of the product, which greatly enhanced my understanding of the brand and its offerings.\n\nOverall, it was a very enjoyable experience, and I look forward to returning in the future!",

I totally had no intention to buy anything since I don’t need anything.\n\nWas browsing the accessories section and was approached by the Retail Staff Tan Chin Yean, who was friendly and gave me excellent service. I was happy with her service and bought a nice looking ring from her.\nThe cashier Noor Ain Hafizah who served me was friendly and efficient as well.\n\nHappy for TANGS Department Store to have such great employees, who are well trained in their jobs and provide great customer service.\n\n** the names are found on the receipt, I hope the names are correct.",

His professionalism and passion for what he does truly stood out, and I left feeling confident in my purchase. Excellent customer service\n\n– Thank you, Dennis!",

It’s airier and brighter, with a wide entrance that allows you to see many of the brands TANGS is carrying. Would definitely come here again to shop; by the way, I got two Cote Opera shirts for a great price. Believe young families would enjoy shopping here too. There’s quite a lot of kids’ brands and apparel, like Miffy and Hegen.",

They have the audacity to treat their customers without any respect or space – just pushing to hit their KPI sales I guess.\n\nThe only saving grace for Tang's customer services are the fragrances and perfumes section at Tang Plaza that have YOUNGER brand and sales associates.",
