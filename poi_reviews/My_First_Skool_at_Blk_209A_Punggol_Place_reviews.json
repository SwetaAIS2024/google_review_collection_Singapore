The school organizes engaging field trips, which he eagerly looks forward to every time. The teachers are incredibly caring and create a safe, nurturing environment that allows my child to learn and thrive.",

Impressed that Teachers will make time to address and update on my child’s progression in school during pick up and would always share some of the little moments that happen in school, such as my child finished her tea break today etc or her responses to a certain thing.\n\nThey made us comfortable in sharing little details of our child’s recent changes in behaviour and would offer us advises on what we could try at home or what they can do in school to help address the issue.\n\nOverall, we’re glad that my children’s early years will be spent in this centre!",

We applied him for the MOE kindergarten and got the offer, but after serious considerations, we decided to let him remain with this centre.\n\nWe were very surprised when our 6yo told us that he needed to be the lead Chinese emcee for the CNY celebrations (we never thought that he would be capable of it), as we spoke to him in English (usually).\n\nOn the event day, he proved us wrong and did a very good job.\n\nOver the years, he had never asked whether could he skip school.\n\nBIG shoutout to all teachers! 真是功不可没!",
