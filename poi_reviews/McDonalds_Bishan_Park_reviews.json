      "text": "McDonald’s at Bishan Park has an average dining experience. The food is fine, but the service is very slow. Additionally, pets are not allowed inside or even in the outdoor seating area. Staff were unfriendly and unhelpful when asking us to relocate our dog, despite it being a genuine oversight. This lack of clear communication and customer care was disappointing. Would recommend this outlet only for a quick bite without pets.",

      "text": "you would think Mac all outlets taste the same. this one hash brown tasted like air fried. (in general I find Mac food are all sub par but at least Fries and Hash browns I have high expectations).\n\ndon't waste money on their waffles. either you make it crisp or fluffy. I don't know what this is. this I don't think is outlet issue but more of Mac offering issue (may have to try other outlets but I rather stick to A&W).\n\na waste of a great location.\n\nI wouldn't comment on staff service as I've seen the worst in other countries. we can't expect all outlets to have our fav aunties with cheery and motherly personalities. some just needed the job. I'm ok so long as food is good and timely. untimely food is usually bad process.",

      "text": "The place hardly had anyone and yet, I had waited 20 minutes for my meal. I counted 4-5 staff. All senior or young senior, except for one very young guy. There was no floor manager in sight which means nobody was managing the operation. All of them are like headless flies. The staff were doing a little here and then a bit of other stuff. Super disorganized., I can see some of them taking over someone's jobs that had done halfway. My order was there in 10-15 minutes but just the burger and the fries were out in the open. The drink was not present. Someone had let the coffee machine run and no one was there to attend. The coffee just there chilling out, waiting to be transferred to melting ice (it was ice Americano). Then I went to the counter to check again. That was when I realized that several table service servings were just sitting on the counter. No one was there at the counter. I have been to McDonald's all my life and at different places in this country but man, this has to be the worst ever. Mind you, I hardly leave negative reviews. This should be the first. The saving grace was the triple cheese was stacked nicely. Oh, the staff, being senior or young senior as they were, seem to be shouting or talking very loudly at each other when under pressure.",
