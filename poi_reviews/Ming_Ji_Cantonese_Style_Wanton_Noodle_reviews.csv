Wee Ting Khow,5,Always ordered the friendly uncle’s chicken mushroom horfun which comes with a piece of shrimp and covered in smooth gravy that’s not too salty. Kway teow is silky and cooked just right for takeaway. Uncle looks very old but still spry and does all the cooking. $5 (add 30 cents for takeaway) is very generous as shown in the picture. Try his food before he retires.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115232150410365122372/reviews

Kent Wu,4,"Flavourful simple soya based soup with noodle. The noodle is not overly cooked, just right. Fresh ingredients, like peeled prawns and fish-cakes. They sell wanton noodle too. You can ask for vermicelli noodle instead of noodle.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117916171298040384511/reviews
Kimberly Phua,5,Love the kway teow noodle soup and wanton noodles there. 有小时候的味道. Ate there almost every other day when I was nearby. I also like the friendly couple manning the stall very much. Auntie knows I love chilli and would always prepare a saucer of cut chilli for me.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103980274249679697032/reviews
