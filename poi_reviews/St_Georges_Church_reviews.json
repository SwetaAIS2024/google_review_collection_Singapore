Had heard about this historically and architecturally significant church last time and bookmarked it on Google Maps, so I was happy to have a chance to see it for myself. Second time here was after lunch at The White Rabbit a short walk away (2 months ago!). You wont think that this is in Singapore, the kind of design. It's quite pretty and very charming from the outside, and very well maintained. Wished I could go in though! Caught a glimpse from outside in, it is naturally ventilated inside... keeps its authenticity!",
