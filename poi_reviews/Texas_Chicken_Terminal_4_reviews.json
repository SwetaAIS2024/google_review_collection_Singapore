I had been wondering how it tastes these days, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nNeeding a quick protein bite before my flight, I ordered their popcorn chicken. Unfortunately, the experience wasn’t the best, as some foreign tourists took an unnecessarily long time just to place a simple fast-food order. That aside, the popcorn chicken itself was decent.",
