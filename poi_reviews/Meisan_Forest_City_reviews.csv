John Chua,1,"Missed the Peking Duck at the old Meisan restaurant in Hotel Mutiara, so when I heard abt the Forest City outlet, I was excited. But, excitement turned into huge disappointment.

Reached there and was told no more Peking Duck, coz they only prepared 3 ducks per day. 1st red flag, coz which restaurant prepares only 3 ducks per day?But I decided to stay, since I missed the food there.
I was so wrong.

We were the only ones in the restaurant at 7pm on Fri,  which was dinner time.
2nd red flag.

The lady captain recommended a special pumpkin based soup with fresh Soon Hock.
she did not show us the weight or size of fish before cooking.
3rd red flag.

The soup was nice and the fish meat was fresh.

Also ordered a veggie dish not listed inside the menu and the portion was so small, though it was medium size and ordered a ma po toufu.

The shock came when I went to pay. The total bill came up to RM462, which was a shocker, as I never expected the fish soup alone costs more than RM300.

So sadly, this would be my last time at Meisan.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115221428387199573511/reviews
Li,5,"Good portion, taste not bad, reasonable price for a hotel restaurant. However, it was very quiet only serving 1-2 tables each time. This restaurant deserves more love.

Food: Beef was tender and brinjal was tasty.
Atmosphere: Clean and bright
Price: RM 30-50 per pax

Hope they will turn on the aircond when more people dine in their restaurant.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102453592164919832826/reviews
Elaine Chong,5,"Just want something not too heavy and tried. Surprisingly nice üëç. But not many people here. It‚Äôs a pity this place and the whole forest city is so quiet. They really deserve to have more guests. It‚Äôs a pity not many people come to this beautiful place. It will be tough if not enough visitors, hotel guests, patronize this lovely city. It will be difficult to survive without customers. Do visit here and eat here if you can. Nice food and atmosphere.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108752070937988507901/reviews
Unconventional Passionss,3,"Food pretty good and tasty
But why no air con on and really hot, servers were also not attentive despite us being the only table dining in.

Literally the restaurant is empty the entire day.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106421761783221220211/reviews
