Roxanne,5,Love the teachers here! The teachers are seriously dedicated. My daughter was enrolled in a different student care before and they barely supervised her studies. It just felt like she was playing all day long. The teachers here felt like they are basically mothers supervising their children. They made sure the kids' homework/spelling/ting xie etc are all done which cant have been easy for so many children. Thank you so much!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100147206044239592283/reviews
