Fadhli Yahya,4,"Positives: Staff are friendly and its generally clean. They have provided a bath towel and sleeping blanket. Bath soap is available in the shower area.

Negatives: Do bring your own earplugs as the use of the lockers or snoring users can be abit loud. The underside storage locker areas are pretty dirty. It made my bag dirty. They should improve on that aspect.

Overall, for the price paid, I think its worth the money.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114985628926040459988/reviews

Andri Wirawan,5,"All in all a good stay at Chic capsules. I stayed on the 1st floor at the upper deck. I have been to many capsule hotel before but have always chosen the lower deck and this is my first upper deck, found it to be quite troublesome to keep going up and down. Anyway, there is 1 bathroom on the 1st floor and there are 3 bathrooms on the 2nd floor. I was told that we can use the 2nd floor toilets. The 2 female staff that I met were incredibly friendly but not so with the 2 male staff. Strictly no food allowed in the cabin. There are 2 tables outside the capsule hotel if you would like to eat.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114581269909648193664/reviews
Madhav Kaushal,4,"Got this place because of price and location. Reception was friendly and allowed me to keep my luggage so that I can go around.
I lived on the ground floor, mixed dorm.
Good: Dark place, quiet, cool so easy to sleep. Price is good and so is the location, quite close to Chinatown station.
Bad: Showers are dated and broken. They give you towel but no place to dry them, so everyone kept it indoors in bed which led to a really bad and bothersome funk.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117963337622915861556/reviews
Dr Hassan Raza,4,"Everything was good. Helpful staff, clean rooms, washroom.
The location was perfect, just a walking distance from the MRT station.
With the luggage, u have to climb some stairs. My dorm was on the second floor. The breakfast was very basic a few steps walk to the neighbour hostel.
But it was all manageable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107405177621190493471/reviews
