Yinghan Long,5,"We engaged Tree House Flowers and Gifts recently to decorate our wedding location, which proved to be a really great decision! From table centre pieces, to chair sashes tied with fresh flowers, a floral arch, and fresh flower bouquets, all the details were taken care of beautifully.
The guests were really impressed by the pretty flowers on the tables and brought them home.
Jocelyn who liaised with us has lots of experience and helped to materialise the designs we like while working within our budget. We highly recommend them for their flowers and floral services, and their reasonable pricing!
Thank you so much! :)",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108948606586025599954/reviews
Jo O,5,"I engaged Tree House Flowers and Gifts for my wedding bouquet, wedding car decoration and corsage. The purple theme bouquet was SO gorgeous and more than what i had in mind! Pricing is also wayyyyy cheaper than some atas florists. I have been a regular customer at their previous Funan outlet and the staff have always good recommendation for flowers! Even though they have shifted, i will definitely be back for more flowers from Treehouse~",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115033405486103016233/reviews
