He enjoyed himself very much, making the robots from lego parts and programming them to battle other classmates‚Äô robots.\nTeacher Enzo was very nice, helping to adjust the wires when my boy got them wrong, thanks Teacher Enzo!\nLunches were not bad.\nOther than Teacher, there was 1 assistant to help with the class of total 5 children.\nAll in all, 3 days well-spent and we look forward to signing up for the next holiday camp!",
