      "text": "I recently had the pleasure of visiting a Fiat vehicles workshop, and I was thoroughly impressed by the friendly and attentive service staff. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warm smiles and a genuine willingness to assist. The staff took the time to explain the work that needed to be done on my car and provided clear, honest estimates, making sure I understood the process. They were professional yet approachable, creating a welcoming atmosphere. The service was efficient, and I felt comfortable asking questions, knowing I was in good hands. It's rare to find such a level of customer care, and I left with a strong sense of satisfaction, knowing my vehicle was in expert hands. Highly recommend this Fiat workshop for their exceptional service and friendly team!",

Simple quotation for fiat van plugs got 4hours to prepare, I left after waiting so long to attend a meeting. and when I call back still looking for plugs, fiat specialist service center doesn't have stocks for simple spare parts like plugs. Customer service executive was Jeremy and no sense of urgency. üò©üò©",

Apart from an extremely pleasant nature, her customer service, level of proffessionalism, product knowledge along with transparency with pricing has been consistently outstanding, & exceeding my expectations every time. To me Maggie is second to none, she examplifies a true role model of what a good customer service employee should be. Will definitely refer friends to her should the need ever arise.\n- 5‚≠êÔ∏è Highly Recommended!!\n\nDean\nGBF8328Y",
