Bhaskar Singapore,4,"Great ambience and prices are very much budget.

After seeing the ambulance it may feel like menu is expensive but the other way. I tried coffee ‚òï and üçµ tea here. Simply super tasty.

Staff are polite and courteous. Must visit restaurant in this vicinity.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118414779972405165627/reviews
JAY RULZ,3,"A very grand 5 star look and ambience restaurant.
Sadly the food didn't meet it's look.
Thai Som Tam wasn't that good as I have ate many in Thai.
The biryani was dry but the mutton was tender.
The meat and prawn we ordered didn't have enough absorption of marination that made the taste of each dish plain.
The papadum wasn't crispy.

Bru coffee was ok and honey lemon was ok too
The mint lime juice was awesome 9/10

It was a disappointment in total as it was a recommendation from friends but end up heartbreaking",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103520824626997280051/reviews
