      "text": "My one year at ProLearn Bishan during Secondary 4 were transformative! Having failed my End-Of-Year examinations, I was in search for a miracle tuition aid to assist me in understanding Elementary Mathematics and Additional Mathematics.\n\nWith Teachers Elaine and Jiaqian's dedication and patience, they guided me through N-level A-Math and O-level E-Math. Their individualised approach in small groups allowed me to learn at my own pace and clarify doubts without hesitation. The result? My grades soared from F9 to A1!\n\nIf you're seeking a supportive and effective learning environment, ProLearn is the answer! Definitely recommend üëç",

      "text": "Throughout my 2 years at ProLearn Bishan during my upper secondary years, I had a good experience here as a student! :)\nI was taught N level A-math and O level E-math by teacher Elaine and teacher Jiaqian. Both of them are dedicated and patient, which enabled me to comfortably clarify my doubts. Additionally, the approach of individualised teaching within a small group setting helped me to be able to learn at my own pace. After my time at ProLearn, my grades have significantly improved from D7/U to A1.\nOverall, I highly recommend ProLearn to anyone who is keen on looking for a centre to enrol in! üëçüèº",
