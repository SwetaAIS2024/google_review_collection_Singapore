They are able to do baked goods, snacks, cookies, chocolates and etc. The cookies tasted really good!

I enjoy spending my time at the cafe for a hot cup of latte, my fave is their grilled spicy chicken. Their cookies are good too.

Most importantly I get to stay for a purpose. ü•∞",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116463728634826205226/reviews
WenD Tan,5,"Love the people.

The cafe is nice and the people cooking are nice too.

Very nice and juicy peri peri chicken with tasty sides. I chose the two best ones.

Aircon on the cold side. Be prepared.
Nice book corner to peruse and you can contribute books too.

Got the Christmas menu for showroom and the best part is the log cake. So delicious and not too sweet. Love it",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109536932994130185088/reviews
