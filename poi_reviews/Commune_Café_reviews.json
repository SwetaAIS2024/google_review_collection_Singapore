As I was walking to my seat, I accidentally spilled my drinks, but the staff was incredibly kind and understanding. @Grace, @Charmaine, and @Faisal immediately reassured me that it was okay and quickly cleaned everything up with a smile. Their warm and thoughtful service truly made my day. On top of that, they even remade my drinks without hesitation, which I deeply appreciate. Exceptional customer service like this deserves to be recognized! Thank you again for your kindness. I’ll definitely be coming back! :)",

The coffee is great, the staffs are so friendly and the sitting area on the overhead is airy, not crowded.\n\nI had the Columbia decaf (bean came from Common Man Roasters) in a flat white and all the Columbia signature notes are there in a nice cohesive balance. Yum. Thanks barista!",

      "text": "I've been getting the coffee here for a few years now but usually just takeaway. Sitting down for a change so doing a review.\n\nThe beans are from Common Man Coffee Roasters but the baristas here so a good job. My wife got a decaf flat white using Colombian Risaralda (see pic) and I got a normal double shot flat white with their Lucky Basterd beans.\n\nThe decaf had a good body and the Colombian characteristics are evident. Good taste and complexity for a decaf. The Lucky Basterd starts with more floral and citrus flavours and had a nice complexity. Body was decent but the length faded very quickly.\n\nOverall, the coffee is still great. The seating are on these two bridges spanning the mall below. Comfy seats and good to relax. We'll come back.",

The seating area is rather limited though. Thankfully someone left, otherwise we would have gone somewhere else",

      "text": "#QRcode QR code for menu in included in one of the photo\n\nThe friendly staff went to look for a table space for me as I am alone and can’t really leave my bag around to Chope a seat. So thoughtful of them.\n\nOrdered the cake set and went for a hot mocha and speculoos cheese cake. The coffee was intense and tasted of what a great mocha should have. The cheesecake on the other hand is passible- nothing to scream about but nothing to fault either.\n\nIf there is one thing to wish for, I hope that the outdoor aircon is a little cooler though. I guess that’s because the afternoon is really hot outside when I arrived.\n\nOverall a great place to chill for an hour or 2 in a quiet mall.\n\nAdditional Note/Info:\nNo laptop use from 12-3pm (peak hours) - check out full info from one of the photo inserted",
