Julia Low,3,"Wanton Noodles, Dry ($4.50) – 6/10
The noodles were springy and thicker than usual, coated in a black soy sauce that had a slight sweetness. The char siew was lean and thinly sliced, but it lacked the tenderness and flavor to stand out. The wantons had smooth skins but were on the thicker side. A decent meal, but not one I’d return for.

Dumpling Soup ($5) – 7/10
The soup was delicious, with a clean, savory flavor, and 4 generously stuffed dumplings. Each of the four dumplings was filled with a flavorful mix of prawns and crunchy water chestnuts, offering a satisfying bite.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116360636909081420398/reviews
Jack,3,"Food is good here, compared to other tanjong rhu wanton mee. I like the noodles really springy no alkaline taste. Char siew of the leaner old school variety. Ordered dumpling soup today $5 for 4 pieces generously filled dumpling with prawn in every piece with a thin layer of skin really yummy. Don't really like this hawker here as many crows, hard to find seating and plates at tray return not cleared promptly.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288565584051666357/reviews
Marcus Ang,4,"noodles are al-dente and springy, sauces compliments well too. wontons were full of meat and skin doesn't taste alkaline-y as well.

char siew is just the regular cardboard char siew (added extra so lower your expectations if you're ordering a normal portioned bowl).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111145722549856734783/reviews

Supreet Kini,5,"Busy wanton Mee stall at Marine Terrace Hawker Centre.

Was craving some nice wanton Mee and spotted this stall. Quick moving line. Opted for the $5.5 version wanton Mee with chilli.

Really springy noodles, generous ingredients such as bok choy, sliced pork, fried wantons and wantons. The chilli goes so well with the noodles, really liked it!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105328280516267995599/reviews
