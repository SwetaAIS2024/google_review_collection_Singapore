Touristmouse,3,"The 3-in-1 ($1.40) was crispy and served hot, which was nice. However, I find the taste flat. Also, even though it's called ""3 in 1"", I could only taste yam and Nian Gao. Where is the third ingredient haha.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110409011587721664076/reviews
Ileen Luu,5,"This stall sells nostalgic old-school snacks that really hit the spot. The carrot cake sticks are especially good—the more you munch on them, the more flavorful they get. You know what I mean, right? That kind of satisfying, addictive taste that keeps you going back for more. I also really enjoyed their Tau Suan and Tau Huay—simple, comforting, and well-made. It’s so heartening to see these kinds of traditional stalls still thriving in Singapore.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115538243248188776850/reviews

JDO,1,"Take away per item is $0.20 , lol the plastic is like 1 cent

So I bought multiple items it’s like
$0.20 $0.20 $0.20 total $1 for taking away ? Hello it’s a plastic bag leh not container leh , why rip off and profit so much from taking away , what the ….

Food wise , youtiao is never fresh , they will not serve the hot one , they will put it below and take the older stock out so if you’re buying at 2-4pm it’s all not nice.

The beancurd is zero sugar, I wished they closed down. Waste of space
