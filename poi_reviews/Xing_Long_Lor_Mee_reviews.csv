hTo Pam,5,"😱😱😱😱OMG it's so delicious 😍😍🤩🤩
Lor mee gravy is so authentic and superb, sooo delicious and tasty that I drank all the gravy. There's these crispy fish skin blend so well in it, simply irresistible and delicious that one would easily be addicted to it. And it's only at $3.50 or $4.50 😍😱so cheap
For sure will revisit it whenever possible 😍🤩

I miss the lor mee sooooo much,
I'm back again for more after a long delay of 3 weeks! Once again, it didn't fail my taste buds, smells so good, taste superbly delicious, keep me craving for more 😍🤩👍

Jun Hong P,5,"Lor Mee is damm SHIOK. Sauce is thicc and flavourful. Macho man stall owner spends 6 hours daily to slowly brew the flavour out and you can taste the love and passion in the sauce. Generous portion, order large if you have buffet appetite.

Come before 12pm because sold out damm early due to popularity. The black/white carrot cake also must try.

Highly reccomended!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100411051108254397569/reviews
Kayden N,5,"Found this stall through some viral Facebook post by some food reviewer. Honestly one of the best bowls lor mee I’ve had by far. Broth was thick but not too starchy, consistent enough to have that succulent texture and taste wise, definitely can beat a lot of “famous” lor mee stalls I’ve been to. Ingredients are top quality and super generous!! (Maybe because the owner/chef is a huuuge dude and that’s how bodybuilders eat lol)
10/10 for $$ worth
10/10 for broth
12/10 for customer service (owner is always smiling and is super polite to everyone - even to this older person queued in front of me who was trying to give him a hard time…very rare for young people to have such good attitude to especially in a hawker setting where no one expects such.)

Highly recommend!  Do support this young hawker with good attitude and good food 👍🏻💯",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107969436789747627490/reviews
Leon Ho,5,"I had lor mee and carrot cake from this stall and it was surprisingly satisfying. The texture of the gravy for the Lor Mee was good and flavorful. They also provide a good range of ingredients to pair up.

Carrot cake was delicious with the crispness and fresh tasting ingredients.

Recommend to give it a taste if you are nearby.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113593936357562901586/reviews
Sean Goh,3,"Chance upon this lor mee stall at this hawker centre at 50a marine Terrace. The Lor Mee stall occupied half of the Xing Long cooked food which sell stuff like fried carrot cake and etc.

A bowl of lor mee starts from SGD$4 onwards.  The bowl of lor mee came with items such as half a braised egg, braised pork belly. Fried fish and fishskin as well as beancurd skin roll. Opted for the combo of yellow noodle and beehoon.

Gravy is quite dark in colour and on the sweeter side which i not such a big fan of. Gravy turns watery quite fast as well.  Not bad but quite easy to jelat due to gravy. Overall, still a decent bowl of lormee.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
