Merlion stuff is also available at this supermarket. Happy Shopping.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489311735261065689/reviews
Di Di,5,"I like how Cold Storage takes pride in the quality of the food that they display. Many staff were still stocking up the shelves when the store opened.

There are many items on offer and I managed to get the chocolates at $0.69 instead of $2.75 and the coffee ground which has a reasonable expiry of a little more than one month was at half price of $8.45.

I could not find a trolley, and I was directed to one. The cashier was all smiles, asked for Yuu rewards and assisted me to pack my items into my bag. She immediately scanned the heavily items so that I could bag at the bottom first.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews

Shin Lee,1,"Deli and salad section is generally great- minus the very grumpy staff who is obviously overworked as he exclaimed ""there is only me"" when I was just asking if there will be anyone helping me. Please DFI, look into your staffing to have more manpower during lunch time, or don't have the deli section opened. It was fully decked out with food but no staff to serve.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108167697159717037881/reviews
