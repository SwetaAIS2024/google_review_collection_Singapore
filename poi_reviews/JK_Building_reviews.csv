Li Xuan,3,"4 storey building. Bottom 2 floors are shops while third floor are 2 storey flats. Building looks dated.

Specialised shops here like veterinary, pet groomer, music shop, massage parlour, dentist, clinic, cheese shop etc.

Across the street there are more neighbourhood shops so this building offers different amenities to the area.

Some parking lots right in front of the building.

Usually not a busy place as people come over for a specific shop and will not loiter for long.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102658129380769300446/reviews
