Jo P,5,"A newly opened cozy cafe at level 2 with friendly & nice staff. Salads with fresh ingredients, good portion & reasonably priced. There's a 30% welcome discount in celebration of their grand opening which valid till end Feb 2025.
Some places do well in main dishes and neglected the drinks but the drinks here are well made too, the coffee we had are good, even with cute coffee art on them. Toasts are just right portion for a light meal. Will highly recommend this place and definitely revisit here again!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107669682753846932299/reviews
Fabian Koh,5,"Dandelions is a very cozy and comfortable dining place in Changi City Point. I ordered the Dandi (DIY salad bowl) and it’s so yummy! The chicken was flavourful, great variety of ingredients for a balanced meal, and not to mention the generous portion — its value for money. This can’t be said for every salad place, but I find that the salad bowls in Dandelions are able to balance nutrition and taste quality. Not forgetting the brownies as well, I’m still dreaming about it. Please request for the brownie to be heated and eat it along with their tea! Highly recommended dining spot be it salad bowl or desserts. 😊",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103694462676315846407/reviews
Vanessa,5,"The salads here are absolutely delicious, with a rich variety of nutritious ingredients. The coffee is top-notch, and the tiramisu is scrumptious.

Ivan Michael Pung,5,"Visited Changi City Point 🏬 and got stuck there due to the rain ☔️ but blessings 🙇‍♂️, I found this pretty chill Dandelions Café.

Café : Simple, spacious and beautifully decorated with nice colouring and selection of furniture. Has a nice mixture of seats from bar, table to couch. (Watch my video 📹) The café is also amazingly clean 🫧🧼and smells awesome 🥰! (They were baking 🧑‍🍳 something I think?)

Drinks : Well, check out my pictures 📸 and see for yourself. Scan QR code to place your orders🧾. (Something I don’t enjoy 😌 as it loses the human interaction 🗣️but that’s what everyone is doing these days and all made possible thanks to technology 📲) I ordered an Ice 🧊 Wakoucha Oat Latte (Highly Recommend 👍👍👍), Flat White + Signature Tiramisu 🍰. Unfortunately, the Tiramisu was a little too “wet” for my liking, the bottom half in the cup was soaking. The drinks were well prepared on a La Marzacco machine using Tiong Hoe coffee beans 🫘.

Staff : Didn’t really interact much for what it’s worth, she 🙋‍♀️ was friendly and polite.

It’s a nice café to chill out from all the shopping 🛍️🛒 and I think we can clearly see they use good beans and machine so that they can focus on baking and cooking the desserts and food stuff. I will come back to try the rest of the menu.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100551027047446956883/reviews
