      "text": "I had a fantastic dining experience at Feng Shui Inn! The food was absolutely excellent, with every dish full of flavor and beautifully presented. The ambience added to the charm, making it a perfect setting for a cozy meal. Our server, Gary, was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, recommending some of the best dishes on the menu – and he didn’t steer us wrong! As a special touch, the restaurant surprised us with a Halloween-themed dessert, which was such a treat and a lovely gesture. Thank you for a memorable afternoon lunch!",

Really fine dining Chinese cuisine at its best. My personal favourites were the boiled soup, siew mai with cod roe and fried baby broccoli. Dim sum were served fresh while piping hot. Portions were just nice as well. Let’s hope they can keep up the momentum.",
