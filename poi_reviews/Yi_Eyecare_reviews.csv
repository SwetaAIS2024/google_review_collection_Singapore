NAZRAMA ‚ÄúRama‚Äù,5,"I‚Äôm a longtime customer at Yi Eyecare, and here‚Äôs where I usually get my contact lenses. (There‚Äôs a happy ending at the end of this review, trust me!)

So far, I have never encountered any issue with my purchases, until I bought a new pair of contact lens recently (same brand, same colour, same degree) like I always did every other month.

Took me several days later to finally realised that they gave me the wrong one. By that time, I‚Äôve already opened the packaging and I was already wearing it when the realisation occured (the degree was lower by a lot, and my vision was obviously blurry).

I immediately brought the lenses back to the store, in hopes to get a replacement, or at least a discounted rate if I had to purchase a new pair. It was partially my fault because I was so used to buying contact lenses there without checking the items first. They already had my purchase history in their system, hence, I fully trusted that the staff at that time (and I found out later that he‚Äôs an intern) would give me the correct ones.

I was very glad that John the supervisor was there to rectify the issue immediately after checking my purchase history and offered to replace my lenses. I still had to purchase a new pair (at a slight discount) while I wait for the replacement for the wrong ones, which will take about 5 weeks.

Technically, I‚Äôve purchased two pairs this month, but at least I could get a replacement for the wrong ones so it doesn‚Äôt go to waste. Thank you Yi Eyecare for the excellent service! I will always come back to you! ü´∂üèΩ",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113705329667189525036/reviews

Jessica,5,"Excellent service and quality products. I‚Äôve been their customer for many years and always had very good experience. They have a good range of coloured lenses and spectacles from very good brands.

I have 1 spectacle from them that I‚Äôve worn for many years and still in superb condition. Recently just purchased dailies from them and happy to find they have small box dailies as I don‚Äôt wear them everyday.

Preorder was quick, I got my contact lens the very next day as they know I need it for Christmas and New Year üòä so efficient!

You can also get your eyesight checked (for the short sightedness/astigmatism) before purchasing anything. Love that the shop does not hard sell and always patient with you during shopping. üõçÔ∏è",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101155769435742692907/reviews
aLtCure,5,"Extremely friendly staff and exceptional in-store and after-sales service. Also a great variety of branded frames and contacts to choose from. The store owner was present during my visit and she was very knowledgeable and patient, answering me and my wife's questions. She also notified us about available discounts and helped us get free promotional vouchers. 5/5 would definitely return again!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108614498956532974626/reviews
Connie Tan,1,"I am extremely dissatisfied with the bifocal spectacles I purchased from Yi Eyecare shop. Despite informing the optician about feeling dizzy while wearing them initially, the adjustments made did not improve the situation. Upon collecting the adjusted pair, I encountered very unfriendly and impatient service from her colleague. Despite explaining my extensive experience with bifocal lenses, I felt as though I was being treated as a first-time wearer. Unfortunately, even after wearing the new pair for several weeks, I continue to experience discomfort and the clarity of vision remains unsatisfactory. Regrettably, I must express my disappointment, and I have no intention of returning to this shop in the future.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100655481191739888089/reviews
