penny,5,"the cold delis were amazing! all the fresh ingredients were cooked to perfection, nothing was mushy or limp! and the sauces went perfectly with everything, the fruity notes added a kick to it! all the different ingredients used felt like they had been meticulously curated and chosen to make a harmonious taste profile! üëèüèª i used to think that hot food always has more flavour than cold food! üëèüèªüëèüèª

the hot delis were surprisingly overshadowed by the cold delis ü´¢ the beef was nice and tender, albeit boring compared to the cold delis. we both preferred the halibut because it was more unique!

the 16 grain rice was nicely cooked, soft and just moist enough! the carrot soup tasted more like pumpkin soup, but it was so good and creamy!

at 12~pm on a weekday, there was already a long queue! the food queue moves quite fast, but the queue for the tables is slower. would suggest you go at 11:30am latest!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104198052626816980862/reviews
Tio Gabriel Tio Yong Ping,3,"Healthy food choices over here with multi grain rice option. Meat portion is pretty small as their set encourage more on cold dish. The only food taste good is the creamy mushroom dish.

Their coffee selection was out of order at that moment. Probably due to closing soon. We came about 7.30pm.

Generally for the price for this portion of food, is not really worth it. I guess I pay more for the comfortable atmosphere.

Kitchen is very tidy though. A+ for that",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112496304834029525242/reviews
Posh Pearl,5,"Food is excellent as usual, it‚Äôs something so homely yet so different and satisfying. I love the explosion of flavours and contrasting hot and cold dishes that go well with their 16 grain rice. Even their miso soup is delicious!
Long queue during lunch peak mainly office crowd but it clears fast as there are enough manpower to do the orders and cashiering.
There was a nice middle age female service crew who assisted me in getting seats.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106728704755913363642/reviews

ItsJaycee Zhuang,5,"Good place to have meal. Price were slightly higher on the side, however the dishes were decent and portion were generous.

The atmosphere I had rated 3 stars. There're some noisy guests who rather spend to talk then enjoying meal here. The hospitality here is well and you had to queue two times for the table.

The carrot soup is a favourite and must come back for the rice and the deli set!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112100541913838236784/reviews
