Daphne Seow,4,"Lots of local traditional biscuits and malaysian traditional snacks. Includes tau sar piah, khong guan biscuits in a tin where you can choose and buy by quantity, keropoks, etc.

Good variety and affordable prices. Good for own consumption or for gifts. Nice shopping experience just browsing through the plethora of products.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104327864622972505344/reviews
