Veronica Pestana,5,"Somehow this little Indian grocer in Clementi West has been my go to place for all Indian type of veggies and fruits.
The coriander is always available, and a good quantity of my favourite karpooravali bananas are brought in every Friday or Saturday.
It's mango season now and Alphonso mangoes are here too!
In the fridge they even have Australian Greek yoghurt which is such a pleasant find.
The guys may not speak a lot of English but they are polite, helpful and know their products well.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107681237278744268338/reviews

Rohit,4,"The only Indian store near Clementi which has an assortment of products from Indian groceries to Body grooming. If you are an Indian and living near the area, there’s no reason not to go here. Better than going all the way to Little India for the same stuff.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107311996908373008787/reviews
Sowmya Mysoor,1,"The orders for delivery is old stock and lentils came with insects in them. Most of the chappathis were gone and had a yellow stain on all of them. We did not ask them to take it back or refund... When asked for an exchange for the wrong lentils and the lentils that had insects, the lady gets aggressive and is extremely short tempered. I've sent pictures if the items in less than 5 mins (of the insects and wrong items) of the delivery. They refused to come back and take it.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116119884832802692134/reviews
