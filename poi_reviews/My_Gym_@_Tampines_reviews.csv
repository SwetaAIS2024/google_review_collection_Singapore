Kat Wong,5,Been sending my 4yo and 2yo children to my gym for the past 6 months. The children enjoy their weekly gym classes and have learnt to be a lot more confident moving about. Coaches often switch up the configuration of the gym equipment so there’s always something new each session.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106350690790613255028/reviews
Christy Lo,5,"Over the past 3 months, my child has been attending My Gym and recently began experiencing separation anxiety and stranger anxiety. Teacher Lynn has been exceptional in handling this challenging phase. She provided professional guidance to both my husband and me, while demonstrating remarkable patience in calming our child and helping my child integrate back into group activities. Teacher Lynn and Teacher Yanny expertise and understanding approach deserve a big thumbs up. We truly appreciate their dedication to making our child's experience positive and comfortable.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113263378276882410978/reviews
H E,5,"My son and daughter both went here for their playgroup class in 2018-2019 and 2024. I think they learn the most essential skills with MyGym at this age around social development, language development, gross and fine motor and gymnastics skills. Teachers are very good and child to teacher ratio among the best I have seen in Singapore, you are assured your child is looked after well and gets the attention for learning.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116875175012421528739/reviews
