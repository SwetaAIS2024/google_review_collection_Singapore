Thomas Yeow,1,"The technician who is supposed to be ""in charge"" of me has poor work ethics. Texted him to request for rental of cpap but only reply 3 to 4 days after. Understand that there may be many enquiries but a response beyond 2 days is unacceptable. At least tell that he is busy instead of ignoring messages. Also he recommended the wrong mask which caused me to saffocate multiple nights. He only showed me 2 different masks whereas there is supposed to be a third mask which is more ideal for my situation. After responding he said he will contact me again but so far it has been months and no response. Shows a lack of interest and sincerity, and is very unprofessional!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107715524674293598312/reviews

chen han lim,5,Patrick was very friendly and very easy going. He was proficient in his work. He was preparing the wires and machine on me whilst answering all my queries patiently. He is also very detailed and careful to make sure everything is placed properly. He also made sure I was comfortable with all the wires hanging all over me. Thank you for your patience and professional.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114405451110573533970/reviews

Niraj Bhujel,5,"Patrick was very friendly and nice guy to deal with. He provide me with all details required for the sleep study beforehand so I can prepare myself.
