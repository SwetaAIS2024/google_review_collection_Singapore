Rin Tanaka,5,"Dr Zhao has been my family’s go-to doctor ever since we became a Bt Batok resident years ago… she is thorough, friendly, assuring and professional… we feel we are in good hands under her care… Dr Zhao’s clinic assistants Filzah and team are also courteous, friendly, helpful & efficient… have never seen any other clinic managing patients’ expectations on wait time better than them… the clinic visit experience was so smooth, it already contributed much in making each already sick patient feel better after the visit..kudos to the team… will miss distinct clinic’s care even after moving out of bt batok… & will still likely come back to visit should I require medical attention in the future…thank you from the bottom of our hearts :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116184644718874671638/reviews
