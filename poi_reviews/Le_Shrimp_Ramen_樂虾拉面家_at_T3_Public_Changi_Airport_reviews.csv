Angela Grace,5,"I love Le Shrimp Ramen and have always come here, but I‚Äôve never visited the Jewel outlet until now.

This outlet really stands out from the rest I‚Äôve been to. The staff are so amiable‚Äîwhen we asked for chilli oil, they responded with such a friendly and demure tone, and even said to feel free to call out if we needed anything else.

We also noticed someone behind us couldn‚Äôt finish her drink, and the staff kindly gave her a bottle of ice to take away so she could keep her drink cold.

Really great experience here at Jewel! Will definitely come back üëçüëçüëçüëç",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104263824020597882746/reviews
Eugene T,5,"Tucked at the basement of T3. We managed to catch the $9.90 deal which is between 3pm to 5pm only. Such a hearty combo with a small appetiser, main meal and drinks. The prawn broth is very rich and flavourful and definitely worth a try if you haven‚Äôt done so. Service is also excellent with staff being attentive and not much of a wait time although it was slightly busy.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100738974040986588380/reviews
DH Y,4,"The ramen was good esp the soup. Unfortunately, there was an extremely pungent awful taste from the greens and I realised the chef put corianders with spring onions.
It really distroyed the meal to be honest.
Corianders taste disgusting. Am glad that the soup did not have coriander smell or taste.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101717588960793112210/reviews
Devina R,4,"Trio Shrimp Ramen is good and the signature here but the Pork Chop with Preserved Vegetables Tonkotsu Ramen is better.
During tea time at 3pm-5pm, we can get a set meal for around 13SGD each and will get chilled canned drinks with a glass full of ice and an appetizer. We both chose the braised tofu.
Big portion. Pretty good value to get the set menu for that price in Changi Airport Singapore. Because it will get you a VERY full stomach afterwards.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110798508068662004291/reviews
