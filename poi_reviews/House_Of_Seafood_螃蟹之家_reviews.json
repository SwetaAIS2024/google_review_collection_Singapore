Ordered chili crab, black pepper crab, pork ribs, prawns roll, yam ring, pan-fried beehoon all were great, except yam paste not very suite our taste as it added some sweet corn which we donâ€™t like corn and not the authentic taste of oh nee. Overall dishes were above average, crab very fresh. Hope they can keep up the quality and standard. Lastly thanks for their promotion dine free for birthday baby. Will recommend more birthday babyðŸ˜….",

The pepper crab sauce was fine and spicy, and if the chilli crab sauce could be spicier that be great. There were a lack of waiters that could take orders that evening, so had to exercise some patience.",
