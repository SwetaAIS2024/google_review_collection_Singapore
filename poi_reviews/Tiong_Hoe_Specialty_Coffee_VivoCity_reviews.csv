S L Chan,5,"We finally found the cafe inside the supermarket, and ordered two flat whites. The espresso base was nutty but not too bitter, making the coffee very good. The barista was nice and friendly, and brought us water immediately after we ordered.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112012995262705002958/reviews
Ms Wunderlast,5,"Tiong Hoeâ€™s coffees maintain their standards with their friendly baristas with their nicely done brews. Even the tea has a timing for customers to know when to start sipping their teas.

Itâ€™s sometimes hard to find good bottled cold brews and their Amber Black tastes good (La Linda batch), not too diluted, as fragrant as you might find with a freshly made hand brew.

Itâ€™s definitely a delight for grocery shoppers, wished there were more room for seats. Iâ€™m always glad to spot a Tiong Hoeâ€™s coffee stand! Thanks for the lovely coffee always!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113518918731581154836/reviews

Audrey,3,"Donâ€™t know why this cafe has such high rate

Have tried the iced white ,the coffee bean must be dark roasted, not good flavor.

Wonâ€™t try again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113066508138771426759/reviews
