Dr. Johnson was professional and took the time to explain everything, which made me feel at ease. The staff were kind and caring, ensuring I was comfortable throughout the entire process. Thanks to their excellent care, my LASIK procedure was smooth and successful. Highly recommend Dr. Johnson for anyone considering LASIK!",
