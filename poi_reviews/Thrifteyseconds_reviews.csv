shirleen giam,5,"Initially came down to pick up FOC Miffy bowls but was greeted by a vintage curated store of sort! It was as if I was walking right through my childhood — I noticed lots of iconic characters from my younger days. As I looked through the store, it really unlocked old memories from the past — be it Mcdonald’s Happy Meal Toys, watching Cartoon Network, playing Pokemon, Love&Berry etc.

If I had to describe this place it’ll be extremely nostalgic, homey and heartwarming. From the placement of all the trinkets/toys to the welcoming owners (shoutout to Nat). Nat seems to know the place inside out too as she could identify where certain Miffy stuff were in the store-full of curated vintage toys.

It was so kind of the owners to give me FOC Miffy bowls and I came out of the store with some gems too! An unexpected find on Carousell led me to something even bigger 🥹 I’m so sad that they’re closing down as I only got to know of this gem of a place right now but I’m truly lucky to have visited once before they relocate to Thailand/Japan.

I’ll catch you guys in Thailand when you open up 🇹🇭👋🏻 Thank you for opening a treasure trove, it is truly a hidden gem. 💎",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109967812785052139148/reviews
Chake Chake,5,"Ever since I was a kid, I've always had dreams where I would walk into a store, one that had all of the old, weird Japanese stuff that I adore, but couldn't get in America. That dream came alive here, I had to stop myself from buying so much stuff! And beyond the items, the experience felt very personal, welcoming, and safe. I highly recommend Thrifteyseconds to anybody who loves vintage aesthetics, to live the childhood fantasy of being a kid with money, and to finally find Bomberman figures! 😂💖",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117114501438901327548/reviews
