      "text": "I had a wonderful experience at the dental clinic today! The front staff was friendly and assisted me smoothly through the registration process. The dentist, Dr Cassandra was patient, gentle, and thorough, taking the time to inquire about my jaw's medical history and conducting an X-ray to meticulously assess my teeth for any decay. She explained everything in detail, making sure I understood each step. The scaling procedure was done skillfully, and the overall visit was very pleasant. Highly recommend this clinic for anyone seeking attentive and expert dental care!",
