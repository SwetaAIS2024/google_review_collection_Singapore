Wei Ming,5,"I don't usually writes review but when I do, I really mean it.
I get my OBU replaced in this shop.
It's my first time visiting the shop, I was served by a mechanic (brown hair), he was very friendly and jokes alot. Got my OBU replaced very quickly and he even explain what I should take note of.

In addition, I had a faulty car play with me for a long time. I always wanted to remove and other workshop quoted my $50 for workman fee.
I ask the mechanic for the price to remove the faulty carplay, he just told me a small amount will do and proceed to remove.
Took him quite a while to remove because the cabling is very deep.
Ended up when the work is done, I ask for the price again, he say don't need with a smile.

Best mechanic I encountered so far.
Highly recommend!!!
Extremely satisfied with the service.
As for the OBU cabling work, could be neater if possible.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104514054868670871800/reviews

Price wise quote me PCX 160 for replacement of belt at$200++. I know you are not the cheapest nor most expensive. Just to let you know I get a quote at $105",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116730991369875733246/reviews

Shuhui Ang,3,"NMax engine oil change - fully synthetic : $27
Spark plug : $18

Didn’t have to wait on a Sat morning. I know it’s hard to change the spark plug as many things to open up. But is above a reasonable price? Last time I change spark plug for fino, it cost $5 else where. Anyway I proceeded.

Asked for battery price and they quoted me $70+
Decided not to proceed because I don’t remember it to be so ex.. subsequently I search online and found battery prices for NMax between $30+ to $50.

Finally got my battery at Ah boy for $38. The better brand one for $48.

I guess good if you are rushing to get things fixed but expensive if you have time to go elsewhere",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109579721510671696106/reviews
