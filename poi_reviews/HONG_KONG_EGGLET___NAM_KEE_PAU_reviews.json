The auntie said it was alright to redeem three at once.\n\nItems was served fast. It was already cooked, but it was still hot. Egglets are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They do taste good.",

      "text": "As what the other reviews say, the egglet ($3.60) wasnâ€™t hot. That makes it tough, so it was difficult to bite and it missed the whole point of the hongkong egglet- a crispy, airy bubble waffle. Hotdog waffle ($2.80) was okay, one side of it was a little uncooked but the hotdog itself was fine. The staff was very busy, so itâ€™s understandable that her service may not be ideal. Sheâ€™s working by herself, so please be patient with her.",
