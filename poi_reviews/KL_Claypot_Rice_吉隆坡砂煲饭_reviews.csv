Andy Heng,1,"Signboard say ""Klang Bak Ku Teh"" but taste nothing like it! More like cooked from instant packet of BKT ingredients. Also, only few pieces of pork & 1 pathetic piece of enoki & veg.

Ask boss can add soup or not, told me now herbs very expensive, cannot add soup & only 1 fill that's all. Total crap! Avoid this BKT at all costs, u can find better ones elsewhere than here!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110223746277236838794/reviews
C P,1,"Terrible service from the man, bossy to customers and poor attitude. The food portion is pathetic, $6.50 for 2 pieces of ribs with very little meat and few strands of veggie and enoki. I will never come back again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111679579358567329812/reviews
FRan,4,Ordered the claypot rice. No other customer in front of me still had to wait 15mins. Believe the cooking process took long to get the flavor.  Chicken was fresh and tender. The bottom part of the rice very crispy. Well done for a pot $6.50.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114274074411845672874/reviews
Angel C,1,"If I could give the food and service a ZERO, I would. Food was served lukewarm, even if server prepared the food one by one. Claypot rice was mushy, unlike the regular ones that’s supposed to be dry. Server forgot about our pig trotters and even tho she prepared it in the spot, it wasn’t boiling. If you like herbal soup with strong herbal taste, this is the spot for you to go if you do not mind just warm soup. 10/10 would not visit again. Especially since server really could not be bothered.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100252287115246456899/reviews
Wei LaW,1,"First time post comment of favourite port klang bak kut teh here. Maybe their claypot rice is better. Back to business, served only 2 slim pork ribs, 1 slight vege & 1cm bunch of enoki mushroom. Portion for kids. Taste normal with soya light sauce. No offence just sharing for food hunters",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115618539078848957072/reviews
