Michael,3,"This is much like a western style “hawker centre”. There was a live band that came on at about 0730H and you can order food from different vendors to dine at your table. Ordered from 4 different food stalls - quality and taste of food will just consider as average.

Will suggest to come in the evening when weather isn’t that hot. Do have some mosquitoes and house flies buzzing around, thus good to be in long pants if you’re not wanting a feast beneath the tables.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115908361280059341890/reviews
Annie Fong,5,"Timbre+ one north is such a vibe! Out large group had a lovely evening singing along and dancing to the awesome band. Food options were a bit limited on a PH (Good Friday) but what we had was alright.

Definitely recommend this venue to meet with friends over affordable drinks and food with live music.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107855244270511816264/reviews

Donna Cashore,5,"Happy, relaxed vibe
Lots of food choices. Fun, live music with 2 different sets (I'm pretty sure) for the earlier and later crowds. The food is tasty and cost efficient. I've been here multiple times and had food from various stalls/food trucks. I haven't been disappointed. This is a great place for a group of friends to hang out, was well as for an after work group to get together.
Definitely recommended.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115345192795203735565/reviews
The Maven,1,"The tray return area is a cockroach breeding ground. The food is good but the hygiene at this particular area is not taken care of at all, will be sending in a report to the relevant authorities.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116461366908429019678/reviews
