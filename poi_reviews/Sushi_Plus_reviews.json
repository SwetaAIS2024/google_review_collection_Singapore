Clarified with the staff and was told it was purposely serve frozen because they don‚Äôt want it to melt on the way out but this is ridiculous. Still have an overall 4 star because this is a sushi restaurant and their sushi + mentaiko fries was amazing.",

Quality of the fresh fish especially the tuna üç£ can be a little stale though overall the food is acceptable. Place can be very busy at meal times. Offers both counter and table seats to choose from. The two of us really had a feast thus the cost of the meal is high. Otherwise $20-30 per pax is doable.",

      "text": "Sushi Buffet (All you can eat promotion 26.90$+++ per pax) was such a wonderful experience where I could have my favourite sushi items as much as I can. Me and my partner could devour a huge number of plates which were quite fresh and delicious. The conveyor belt never went empty. The only thing that we had to wait was strawberry mochi because I think it was the favourite dessert for most of the customer and kitchen staffs were a bit delay in topping up the mochi on belt.\nI love Mango cheesecake, caramel pudding were included in the buffet spread which are quite good in quality and taste.\nAppreciate the prompt delivery of ordered items and clearing the plates.\nOverall it was a genuinely great and worthy experience of sushi buffet.\nIt will be great that the buffet system will be available as an ongoing basic. Looking forward to buffet system for sure.",
