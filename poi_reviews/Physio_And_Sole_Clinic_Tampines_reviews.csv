Joanna Chan,5,"I came here because of my hip joint pain.   My physiotherapist, Felicia, is fantastic.  She took time to assess my conditions in the first session, explained to me the issue & how to prevent it in the future.  Felicia helped me to relax the muscle in each session, I feel a lot better after each visit.   The exercises she taught me are very useful and I could see consistent improvement on my hip pain. After 5 sessions, together with practising the exercises, my pain is gone!

Apart from that, counter staff are very friendly, patient & quick to respond to chat.  Clinic is neat and clean, a very pleasant environment.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106683675844330020723/reviews
