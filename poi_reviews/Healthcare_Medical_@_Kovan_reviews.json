As I needed a referral to see a specialist, she helped to ensure that I am consulting the specialist which is a panel from the insurance company.\nThe receptionist is also very helpful and friendly. She has to call several specialist clinics to ensure I got the correct specialist and helped to get their add for me.\nThank you for the kindness and this truly helps the patient to ease some of the burden and worries.",
