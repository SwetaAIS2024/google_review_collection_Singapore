She was incredibly knowledgeable, patient, and attentive to my needs, making the entire process smooth and enjoyable. Her professionalism and warm demeanor truly stood out, ensuring I found exactly what I was looking for. She went above and beyond to provide excellent customer service, making me feel valued as a customer.

DR DAVY GOH,5,"The sales staff Lucy Mu was attentive and sweet to answer all my queries. Especially now, there is a Doraemon collaboration.
Good effort from her.

Location at level 1 of Paragon.
Quite spacious. Had 2 levels

Store design was as expected of a high end store. Well decorated and classy.

Bags, belts, ready to wear, shoes.
All look so nice. Just need the wallet to be fatter a bit, to buy.

Strongly recommended!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100178836333366849641/reviews
from Berlin,3,"Today the shop assistant at Gucci Paragon didnâ€™t appreciate the clients much. Instead she clearly demonstrated her less interest so we left slightly acidified. My recommendation to anyone interested in buying Gucci in Singapore is to go to the Gucci flagship store at Marina Bay Sands mall instead. Motivated staff, large selection and a bit of â€žthe extra mileâ€œ experience.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111976782510383613307/reviews

Anu Prasad,1,"Gucci store in Paragon Plaza is totally a waste of time, the staffs are not trained to be friendlyâ€¦ They are ALWAYS irritated and doesnâ€™t want to serve the  customers , very rude , very unfriendly sales  girl added to that a manager by name Afzal is also not serious enough to deal the matterðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
