      "text": "I dined at Bali Thai hoping for a proper Thai meal but left feeling disappointed. Their menu leans heavily towards Indonesian dishes, with only limited Thai options. To make things worse, the food was served cold, making it feel more like fast food than a proper dining experience. For the high prices, I expected much better quality and service. Unfortunately, it didn’t deliver on the authentic Thai dining experience I was craving, and it’s not a place I see myself returning to.",

We had pineapple rice and it came with sliced chinese sausage. Would be good if the outer skin of chinese sausage are peeled off.\nOn seevice, Staff are pleasant and friendly.\nNice environment with tables apart.",

The Tom Yum soup was a bit too light for me, and the fish was a bit too dry and hard to eat, but I liked the mango salad that came with the fish. Kang Kong and green curry was nice. The Red Ruby and mango sticky rice were below average.",
