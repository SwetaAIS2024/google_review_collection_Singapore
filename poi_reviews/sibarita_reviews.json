      "text": "We were looking forward to the meal due to the good reviews but were disappointed üòî\n\nFirstly, the restaurant seems short-staffed as the place was packed but with only one or two staff at the front, hence the food and drinks took awhile.\n\nSecondly, although I enjoyed the loaded nachos, the tacos were mid‚Ä¶ although the fried fish was great, the pulled pork was pretty tough and the tacos in general were super dry‚Ä¶ wished there were more sauces in the taco or provided at the table. The braised beef quesadilla ($16, not pictured) was alright.\n\nThere were 3 of us and we had 1 nachos, 2 sets of tacos, 1 quesadilla to share. We were still pretty hungry (but didn‚Äôt order more because we didn‚Äôt really enjoyed the food)  and paid $21.30 per pax, hence I felt that the cost was pretty steep.",

      "text": "Slightly disappointing considering the good reviews. The food is decent but it's quite pricey and the portion size is small.\nMy order for 3 items + a drink came up to ~$50 and i wasn't anywhere filled. Note 10% service charge applies.\nBarramundi taco was nicely done and the best of the 3.\nPulled pork quesadilla was lacking in taste which is unfortunate, since it looked like quite a bit of effort went into it.\nThe nachos looked sad when they came up cos they were around the same size as my hand - and my hands aren't huge. The salsa was nice though. Wish the portion was more generous.",

      "text": "Broccoli platter tastes like loklok (i mean i like it). The pork collar is a weeeeee bit tough, love their fries though. The colesalw veers towards the saltier taste The mushroom quesadilla was tooooo salty that day.\n\nThier crowning glory: the barramundi tacos. MUST try! Super tender and goes very well with the sauce.\nThis is my 2nd visit for their barramundi tacos. Would go back again to try their other foodsüëç",

Also had a shirley temple for $7. Everything tasted pretty authentic and the pasta was cooked al dente. Would definitely recommend for anyone with a craving!",
