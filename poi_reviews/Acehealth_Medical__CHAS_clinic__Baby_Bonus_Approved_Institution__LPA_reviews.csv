Lynnette Ng,5,"We are so glad to have Dr. Lin as our family doctor! He is sincere and genuinely cares for our family whenever we need medical attention. He also takes the effort to befriend our toddler, such that she is comfy to see him whenever she is unwell.

The nurses at the counter are friendly and an assuring presence as well. Thank you for caring for us! Highly recommended :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108811317327020290717/reviews
WanQian Chong,5,Acehealth Medical is the best clinic I have ever been to. Dr Lin as well as the front desk staffs are all very nice and knowledgable. Calls to the clinic were always well attended to. Clear instructions was always given on directions of medicines as well as tests done. Every visit was a hassle free experience. Another great point is the communication channel that was used - whatsapp to inform patients on more information and gov SMS on appointment reminders. Thank you.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105013021336317007464/reviews
