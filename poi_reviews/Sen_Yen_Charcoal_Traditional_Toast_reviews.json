      "text": "Kaya & butter toast is really good. Definitely lived up to the reviews. Kaya was flavorful and coconut-ish, butter was thick, toast was crispy on the skin yet soft on the main body. I think this texture is what makes it stand out from others like yakun, where the entire toast is dry and crispy. Entire set which comes with two soft boiled eggs and a teh C cost $4.90.\n\nStall is located in a coffee shop under a HDB beside the famous Sin Ming roti prata. Parking is pretty limited, a small hdb outdoor and indoor carpark just beside.",

      "text": "Service was not greatâ€¦ I went to counter to order and the auntie shoo-ed me off, and cos my Chinese was so bad I didnâ€™t quite understand her until a customer explained that for dine in, not allowed to order at counter. I was like ??? Okay fine, have to sit to order.\n\nSo I went to sit, and for at least 15-20 mins of VIGILANTLY trying to get the uncleâ€™s attention, nobody came to take my order (I already suspected this sitting down order thing wonâ€™t work for this busy kopitiam).\n\nEventually I still had to get up and go intercept the uncle, near the counter but not at the counter, to order.\n\nFood came quick, although eggs much later, by then my toast was cold. Eggs was good, toast was so so, milk tea was thin.\n\nI wonâ€™t wanna come back here to sit and stare for 20 mins just to place my order again. What a waste of time. If you do go, recommend you to just intercept the uncle near the counter but not at the counter ðŸ™„",

      "text": "Came here to experience the legendary charcoal kaya toast but left very disappointed. Toast was barely toasted and no charcoal smell or taste at all, just like normal bread with slight toast. Butter was very good but barely had any kaya to complement it. Ordered 4 slices with Kopi o kosong and Teh bing but did not know that eggs were to be ordered separately. Had to wait another 5 mins for eggs to be served while our kaya toast went cold. Eggs were also served half boiled when we wanted soft boiled. Requested for black sauce but was only given white or black soya sauce for eggs. Teh bing was standard but kopi was abit too acidic for my taste. Paid 9.70 for in total, which is a bit sad for this quality. Sad to say this was quite mid and i donâ€™t get the hype.\n\nTLDR: Ultimately, this was just simple kaya toast, nothing special and overpriced.",
