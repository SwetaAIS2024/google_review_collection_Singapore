C,4,"Kun Hai Shop, a growing Chinese supermarket with two outlets in Singapore, offers over 10,000 Chinese snacks, beverages, and pantry staples, both in-store and online via Shopee. The Clementi Mall outlet has a decent selection for its size at reasonable prices, including some hard-to-find items. Though the store is a bit packed and messy, it’s a convenient spot for affordable and authentic Chinese food products.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
