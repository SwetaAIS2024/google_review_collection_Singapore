      "text": "Pretty solid hotpot imo and Iâ€™d rate it higher than the likes of the popular chains outside. The only downside is the levy needed to get in. But if you are already inside, one of the best options! Solid ingredient choices and they even have other variety of dishes as well. We had the pork broth and Tom yum soup base which was tasty and blended well with the ingredients. Service is prompt and polite and the ambience is plush and oriental. I guess it helps if you have vouchers to redeem to get a free meal as well!",

Love their concept and love that I get to experience this inside the casino.\n\nPlus we also used the casino vouchers!\n\nWe had the individual hotpot and the build your own noodles. Paired that with some wines, voila ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹!",

I like soup base not too think and not seasoned. it's so good. I felt like home cooked style hot pot.(cozy eating place)",
