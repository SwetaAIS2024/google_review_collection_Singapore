Sharifah Aidah Alhabshie,5,"My son enjoyed his very first lesson. He didn‚Äôt cry and was very comfortable with Coach Kidd. It looked like he was able to follow certain instructions and really liked the lesson. After the class, he told me he loved the lesson. Good job Smile swimmers!

Elin Zul,5,"Awesome coaches, friendly, professional and very approachable.
Kids are comfortable with them. My 1st was w another company before this and i decided to swap and was surprised she improved drastically aft 2nd lesson (a technique she cldnt get right previously). Now she is steadily getting better.
Enrolled my 2nd kid soon after. N i dont regret, 2nd kid is enjoying himself n his water confidence is good now thanks to good coaches!
Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102380061558369929771/reviews

Widyawilis Selamat,5,"Coach Kidd and his team are great. My kids look forward to the weekly lessons very much. From fearing of not being able to float on their own, they can now swim independently with confidence, thanks to the coaches! Appreciate the good training from the weekly lessons!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109848464311620234213/reviews
