      "text": "Listed in an elusive part of lakeside, unless you're a nearby resident chances are you relied on online means to know of this place. At least I did.\n\nNot going to lie, was extremely excited with the generally high reviews and praises of \"best kway chap in the west\" shouts.\n\nOrdered the $5.50 braised set and $0.90 Kway (large). Portion was fair at best, almost leaning toward being slightly lesser than desired.\n\nFirst bite, I took a kway and ate it on its own. The texture was spot on. However, the kway itself was tasteless. I don't know how to fully explain it, but some stores have a slight nuanced taste of the kway which makes all the difference.\n\nWhen I tried the soup, I was impressed. The soup had the usual salty kway chap broth taste, and an added kick. This added points, I must say. They paired some deep fried onion bits, which well contrasted the soup. The soup immediately elevated the kway.\n\nAs for the meats, I must say standouts were the intestines and fatty pork. Tau pok was overly dry and I didnt like the texture. Same for the egg, a bit underwhelming. Other components were okay.\n\nChilli was average. Nothing game changing about it.\n\nI did enjoy the meal. The kway is distinctive in its taste with the soup, and a strong effort. However, the fickle performances of the other components makes this desirable, but nowhere near the top echelons in my opinion.\n\nWho knows? Maybe this is the best in the west - I don't know its kway chap compadres.\n\nBut I know for a fact North has a much better kway chap, and its even cheaper than this. But that's a gatekeepðŸ«¢",

The kway could be a little more silky but can consider to be very good level alr. Oh and donâ€™t forget the chili, provides a nice contrast to the saltiness with a sour kick! ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™",

The food is still good, and the flavors are comforting and familiar. However, Iâ€™ve noticed a slight drop in taste over the past few yearsâ€”itâ€™s not quite as rich or flavorful as it used to be.\n\nThat said, itâ€™s still one of the better kway chup spots around, and I appreciate the consistency theyâ€™ve managed to keep over the years. Itâ€™s a place Iâ€™d still recommend, especially for anyone looking for a nostalgic meal.",
