JANE ZHENG,5,"We are truly happy and grateful to have chosen ChildFirst@Hillview for our son. Although he has only been attending for a month, we already feel a strong connection with the school.

From the very first visit, we were impressed by the bright classrooms, safe and well-maintained facilities, and—most importantly—the warm smiles from every staff member. During the first week, I noticed that every teacher and staff member could call my son by name, which made us feel truly welcomed and cared for.

This is my son's first time in kindergarten. At first, he cried so much that he didn't want to go to school. But the teachers fully embraced his mood, talking gently to him, patiently comforting him, and even staying by his side throughout the nap. We really appreciate your concern, it means a lot to us. It is clear to us that the teachers here are not only professional, but really kind and compassionate.

We feel very fortunate to be part of the ChildFirst@Hillview family. Thank you for all the love and dedication you give to the children every day.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106384625574214009872/reviews

Olivia Leu,5,"We couldn’t be happier with our experience at ChildFirst Hillview! Our journey with the school began 2.5 years ago when we attended their open house. I first came to know about ChildFirst after seeing them featured on TV, which sparked my curiosity. I explored many preschools in my neighborhood, including some of the most renowned names in town, but ChildFirst stood out in every way.

From the open house itself, I was impressed by how organized and welcoming the school was. The admin team confirmed our visit in advance, and the form teacher personally showed me around, explaining their curriculum in detail, complete with textbooks. The teachers we met were warm, happy, and passionate. The robot interaction activity was such a fun and unique experience, and it left me confident that this was the right place for my son.

Fast forward to today, and I’m so glad we chose ChildFirst. The new campus at Hillview is stunning—spacious, clean, and futuristic in design. While the fees are slightly higher compared to some of the preschools, the exceptional quality of education and peace of mind they provide make it absolutely worth it. Unlike other brands that expand quickly, ChildFirst focuses on maintaining high standards, which is something we truly value.

The tri-language program is phenomenal. The AI-driven Chinese app is cutting-edge, identifying areas for improvement and reinforcing learning through repeated practice. It’s well-preparing my son for primary school. Coding was introduced in N2 (age 4), and it laid the foundation for his interest in robotics. The phonics program is also excellent—my son blends sounds fluently, and we’ve never felt the need to send him to any additional academic enrichment classes.

Beyond academics, ChildFirst places great emphasis on character building. My son has grown emotionally resilient and can manage his emotions much better now. The teachers are patient, caring, and truly invested in the children’s growth.

We owe so much to the wonderful team led by Ms. Patricia. Ms. Stephanie, Zhang Laoshi, Ms. Sharon, and Ms. Shiting have been nothing short of amazing. They’re approachable, warm, and genuinely care about the children and parents alike. Their constant communication and support have made all the difference.

The graduation ceremony held yesterday was a truly emotional moment for us. It was so beautifully organized and heartfelt that I couldn’t stop tearing up, especially as the children bid farewell to their teachers. It was clear that the teachers had poured so much time and effort into making it a memorable experience for everyone.

ChildFirst Hillview has exceeded all our expectations. It’s a school that focuses on quality education, character development, and creating a nurturing environment for children to thrive. We’re so grateful for the difference it’s made in our son’s life, and we highly recommend it to any family looking for a preschool that truly stands out.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103018690713653018846/reviews
