I felt like I barely got half of what I expected. Not worth the money at all. The pork trotter vinegar was practically just selling bones and cloves of garlic.",

The sesame oil chicken tasted nice not overpowering. Soup is on the sweet but prawns v fresh. Love the home cook taste. Yummy üòã",

      "text": "Ordered twice from Foodpanda. The food is great and portion is not consistent i guess. But i cant determine, as we only ordered twice. First time, the portion is big easily each dish fits 1-1.5 person. Second order , portion is smaller, fit 1 small eater. Both ordered for Lunch.\n\nWe have tried some of their main dishes and side dishes.\n\nMains :\nPig's Stomach Chicken Soup - Nice, perfect for cold weather. Comes with 1 drumstick and some pig's stomach. Portion wise just nice for 1 pax.\n\nSesame Oil Chicken - Nice, not too spicy and sesame oil smells so good ! Can try !\n\nHerbal Prawn - Prawn is fresh , soup is good ! Guess it's the same base as lala herbal soup, very refreshing ! But we are very thirsty after having this , not sure if it's the msg or not. But we will order this dish again too!\n\nVinegar Pig trotters - Portion is big and super yummy! It's not too sour , and pig trotters is fatty & meaty type. Comes with an egg.  Will order this again for sure !\n\nSide :\nChili Crab Bao - Deep Fried Bun with Chili Crab meat fillings , so-so , filling is little but tasty and spicy. Oily as it's deep fried.\nVeg Fritters - Woow , this is good. Will be better if we had it on the spot, as we order through delivery, it's alittle soggy. It's mini-sized , with a onion ring to shape it.\nVeg - Normal , can eat.",
