Jovan Evermann,1,"Not to recommend to go here. Better go to other swimming complexes, as stuff in Geylang East is unfriendly and behaves as if they were in a dictatorship. ""You are nog allowed to do this, don't do that.... "" regarding things nobody would and should normally care for at all.

Phoebe Peng,1,"If it’s called a “public” swimming pool it shall open for the public rather than for athletes training only during public “leisure time” like weekday evening and weekend. The public cannot go swimming for weekday evenings in the standard pool, although the residents have no other option nearby to go swimming. I cannot get it!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109376296062871438366/reviews
