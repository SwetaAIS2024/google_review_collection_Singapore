      "text": "Came back after a long absence, as it was a rainy cooling day, decided to come back for my fav curry chicken.\nAlas, was disappointed to learn that it is no longer on the menu!\nHad to go for the curry fish head instead today - which was fine but average.\nThe pork rib was ok, says the one who ordered it, average.\nAh... one less old favourite of mine...\n---\nCame by today for Coachman Inn and discovered it's been replaced by this restaurant.\nThe sea view is as fantastic as before of course. Food so far is OK, the hor fun has wok hei, and sweet and sour pork is tasty and slightly crispy on the outside - just the way we like it. The friend rice, however, has room for improvement - no wok hey. Will come back again to try the curry chicken next time and update my review if it is as good as Coachman Inn before it.",

The food was delicious, showcasing the chef's skill, and the staff's attentiveness only enhanced the dining experience.\n\nWithout a doubt, when I return to Singapore, Georges Changi will be at the top of my list. The combination of outstanding service, delicious cuisine, and a welcoming atmosphere makes it a must-visit destination.",

The band is lovely and engaging …the crew is super attentive and the last and the best is the food… Pork belly beats us to the edge …by the crispy and tender meat.  Will visit there and I will recommend to my friends - one place we should not miss it if you want to have fun ending week!  Thank you team",

      "text": "This venue used to be \"Coachman Inn\" and it has now been taken over by another owner. We came to try out the Reunion Lunch set. The food tastes good on the whole. Portion for most of the dishes are acceptable for our party of 6.\n\nHowever, we were rather shocked that the soup was only barely half a bowl. Either the bowl was too big or the soup portion was simply not enough to go round for 6 pax.\n\nWe also found it strange and somewhat amused that every one was served one piece of tang yuan (the glutinous rice ball) for the dessert and given one mandarin orange each.\n\nIt appears that the owner/chef apparently lacks knowledge of the Chinese tradition/ belief that good things come in a pair. Hence, the Chinese traditionally would gift in pair(s) and even red packets is gifted in even number.\n\nI would still visit for a meal on an ordinary day to try other dishes but not for festive set meals.",
