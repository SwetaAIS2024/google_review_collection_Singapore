I particularly like the Laksa and Satay, probably some of the better ones around in Sg. They serve pretty good western food too and I would recommend the chicken chop, burger as well as fish and chips. The staffs are all very friendly and they make an effort to remember the frequent members, which is a nice touch üëç.",

All three dishes mutton satay, salted egg bittergourd and fish curry were excellent. A great respite from the heat and newly renovated, truly living up to ‚ÄúLuxe‚Äù standards.",

We waited for some time before we got the menu and waited before someone managed to come take an order, albeit telling us that is isn't the one to take order usually as he is only a part timer but can help us if our order wasn't too much (as his colleague was busy).",

Awesome\nThis restaurant is quite comfortable sitting in for wine/beer and dinner with good friends or family due to its good deco and yummy dishes\nFrom the full-view windows, it has very wonderful view of water and golf courses. We like the wayue beef and curry chicken\nBut one thing to remind, this restaurant is only for members, for non members even can successfully reserve the table they still don't serve.... Saw some arguments at the entrance between guests and the waiters.",
