      "text": "Roland Restaurant: A Mixed Bag with Disappointing Chilli Crab (3.5/5 Stars)\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n‚Ä¢ Food: 3.5/5 (Crispy Baby Squids were excellent, Chilli Crab was disappointing, other dishes were satisfactory)\n\n‚Ä¢ Service: 4/5 (Lively atmosphere, efficient service)\n\n‚Ä¢ Value for Money: 3/5 (Pricey, but not entirely justified by the quality of the Chilli Crab)\n\nOverall: 3.5/5\n\nMy first visit to Roland Restaurant for a colleague's birthday celebration was a mixed bag. The lively atmosphere and efficient service were positive aspects. However, the much-anticipated Chilli Crab was disappointing; while the sauce was excellent, the crab meat itself lacked freshness and was a little mushy. This was a significant letdown considering the price and the dish's reputation. On the brighter side, the Crispy Baby Squids were exceptionally good, a highlight of the meal. The Home Made Beancurd with Spinach was just average. The other dishes - the Cereal Prawns and Assorted Seafood Fried Mee - were satisfactory. Overall, while the service and atmosphere were pleasant, the subpar Chilli Crab significantly impacted the dining experience, making it a pricey meal that didn't entirely live up to expectations. I would likely try other dishes on a return visit, but wouldn't necessarily recommend the Chilli Crab based on this experience.",

      "text": "Had a private room for a birthday event. As usual, food was good, some of the sauce/salt was a little heavy handed but is just typical of Chinese food.\n\nWould recommend the black pepper crab instead of the chilli crab as it isn‚Äôt spicy enough. My family enjoyed the USA duck but I‚Äôm not a big fan of the sauce.\n\nService was attentive but towards the end, they seemed to be clearing whatever they could, so felt quite rushed even though the cake wasn‚Äôt ready, hence one less star.\n\nBut in all, enjoyed ourselves.",

Get ready to get messy...the chilli crab was bursting with flavour and the gravy pairs well with the buns. Recommended if you want some authentic Singaporean Chili crab!",

      "text": "The restaurant serves consistently good food with attentive service. The chilli crab is a highlight - very rich, flavourful and well-executed. We also enjoyed the ice plant, cockles (very fresh), crispy baby squid, the pumpkin prawns with salted egg, and honey pork ribs. Desserts like orh nee and mango sago were satisfying too without being overly sweet. The boss is friendly and welcoming, and the staff were helpful in recommending dishes that suited our family‚Äôs preferences. The place is clean and well-kept, including the bathroom. Highly recommended for a satisfying, authentic mealüëçüèº",
