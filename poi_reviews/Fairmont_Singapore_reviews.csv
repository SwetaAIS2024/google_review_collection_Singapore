Dominic Anggit Pradana,5,"wow! what a gorgeous hotel with fantastic views of the marina. i think hotels on this side with marina view is infinitely better than staying at marina bay sands itself. well appointed, large rooms, plush bedding, stunning yet practical bathrooms. royal service always ready to help with whatever you need. only downside is a bit skimpy on storage space, but i’ll live. would love to return for sure",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117587404575537732553/reviews
R A,5,"gold lounge staff went above and beyond.. good service and hospitality.

the food in the lounge was nice but swissotel one is nicer.

my room was spacious and comfy. but its rather dim and the cabinet is too bulky (the water dispenser is inside that cabinet)",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107262834208550561408/reviews
Subhani Dharmasena,5,"My solo trip to Singapore was elevated by the Fairmont Singapore. Its prime location above City Hall MRT, with access to multiple train lines and Raffles City mall, was perfect. The Marina Bay View room was stunning, impeccably clean, and the bed incredibly comfortable. The spacious bathroom with a soaking tub was a treat. Staff were exceptionally welcoming and helpful, and early check-in was greatly appreciated. Check-in and check-out were seamless. For its location, luxury, and service, the Fairmont Singapore is the best hotel I've experienced in the city.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103055012614962345948/reviews
Jay Sabiry,5,"It was indeed an experience, we booked a gold Fairmont room, we got upgraded to the harbour view room and oh my God it was a really nice surprise and an amazing upgrade.
The whole experience from checking in till checking out was beyond my wildest dreams.
Staff members were so friendly and genuinely happy to lend a helping hand.
I can go on and on but it will not do this place justice.
I would like to thank everyone on their part to make our stay all that is special.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113407577867127008994/reviews
Michael Beavis,3,"Fairmont Singapore – A mixed experience with some highs and lows.

The staff were professional and courteous throughout our stay, though there was a noticeable lack of warmth compared to other hotels we've visited in our travels.

Our biggest issue was the room temperature—it was uncomfortably warm, and the air conditioning settings couldn’t be adjusted enough to make a real difference. Despite requesting assistance, the problem remained unresolved. The in-room fridge was also disappointing; unless you're purchasing hotel-stocked items, there's barely enough space to store anything else—just a slim 60mm slot at the bottom.

On the positive side, the view from our room was stunning, especially at night when the city lights up. The pool was a great place to unwind, though it’s worth timing your visit as it can get quite busy.

Location is a definite highlight—centrally placed with easy access to major attractions like the Merlion, Singapore Flyer, and War Memorial Park, plus a range of food and shopping options right downstairs at Raffles City.

Overall, a decent stay with some lovely features, but comfort concerns held us back from fully enjoying the experience. Probably a better fit for adults travelling without children.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110186708610602390803/reviews
