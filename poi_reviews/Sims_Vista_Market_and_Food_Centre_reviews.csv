Peter A. Knipp,4,"Sims Vista Market & Food Centre is one of these very traditional Food & Market Place , which is Quintessential Singapore as locals know & live it!

Plenty of choices of local varieties to suite everybody’s taste buds!

We managed to visit the Famous Sin-Kee chicken rice stall, but could have been enticed to visit many others, which we will do in The future!
I was informed through a mutual friend who loves her local food as much as I do that next trip to try the Green Chili Chicken Rice stall, run by a  Malay team! I promised to try it the next round when there! (The line as long as it was is always a good sign of it’s popularity)

A fairly clean place, with an offering that includes most local classics!

Attached some pictures of our recent visit!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110331631130058516070/reviews

Leville,5,A food centre catering mainly to the breakfast and lunch crowd. Been there a few times around 4pm and only a handful of stalls open. Heard the carrot cake is very good here but no chance to try it yet. Char kuay teow and Hokkien mee stall is open at 4pm though.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112553288126923768878/reviews
