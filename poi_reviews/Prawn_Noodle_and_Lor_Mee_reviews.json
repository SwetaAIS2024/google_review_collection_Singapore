      "text": "Tried both their prawn noodle and the loh mee. The prawn noodle is good but nothing to rave about. The loh mee on the other hand is definitely awesome!\n\nFirst of all the sauce is heavenly. It is not too thick and incredibly tasty. With such a wonderful sauce, it is very for the dish to do well. However, on top of the wonderful sauce, they have added abundance of wonderfully fried stuff. The fried meat is infused with a big spectrum of flavor. There are alot of other stuff but floating on top are 3 big pieces of super crispy fried wanton. This heavenly bowl will only set you back by $3.5! Wow! What a deal.\n\nThe next time I try this place, I will add extra those wonderful ingredients!",
