Ashley Liew,5,"Really wonderful first experience here at this flagship Mothership store at Harbourfront. Our first impression was, wow this place is huge! Really spacious with many offerings, nice for our active kid to explore too. The staff Mr Nong Chin Wei was absolutely helpful and professional, I’m glad we met him as we asked about a jogger we were really keen in. Grab payment option available too which allows instalments.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
Dennis Leong,5,"Need to seriously compliment Evy Loke of the store. As a first time parent, getting a car seat and stroller is confusing. She did a very detailed explanation of all the different functions and how it works. Comparing pros and cons for us. A very good insight of the products. Thank you! Indeed a good experience.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107764620525050061820/reviews
Mei Yee,5,"Was served by Mr Nong Chin Wei today. We were amazed by his service. He went the extra mile to explain different types of strollers, even though we did not purchase one that day! Great service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105049625351856521379/reviews
artz jonathan,2,Went for the recent mothercare sale. The crowd wasn’t so bad and the queue was quite fast too. But the cashier didn’t even know to charge for the items. Picked an item that states buy one get one free (also clearly states the lowest priced item is free). But she still insisted that I have to get the same brand. So where does the lowest priced item is free applies to?,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108456658258644851771/reviews
Jtyr,5,"Bought a baby car seat from the Harbourfront outlet today. It was a very pleasant experience! In particular, special thanks to Wei Jun for bringing the display child seat to our car to test the fitting and to demo. Appreciate your efforts and patience.

Also, thanks to Marlon for installing the car seat for us.

Overall, staff here are friendly and helpful.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101425197363916409857/reviews
