Being female doctor, there was also zero gentleness, scan was done so roughly, I cringed at her every movement, she also needed to put on and down her glasses, I wonder if she can really see clearly after all. Don’t be fooled by the Japanese name, thinking u are going to see a nice pleasant sweet female doctor, it’s NOT at all. Never judge a book by its cover, be very wise. I left feeling very insulted, traumatized and shocked by such behavior of a doctor.",

I received very patient care advice when I collected my medication and when its my usual review. It's a mainly Japanese clientele clinic so the service is top-notch, very discreet and gentle. Compared to my first delivery at a public hospital, Dr. Motoko and her team of staff nurses shows extreme care and finesse when conducting the regular checks, so I was never in discomfort or pain. Will definitely be back (if I am lucky to have #3!)",
