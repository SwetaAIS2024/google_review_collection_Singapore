I walked a long distance to several convenience stores along Duxton and Tanjung Pagar to look for cashcard with chip but none sold it.\n\nWhen I finally got to her store at Wallich Street, she helped called her colleagues from other nearby Cheers to check for the availability of the cashcard.\n\nShe really went above and beyond to help a stranger who was in dire need of help. It is difficult to find a kind soul nowadays. But found one in Cheers !\n\nThanks for your help.",
