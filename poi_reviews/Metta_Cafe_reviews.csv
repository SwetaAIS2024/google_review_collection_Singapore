Daniel Sin,3,An interesting place to dine for a vegetarian dish and is prepared by trainees. Ordered the olive fried rice and char kway teow and also came here to collect their eggless cookies. Their cookies are actually really good while the cooked dishes lack a bit of flavor.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112598854240446452449/reviews
Chris Tan,4,"Specially came here because it serves Vegetarian food and opens really early (7am)… and I wasn’t disappointed! They serve a myriad of vegetarian dishes, bakes and drinks. Tried the bread and vegetarian bee hoon, it is pretty good value for money. Only gripe is service only starts at 730am instead of 7am but you are welcomed to sit in and wait. It’s spacious, air conditioned and there’s a small gift shop stocked with products designed by the students & alumni.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103463791737805347871/reviews
Sandra,5,The cafe is open to public and serves delicious vegetarian food. The place is spacious and there are different corners selling baked goods and art pieces made by the students. Meaningful initiative that train the kids and raise funds for their programmes as well. They are now offering $25 Father's Day cookie gift sets and also have $5.80 vegetarian dumplings for the upcoming festival.,12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103115080435067308189/reviews
Buck Chwee Ng,5,"It is a very very nice paradise for vegetarian lovers! The entire place is air-conditioned, clean, neat and cosy and most importantly, without the strong kitchen smell that many air-conditioned restaurants possess. There is a wide range of wonderfully cooked and reasonably priced vegetarian food available.

Highly recommended!!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114204742067358508770/reviews
Yellow Bear,5,"Metta means Loving-Kindness (to all sentient beings), hence this cafe is selling no meat but vegan/ vegetarian food (without alliums).
Food is great with friendly service. Must try their vegan curry with crispy Prata, yummy.
You could also buy some vegan stuff there to donate to the Food Bank.
