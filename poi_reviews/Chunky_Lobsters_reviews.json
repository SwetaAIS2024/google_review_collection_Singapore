      "text": "Chunky Lobsters has relocated to the basement of Havelock 2, and has expanded their menu to include Japanese rice bowls on top of their signature lobster rolls. There are a few counter seats at this location and I understand they still do their lobster rolls via delivery, though you can get the lobster rolls for dining in if you give the owner heads up.\n\nI got their chicken teriyaki and beef rice bowl ($13.90). At this price, my expectations weren't high but it was a serviceable bowl of food. I thought the rice was quite nicely seasoned.",

      "text": "The lobster and scallop capellini pasta was slightly soft but well-separated. The lobster meat was a disappointment; it was a bit hard and lacked the flavor I expected on the other hand, the scallops, which were thick-cut, tasted incredibly fresh. Their tender texture added a delightful contrast to the pasta. The oysters were  fresh, not briny, and perfectly chilled. I was surprised to discover that the yuzu sauce, which I had to pay an additional 50 cents for, wasnâ€™t citrusy at all. I enjoyed the garlic clam dish, which was quite nice. The clams were tender and the garlic providing slight flavour",

I enjoyed the mentaiko lobster and the buttery toasted roll~ sadly one of the rolls was a little charred.\n\nOverall a satisfying meal but not that mindblowing ðŸ˜‚ the place is nicely decorated with some lobsters and rolls plushies but was really empty on Sunday 7pm.",

Their rolls are so delicious that will make you think if you want to order another one. ðŸ˜…  But I must say that it's a bit pricey and the roll is just good for one person and not for a large eater.\n\nThe truffle fries is just so-so. Maybe i'm still looking for more truffle taste.\n\nOverall, i will still give this restaurant a 5 star since their specialties really taste special and they have a good and fast service!",

Still as good as before (even tho the price is $24 now ðŸ¥²inflation is real). I topped up for the truffle fries ($4) which I thought was pretty decent. Overall I was satisfied with the meal and the price is actually quite reasonable as compared to other places offering lobster roll. Will be back again to try out the lobster pasta options on the menu!",
