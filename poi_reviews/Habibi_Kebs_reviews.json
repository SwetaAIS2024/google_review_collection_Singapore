The bread looks thick and dense but it was quite fluffy!\n\nConvenience level bumps it up to a 5 for me but not something I‚Äôd travel or queue for. Best of luck to the new proprietor!",

      "text": "Halal German style d√∂ner kebab - which is a flatbread stuffed with kebab and veggies, and a choice of sauce. Flatbread was EXCELLENT - fluffy with a tinge of sourdough taste. Tasty meats and fresh veggies - can‚Äôt ask for more. Also üíØfor the mini alfresco vibe. If you‚Äôre looking for a wrap, go for the Durum. There‚Äôs a gelato shop next door opening in April 2025 if you need a pick me up after a hearty kebab. Highly recommend the dark cacao and pistachio flavours. The mulberry sorbet was also refreshing.",

      "text": "Bismillahi Masya Allah.. good things must share especially when it‚Äôs halal. Had the Chicken Doner Kebab and it‚Äôs delightfully delicious. The bread is uniquely soft yet ‚Äúcrunchy‚Äù sourdough-like with  the filing so generous. The sauce is yummy with a tinge of all tastes, super flavourful. A must try especially if you are a fan of kebabs! If you are not, you will convert to one (like my daughter)! I‚Äôm not a fries fan but we love the fat yet crunchy fries too. And it just beside Masjid Kassim so after terawih, i ate 1 and im so glad to buy back too. It remained yummy for sahur too. I‚Äôm gonna get again next weekü§≠",
