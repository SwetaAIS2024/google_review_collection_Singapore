Josh Lim,5,Came across an ad from ewineasia with a masterclass. Was wondering if the 4 samples of wine will be fresh and still good by the time of the class. The wine samples got delivered a few hours before the class. The class was very informative and well executed (through zoom) and the wines was so good I had to buy 2 bottles. Signed up for their next class too!,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100606910212221946176/reviews

I really like discovering new ones  which is pretty easy with Ewine Asia as they deals with small vineries who treat their production with true love. We keep discovering gems to enjoy.
