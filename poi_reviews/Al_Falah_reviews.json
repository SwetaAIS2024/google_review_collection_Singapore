      "text": "My buddy and I cycled to the stall in Kopitiam Corner at Rivervale Plaza, and we decided to try out some dishes. I ordered a roti prata kosong and an egg bawang, while my buddy opted for the briyani chicken. The roti prata didn't quite live up to the crispy description in the Google reviews, but the fish curry was delicious. Overall, the roti prata was acceptable, but not outstanding. On the other hand, the briyani chicken was flavorful, especially when eaten hot. The tender and juicy chicken, along with the tasty acar, made for a satisfying meal.\n\nWhat stood out about the briyani chicken was the addition of a hard-boiled egg, a rare find in other stores. We requested a scoop of curry to be added to the briyani rice, and it enhanced the flavor beautifully. When the staff served us the briyani, we were fascinated to see that the mutton, chicken, and other ingredients were cooked together with the briyani rice. It was impressive to watch as he carefully selected the chicken for the briyani from the same pot, which we believe contributed to the flavorful taste of the dish.\n\nI recommend enjoying the briyani while it's hot, and if you're taking it home, a quick microwave will do the trick.\n\nIn terms of service, there were two staff members. The one making my prata was friendly and even smiled for a picture I took. His warm gesture added to the dining experience. However, the other staff member seemed less enthusiastic about working in the stall, which was a minor downside.\n\nOverall, apart from the slightly underwhelming roti prata, I believe the other dishes, especially the biryani, maintain a good standard. The unique addition of the hard-boiled egg and the flavorful curry, along with the cooking method of the mutton and chicken together with the rice, make it a worthwhile choice.",

But I find that their sauce can be improved.\n\nOverall really good food.\nBut they need to work on their hygiene a little.",
