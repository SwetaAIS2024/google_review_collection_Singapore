Pooh Hui,1,"Bought a bottle of rum and the bottle was put in a blue plastic bag. Step out and after 10 second, the bottle drop and break because the plastic bag got a hole underneath!  Went back to the shop and tell them their plastic bag is faulty. I need to pay for another bottle of rum. I am suey. The public should be vary when buying heavy item, who knows if they poke some hole in the plastic. Will never patronise this shop again, babi",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114023410046358191502/reviews
林昭扬,1,"There was one young Chinese female staff who was extremely rude when I declined to receive 5 cts change. Then I told her I decided not to buy the bread and asked for a refund, which was again declined. I will not patronise this shop even if there is a $100 incentive.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107612788435590848467/reviews
Darren Chang,1,"Had a very unpleasant experience trying to drop off some Ninjavan packages for pick up. Went in at 930am and there was 1 staff attending to 2 customers in queue. She then told me she is very busy now and cannot scan the packages I want to drop off, and told me to leave it at a corner so that she can scan later. I told her it is ok, and I can wait till she is less busy before attends to me. It is our company policy to witness the handing over and scan in of the packages as we had bad experience in the past when we lost packages when we did not see for ourselves the packages being scanned. Anyway the staff at Angel Supermart was extremely rude about it, tell me next time to come after 11am as morning is very busy. I thank her, and brought my packages to nearby 7-eleven instead. Will never return.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100919521566574972613/reviews

Basic maners la hor , people joke'joke and talk talk but the staff was not happy at all .

Kok Beng,5,"For a neighbourhood mini mart, angel supermart is Good, affordable, well lighted and has friendly staff. They also have a membership system. Generally it sells small items needed daily. Good to visit and buy dish washing soup, newspaper, cloth hanger, etc. Not a big fancy shop, it just what you need with affordable price",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109619546309906985004/reviews
