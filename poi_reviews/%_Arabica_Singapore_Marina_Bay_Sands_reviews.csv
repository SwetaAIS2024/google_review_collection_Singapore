Niteesh M.,5,"%Arabica offers a sleek, minimalist space perfect for coffee lovers. The Kyoto Latte stands out—smooth, rich, and beautifully crafted. Though pricey, the quality and ambiance justify the splurge. Ideal for those who appreciate well-balanced coffee in a calm, aesthetic setting. A must-try for design and caffeine enthusiasts alike.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110117796641376580021/reviews
Yun-Xuan Ang,4,"came in 3mins before opening and the lady curtly told me they aren't open yet as though to say i can only step in the store exactly at 1030. had to tell her i know that it's another 3mins before they open.

unnecessarily abrasive.

also strange opening hours for a coffee place. 1030AM misses a lot of the morning crowd and usually not a lot of people drink coffee after 5PM. granted they do sell soft-serve.

coffee is quite expensive but tastes nice.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115762093508503990962/reviews
Happy Bird,5,Fantastic speciality coffee offerings here as with all their branches. Nice looking store but lacking any form of seating so it's buy and go.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108716533290322327726/reviews
B W Y,5,Simple and good. Can only order ‘to go’ as there’s no dining area. Will get a cup from here when the queue is not too long :) I like that they have unsweetened matcha latte here.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109976438164397581664/reviews
