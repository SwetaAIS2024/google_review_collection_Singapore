The portion somehow seemed small and the sauce packed flavour. The potato rosti was slightly under cooked and over salted.\n\nNice place to sit and read etc.\nBut I wouldn't return for the food.",

      "text": "Great option to catch up on work - they have plugs at some tables and not too crowded, even during lunch time. If you go early, they have a breakfast promo before 11am on weekdays, where you can top up $3 for coffee when getting a breakfast item.\n\nThe skinny flat white was well balanced, but the pancakes with bacon and eggs fell flat. While the scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked, the pancakes were too dry. Portion size was great though, it was just right for one person, and priced decently too at $19.90 before gst.",

There‚Äôs a lot a few book shelves for you to pick a book while relaxing at the cafe. Stayed here for about 3 hours and managed to get work done. Staff were friendly and kind to help us top up water whenever. Will come again.",
