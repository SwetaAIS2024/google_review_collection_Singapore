Josephine H,5,"Hidden within Haw Par Villa is this gem for resting and enjoying some food and drinks.
We ended our trip to Haw Par Villa here as it was just nice for lunchtime. Ordered the crispy chicken burger which my son gobbled up. He claimed it was similar to that of fast food chains. I ordered a nacho cheese with salsa. Salsa was very tangy.
Don‚Äôt expect humongous serving portions for the reasonable prices. We even enjoyed a 20% discount when we showed our tickets to the Hell‚Äôs museum.
Nice jazzy music playing in the background, together with the chirping of birds and crickets‚Ä¶. Such a nice place to just chill! Love the vibe here. Will definitely visit this place again!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105371639539285097998/reviews
Pearl Han,4,"Overall, it was a soothing, calm, quiet, nice place.

The old eatery at The 6 Milestone was moved to Cafe 1937. It has aircon now, and there was a slight revamp. Menu has lesser variety but it has all the basic features and common food, snacks and drinks in it.‚ú®Ô∏è Adaptable, modern and easy for all age too. üëç",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116482705061804053073/reviews

Jordan Tan,5,"New menu with more varieties than before but still kinda limited.
I'm sure if the business is picking up, more varieties will pop up too.
Only tried the egg fried rice though.
Always like the ambiences since day 1.
Non air con but is windy as there are no walls.
Oh ya, they serve beer too...",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104688433473690872787/reviews
kenneth lee,5,"the cafe environment is very serene, chill with the occasional birds chirping as you eat there...first time here, will think this is a good place to be with nature and cool classic songs playing. tried the mushroom aglio olio and can accomodate alliums-free request. also had their iced coffee, big glass reasonably priced. it's ICED fyi, not hot under $5. chef & the brother at the counter are friendly. airy, spacious.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103710016712765139805/reviews
