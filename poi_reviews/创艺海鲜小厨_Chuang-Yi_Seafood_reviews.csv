Kelvin,5,"Brought my kids here to dine. Good alternative to the foodcourt opposite decathlon. Tried their Fried Sin Chew Bee Hoon (good wok hei and big portion). Ordered some of their other dishes and they are good as well. Minced pork tofu (gravy goes well with rice), sweet and sour pork (crispy and good bites), good portion of 青龙菜 as well etc and reasonable pricing:)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104898305272366081963/reviews
Sean Goh,4,"Checked out the zhichar stall at the newly refurbished coffeeshop opposite Chai Chee Decathlon. Chanced upon this stall yesterday while I was having the western food from the same coffeeshop. Came back here the following day to try. Stall wasn't busy, we were able to order immediately.

Ordered 3 dishes, sambal sweet potato leaves, hotplate beancurd and the pork ribs. We didn't had to wait long before our food is served. Food was not bad, personally like the beancurd dish the most, the gravy was nice and goes well with rice. The rest of the dish were fine but nothing extraordinary for me.

Overall the food was not bad, wouldn't mind coming back again to try their other dishes. Noticed that their menu also has items like bbq stingray etc.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Clo’s Laobu,4,"Only ordered 1 horfan with egg, Lala white beehoon. Cost $11.30
Dish was served very fast. Came around 5 mins or lesser. But be prepared service might not be up to standard totally. Good food bad service perhaps.
Horfan got the wok-hey taste, Lala beehoon has its savoury taste.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114142484779850595642/reviews
Poh Soh Lee,5,"Surprisingly good mee goreng from a neighbourhood zichar stall. Sweet, savoury and spicy… reminisced of my younger day’s favourite noodle!
Egg omelette was fluffy and tasty. Tried their other fried noodles like claypot noodles… average, not as good as the mee goreng.
Located in coffeeshop.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107301070285258783270/reviews
BM Yeo,4,"Dry Horfun and sin chow bee hoon are good, got wok hei. Hong Kong noodle is so-so, not much wok hei. Price is reasonable. Speedy service, from parking car to tapao to getting out of carpark, all within grace period, impressive. Staff may be a little disgruntled but not to the point of being abrasive. Will be back to try more dishes.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101710688726385526538/reviews
