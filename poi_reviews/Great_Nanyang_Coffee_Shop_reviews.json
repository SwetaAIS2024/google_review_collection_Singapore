Their ayam penyet is very delicious moreover the sambal just kicks in with rich and savoury taste ! Nasi ambeng is also the best ! Appetizing only by look but what more when u try and taste it on ur own :)\nNo words can describe how enjoyable, inviting & finger-licking their food are !\nToo many dishes to review on how it is moreish ðŸ˜‹ Come down to their store and give it a try ! It's really the best one for me !! Thank you Mom's Kitchen ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š",
