Dive Talking Lets Talk Diving,5,Be careful riding the Mandai Trail. It can be treacherous and slippery with sharp stones. Not for the inexperienced MTB rider.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115820149866263807656/reviews
Yew Kay Yan,5,"Easy trail which is mostly paved. Easy to walk with a few slopes.

Please keep left in single file when walking as the track is very narrow and shared with cyclists.

This PCN cuts through natural terrain, expect lots of mosquitoes and other biting insects.

There are no restrooms or water points on either end so plan wisely.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117168191281589507149/reviews
Simon Y,5,"A 7-8km moderate trail between Chestnut Nature Park Observation Tower and Mandai Road(starting point of Mandai T15 trail). This is the closest to 'walking in the woods' you can get here. Don't be put off by the seemingly nonstop up & down terrains(mountain bikers' favourite) throughout as they are mostly mild slope, only issue is that hikers & bikers share the same path for the most part. So advisable to trek in groups that the bikers could see you from far and adjust their speed accordingly.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110316451866688483932/reviews
Nope Thanks,5,"Part of the Gangsa track connecting to Chestnut Nature Park. Lots of big Durian trees overhead. Might be dangerous during the fruiting season.

The path after Mandai is loose rock and gravel, likely an eroded concrete road. Quite treacherous and hard on the feet.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114697604520200224046/reviews
Leonard Sudharta,5,"Hike it or bike it.... One of the longest nature path in Singapore. Connected all the way to bukit timah trail, passing thru chestnut park. Shared path between hiker and biker, havent had any bad encounter, both biker and hiker in these areas tend to be polite with head nodding and acknowledgement all around...",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117245129521844172128/reviews
