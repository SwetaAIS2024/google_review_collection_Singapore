Not overwhelming with the sauces and spices and just about the right amount. Food is a feast for the eyes and gut of course. The üê∑ head salted egg custard buns are a delight! special shout out to staff LanLan for being such a gracious host with her friendly and warm personality.",

The food quality is consistently great, just like other Canton outlets. Love the roasted meat. The staff were friendly and attentive, making the overall experience even better. Highly recommend! üëçüèº",

The bouncy but tender texture of the pork was delicious and the dish was infused with wok hei.\nThe fish maw soup was hearty. The stir fried carrot cake was well done.\nThe steamed pork ribs was hard and had more\nFats than meat.\nThe batter of the deep fried brinjal turned soggy too quickly.\nBut it is still worth a revisit to try more dishes.",
