Almost every where has been crusty lovely pastry with substantially strong delicious XXL sized ice coffee.\n\nThis time, the coffee was great as usual, but the tart was dry and no longer crusty, and the base was limp soft.\n\nI brought the plate of tart to the lady behind the counter and she held the plate and said it all like that, and shrugged her shoulders.\n\nI have never had that indifferent response from any staff of Kopi & Tarts before. And the Tarts ... product of the shop's namesake, didn't live up to itself.\n\nDisappointed. ‚òπÔ∏è",
