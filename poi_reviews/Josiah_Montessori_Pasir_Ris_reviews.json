The environment is lovely and Montessori style. Their teacher to kids ratio is better/ below ECDA guideline. There are special outdoor and festive programs monthly. Communication via Little Lives is daily. Baby is happy to go to school :) recommend!",

He is getting along well, the staff also continuously communicating via the app and giving some progress on their development. I love the fact they include more plays in their curriculum. Kids have time to go outside with in their premise and play sands and water. The studies are also balanced. Would recommend this for kids who are more into Montessori teaching and fun and plays.",

      "text": "My child has been attending Josiah Montessori in Pasir Ris. For working parents who struggled with a lot of initial guilt at sending our child to infant care, we have been so at ease with the level of professionalism, love and attention to detail that the teachers at Josiah give to caring for all the children. When you send your child to a second home, you want to be certain that you're sending them somewhere where they are taken care of well, with individual attention and loads of varied activities. And it is clear that Josiah's teachers do just that. The facilities are great, the location is accessible and the center is always welcoming. It's been a joy seeing not only my child grow and flourish, but all the other children there as well.",
