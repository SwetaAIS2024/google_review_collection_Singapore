Sahana Sengupta,5,"I started AZKEN for emath and amath in the earlier half of this 2024 based on a friends recommendation. Under Mr Lims guidance, I went from a C5 in Emath and C6 for Amath for secondary 3 end of year examinations, to an A1 in Emath and A2 in Amath for O levels. I attribute my great improvement to his teaching style which helped me first understand each topic, then allowed me to practice application of what i’ve learnt for that topic until I have thoroughly understood it. Mr Lin also gave me free extra lessons so I could catch up with previous topics, which was very generous and helpful of him. Joining AZKEN was likely one of the best decisions that I have made this year, and I am grateful to have had the pleasure of attending it.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117093087817744571477/reviews

callie lim,5,"I discovered Azken Centre through a fellow parent whose child also attends the math class. I enrolled my daughter, Yvette, in late May as she needed to strengthen her foundations. Mr Lim has been incredibly patient with her, focusing on her weaker areas and helping her build confidence in math. She's now able to assist her classmates and has shown significant improvement. Although Mr Lim is strict, his passion and commitment to ensuring his students understand the material are evident. Despite being intimidated by him, Yvette continues to attend his classes, indicating that she finds them valuable and beneficial. I am glad that we made the move to join Azken.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109095407466775519058/reviews
