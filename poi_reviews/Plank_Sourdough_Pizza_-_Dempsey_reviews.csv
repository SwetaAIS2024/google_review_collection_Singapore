Tony Khoo,1,The pizza bread was not crispy at all. The four cheese pizza lack taste and ingredients. Overpriced.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113447960630664185478/reviews
A V,4,"Good Pizzas.
We arrived on a rainy day and fortunately we booked before coming.
The pizza dough is delicious and I will try to follow their recipe from their book. It's a pity the kitchen is in a separate building otherwise the smell of the cooked bread or pizza would give people more appetite.

The service was lacking. We received the pizzas but no cutlery. I asked for the cutlery and the waiter gave a fork and a spoon... Hmmm ok, the spoon is part of the cutlery but do you use spoon to eat pizza in this restaurant? Finally after a couple of minutes I asked for a knife.

Another waiter asked us and the table near us if we had more orders. I think the waiters should just check in their system if there are more orders instead of disturbing the clients during their dinner. If they want to communicate with the customers, they can just ask what we think about their foods or if everything is alright, or if we need anything else.

Conclusion:
Good foods but lack of waiters with experience",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116768699501663000789/reviews
Rachel Luyi,2,"Visited this place after being highly recommended by 2 friends.

I was disappointed. Service is non existent and perhaps its more of a self-service kind of place. The dough of the pizza was not seasoned at all and lacked salt. One of the diner with me visited the place before and said the pizza looked and tasted different from the time she last visited. So perhaps we got a 'bad batch' of dough. The crackers served with the Burrata was hard as rocks but perhaps its supposed to be like that.
Hmm. That's alot of Perhaps.

Nice ambience outside, very romantic with fairy lights.

Will not revisit, there are many better places in Dempsey to eat and enjoy the ambience.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105345832861069223691/reviews
Stanley Ng,5,"Had the sourdough pizza. Love it! We had the Parma ham and rocket pizza, and the salmon and prawn pizza. The sourdough is chewy and the pizza is not too salty.

We were back for more. This time menu item 0: pepperoni pizza and item 11: Parma ham and rocket. Today was dog day out so the were some dogs socializing as well.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106349591126639156962/reviews
xris81,4,"We went there for dinner. Like anywhere in Dempsey, it is a bit of walk from the main bus stops but the atmosphere was good. It has a small playground outside the cafe. Good for family with young kids.

We orderded a few pizzas - pepperoni, Parma ham, seafood, pumpkin salad, garden salad, fries, and garlic bread. They were all so good. The pumpkin salad is surprisingly delicious. The pumpkins were sweet and were not mushy. The sourdough pizzas were thin crust and tasted wonderful. Definitely a place to return to (maybe at another more conveniently located outlet).",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100940735123182872655/reviews
