Regina Tan,5,"Had the best celebration at VUE! I loved the quiet atmosphere, and the view was amazing. Highly recommend the oysters, mushroom risotto and lamb rack üòã Special mention to the Smoke and Whisper cocktail - I loved the smoky and deep flavours of it

It was our first time, but Mikk was very welcoming and was eager to provide us with recommendations. He constantly checked in with us, making us feel comfortable throughout the meal.

The food was a highlight, but the immaculate service and lovely atmosphere was what made our experience there so memorable. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back here!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112033642553256246551/reviews
Tan Hui yi,5,"We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of food at Vue! We had the four course menu and were thrilled that we chose foie gras as it was the best dish of the night. Chef Jin Wei warmly shared his inspiration behind the dish and is proficient in his craft. We had a great time. Coupled with the enchanting view the restaurant has to offer, Vue has become one of our favourite places to dine at! Thank you for having us!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110870283800900214000/reviews
Claudine Tan,5,"Had my birthday dinner there and it was an absolute delight :) Not only was the ambience and view great, but we also had fantastic service from Syafiq, who patiently explained the menu to us and was attentive throughout, especially to my elderly grandma.

val!!!!!,5,"insane insane service by Mikk!!!!! üòçüòç food honestly was all so good but our top 3 would have to be the uni risotto, lamb risotto and wagyu! had a mini hiccup with the sequence of dishes in our course menu but mikk's service recovery was soooooooo impressive!!! also caught him going his rounds to catch up with other tables! really established a genuine connection with us and introduced the drinks in the bar that he created with a lot of passion and enthusiasm! really enjoyed speaking with him a lot! another wait staff at vue also noticed my linen napkin fell off my lap and before i picked it up, he already hurried over with a new one. superb team supporting one another! truly added to the experience here. thanks vue!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106092381788253074059/reviews
Marcus Tan,5,"we really enjoyed our dinner hereüôå

the foie gras dish was excellent. served with a stuffed zuchini, strawberry and chocolate soil, the balance of flavours and textures of the dish were absolutely amazing.

special shout out to head chef Jin Wei. besides being extremely talented in the kitchen, the service rendered and explanation given for the dishes he presented were indeed eye opening and interesting.

highly recommended for a special occasion!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100850907848946706892/reviews
