      "text": "For $5, good value for money with generous big chunks of tasty and fresh fried fish meat. The tender bitter gourd gives the delicious fish soup a nice kick and of course good healthy dietary fibre. The fragrant slightly sweet fried bean curd skin soaks up the flavorful stock and bursts with layers of flavor in the mouth. Definitely recommended for fried fish soup lovers.\n\nThe Teban Gardens hawker center is well ventilated and clean and HDB gantry carpark is plentiful.",

Especially after a period of deep-fried foods.\n\nYou can't miss the stall. Just look for the longest queue. Operated by a \"family\" crew,\" orders were promptly prepared and served with few words.",
