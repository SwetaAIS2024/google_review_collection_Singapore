TCH,3,"Tried their Mee Siam and Mee Rebus.  For the price of $3.50 each, I would say itâ€™s value for money in todays context.  However their taste wise can be improved further in my opinion.

Their gravy is not thick enough and a bit sweet for me too!

Ample parking in the carparks around here!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102467592239988127131/reviews
Vee Chin,1,"This is the most expensive halal food at Tampines Block 406. They use small containers for takeaway items like Mee Rebus, Lontong priced at $9.80.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108630386495615670864/reviews
Rinsenmon,1,"So nonsense. Bought a mee rebus and a lontong with 2 begadil for $11.50. Told them I don't want chill, and they tell me mee rebus no more boiled egg, can change to fried egg? I say ok, then end up went home and to discover the food covered in chilli and no egg. A $4.50 noodles with no egg lol I don't know what to say. And so obvious they charging Malay people much more cheaper. Saw a Malay girl buying 1 nasi lemak, 2 Kueh, 4 curry puff, 2 kway teow, only charge her $18. Like that do business one ah? Not gonna buy from here again.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117728210314679617985/reviews
LEE Thomas,2,"Today I had a plate of mee rebus which  is horrible. The yellow noodle is not cooked. The gravy is luke-warm. I am very disappointed as I was a regular customer.
Also lately the cost for all the items are over-priced.
The overall verdict...this is the stall I will not patronized again. This is a one-off experience for me.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112600871638505147886/reviews
