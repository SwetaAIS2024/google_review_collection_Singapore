Jonathan Lum,4,"It was the first time we had dim sum for lunch at this restaurant. Our highly recommended favourites were Har Gow, Salted Egg Buns, Century Egg Porridge and Fried Mango Prawn Rolls.

However, some of the items were pricey such as a small portion of Chinese Lettuce in Soya Sauce at RM12.00++ and 2 pieces of assorted Yong Tau Foo at RM6.30++. Furthermore, the Prawn Chee Cheong Fun Rolls were quite bland too.

We were surprised to see the dim sum being served in trays instead of being pushed around in a trolley.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104876861680092312539/reviews
Iva Lim,5,"Great food, good price and excellent service (special shout out to Jenny! She was super attentive and very friendly. ) We happened to walk by and saw the bustling customers inside and decided to give it a try. And now we found a new fav dim sum place at Eco Botantic! Dim sum is served like trolley style, but on trays.
Definitely will go back!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100228405423687108996/reviews
