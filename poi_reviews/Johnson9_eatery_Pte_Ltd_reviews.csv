Jmj Consultants,1,"Coffee servers either sitting down always. Notice that even though they were serving coffee or drinks, is always 1 hand 1 cup.
Even self service counter, slow slow slow, 3 to 4 fellows inside, queue long & none is bothered. Priorit should be given to those at self service counter reasons being that food that is ordered requires us to self collect example the laksa noodles fireball noodles & .....
Seems like the management may want to carry out a spot check on the blk 332 outlet",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110479025047515733691/reviews

Seren Po,1,"Always been a frequent customer of this coffeeshop . The service staff here has always been helpful and friendly.

However there is this  super rude old man at the counter who look like in his 70’s .

I show him the QR code of the drink and he reprimanded me saying that he must “scan” first then I can make payment for the QR code and asked whether I make payment at NTUC.

I told him NTUC payment is via paywave leh , using transaction machine …

Now is QR code leh , don’t need to wait ..

And he ask me to “diam”

So is he trying to pick a fight with the customer??

I m the customer and I have to see his face colour to make payment ???

If he is not happy then stay home la , don’t need to come out to make people blood boil.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110494377805539163707/reviews
