Payment went through, and email was received which stated delivery date and time being 5th April, Saturday, 655PM.\n\nCurrent time: 853PM (when im typing this review)\n\nThis is ridiculous. I’ve been on the hotline since 715PM (one hour after ordering) but no one was available to even pick up the phone call…\n\nThis is the longest time i’ve waited for a delivery. And no help was given. Website says if you want a refund, please call the hotline. I am still on the hotline hoping for a CSO to answer and refuns the transaction… Current time, 855PM, still no answer.\n\nSubmitted 2 feedback on their website, not too sure if anyone will even get back to me on that. Because i demanded for an explanation and feedback from them.\n\nPlease, if you would. Avoid at all cost. If you really want to eat pizza hut, just order it via grabfood. At least CS is a lot better than this pizza hut one.\n\nTime check: 857PM. Still waiting for an answer on the phone call. Ridiculous. Horrible CS.",
