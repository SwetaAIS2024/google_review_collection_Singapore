      "text": "I often have morning and afternoon walks in this park. It‚Äôs not crowded most of the time. Relatively clean except for the expected leaves that have fallen from trees. One round of walk around the park i think is only 250-260 meters so I think if I will go back to running soon, i might get bored easily. üòÖ I like how there are a lot of benches around it. So when I get tired walking (i just had surgery last week), I can easily find a spot to rest for a bit before going back to walking. It‚Äôs also quiet, i enjoy calling my mom while resting in one of the benches. Air is also fresh and cool. Background chirping of birds from the trees also adds on the relaxing vibe. Bonus points when there are cute doggos trotting around. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",

Probably its because I workout at 530 am.\n\nReccommend to bring the kiddos here in the morning (till about 1030) when the sun can be very bright after.\n\nAfternoon can come after 330 pm. Trees should provide decent shelter.\n\nReccommend to put on mosquito repellent. I do that for myself and my kiddo lah.",
