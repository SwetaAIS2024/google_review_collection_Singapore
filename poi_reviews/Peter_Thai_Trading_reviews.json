Patrons and stall owners are Thai, and walking past this shop really made me feel I transcended to Thailand for a brief moment.\n\nIt was a one-stop shop provisional store that sells dry and wet goods! There is even a fridge that sells tofu and fresh greens, too. Also, I saw a few instant noodle packets that I only saw in Bangkok here!",
