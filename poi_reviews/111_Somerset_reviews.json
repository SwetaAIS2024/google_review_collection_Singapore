I had the matcha strawberry and itâ€™s really good, much better than the other one I had at another place.\n\nAlso the matcha petite cake just looks so good. Iâ€™m usually not a huge fan of cakes and desserts as I find most of them being too sweet. But Hvala nailed the proportion perfectly and you canâ€™t stop eating bite after bite. Definitely must come and try if you are around the area.",

Great wine, great food ðŸ˜Š both of us had the set which included a wine together with a bowl of mussels and a mains (we got the crispy pork knuckles).  Nothing to nitpick really.  Service was great too! We were checked in often and our glasses were topped too ðŸ˜Š\n\nWill be back for sure!",
