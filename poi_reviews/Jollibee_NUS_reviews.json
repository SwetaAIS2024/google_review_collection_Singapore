When I reached back to my accomodation, I realised that 2 orders of fries and 1 jolly spaghetti were missing. Its very frustrating that a large part of the order is missing. There is also no contact number or email to liaise with to get a refund. Please advise on how to go about dealing with this matter. Thank you.",
