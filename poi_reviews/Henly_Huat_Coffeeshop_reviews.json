      "text": "The seafood zi char place in this coffee shop is a hidden gem - great service, pleasant owners and fantastic food.\n\nItâ€™s not a stretch to say that they have one of the best fried rice I have ever tasted! Sadly we have been informed that they will be moving to a new location (not yet confirmed) by the end of September 2022.\n\nFried rice is highly recommended with its affordable price tag yet generous portions. Do order their BBQ sambal seafood as complements as well. We expected the pomfret to be rubbery and dry due to it being grilled, but it was surprisingly soft and the accompanying sambal chilli packs a flavorful punch without being too overwhelmingly spicy.\n\nMy only regret is not discovering this place earlier. All the best to the owners!",

      "text": "Coffeeshop often crowded around lunchtime with many patronizing the mixed rice stall. Decided to try - picked the fried cabbage and the fried fish (dory)in  sauce with some curry sauce. Price came up to $2.80  which was decent to me so decided to add the omelette and my total is $3.60. Taste was pretty decent. The kopi-o thin I ordered was $1.10 and alittle bit thick but drinkable.",

Portion reasonable and taste good for the price.\n\nGood choice to beat inflation and some unscrupulous profiteers.\n\nWill come again to try the $3 wanton mee and $3 carrot cake.",
