Viv薇薇安,5,"Jing Si Books and Cafe offers a tranquil setting, perfect for relaxation, reading, or getting some work done. During my visit around 3 pm, I noticed they didn't provide a food menu, but they did offer a delightful surprise in the form of budget-friendly and delicious herb noodles.

The minimum expense per person here is the price of one drink, and they boast a diverse selection, including coffee, tea, and healthy beverages. The staff members are welcoming and friendly, enhancing the overall experience.

One thing to keep in mind is that seating is limited, so it's advisable to plan accordingly. My time spent at this place was truly enjoyable, and it made for a delightful evening.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113019870660151627817/reviews
Pin Lay Chi,5,"Nice place for cuppa and the moment you enter you can feel the peacefulness of the place. We only tried the tea - honey lemon tumeric and oolong tea (their house brand).

It is a refuge from hustle and bustle and the heat! Next door is a duck and fish porridge which I heard is not bad!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113737048321340891425/reviews
Esme,4,"A cosy cafe nestled among other shops! The environment was really nice. There was a lot of chatter but the noise level was still at a comfortable volume. We ordered 1 cup of tea, 1 cup of coffee, 2 small yam cakes and 2 bowls of noodles for $23 in total, which was very reasonable.

If you want to order the noodles and yam cakes, you'd have to ask the cashier or one of the other aunties for the menu. They don't have pictures of the herbal noodles but based on our experience of ordering 2 different types of herbal noodles, they tasted the same. The soup tasted quite different from the usual soups out there as it was like a mix of miso and soya sauce. Toppings included seaweed and vegetables.

I removed 1 star from my rating because I feel that it would be better for everyone to be made known that herbal noodles are served. I only found out as someone ordered it and the smell wafted over.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102765615752858514523/reviews
John a,5,"Peaceful and restful cafe to enjoy tea or coffee. Surrounded by book shelves, it's a bit like a small Buddhist reading room at the library that serves delicious beverages.  I felt the calm settle as I tried a hot Cinnamon coffee. A creamy latte style drink, a crisp but not overpowering cinnamon flavor mixed nicely throughout, was covered with thick foam, which also was gently cinnamon flavored. Served with four small finger cookies it was a really calming way to slow down from the rush of the day. Very friendly and kind staff.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115322239165769116221/reviews
