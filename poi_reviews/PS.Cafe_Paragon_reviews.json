      "text": "Beautiful Decor and Atmosphere\n\nHad lunch here with some friends on a weekday. Although it was not crowded in the beginning, it became pretty full halfway thru lunch.\n\nWhich was why the service was a bit hurried and sometimes food was served without the right cutlery. However, they were responsive when attention was needed.\n\nThe food was pretty decent. Quantity was generous and plating was good.\n\nWhat stood out in this place was the 6 star decor. It was not over lavish, just pretty inviting. Somehow it felt really nice to be in the restaurant. Kudos to whoever designed the place.",

It was a great rec cos it had just the right amount of tang. Delightful. Thanks Eric for the fab rec plus great service! You made the experience so lovely!",
