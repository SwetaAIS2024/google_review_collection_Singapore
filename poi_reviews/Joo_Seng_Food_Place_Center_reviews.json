I was sad to see them go but maybe there are new ones? I don't know, but the new design looks neat and convenient. I'm still excited to come back and eat here again.",

The chili was spicy and when mixed with the noodles, it gave another level of tastiness. The crispy cooked pork‚Äôs are everyone‚Äôs favourite. The dish was added with anchovies and some few vegetables which completed a well appetising meal.\nThe 2nd photo will tell you how I like the foods.. ha ha.",

Food is freshly made to order and comes with a side of mushroom soup as well for the promotion! $12.80 for everything (U.P. $18.50).\nReally like their whipped potato here although it would be nicer if it was hot like the proteins.",
