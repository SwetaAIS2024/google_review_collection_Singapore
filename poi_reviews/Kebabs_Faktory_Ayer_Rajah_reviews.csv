Ghizo Bk,1,"I usually don't write bad reviews when the food is average but this just tasted really really bad. 4 of us ordered different bowls and all of them were definitely not fresh, intense spoiled taste and had to throw it away.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108517803624854295228/reviews

Logan Chiam,3,Good Kebabs At Reasonable Price.  Their kebaba are tasty and serving is just nice for a quick lunch.  Price reasonable at around $10 considering its in a generally expensive location for food.  Service is fast.  A ton of seats but can be crowded during peak lunch hours.  The “food truck” style adds a lot of charm.  Would be better if the serving is be a bit bigger.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107382594263605332876/reviews
