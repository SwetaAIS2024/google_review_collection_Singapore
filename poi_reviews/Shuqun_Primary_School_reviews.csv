melissa,4,"as someone with a few years of experience in this school.I would like to say the girls toilet,please do tell them to flush yeah,especially when they're on their period thank you.
Okay let's talk abt actually,this school gave me great memories and i would like to thank friends and teachers,even if the teachers gave trauma,they did get me to come over my mistakes,they may be strict but just listen to what they want you to do,and they wont scold!
Something to touch of,please do be soft on us,we are trying our best,even if some of us are mischievous,we really are trying to help our friends to do the right thing,thank you shuqun.
