Christina loh,1,"Utterly appalling service and highly unprofessional.

I purchased a Botox package after being aggressively pushed by a hard-selling consultant Lily

Afterwards, I repeatedly attempted to make appointments to utilise my package, but to no avail.

They are extremely unaccommodating. Despite my efforts to accommodate them by adjusting my work shifts and personal schedule, it was still impossible to secure an appointment. The doctor in question is unbelievably irresponsible, concerned only with sales and her own convenience, showing no understanding of customer service.

It seems that BK Clinic has little or no regard for their patients' time and welfare, merely wanting us to part with our hard-earned money without fulfilling the agreement.

I have repeatedly reached out to them and provided options for dates and times but was eventually ignored. It seems I may be compelled to bring this matter to the relevant authorities.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115458964650606362544/reviews
Rolling,1,"I went to your clinic recently for treatment. Dr Chu and the young lady was very professional but not that consultant Lily and her big mouth please ask her shut up keep pressing me buy products not handle professionally. Even skin care going to expiry I saw expiry date and ask for discount she refused to give. Now I know why my friends no longer want to go BK
1. No price list
2. My friends told me one of your doctor told her 35units but lily asked doctor put 40units and charged $20/unit for 40units
3. Who like to be cheated by an unprofessional consultant",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102106531821660322133/reviews
Nurul Ashikin,2,"The treatment is good.
The doctor is highly skilled.
But the clinic assistant lily is  annoying,forever talking so much trying to hard sell with products and other services while cleaning the face and applying sunblock after the session. I wish she can just SHUT HER MOUTH UP! After a long day at work, I no need another talkative person during my treatment session.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117253336290748339742/reviews
Jing Lee,5,I came here for Picolaser and this is my third session with them. I used to have obvious freckles on my face and after first session the freckles are almost gone. Dr Lilin and the team are friendly and professional. There is also no hard selling and only advice providing according to my skin condition. Really satisfied with the result and service üëçüèª,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112517390004694555912/reviews
Firqin S,5,"I went for my first botox injection at BK aesthetic. Dr. Chen was incredibly professional and patient in helping calm my worries and to make me understand the process fully. The staff would also personally check in on my skin condition a week after treatment. I came back for a second round for touch ups, and the staff and Dr. Chen were incredibly patient and kind. Highly recommend BK Clinic and will definitely come back for future procedures!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112041062350396358366/reviews
