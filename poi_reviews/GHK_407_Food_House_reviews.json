Not only they have a large selection of different dishes to choose from, the dishes taste good and very reasonable pricing. You can tell this stall is good by the constant queue even till late night.\nDo note this coffeeshop tends to be quite crowded during dinner time, with lots of beer drinking uncles occupying quite a number of tables, so it may be hard to find available tables during peak timing.",

Ordered chee cheong fan, porridge, siew mai, century egg siew mai, har kaw, chicken feet as well as char siew bao and salted egg custard bao. The porridge, chee cheong fan and chicken feet really impressed while the buns were pretty good too. Prices were wallet friendly and the auntie at the stall was really friendly, even telling us not to buy too many buns for takeaway as they should be eaten within 2 days at most. Definitely returning again üëçüèª",
