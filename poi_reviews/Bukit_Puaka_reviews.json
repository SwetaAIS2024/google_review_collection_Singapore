      "text": "The views on this hill are great, and there are 2 smaller viewpoints on the way up. I actually think that the view from the 2nd lookout is nicer, you get an unblocked view of the quarry below. From the top, you get to see Singapore. The climb is not far, just be sure to wear proper shoes and use the ropes at the side if necessary. Most of the distance from the main jetty is covered by paved roads, which provides nice scenery as well. We found walking the whole way quite manageable. All in all a very enjoyable activity that you should consider when coming to Pulau Ubin, especially if you are not renting bicycles.",

I would not recommend this hike for the elderly.\nThe view at the top is awesome, overseeing the inner lake of the island, surrounded by palm trees. Don't miss it!",
