ng samuel,1,Ordered 2 packets of Si chap hor fun which cannot be found on the menu. Had to pay an extra $2.40. The taste of their hor fun is nowhere near what I eat from other places. Will not purchase from them again.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102811583584878137224/reviews
--,1,"The cashier was really rude yesterday (12/01/25). I ordered my food to go, and it was clearly ready. I politely asked if it was mine, and she told me to wait. She then went on to serve three other people in line, turned her back, and finally grabbed my food to hand it to me. Was it really that difficult to just give me my food first since it was already done and sitting there? The wait was completely unnecessary.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102937073224505029043/reviews
