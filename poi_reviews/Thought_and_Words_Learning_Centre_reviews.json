They not only impart the essential writing and comprehension skills to the students but most importantly nurture their love for the English language, which will stay with them for life. They have their own impressive concoction of teaching methods that allowed my daughter to achieve a remarkable 39/40 in her prelims composition! We are truly and sincerely grateful for the incredible support from Thought and Words throughout my daughter’s PSLE journey!",

Feedback was provided when needed and with their consistent effort she improved, finally achieving AL2 in her PSLE. Something I am sure we could not have done without their help.\nThe importance was inspiring a love for writing and instilling confidence in taking the English exams.\nThank you again",

The improvement was not just in composition but also other challenging components such as cloze and comprehension.\n\nThat first resulted in a Good Progress Award for English in P5 and then an AL1 for PSLE English!\n\nAs long as your child is willing to put in effort, he/she will find the right guidance at T&W and improve! Thank you Jacqueline & Geraldine!",

      "text": "Great lessons, hours always seem to fly right by when I’m learning at Thought & Words! Starting off with a few common english practises such as Synthesis and Cloze passages arouses my interest, and there are also interesting composition topics as well as great tips and creative storylines! The tales the teachers cook up are packed with twists and turns, as well as never-seen-before idioms, similes, metaphors and more!\nOverall, an amazing experience and I’m sure future students will always have a whale of a time at Thought & Words!\n- CK P6 Graduated Student from year 2024",
