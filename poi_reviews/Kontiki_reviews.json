The common bar food like chicken wings, fries etc are really good. Some of the main course menu items can be hit or miss but overall still a really nice place to be at for dinner when itâ€™s not too warm.",

So can stop by for a meal before continuing or end the walk here.\n\nThere is outdoor and indoor sitting. We opted for indoor. Very warm service staff who explains the menu when asked.\n\nI had the salmon and avocado sandwich and it was a good and hearty one.",
