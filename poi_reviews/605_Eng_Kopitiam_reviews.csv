Jonathan Koh,3,Comforting bowl of mee pok. Always add extra bean sprouts. Love that they have a separate bigger bowl of all the ingredients. For $4 i think it's value for money,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107711268993671943333/reviews

David Lim,4,"This coffee shop has the A&C Kway Chap, a minced pork noodle store, economic beeHoon, Muslim food and Indian food.

Seat places are very cramped here but the food choices and quality makes up for it.

Had the minced pork noodles today at the Yong Soon Noodle store. Theirs is a chilli base version instead of the usual vinegar type.
