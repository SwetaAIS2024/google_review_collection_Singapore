Melon Goh,1,"This is by far the WORST ONLINE RETURNS Outlets, (Park N Parcel and some other returns logistics) I have ever been to.

I came at about 10.30 am in the morning to return my online purchase but the old uncle say he doesn’t accept and must be wrapped and secured with plastic bag. So I went home and wrapped my online returns as he had instructed and taped them all over securely.

I returned again at 3 pm to do my returns but the uncle still didn’t want to accept. He said must use the ORIGINAL shipping plastic bag from the delivery!!! If don’t have, spend some money and go and BUY!  I said I already tore open the original shipment plastic bag and threw away already, how to reuse a torn original shipment plastic bag? He said then go and BUY!

He gave me black face and said what sort of lousy wrapping is this? Excuse me? I went home and took great care to wrap and scotch tape it tightly. How else did he expect me to wrap the parcels? He said can get torn easily and he don’t want to take responsibility. So… does this mean the shipment plastic bag won’t get torn, won’t get pressed on and won’t damage the goods inside?

He said he wanted to take a picture of my lousy wrapping as proof and not be held accountable if I don’t get my refund. Since he’s taking photo, I also whipped out my handphone to take as my own proof. He got upset and said “ Cannot take photo in my shop!” So he took my parcels and DUMPED them in his Returns Reject box outside his shop. Then he went in to take his phone again.

Meanwhile, I took video of my parcels and his shop as proof that I delivered my parcels properly. He got angry and said “you can only take picture of your parcels, you cannot take picture or video of my shop!!!! I want you to DELETE your video!! If not, I don’t want to return your parcels for you! I only earn a few cents from your returns, you not happy you go elsewhere!”

Well, why should I delete my video? I only took video of my parcels in his returns reject box and his shop front. So many people can take pictures of his shop front, so why can’t I?

So difficult to do a simple online shopping returns.

So I told him I’m NOT going to delete my video. And I am NOT going to return my parcels through him.

HOW TO TRUST this kind of old man to treat my parcels with care when he just dumped my parcels like that ????!!! My refund is at stake!

I have taken so much care to wrap and secure my return parcels as I wanted to get my refund. I don’t think I could have done any better. If being a returns/ collection point is making it SO HARD for customers to return parcels then STOP BEING A COLLECTION POINT FOR RETURNS!!! Ok?

UPDATE:

I managed to do my online shopping returns through Park N Parcel at Rivervale Plaza immediately after I left New Touch Bookstore. The Oppo Shop at Rivervale Plaza accepted my returns with no questions asked and the lady was so much more pleasant and courteous. I have return my online shopping through them twice before and I think I’ll continue using them in future.

I read earlier reviews of this New Touch Bookshop and found that I was not the only one to have such a nasty encounter with the nitpicking old uncle. Too bad I didn’t read the bad reviews of this shop earlier.

**RESPOND TO THE SHOP’S REPLY**

1) I DON’T have to WASTE 50 cents to BUY your polymailer bag. You are forcing Returns customer to SPEND extra money to buy your plastic bag to do returns. You are trying to push sales and earn more money.

I did my returns at Rivervale Plaza Oppo shop and had NO PROBLEM at all and no question asked.

2) Your have very HIGH STANDARDS of packing. You expect people to wrap the parcels according to your own standard. You are so nitpicky say my wrapping is lousy. You are the one who **started** saying you want to take video of my lousy packing as proof if I don’t get my refund.

But the other Returns shop at Rivervale Plaza never complain about my wrapping. I return 2 times before this time through them again, got no problem.

3) You know it yourself - you bully customers and scared other people take video?",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115374020860070932069/reviews
Danny Chan,1,"While attempting to return a package today, shop owner refused to accept and scan barcode despite me showing him in Black & White that handwritten label is acceptable by SPX Express. Wondering if shop owner is ill-informed or ignorant about the process.

stella wijayanti,4,"Reliable. Uncle is very patient. The quality of color printing may not the best, but decent for it's price. For last minute printing can come here as it's always open regularly & no need to Q. He can do ring binding too. We can choose the hard cover color for the backing.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115897784485291033679/reviews
Abdul Rashid,1,"This used to be my childhood place where I used to go to buy my stationery. But sadly, their service is not good at all. Old couple (the old aunty and uncle) couldn't manage the parcel. They can't even retrive my parcel and still asked me for lots of info. Where eventually I told them the info lol.

And there's another old heck (maybe their relative) also couldn't manage to find the parcel. He couldn't even listen properly when I try to tell him the PIN number.

This might be my last day of collecting the parcel.

Should name it as ""Old Touch Book & Stationery Station""",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108631499846515650500/reviews
