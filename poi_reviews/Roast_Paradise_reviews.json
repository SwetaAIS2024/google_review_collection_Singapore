It was literally just a chunk of fat,\nwith a thin layer of roast on top to mask it.\n\nOn top of that, the rice was undercooked today, which made the whole meal even worse.\n\nThis wasn’t the first time I had an unpleasant experience. The last time I bought their Roast Duck\n- it came with some loose pieces of tough, hard meat\n- the kind that seems like the stall wanted to discard,\nbut decided to serve to customers buying their more expensive set meals.\n\nToday was the last straw. I won't be eating from here again.",
