Christian Vent,5,"We absolutely love Playfacto East Coast!

My kids adore the center, and it's clear that the staff are proactive and incredibly supportive. The progress my children have made in their learning journey is remarkable, thanks to the tailored enrichment classes that have significantly improved their school assessments.

I'm thrilled to share that my son just received his first annual prize for outstanding achievement in mathematics after attending the enrichment class for three years. I highly recommend this school to any parent looking for a nurturing and effective learning environment!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100286365322930077860/reviews

Surin Lin,5,"Brandon goes to PFS EC and we signed him up for their Creative Maths & Robotics enrichment classes. I must say he enjoys his classes and the curriculum at Playfacto. His teachers are helpful and caring and provided much assurance to him too given that he is in P1 and just embarked on a new journey of formal education.

He loves the Creative Maths lessons and we have realised it has markedly improve his understanding of maths concepts and his interest in learning. *thumbs up*!

He always come home sharing with us on his learning in PFS and the friendship and interactions he has with his friends at the centre. This is heartwarming for us.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108786026892390794532/reviews
