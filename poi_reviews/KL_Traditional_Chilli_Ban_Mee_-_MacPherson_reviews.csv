Neo Zi Xin,4,"The taste of the ban mee here is quite good, especially when paired with their signature chili. If you're a chili lover, this place might just be your kind of heaven. One great thing is that you can customize the spice level by adding as much (or as little) chili as you like, perfect for those who enjoy a bit of control over their heat.

The portion size is on the smaller side, especially considering the price point. It might not be the most filling meal if you're really hungry. Another downside is the ventilation, since they also serve mookata, the space can get a little stuffy.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104140081558501135711/reviews
Lola L,3,"Chili ban mee is honestly average, nothing special. Warning: the chili is quite potent! However, they do their fried side dishes really well. The chicken, shrimp and sotong side dishes were all very tasty!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113679104726180207972/reviews
B B,5,Nice and clean restaurant… Reasonably priced and portion is actually quite sufficient. U can order their drinks at $5 unlimited free flow. Seafood Tom Yum is really yummy and natural to its taste with fresh ingredients. Great job!!!,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111138750414612149036/reviews
ng lipeng,4,"The ban mee is quite small portion, I’m not a heavy eater but still one portion if not enough for me. The soup will be nicer if they use the mani cai ( sayur manis) in it. The noodles should be dry ban mee, bt it’s quite soupy, don’t know why. Ordered ngoh hiang as the side, it’s decently ok. The sauce is nice though… the location of the place is not as convenient unless you have a car, carpark is also not as convenient. If you can’t get the spot at the road side for parallel parking, the nearest car park shown in Waze is at least 5-8 mins walk.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100924580553539539506/reviews
Benedict Soh,1,Ordered several times from this stall and everything was good. Ordered grabfood today and there was no egg in my noodles at all. The portion was little too. Your cost cutting measures just lost you a regular customer.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111928094224287558023/reviews
