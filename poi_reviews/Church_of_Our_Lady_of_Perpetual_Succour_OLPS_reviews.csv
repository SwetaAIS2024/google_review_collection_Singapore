sam wong,5,"""Our family has been attending Mass there for years. Most of the parishioners are friendly and welcoming. We always feel a sense of peace upon entering the church. The altar is beautifully designed and radiates a special energy.

Over the years, the church has undergone several improvements while still preserving its original charm. The place is clean and well-maintained, thanks to the dedication of volunteers, parishioners, and cleaners. A heartfelt thank you to all who contribute to keeping this sacred space so beautiful!""",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115340588800034643959/reviews

Ram Reyes,5,"It is my church now as I live nearby only. I love the ambience and also the choir singing hymns every mass. The homily as well is great so far from the two parish priests I came with. Fully air conditioned, and for sure, you can relax and pray here silently with no distraction. Photos are from inside view.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115690427466639954662/reviews
