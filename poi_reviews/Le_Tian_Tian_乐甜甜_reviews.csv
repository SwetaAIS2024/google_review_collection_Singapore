Pauline Wee,1,"Tried Le Le Tian at Bukit Timah for the first time via GrabFood after seeing their good ratings. Unfortunately, it didn’t quite live up to expectations. A few of the desserts were decent, but the main dishes we ordered were below average. I was hoping for something that would impress based on the reviews, but honestly, the food fell flat. Maybe it's better dining in, but for delivery, it just didn’t hit the mark.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113442208195765868656/reviews
S.Tan,2,"Disappointed with my experience at Le Tian Tian. The dry noodle dish served was different from what was shown on the menu, which was misleading. On top of that, the taste was bland and lacked the flavor I was expecting. The nasi lemak was similarly disappointing. There’s definitely room for improvement in terms of food quality.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111562369977749883730/reviews

F Tn,5,"Oni is absolutely delicious — I keep coming back for more!
Just a note to those leaving poor reviews: running a business is incredibly tough. These owners work more than 10 hours a day, every day. Harsh reviews can be so discouraging and unkind. Please show some understanding and kindness.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118347760220111040045/reviews
K,5,"I am amazed. Everything ordered here is delicious and taste home cooked. Seriously a gem.

Service is good and friendly. The male cashier/waiter makes it a point to remember you

Place is clean and comfy. They really clean your table well.

Recommend:
- Curry chicken with toast. 4 wings well cooked with curry flavour. Potatoes are the type that goes well with curry. Toasts 2 pieces are well toasted.
- rendang chicken nasi kunyit. Rendang chicken is full of flavour. Sambal is nice.
- soy sauce chicken. With rice. The sauce is really premium as it's name suggest. Top quality soy sauce is used.
- stewed pork beehoon. Loved the beehoon which is so fine. Goes well with the curry.
- mango sago pomelo is the best ever eaten.

Only drawback is they only have plastic fork and spoon, other than wooden chopsticks. Not so environmentally friendly.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109386738253826668143/reviews
