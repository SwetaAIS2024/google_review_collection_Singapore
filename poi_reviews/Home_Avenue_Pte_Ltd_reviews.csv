Benjamin Teoh,1,"Got my vinyl flooring from these guys 3+ years ago and it supposedly came with 10 years’  BC warranty. Everything was good, installation went well and all.

Now, it’s 3 years later and I need them to do something for me. I called the same number and it was COWAY; yes, the water filter company. It’s okay. The COWAY people were kind enough to give me the new contact number.

I called the contact number and someone picked up confirming that it’s Home Avenue. I told them about the vinyl floors and what I needed from them. They said, “oh, this is Home Avenue, but we only sell air conditioners now.”

I asked, “So… what does this mean? What about my 10 years warranty?” The lady said she will check and get back to me.

It’s been 2 weeks. I’ve sent multiple follow-up texts and made many calls that don’t get answered.

Yup, they ghosted me.
