Desmond Lim,4,"Very nice Lor Mee in CCK area. The braised pork belly is very fragrant and tender. The portion of the sliced ngor hiang given was quite big. To me, the most important part of Lor Mee is the Lor. The Lor is very thick and fragrant. I was abit skeptical at first because it looks lighter in colour compared to others. But I was wrong, it's highly fragrant esp after they put the garlic and black vinegar!

In my opinion, they win Tian Fa noodle house hands down.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102400484891733905614/reviews
Orange,2,"Portion is huge, ordered xiao wan mian at only $5. I personally donâ€™t like the noodles used here. Has got the weird taste. Soup is okay, many ingredients used, even has got wanton inside.

Long queue, and hot environment. May want to try their laksa the next time.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
George Teo,4,"At $4 a bowl, the quantity is huge. To me it's a hybrid between laksa n curry mee. For laksa, it lacks the depth n should have more dried shrimp. As for curry mee, it is too milky n thick. However, it would be nice to add some steam chicken to enhance the flavor as curry mee.
For the price n quantity, no one should complain.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116934309180688670454/reviews
Dee Cee (The Dead Cockroach),3,"Just a small coffee shop with one drinks stall, one noodle stall and one vegetarian stall.

Noodle stall is quite popular selling Fishball Noodle, laksa, lor mee, little bowl noodle and fish soup. Make payment at the drinks stall first before ordering at the noodle stall itself.

Vegetarian stall have vegetarian bee hoon and daily specials.

Both noodle and vegetarian stalls operate till after lunch hour.

Coffee stall open till around evening time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114499637556582554619/reviews
