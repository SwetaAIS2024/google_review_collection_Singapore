Daniel Chee,1,"Ordered a Butcher 9"" regular thin crust through FoodPanda. Pizza arrived cold, there was no ground beef topping, there was barely any salami, and the pizza was not even 8"" in size.

Nothing short of a scam.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111081667578912085529/reviews
FoodieDirectory,4,It’s your usual Sarpino’s but at a fantastic location. No need to worry about parking. Can call ahead and pick up easily. Pizza was tasty with substantial toppings.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114040935321134660301/reviews
Mark Robinson,1,"Wish I could comment on the food quality, but we never got that far. An HOUR after ordering (and paying) for delivery via Grab, Sarpino’s decided to just cancel the order. I knew they were due to close at 10:30pm, hence why I ordered at 9:30. If only the restaurant had the ability to plan that far ahead, and stop taking orders they cannot/have no intention of fulfilling.

Complete and utter rubbish!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101485905956873080290/reviews
