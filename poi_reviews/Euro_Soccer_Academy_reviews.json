It’s been an amazing first season and I’m so happy we signed up with Euro Soccer! I usually come to practice to observe and I love how all the coaches manage to balance serious practice with fun and being encouraging yet strict. Go Euro Soccer!!!",

The coaches know very little about soccer nor have experience ( none are European as the name suggests by the way) , they generally don’t pay attention to the kids during practice and the games are discouraging. Not a good level at all! There are other much better academies in Singapore.",
