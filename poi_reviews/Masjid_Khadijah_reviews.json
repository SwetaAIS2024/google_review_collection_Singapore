      "text": "Almost 100 years after the construction of Masjid Omar Kampong Melaka in 1820, Masjid Khadijah was established and fully constructed with a donation by Madam Khadijah Binte Mohamed, a philanthropist and trader, in 1915. The mosque was named after her once it opened its doors to the public in 1920.\n\nThe exterior was added in 1960 and it has stayed that day for as long as time passed. Today, this mosque still stands in its location with a major restoration being done in 2001 and the original exterior wall remained as it was. 500 people can congregate at any one time. There is an annex auditorium for any religious seminars or events.\n\nIt is also home to the Religious Reformation Group (RRG) which serves as a venue of rehabilitation and reformation for those radicalized and self-radicalized Islamic individuals to re-correct and reconnect to the true Islamic values of peace and harmony. There is their Majulah Gallery at Level 4 of their concourse building and their Resource and Counselling Rooms are located inside Ustaz Ali Haji Mohamad Auditorium",

It provides some respite from the hustle & bustle of the surroundings, the interiors are so unlike Iâ€™ve seen in other mosques. The architecture is very dated & rustic and I would really considering coming here again in spite of the fact I donâ€™t leave in the East.",
