Ivy Abella,1,"Dear Guardian,
I just want to get your attention regarding your staff named Jenny who is on duty on this day (13/11/23 ) at this very hour on Simei Eastpoint.  Who is quite rude on attending customer.
As she holding the scanner for the product, she is having some attitude on talking to customer.
There is a promotion on the vitamins I bought which I misheard that buy1 get 1, which is buy 2 get 1. She seems not quite happy, and get the bottle that I did not buy, like stomping on the table. And rushing to scan the products I bought.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105954755382168385032/reviews
