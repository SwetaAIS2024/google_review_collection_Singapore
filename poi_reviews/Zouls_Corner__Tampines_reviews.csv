RCSC,5,"Ordered via foodpanda and ate 1 hour after delivery. Food was still warm. Although chicken lost its crispiness as expected, I was surprised by the portion!! Chicken leg was huge and rice given was a lot. Chili from their signature set was really good. Personally preferred the white rice over the nasi goreng. I could taste that the white rice was cooked with chicken so it was very flavourful; not plain white rice! The tahu goreng was good for sharing too.

As for the mee hoon goreng, it was cooked malay style (duh) so it was like dry mee siam. Portion was so generous, I think can feed 2 adults!

Cannot believe I only tried this now! Will order again!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101381356185028377091/reviews
Rozita Ahmad,5,"Iâ€™ve tried Ayam Penyet at quite a few places, but this one really stood out. The chicken was perfectly crispy yet still juicy inside, exactly how I like it. What really impressed me was the sambal, it had that fiery kick and depth of flavour that made the whole dish come alive. You can tell they put care into every plate. Definitely coming back for more!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108770969038031154208/reviews
Eunice Pang Zhi Yi,4,"Ayam penyet came with chicken rice rice which made it even better. The meat is well-marinated and the sambal adds the perfect sweet and spicy kick.
Cheese fries were loaded with sauce, jelak towards the end, but great for sharing.
Fast service located in a quiet corner, perfect for dinner in a big group.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105474419704405342817/reviews
Young Gunnar,1,"Patronising this place both as a consumer and delivery partner has been an utter nightmare. the restaurant takes absolutely forever to prepare their food and this has been the case for years. for delivery riders, take note customer walk ins take priority over yours.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103578091996298538229/reviews
