Edwin Lim,5,"Having been attended by Dr. Robyn Hay first at Bridgepoint Health Everton and was left a good impression of her compassionate and helpful attitude as a doctor from a patient's viewpoint, as I was coughing and in need of more medicine, I booked an online appointment with Dr. Robyn Hay last night for Thursday, 17 April 2025, from 11 AM to 11.15 AM. I highly recommend others to Dr. Robyn Hay.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106154446512703154008/reviews

Zoltán Török,5,"We visited this place because my girlfriend had developed a little flu on the way to Singapore. We could walk in without an appointment and the doctor seeing us was the kindest and most  caring doctor we've ever met. It is the friendliest medical office we've ever been to.
Also her prices were very fair and as an added bonus they have an onsite pharmacy so we could get all the needed medicine right there.
We wish them all the best in the future!
Very highly recommended!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106680942851618653794/reviews
