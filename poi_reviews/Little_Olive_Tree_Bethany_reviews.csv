Insolen,5,"My 2 boys have attended this school and they love it. The older one has graduated to primary school and the younger one is still there.
My older son has attained a solid foundation in his core subjects thanks to the dedication by his teachers in this school. Special shout out to 王老师 and Mrs Koh for their guidance.
My younger son is also thriving in this school.
The teachers are dedicated, passionate and caring. The environment is conducive to learning, and a loving one too.
On special occasions, there are celebrations conducted and the communal spirit is strong.
Strongly recommend this school.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104070702719141299970/reviews

Cherrian Chu,5,"We absolutely love BPCDC and so do my children. It has a very homey feeling and the child to teacher ratio is great. Our 3 kids had the whole wonderful experiences from PG to 6 year-old kinder. Amazing staff with so much heart and caring mindset. We love the veggie and herbs garden. We love the sustainability ideas introduced to the children since young. It not only helps the children understand the concept of food and learn about the process of farm to plate through growing their own vegetables but also train them eat green as well! From amazing chef, Aunty Tan/ Aunty Wen, Janitor, Aunty Ping to Educators-Teacher Cel,  Mrs Koh, Lim lao shi(Michelle), Teacher Jane, Hong En lao shi, Teacher Adeline, Ai Ling lao shi, Chen Lao Shi, Mrs Tan and other newly joined educators to Principal, Ms Sim, thank you for keeping our children safe, well-fed, happily entertained, loved and cared for throughout their early childhood education at BPCDC! Highly recommended!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117710337308526483267/reviews
