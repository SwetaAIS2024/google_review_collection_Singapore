Calvin Chin,5,"Very enjoyable and reasonably priced grilled  chicken chop. Came with a nice pepper sauce. Consistent standard and this is probably my fifth order.

Service minus one star cos they forgot I wanted coleslaw instead of fries but it's OK.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106748038567438417344/reviews
Eugene Low,1,"Wanted to order a chicken chop and fried rice with breaded fish, but the cashier only entered the chicken chop. When we asked to add the fried rice, the cashier couldn't find the option and said it was fine. We waited a long time for our food, and they only prepared the fried rice. The fried rice was also bland.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116983740569885667573/reviews
