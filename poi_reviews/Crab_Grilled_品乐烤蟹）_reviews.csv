Chiun How Teng,5,"Excellent crab. Nicely prepared. Friendly uncle also shared he provides three types of sauce:

Japanese Wasabi
Japanese Soya sauce
Mayonnaise

It's been in operations for about one month. Do come and support.üòÄ",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110173267101233175211/reviews
Eugene Ng,4,"Crabs here are cooked and chilled already so you can have cold crab on the spot. But try their grilled crab with the stallholder‚Äôs own special black pepper sauce which he lathers on the exterior of the crab before it‚Äôs grilled over charcoal. Dipping sauces include a mean sambal belacan, mayonnaise and wasabi in soya sauce.
Only downside to this place is the prevalence of flies when we were dining. Perhaps sitting further away from the tray retrieval rack may help.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109953789831620496583/reviews
