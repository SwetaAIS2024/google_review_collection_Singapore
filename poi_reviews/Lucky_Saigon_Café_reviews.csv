Joel Tan,4,"Interesting nature theme Vietnamese restaurant well hidden in Tanglin.
Misty entrance to welcome you.
Pet friendly, sheltered outdoors, with high ceiling fans. Might get warm if itâ€™s hot weather so dress lightly.
Food is not bad, with quite an extensive range of drinks.
There is a high pitch sound that is at the background. Those with sensitive ears might find it disturbing.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106082472909570506113/reviews
Eve C,3,"A hidden away cafe. I like the place for the unique experience it offers but it was unpleasant because firstly there was a constant high pitch noisy which we feedback but staff didn't know how to solve, secondly while it is excited to have peacock and chicken in cages, the smell was overwhelmingly strong. When I reached the entrance I could smell it. Even though the smell wasn't at the dining area, it is still an unpleasant experience to smell it on entry.

We like the fried fish ordered and the ability to wrap fresh spring roll sheet with veg to eat it. Quite nice.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109756518746414930822/reviews
Snoop Ee,5,"Had a lovely lunch here. Portions were big. Ordered the beef brisket pho. Beef was a bit tough, but the soup tasted delicious. Chef's recommendation of Crispy Chix rice was nice. Fried chicken was flavouful. Ordered lemongrass and tamarind drinks, too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117540808388622978655/reviews
Trancemaster,3,"This Vietnamese restaurant nestled in a compound off quiet Tanglin Road that also housed a plant nursery and Salvation Army Collection Centre.
The Place
It looks like an ornamental plants sale room, with pots of hanging plants, complete with fake stream, wooden fences and a wooden bridge.  The alfresco restaurant also try to give a rural vibe - walked behind it, you will chance upon a hugh cage housing some chicken, a turkey and some birds. There is also a fish pond.
The Food
Crab Soup - tasted quite savoury with bits of crab meat, but lacking in robustness.
Dry Seafood Glass Noodles - the noodle was rather too 'al-dente' for me, and lacking in flavour. The beef pho I have tried on a previous visit was better, but also not outstanding.
The Verdict
Visit the place for the experience (if you like an artificial countryside vide, and need a quiet place to chill), but not for the food.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104265010884666368627/reviews
jesuis_jasper,5,"This Vietnamese restaurant on Tanglin Road is worth visiting. Decent food, friendly staff, and very clean. There are game boards available while waiting for your food to be served. The backyard is as beautiful as the front garden. It was a wonderful experience!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100718032535637801685/reviews
