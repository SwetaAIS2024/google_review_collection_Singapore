Service staff was top notch as they kept checking back on my table and were all very friendly!\n\nWill definitely come back again if Iâ€™m near the area & hopefully it would not be too crowded!",

We had beautiful staff looking after us and the atmosphere was lovely. Can recommend the chicken wings and nachos for eating. 500ml of Tiger beer went down well after lots of walking and Prosecco was equally refreshing. A must visit place.",
