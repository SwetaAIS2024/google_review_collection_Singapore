Siah Hx,3,"Overall dissapointing visit to this outlet.  The place is too warm on a sunny day! A pint of beer literally turns warm in a while. The place is quite run down.

Service provided by staff isn't fantastic either, the indian lady staff kept trying to sell food items to customers - turned off! And her handling of food when serving customers lack professionalism as well.

Food isn't tasty and not cheap, given the small portion.

Carpark available on site at a fee, but limited though. Washroom available on site.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103944670556353820143/reviews
Michael Yap,5,"The restaurant offers a pleasant ambiance, and the food was delightful. I requested a White Russian, which was not listed on the menu, and the staff graciously accommodated my request. Despite not being a standard offering, the drink was expertly crafted and tasted perfect. Kudos to the team for their excellent service and attention to detail!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107559329039380199446/reviews
Conway Teo,1,"I recently visited this place and had a mixed experience. On the positive side, the food was nice, we enjoyed it. However, the service left a lot to be desired. All the time we waited for so long to get our drinks, so when one person was drinking, the other one was waiting for so long to have their order. And even we reminded several times if that could be done faster it still took time with their bartender standing around talking. It's understandable when there are a lot of people, but when we only came we were only one there. Overall, I am not thinking to coming one more time to that exact location but maybe other locations, hoping other outlet service will be better.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112106291011987756160/reviews
HyperNinjaNerd,4,"Second visit, this time on a Friday. Ordered the fried food platter and it was scrumptious. Beer and red wine at reasonable prices. The spacious alfresco style restaurant is not overly crowded on a Friday evening so staff was quite attentive. Good place to chill out! There's an area in the restaurant that is pet friendly. Would patronise again!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106136280825794360945/reviews
GA YA,3,We went there after swimming with our doggies. This Al Capone is pet friendly üëçüèª it was lunch time and perhaps therefore very understaffed. One very overwhelmed single waitress that made a few errors in our orders and we received our dishes one by one because as she explained there was just one person in the kitchen cooking. Not sure how the place is for dinner. It is quite large so hopefully with more staff üëçüèª,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107030149869065027484/reviews
