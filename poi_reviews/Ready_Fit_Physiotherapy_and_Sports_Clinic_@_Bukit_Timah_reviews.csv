Priya Rath,1,"I went in with a knee issue and unfortunately the physiotherapists are more interested in deploying expensive treatments like Winback and dry needling instead of diagnosing the root cause.
I found a better physiotherapist that charges half the amount this clinic charges.
My only regret is that I didnâ€™t switch clinics earlier and spent $530 for 2 sessions.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116740117977157729393/reviews

Cherise L,5,"I was experiencing bad back ache as a result of bad posture at work and a friend recommended this clinic. My sessions with Daryl were fantastic and alleviated my neck/back aches. The heat therapy provided instant relief and I was happy that I learnt several techniques to manage my backache with targeted exercises and lifestyle change. Initially I was worried that the aches and pains would affect my performance at work but nowadays I am able to work much better.
It was my first time visiting a physiotherapist and I did not know what to expect, but Daryl is friendly and able to put one at ease. The clinic is very well equipped with high tech equipment tooðŸ˜Š 10/10 would recommend!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114378368687153191039/reviews
