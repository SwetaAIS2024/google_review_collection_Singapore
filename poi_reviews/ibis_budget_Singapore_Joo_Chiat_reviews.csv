Culaya,4,"For me, the check-in experience at this hotel was good. The location is convenient—close to Geylang and shops like 7-Eleven. However, if you're driving, please note that on-site parking is very limited.

I would like to suggest that the front desk staff be more friendly and approachable when dealing with guests. When I checked in, two male staff members appeared very serious and didn’t smile. Interestingly, I noticed they were much friendlier to a foreign guest. As a fellow Malaysian speaking the same language, I felt a bit confused and disappointed. All guests, regardless of background, should be treated equally and warmly.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100532103759447768482/reviews
marathon42,5,"This is in a historic part of Singapore. Many greats cafes, bars, and general businesses of old Singaporean life in the area. Buses to town and Sentosa near by.
Halfway between the airport and the city.
Room was clean, tidy and well serviced.
We will book again, but get a room with a window as it is too easy to sleep late otherwise :)",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101860623232372054939/reviews
Casey,5,"Just under a day layover in Singapore and this was a great budget option to have a walk, eat some local food and get some quiet peaceful rest. Very calm and quiet area, no outside noise from our room.

Had someone on the desk to check us in even though we arrived really late/were delayed until 4AM

Rooms were comfortable, nice firm mattress and soft sheets, hot water and the best water pressure (may have been because we showered at 4am). Drinking water tap, TV with a few channels, very dark when curtains closed so great for sleeping. (Sorry bed pictured is not made as we went straight to sleep on arrival)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103547899356634829831/reviews
Journey Inside And Out,5,"Ibis has a great location and a very clean room with reasonable prices in the city. Thanks for letting us store our luggage while we went to Malaysia for a few days. Great service! Thanks, Sya, for your help.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113213164263661277415/reviews
Xoom Too,5,"I got a room with a single twin bed and a queen bed for 4 nights and the room was quite comfortable, had a nice desk area, nice area to keep the bags, all the necessary items like shampoo, toothbrushes, toothpaste, etc. Just that the bathroom was a bit small so the floor in the shower and out the shower would get wet easily.

The location is farther from the city center but there are still a plenty of good restaurants, transportation, and things to do here, just a bit different is all. Room service was efficent as well. We were also able to get 3 room keys which I know doesn’t always happen. I think the hotel is a great place to stay at for a cheaper room and if you’re only here for a couple days.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105863133358477079886/reviews
