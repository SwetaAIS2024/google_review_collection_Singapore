The truffle cheese was also good too.\nThe tuna sandwich came with side salad and the sandwich was made with croissant.\nCoffee is ok, general standard.\nItâ€™s happy to meet an old friend there and she reminds my favorite bread ðŸ¥– ðŸ˜‚\nAll is good will be back.",

      "text": "I came here seeking some good French food and they did not disappoint.\n\nFood: 5/5 - I opted for their set menu lunch special. You can start with soup or Caesar salad. I chose the salmon chowder which was delicious. For an extra $3 you can choose a dessert but I was too full. There are 3 choices for the main course ranging from meat to vegetarian. I had the chicken with pasta cream sauce. A good serving size at a great value. The set menu also came with an iced lemon tea. If you donâ€™t want to dine in, thereâ€™s a section of takeout sandwiches, cakes, pastries, and desserts.\nService: 3/5 - the service could be improved as I had to call the server to bring my check\nAtmosphere: 5/5 - the beautiful interior of the restaurant made up for the lack of service. Thereâ€™s a nice vibe to the place.\n\nI will come here again.",

      "text": "Paul Bakery at Tanglin Mall boasts a bustling and inviting atmosphere, complete with the delightful aroma of freshly baked goods and the comforting fragrance of coffee. Upon entering, one is immediately drawn in by the vibrant energy and warmth of the establishment.\n\nHowever, the service left something to be desired. The staff seemed overwhelmed by the crowd, resulting in slower service than expected.\nAs for the food, the experience was a mixed bag. The croissant, unfortunately, was a disappointment. It was soggy and oily, lacking the desired crispiness and flakiness that one expects from a good croissant.\n\nWhen it came to the main course, the duck confit was well-prepared and enjoyable. On the other hand, the squid ink pasta was a letdown.\nThe sauce, reminiscent of laksa, did not pair well with the seafood, creating a somewhat unharmonious flavor profile.\n\nOverall, Paul Bakery is a decent spot for catching up with friends over a cup of coffee, but don't go with the expectation of an exceptional culinary experience. The ambiance is lovely, but the food and service leave room for improvement.",
