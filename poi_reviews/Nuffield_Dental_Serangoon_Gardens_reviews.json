      "text": "Thank you Dr Ben for the super fast extraction of 3 teeth including 2 wisdom teeth. I have never thought that extraction could be so fast. Dr Ben is professional and decisive in giving his advice which is best for the patient like me who would have taken a lifetime to decide to remove any tooth due to my great phobia for any dental procedure even normal scaling and cleaning. Thanks a million Dr Ben!",

      "text": "I recently visited Nuffield dental clinic and was attended to by OHT Pearlyn, who provided outstanding care and service. From the moment I sat down, Pearlyn was attentive, professional, and thorough in explaining each step of the treatment. Her gentle approach made me feel comfortable and at ease throughout the procedure. She took the time to answer my questions patiently and ensured I understood how to take care of my oral health after the visit.\n\nIt’s rare to come across such a dedicated and compassionate healthcare professional, and I truly appreciate the level of attention and professionalism Pearlyn demonstrated. Thank you for the excellent service — I left feeling well taken care of and confident in the treatment I received.",
