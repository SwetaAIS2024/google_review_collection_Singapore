      "text": "I had the opportunity to visit the fish feeding pond at Eco Botanic at 9am this morming. There is a boardwalk above the pond and a shelter area. The pond was full of fish, with only the giant catfish being easily identifiable. Make sure to bring bread or fish food, which the fish eagerly nibbled on as I fed them. It was an enjoyable experience, especially for young children, who seemed to have a lot of fun interacting with the fish. However, I did notice a lack of rubbish bins around the area, which could be an issue for the cleanliness of the park.  There is no public toilet nearby too.Overall, it was a fun and exciting experience that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for an enjoyable outdoor activity.",
