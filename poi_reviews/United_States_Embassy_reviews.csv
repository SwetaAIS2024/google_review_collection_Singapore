J lyn,1,"My hubby experienced a setback when his US visa application for a fully-sponsored conference by his company was denied. Despite having a stable standing in Singapore, the significance of 'strong ties' in the visa application process has come into question. The US visa mechanism and the interviewers' professionalism appear to be lacking, despite their claims of being well-educated and highly trained. The number of individuals not returning to their countries serves as evidence of their incompetence in assessing applicants. The interviews seem superficial, with officers assuming they understand everything about the applicants without proper screening. Despite the collection of the USD185 application fee, a thorough screening and review of applications are not effectively conducted. Their deceptive behavior allows them to manipulate perceptions and maintain a certain image, showing little concern for the impact on careers and work. They come across as grim, mindless clerks with no accountability, unfairly affecting innocent travelers. The irresponsible attitude and potential power abuse of Visa officers can result in carelessness, poor judgment, complacency, insufficient risk assessment, and a tendency to take shortcuts. These actions can pose risks to both the individuals involved and others. It is essential to report such abuses of power to the relevant authorities. Nothing to be proud!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109042636657086546309/reviews
Shohel,5,"Very convenient, just turn right from Napier MRT. Smooth entry n exit. Hand phone must switch off n surrender to the security. Visa interview 5 to 10 min with highly positive minded handsome officer. Very much easy process compare to Netherlands visa, submitted more documents than they require yet rejected.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111439153278844925221/reviews
Vivek Chopra,5,"Super smooth process, the staff was really helpful in guiding through the steps. Please read through the Appointment email in details so all can have a good experience.
Points to note: laptops not allowed inside the embassy (must be stored outside with $2 lockers), phones can be carried (switched off and will be kept by staff administering bag x-ray, other electronics get the same treatment as Phone (smartwatch, wireless headphones, wired headphones - all kept at the x-ray). Reaching far earlier than appointment time would make you first in your time slot but not jump ahead of other time slots :-) Timeslots take priority and then follow ""first come first serve"" within those timeslots. Photo machine is inside embassy and the staff would tell you if new photo is needed or DS160 photo works, please carry $10 cash for the photo payment.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111651614591755620981/reviews
Madu Ravada,5,Organized and efficient. Had called in several times with questions and phone was answered every single time even at 4:55 pm. Very informative and answers all questions. It was a smooth process from check-in at the gate to exit. We took our baby with us as we are visiting Singapore and had no one to watch her. No problems or objects raised about it. The lady at the first check point even asked everyone to be quite because my daughter is sleeping. I appreciate the kind gesture.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115346141641562711169/reviews
C P,5,"Very well organized queue system, staff is really helpful and highly efficient. Most importantly they respect your appointment time, therefore you don't want waste any minute. Go there with all the required documents and you are good after that. No public restroom near by the entrance and only available inside the embassy which can reach after all the security scans. Don't carry the laptop to avoid storage problems.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104348885255859135653/reviews
