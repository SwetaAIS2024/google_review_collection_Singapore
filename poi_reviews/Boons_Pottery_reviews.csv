Cat Lover,1,"Boon is the worst teacher of all time.

constantly hear him complain the 3-4 hours i was there.
he scolded me multiple times 'can you use some intelligent or not?"" when i tried a new method he taught me for the first time.

he glazed our potteries with the worst kind of colours and we threw it away when we get home. the collection of pottery from him was worst. nothing but an angry face.

And yet he is so insecure and constantly boasting himself in front of me and other students. What a shame",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101299808824341128611/reviews
Kai,5,"Never regret attending the trial lesson at Boon’s pottery, Mr Boon is a very patient and humorous uncle which make our session very fun! Even though we wanted to just try it out with an expectation of not bringing any pottery home due to our clumsy hands, we were surprised that he taught us all the tips and tricks which makes it very easy master.

His teaching method does intrigue me to take up more lesson but sadly his classes are mostly taken up :(

Nevertheless, my wife and I were very happy and enjoyed so much at his pottery studio.

Tze Chong,5,Boon’s pottery is a great place to learn the basics of handbuilding (coiling) and wheel throwing. I did the coiling course first and will be starting the wheel throwing courses soon. The instructors are very knowledgeable and skilful. A few of them have decades of experience. The location is also very convenient.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104131438950353946622/reviews

Angie Mead King,5,I think I'm hooked! I want to come back for sure! I had to apologise to Mr. Boon as we were late but we did some amazing progress which he helped sort out of course.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115858011490186736153/reviews
