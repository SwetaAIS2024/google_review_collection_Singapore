Andrei Jedidiah,1,"Creamier Creamier, this outlet is a joke, there's no signature Nutella flavour, you have got to be kidding me, the person even told me it's no longer on the menu. poorly trained staff, clueless. Only served waffles on weekends, like seriously? Where's the coffee in your slogan? Just rip it out I guess. What a way to destroy your good brand.

Good money from Franchise? Well good luck with that.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108282722018621898245/reviews
thelevitator,5,"Decided to try something different and went for the ""Swirly Raspberry Cream"" flavour ($5.90). Price was a bit on the high side but because of how creamy and delicious it was, it was definitely worth it.

The staff was very kind and allowed me to take the photos shown. Will come back again.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102689218568385117662/reviews
Esther,1,"I had fond memories of Creamier years back, and was looking forward to buying a number of tubs as presents for the Christmas season. So imagine the rude awakening I was greeted with.

Politely, I informed the middle-aged service staff of my intention to purchase a few tubs, and would like to sample some flavours before doing so. My partner and I are quite mindful of the number of samples we'd take, and would always share 1 sample between the both of us. To our amazement, the sample portions he scooped were comically miniscule, approximately 1/4 the size of a female's pinky fingernail. Unexpectedly, we could barely taste anything, and this did not aid in our decision making for purchasing a tub. After 2 samples, Karen immediately scooted off to the cash register, so we were awkwardly standing around and waiting for his return... which never happened and was like waiting for the sun to rise from the West. So I went up to him and requested for 2 more samples, which he begrudged us, with impossibly smaller sized samples (imagine a tear drop?). Truly, it is a honed skill to dough out such miniature volume. Still undecided and wanting to spare everyone from this painful night, I asked for 1 last sample, and was greeted with a slight eye roll and an exasperated face. In total, we had 5 samples split between 2 customers who were planning on buying at least 3 tubs of ice cream - I don't think it's a big ask wanting to sample before buying bulk quantities.

Given such micro samples, we had no idea how the flavours tasted like. But even so, we were prepared to make a blind purchase in good faith because we had previously patronised Creamier years back and had fond memories. Also, we had $200 worth of CDC vouchers to spare so this comes at zero cost to us.

Alas, the decision to make a purchase was taken away from us, when at precisely 2 minutes past closing time, Karen decidedly had enough of us and proceeded to switch off all the lights of the ice cream bar, as well as the lights of the freezer for the tubs, signalling that the shop is closed. It is perfectly normal and acceptable for staffs to inform customers on their closing time, and frankly this is much preferred. We felt this form of passive-aggressive behaviour was so unnecessary and uncalled for. Having worked in F&B before during my younger days, not once have I given such ill treatment, even to customers who have overstayed 30 mins past closing time. In any case, Karen's hint was well noted and we got the message that our patronage was neither welcomed nor needed here.

Our visit lasted less than 10 mins, but was unpleasant enough to sour the remainder of our night, and unpleasant enough for me to spend over 10 mins penning this review.

We were happy potential customers with sincere intentions, but I guess Karen decided otherwise. There are other ice cream eateries worth your time, like the Daily Scoop or Birds of Paradise.

Creamier? More like Creami-naur!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100867836421757680326/reviews
Jeryl Teo,5,"So glad that Creamier is in my Queenstown neighbourhood now!

As always, a reasonably good selection of flavours (both normal and premium flavours). This outlet also features “This Month’s Special” flavours. Had to get their Sesame Tang Yuan special and the classic earl grey lavender on a cone. Looking forward to trying more of their specials!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102205208510784146195/reviews
Choon T,5,"Great place to enjoy some great ice cream. The sea salt gula melaka was yummy (as expected, it's sweet). Took the OMG set for 4 scoops and a cone for $20 (extra for the premium flavours)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114720035040328969753/reviews
