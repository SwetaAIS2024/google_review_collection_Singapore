E C,5,the flavour is deliciously old-time,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114212068326694099103/reviews
Jaren Koh,4,"Food was OK I would say. Since it’s a new stall it has a lot of hype but the queue is getting shorter everyday.
Partly because the food is not like the GOAT, but it’s decent. I personally would recommend 卤肉饭 Braised Pork Rice (includes sliced braised pork with half braised egg and some salted vegetables).
And also DO NOT buy the tea bag egg, $1.20 for an egg that doesn’t taste different from any other egg and you have the peel the shell yourself.

The service I would give 5 star in this canteen as this is the only stall that gives out collection buzzer (the one that will buzz when your food is ready to collect) and detailed receipts",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105920623539818036234/reviews
