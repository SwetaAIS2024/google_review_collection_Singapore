Vanessa Tan,5,"Strong broth, tender pork slices, generous amount of lard pieces, two whole prawns!

Ordered the normal prawn noodles ÊôÆÈÄöËôæÈù¢ ($5) and was very impressed by having 2 whole prawns to myself, peeled at the body for your eating convenience! NOT CUT INTO HALF. Usually i get 1.5 prawns at this price with 3 halves thrown into my bowl, stuck to the shell. Not this stall üî• and they have a $3.50 Lean Pork Noodle Soup promotion!! Because their pork in my prawn noodle was tender, I would try this next time.

Run by 2 approachable, friendly young people. I look forward to having prawn mee at this coffeeshop again! It has been a while and welcome change :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110679538561876302414/reviews
Pak Soon Lau,4,Quite a good bowl of big prawns noodles. This stall is hidden in a small coffee shop in the midst of HDB blocks. They even serve a budget version at $3.50 per bowl.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107524637554500568527/reviews

ChinZhu Ho,1,"Today i went to other branch at 1015 Geylang East. I ordered one bowl of prawn mee soup and regretted immediately.
Because the prawns taste worse than frozen and prawn soup so bland.
Please avoid all branches of Everyday Prawn Mee at all costs !",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101074234530611362946/reviews
