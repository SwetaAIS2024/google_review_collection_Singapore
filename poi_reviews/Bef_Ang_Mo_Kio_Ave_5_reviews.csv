Low Soon Kuan,4,I like the place as it is near AMK library. Every morning after I visited library I will take a bus to go to Bishan or Chinatown to visit friends then go for lunch. The atmosphere is casual and relax and comfortable.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114238281415823050127/reviews
