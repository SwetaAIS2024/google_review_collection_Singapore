Then, I went there with the intention of giving it a go, but I gained strength from the good church members and the pastor's words, and my child met a friend at Sunday school, and it has been a happier month.\nWhen I went to school with my church members on weekdays,\nI also do rounding.\nThe child also goes to play on the soccer team.\n\n7 minutes from Tiga",

I was so sorry that I couldn't even say thank you because my child was sick.\nI'm leaving this post in the hopes that you'll see this post. I am a mother who brought 2 elementary school students (boy and girl) and 1 girl from kindergarten. (I helped a little with meal preparation..^^;;) Anyway, although it was small in scale, it was a service with great grace.",
