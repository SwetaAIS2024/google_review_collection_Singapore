Ran by an old couple that refused to retire. ðŸ¤£ already 70 plus 80.\nI remembered when I was much younger they were the earliest at the market starting making their bean curd at 4 plus in the morning ! The smell of pandan leaves is so wonderful  !\nThey sell soyamilk and grass jelly drink.\nWhen I shifted here 40 years ago they are already here.90 cents for a big cup ! Where to find ?\nOpened on Monday when everyone else is closed !!!\nNewly updated timetable is inside 3rd pic.\nPeople come people go but these are the real true heartlanders ! Thank You uncle & aunty !",
