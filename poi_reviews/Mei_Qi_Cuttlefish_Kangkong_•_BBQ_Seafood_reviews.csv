Denise Ong,4,"Came here for Stingray, Kangkong, and Black Pepper Crayfish. Stingray and Kangkong got a good kick in their chilli taste! üëç

Crayfish wise, the crayfish was a bit small and correspondingly the meat was rather small too but the black pepper paste was pretty good! Can give it a try. üòã",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105885270396733702572/reviews

DC,1,"All I can give is one word . ‚ÄúCUI‚Äù the portion $12 I could count the number of lala. The sauce not even close to chili crab style. Lastly, the seafood lala was sandy I thought I ordered sand with chili crab sauce. Took the risk because the usual store was closed, but they did not win me over. Overall 0/5 sadly, I have to put at least one star . Goodbye meiqi",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105201775244156500537/reviews
Benjamin,1,"This establishment is highly unethical and best avoided. The owner's attitude is quite poor, pressuring customers into hurried and uncivilised ordering experiences. My order of sea snails was thoroughly unpleasant‚Äîcold, smelly, tough, rubbery, and far from fresh. I recommend that the relevant authorities, such as the SFA, investigate the quality of their offerings. I strongly advise potential diners to steer clear of this place at all costs.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109315951039431824709/reviews
