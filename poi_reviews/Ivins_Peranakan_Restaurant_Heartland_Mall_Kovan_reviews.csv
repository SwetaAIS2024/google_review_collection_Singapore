Daniel Hong,5,"A very very yummy and authentic place for Peranakan cuisine. Many patrons are here for the specialties like the ayam buah keluak and babi pongteh. They also have a great variety of side dishes like the bakwan, fried ngo Hiang and stuffed beancurd. Customers can also request for Nasi Kuning (with a 50 cents charge). It's easily accessible by MRT, just take the MRT to Kovan and take Exit C to Heartlands Mall. Definitely will be back again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106614080977870381221/reviews
Clement Cher,4,"Went there over the weekend at 7 pm and was crowded with a queue.

Staff were friendly and quickly sat the customers down as space was available.. Ordered via QR code and the food is served very quickly.

Ordered the curry fish head, egg. Chap cai and beef rendang. Portion is just nice for small eaters. Favourite dish was the beef rendang and fish head. Ordered dessert after. chendol and gula meleka sago which was OK . Price is considered decent.

Recommended to try if you are around the area.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113278228004850197170/reviews
CHOLE Tang,5,"Love the chendol here! This is the second time I ate this even though I live in the west, but I'll gladly drive over here to have it again. I recommend going on the weekdays as there are the lunch sets that are worth the value. The assam fish, chye poh omelette are the must try dishes, and if you're having the lunch set, it's the duck soup, chap chye, ngoh hiang, bean curd and ayam buah keluak. Really recommend for you guys to try it!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114642132578006423922/reviews
Shandy L.,5,"Authentic Peranakan cuisine that feels just like home. Warm service, delicious traditional dishes like rendang beef and chap chye that truly hit the spot. The pulot hitam dessert is a creamy, rich highlight.

Friendly staff, hearty portions, and genuine flavors make this a must-visit local restaurant. Perfect for family meals and those craving true Nonya cooking.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114031717407176630900/reviews

We ordered the 4 pax set meal, came with 5 dishes, 5 rice and 5 chendol. A meal within $100 for delicious Peranakan food is value for money. My family enjoyed very much. The staff were also very friendly and helpful.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102477248367236393822/reviews
