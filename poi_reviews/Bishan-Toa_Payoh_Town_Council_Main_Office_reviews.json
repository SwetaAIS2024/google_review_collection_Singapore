Without reading the e-mail in detail, a staff referred me to NEA (which I have already contacted) and told me that NEA will be in-charge of cleaning up the recycling bin as shown in the photograph I've attached.\n\nFunny thing is, there was no attachment in my e-mail and nothing about recycling bins was brought up.\n\nWhile I understand that NEA handles littering issues, shouldn't the Town Council be more concerned about the overall well-being of their residents?",

I would also like to give an excellent satisfactory comment to the fast response to my feedback on the block rubbish chute odour issue. I noticed the TC staff doing water flushing to the chute from the top down and washing at the bin areas. Keep up the good job. You have my thumb up!! Thank you for the fast response ^.^",

      "text": "I am writing to commend Andrew for his exceptional service and dedication in resolving an urgent water flow issue we experienced at our house. On 30 December evening, we encountered a sudden problem with the water flow in our house: when the master toilet shower was turned on, the other taps in the house either have no water or very little water flow. We contacted EMU for assistance. Andrew responded promptly, and he also followed up personally with us late into the night, showing genuine concern for our water supply, understanding how crucial it was for our daily needs. His attentiveness and commitment to resolving the issue were clear throughout the process. Despite PUB’s efforts on 31 December to replace the water valve and meter, the issue persisted. However, Andrew remained proactive and reassured us that he would coordinate with PUB, HIP, and TC to conduct an on-site visit. On 7 January, a team of six men arrived and discovered a small sand sediment blocking the pipe, which, once removed, restored the water flow to normal. We are very grateful for Andrew's effort and quick action in handling the situation. His professionalism made a real difference in resolving the issue. It’s rare to experience such a high level of commitment from government agencies, and we truly appreciate the service he provided. Andrew’s efforts reflect the excellent service your team provides. Thank you. We also appreciate the combned effort from PUB and HIP team to come together and discover this issue.",

      "text": "Property manager Darin is incapable of handling cases. Complained about fire hazard along corridor and nothing was done to advise neighbors to remove. Told me if ask them to remove alot of units will be affected in my floor (only 2 out of 15 other units are crowding corridor). Radio silent after. This town council is just plain lazy and inefficient at handling cases. Estate is extremely dirty and poorly maintained. He is not fit to be a manager",
