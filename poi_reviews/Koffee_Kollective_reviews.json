I personally had the strawberry matcha, which didn't quite do it for me - a strange mix that didn't end up with either tasting strongly nor each complementing the other. I believe the standard and safer orders would do better.\n\nThe wait time was significant on a Saturday afternoon, likely due to the many patrons at the post-lunch hour. Might take 15-25 minutes for the drinks to be served.",

Can use CDC voucher too for those of you coupon clippers. Get your coffee fix then pop by opposite for good cheap hawker food. Amazing place and wish there were more outlets like this in the heartlands!",
