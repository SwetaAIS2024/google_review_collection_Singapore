Irene Lim,3,"We visited Pastaria Abate on Chinese New Year’s Eve, and it wasn’t crowded, which made for a comfortable dining experience. Service was good—staff were attentive and efficient.

The pasta is advertised as homemade, and it did taste fresh. However, while everything was decent, none of the dishes really stood out as particularly amazing. It was a solid meal but nothing to rave about.

The restaurant is located on Neil Road, and there’s a convenient public parking lot nearby, which is a plus. Overall, it’s a decent spot for casual Italian food, but don’t expect anything mind-blowing.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105804445185126817371/reviews
BC Ng,4,"Cute restaurant cozy ambient. The staff are friendly. The minestrone soup was nice and hearty. Apparently freshly made with every order. However, pasta was so so, and your pork chop was too sweet for my liking",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101802568076494399106/reviews
Ng Yong Ming,2,"Been here once 3 years back and had the carbonara & vongole (sadly no photos were taken then). This time round, came back for the Mac & Cheese that is being raved on social media, and had the Prawn & Gorgonzola Ravioli.

Gorgonzola ($32) was fine, giving the ravioli a slight pungent kick from the blue cheese. Was not getting the nutty-taste from the burnt butter sauce and maybe it would have been slightly mainstream to add sage into browned butter sauce, but it was lacking a form of aromatics to it. Prawns tasted weird, or at least for us, though definitely not spoiled but it was just off-putting.

Stove-top Mac and Cheese, ordered the Bacon version ($29) since why not, its bacon. Not entirely wow-ed or amazed, and was a little put-off by the bacon. There is an extremely strong, porky/gamey flavor from the bacon and it was cooked into the entire pot which made the whole dish a little unpalatable. I am normally fine with the porky flavor when eating, but that boar-taint flavor from the bacon was too strong for me.

Atmosphere wise, cozy definitely and can be quite cold. The only ick was there were so many empty tables and seats for the night (their reservation timings were close to when we ended) and we had reservation as well, but we were seated next to the fire hose(?) which was already a slightly bad start to the dinner. This particular table was behind their display shelf which meant it was extremely difficult for the service staff to notice us, without having to come out all the way.

To make things worse, I am not too sure if that particular staff is the famed Faith or another employee but she was very dedicated to her service of one particular group of diner (family of 5, 2 kids) that were sat in the couch seats beside us. Extremely dedicated and attentive, to the point she was playing with the 2 very rowdy boys and her back was facing us majority of the duration. There was a good 10min when my mouth was just creamy gamey flavor in my mouth with the pungent blue cheese but we couldn't even get a service staff to help refill our water, since there is one service staff in our area just that she was too focused on one table and her back was facing us the whole time.

For this price point, not an extremely picky person but I don't think it is worth be it for food or for service (well, unless you are the preferred customers I guess).",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116059578954710664061/reviews
pauline,5,"The best spaghetti I've ever eaten in my life! I've tried Italian spaghetti in well-renowned Italian pasta restaurants set up by Italians but theirs is a huge win for me in terms of taste! Not too soft, not too hard and the sauce is just right too. Even though I ordered seafood pizza and pasta none of them tasted extremely salty which is impressive. The atmosphere is wonderful too with nice decor, appropriate temperature, comfortable seating and the service is 10/10. Would love to bring others here next time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105442979054970287675/reviews
Yvonne Yee,2,"Quite surprised by the high Google rating. Might be some freebies given or past ratings.

We went on a weekday lunch time (some time last month). There were only our group and another group, 2 tables. Restaurant looks nice from outside but rather dark and dated inside.

There were set lunch offered and portions were decent. Pricing is on the high side considering the mediocre taste. Not the usual pasta quality a pasta restaurant offer.

We booked this place from Kris+ and was surprised to be informed that they do not accept Kris pay!! There is additional 3% charge on top of the gst and service tax if you pay by credit card.

There were 6 of us, all of us agreed it was overpriced and food tasted mediocre, not worth another visit..",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106525972077790864123/reviews
