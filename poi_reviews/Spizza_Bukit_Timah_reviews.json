      "text": "We visited Spizza Bukit Timah yesterday around 9 PM, even though they close at 10 PM. Despite the late hour, the staff was very accommodating and welcomed our group of nine without hesitation.\n\nWe ordered quickly and were pleasantly surprised by the prompt service. The food was generally delicious and well-presented. Some dishes, like the vegetarian pasta and carbonara, were slightly under-seasoned, but nothing a little salt and garnish couldn’t fix.\n\nThe highlight of the experience was the service—friendly, humble, and attentive staff who made sure we were comfortable throughout. It’s a cozy place for gatherings, and even though they close relatively early, they went the extra mile to accommodate us.\n\nWe spent around $300 ish in total, which we felt was reasonable for the group size and quality of the food and service.\n\nOverall, it was a lovely spontaneous dinner plan that turned out to be a great experience. Thank you, Spizza!",

May not be the most authentic Italian but still excellent flavours and fresh ingredients. Staff are friendly and helpful and they also have a great membership programme with plenty of deals.",
