Randomstuffsg,4,"NomStopX at SIT Campus Foodgle Hub offers affordable and delicious American-style comfort food, with hearty options like Nashville chicken, spicy chicken sandwiches, mac n cheese, and BBQ ribs. The food is satisfying and perfect for a quick, filling meal. However, itâ€™s worth noting that several popular items, such as dirty rice and BBQ ribs, were out of stock before 1pm during my visit. Additionally, the bread used for some sandwiches could be of better quality. Overall, itâ€™s a great spot for tasty, budget-friendly meals, but I hope theyâ€™ll keep their stock up and improve the bread in the future.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116551745132589748453/reviews
PH Ong,5,"Happy to support this stall!

I enjoyed the jerk chicken with dirty rice on my first visit. Today I decided to have blackened fish with a side of charred broccoli. They were out of dirty rice.

The fish was well done with a buttery sauce which I enjoyed very much. It went well with the plain rice. Would have probable been a bit too much with the dirty rice.

The broccoli had a good char and smokiness to it, though a tad heavy handed on the salt. But overall I still enjoyed it and would order it again.

Will come back to try their other dishes.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110260550138127986835/reviews
Jason Ng,3,Had the Chilliconcarne and the hot dog. Tbh rather average in taste. It's not as heavily flavoured as I thought. Cheese did nothing apart from being a garnish. The dog was alright being a chicken frank I assumed. Nothing special with the usual sauce and relish and bun. I guess it's a decent try for American carribean food at a very affordable price.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103405563195010248727/reviews
Javriel Lim,5,"Delicious food at an insanely affordable price. Great value for money especially in this economy. Owners are friendly, passionate in what they do and have great knowledge about the food they whip up. Food was served quick and piping hot. I was eating nomstop for sure... Travelled 1.5 hours from the West and have no regrets. Northeasties especially SIT students you're in for a treat!!!

Alexis C,3,$5.60 jerk chicken leg Portion is rather small not even a full leg different from menu picture  and upgrade 1.80 I think to swap to dirty rice which is rather mushy and not so tasty. Broccoli is tasty only 3 stalks. Foodcourt interior is pleasant and has good views,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105419750770738056153/reviews
