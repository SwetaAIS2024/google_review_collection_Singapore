Khun C,5,I was grateful to be invited as a guest for dinner. Exudes old school charm with warmth and family atmosphere. Service is top shelf. Food is a mix of local favorites and Western fare. The grounds are immaculate. And the vibe transforms you to another place and another time.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113032638184818514755/reviews
Tommy Seah,5,Pretty decent place. Food at the Chinese restaurant is fairly good. Service is excellent. But the place has a run down feel. It could be just me being exposed to some of the better Japanese resorts. Fairly decent experience.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105229389666384285229/reviews
Alexis Cheong,5,"Secluded golf course with a members only bistro/diner that makes you feel like you're not in Singapore. The local favourites like satay, char kway teow and carrot cake are must-tries. Drinks are 50% off during Happy Hour. The waffle with ice cream was also super indulgent and delicious!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104658918419134607489/reviews
