      "text": "When I first entered the restaurant, I was warmly greeted and impressed by the attentive service. However, my enthusiasm dipped slightly when we were seated‚Äîour chairs were noticeably worn, and the decor felt outdated.\n\nFortunately, any doubts quickly disappeared once the food arrived. Each dish was beautifully presented and full of rich, fresh flavors. It was clear that a lot of care went into the cooking, from the appetizers all the way to dessert.\n\nThe service remained excellent throughout‚Äîhelpful and professional without being intrusive. By the end of the meal, the worn furniture felt like a minor flaw in an otherwise outstanding experience.\n\nOverall, while the ambiance could use a refresh, the food and service were top-notch. I‚Äôd definitely return and recommend it to others.",

      "text": "Crystal Jade Pavilion\n\nService : Impressive standards at this outlets. We have an Indonesia helper with us and we were trying to order food with no pork usage at all. The waiter gave us some advice and left. He came back shortly with a menu circling all the dishes that don‚Äôt have any pork. üëçüëçüëç and the waiter and waitress are friendly, patient and very helpful. Kept my mums wheelchair, help us get seated, didn‚Äôt rush our order or meal even when the restaurant starts to fill up.\n\nFood : We ordered mainly Dim Sum dishes followed by some main from the menu. It‚Äôs good! Full on restaurant setting, standard and the food was flavourful, delicious and fulfilling. Highly recommend the braised chicken üêì feet, Haa Kao ü•üü•üü•ü and the Egg Hor Fun üçú. (Especially the Hor Fun!) Overall, excellent cooking skills.\n\nEnvironment : This brunch has a great view of the ocean üåÖ, facing Sentosa üé¢üé°üèûÔ∏è. You can choose to be seated next to the large glass wall to catch the view. It also gets very busy during lunch and dinner so either make a reservation or go early.",

Decent quality food, but perhaps we ordered too much fried food and needed loads of Chinese tea (È¶ôÁâá). Thankfully their tea quality is good too and remained concentrated over at least 2 pots.",

One of the worst I've tasted.",
