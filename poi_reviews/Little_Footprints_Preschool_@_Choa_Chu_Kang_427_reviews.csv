Ken Peh,5,"Both my child attended the childcare services here. The teachers have taken care of them well. Although it's within a HDB block, the environment is clean and conducive. The childcare center at this area is also being awarded SPARK, which is a testament of their quality. I highly recommended Ichiban Montessori 427 CCK to parents. You will be able to leave your kids to the good hands of the staff here with a peace of mind.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113975004215945002265/reviews
