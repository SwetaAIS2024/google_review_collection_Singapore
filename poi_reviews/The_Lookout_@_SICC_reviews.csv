YT Teo,5,"The food at The Lookout is always very nicely prepared and caters to the healthier palate. Not too oily or salty, just right for our family.

On weekends, service can get a little hectic due to the crowd, but during weekdays and off-peak hours the team is very friendly and cheery. Veteran staff will always make sure you are well-taken care of.

After a recent overhaul, it is more airy and breezy. On lazy weekdays, it is a nice place to just let the mind slow down and enjoy a cuppa.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117189324575730659160/reviews
Catherine Chan,1,"We ordered 6 coffees to go from the bistro at what was not ostensibly a peak hour (1:30pm). We made payment upfront to a very disgruntled waitstaff. No sight or sound of coffee for the next 25 minutes - after we enquired politely, we were told to wait longer as they had just started to prepare these. Extremely poor service, and mediocre coffee. Would not recommend.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107345273098617230547/reviews

Carol Yuen,4,"Nice ambiance with cool breeze on a hot afternoon. We ordered Braised Duck Rice, Ham, Cold noodles and Ice Kachang. The cold noodles is under Japanese menu but it is actually Chinese cold noodles with mala flavour. It is quite misleading and we have feed back to the restaurant.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103035392154307882845/reviews
Thomas Ng,3,"A great place to chill and relax, tried the local delight. Laksa, fried beef kway teow, beef hor fan and the chendol. Must try. If the Chendol ice can be more fine, it will be perfect.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113098290299962244417/reviews
