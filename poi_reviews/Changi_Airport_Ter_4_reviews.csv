Bhaskar Singapore,4,"Well planned new terminal. Most of the shirt distance and low cost airlines operate from here, kind of hub for Air Asia in Singapore.

Terminal attractions also look good, but only disadvantage is ita bit isolated from main terminals T1, T2 and T3.

Yet good connectivity from these terminals to T4. Free shuttle available, but frequency is bit less. Rest all look great.

International food court have all kinds of restaurants and dining options",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118414779972405165627/reviews

Atom Sloth,4,"Terminal 4 is the newest terminal in the airport.
This is my first time visiting the terminal, and I am quite pleased with it.
The security measures are strict, requiring passengers to remove their laptops and electronics for inspection.
However, I feel that the security guard handled my laptop in a rough manner.
The terminal offers a variety of dining options and attractions.
There is a slide, an entertainment area, and a musical performance.
I highly recommend visiting the terminal if you have a long layover.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111653531675792285633/reviews
