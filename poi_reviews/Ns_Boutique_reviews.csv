Paige B.,4,"Cocktail dresses can be hard to find in SG, but this store has a lovely selection and I would recommend it to others!

The sizes they carry are somewhat small but I found the sales associate to be really friendly and found a perfect dress for a wedding. They also held said dress while my indecisive self sorted out what I wanted, which I really appreciated :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115955128631674456121/reviews
Sharon Ho-Norton,1,"Horrible clothing quality and customer service. Bought a dress for $200++, and washed it individually in light ""handwash"" cycle (15 mins) and cool temperature. By the way, dress had NO CARE LABEL. After washing, it was put away in wardrobe. I tried to wear it 6 months later and to my horror, realise the dress had shrunk way beyond acceptable levels. The dress had shrunk by at least 1 size. When I called their store and office for help, and they gave a very unhelpful and unsympathetic answer : ""our boss says - sorry cannot help"". Did not offer other way to help ease the damage or horrible quality. Appalling customer service standards given how pricey their clothes are. I am never going back.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109789401290131039982/reviews
