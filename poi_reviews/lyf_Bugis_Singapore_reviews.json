I definitely prefer bigger rooms but was open to try this hotel just for fun and I still enjoyed the stay as the small area didn’t hinder nor annoy me in any way. Price was also affordable and for just a quick getaway, I have no complaints. Would I return in the near future… perhaps, if the price is good enough then why not",

The bathroom/toilet door was not designed to be locked; it was a just sliding glass that did not close fully either!! Perhaps, the room is better for solo travellers.\nThe breakfast was good, the staff/service was really good.",
