      "text": "I love the food here! The portions are big, so if you're a small eater, you might want to share. The beef noodle soup is packed with beef, and you can really taste it in the broth. It‚Äôs served hot, and if you like a bit of heat, adding chili oil makes it even better.\n\nThe fried rice is really tasty. I couldn‚Äôt stop eating it üòÄ I just wish it was served a bit warmer. The dumplings are soft and go so well with chili oil, but again, I would‚Äôve liked them to be hotter when served.\n\nOne thing you shouldn‚Äôt miss is the Chinese tea.. It‚Äôs sweet, served hot, and packed with herbs and flowers like chrysanthemums, goji berries, longan, and red dates.\n\nThe service is pretty fast, which is great. I just wish some of the food came out hotter, but overall, I‚Äôd still recommend this place",

Here is the situation.\n\nFor a restaurant that has only us dine in that time, not even a single server notice that our order beef kebab yet ready. After we notified them, only then they realised.\n\nIf your beef kebab takes a long time to prepare/cook, kindly inform us during we place our order. We will decided whether to proceed or not.\n\nInstead of sitting and talking with each other,(server) why don‚Äôt they make a round and checking our order paper. We asked for an update for few times but order still pending. Our order time is 14.32pm yet at 15.30pm didn‚Äôt received.\n\nWe decided to cancel the order because when my mother asked, the server blame each other in front us. Such pointing finger behaviour is not acceptable.\n\nSurprisingly when we get up from our seat to pay, the server send our beef kebab in packaging.\n\nMy question is ,why decide on your own? Instead of asking us, why you packed the beef kebab? Not to make things worst we just accept the ordered.\n\nLastly, no apologies heard from the server. Only the cashier apologies to us.",

      "text": "3.5/5 ‚Äì Mee Tarik Beef Noodle\n\nOkay, so it was pouring rain and I was convinced a steaming bowl of beef noodles would hit the spot. Let‚Äôs start with the good stuff: the mee tarik (hand-pulled noodles). Absolutely killer‚Äîspringy, fresh, and just the right kind of chewy. Like, *chef‚Äôs kiss*. But here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ the broth? Wayy too salty, fam. Like, ‚Äúchugging three glasses of water after one sip‚Äù salty. It kinda drowned out everything else, which is a shame because those noodles deserved better. Solid effort, but if they dialed back the salt a notch, this bowl would‚Äôve been *cheeks*. Still, not bad for a rainy day cozy-up‚Äîjust bring your own water bottle. üòÖ",
