Mobile payment apps & cash accepted only.\n\nI requested for less salty, no chilli powder. Received my order in about 5 minutes after making payment even with 3-4 orders ahead of mine.\n\nSize of the squid & promotion price $6.80 are acceptable. The coating was crispy enough but I didn't really like the texture/mouthfeel & it was quite thick, with most of the flavours came from the coating & seasoning powders (pepper salt & plum), the squid underneath the coating wasn't really seasoned.\n\nWon't be back...",
