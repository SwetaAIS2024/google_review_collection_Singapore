And order them for colleagues in my office üí™üèª",

      "text": "This is a nice cafe addition to Wisma and is located on the 3rd floor, right beside the lift bank. Lots of seats with a welcoming ambience but you might still have to wait a bit for seats on the weekend. The cafe is newly opened, the manager was  enthusiastically dashing about to attend to customers who had queries on how to order.\n\nAs part of their opening month they have some special promotions, we tried their croffle dessert which was nice and flaky. Overall a good experience, if you want to just grab and go there is a standalone takeaway outlet located at B1 which is where The Face Shop used to be, near where the connecting walkway to Taka is.",

They also have seats upstairs, in case you want to find a space to meet someone.\n\nGrabbed myself some Salted Egg Brioche, and a Kale Caesar Salad for lunch, and did a grab-and-go.",
