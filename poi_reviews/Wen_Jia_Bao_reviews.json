      "text": "Recalling an incident at 655am in WenJiaBao Lakeside MRT economic food stall on Sunday 24 November 2024\n\nI queued behind a man taller and older than me. My purchase was a packet of white beehoon (kosong) which costs $1.50 and a packet of white beehoon with a piece of otah and curry vegetables in a total of $6.00 which meant my beehoon with others and vege costs $4.50.\nThe guy before me took long time at the cashier. So I move before him to scan my qr code for paynow.\n\nI asked the cashier the price of my food. She told me it's $10.80. This is a shock so I asked again on what I bought? Then she question the guy who pick me food. The guy told her everything i bought is $6.00 only. But she picked the bento of a guy customer behind me and told me to move away for blocking him. I asked her what was the reason she is not serving me but someone else? She said I cut queue and blocked the way. I asked her why she had overcharge me? She brushed aside and said there are too many people and I must queue up 1st. After I paid., she said that I should get lost faster.\n\nTerrible cashier service from a rundown profiter at WenJiaBao Lakeside MRT.",

Smaller outlet that serves an interesting selection of Northern Chinese and Shandong dishes. ShenJianBao is pretty good. Cold noodles with cucumber in a spicy sesame sauce also good. They also have a selection of other cold side dishes worthy of add-ons.\n\nDon't expect the best service or atmosphere. This is a utilitarian take out place.",
