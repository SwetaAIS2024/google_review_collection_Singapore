Bock Keat,5,"Awesome food especially the western set meal! Even the side dish such as the ice lemon tea, mushroom soup, french fries and salad taste good. For $9.90 nett it is really cheap.

Dining environment is cosy - good music, peaceful and clean. Staff are polite.

This place is a hidden gem.

Lots of parking lots in Joo Chiat Complex.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105334451934924974543/reviews
Shanna Ng,5,Love the fresh oysters! Reasonable drinks. Other basic snacks were good too!,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109060290777205197594/reviews
Vicky Teo,3,"Nice place to chill at, maybe even hold small meetings etc. It's a KTV bar/ cafe, the alcohol selection is okay, there's no draft beers just bottled and cans...there's hard liquor (I think?).

Food is decent at best, not that it's horrible but the taste just doesn't stand out. I would consider it slightly overpriced because the portion is way too little but again, it isn't very expensive.

Would I recommend eating there? No.

Would I recommend drinking there? Probably but it won't be my top few choices when I think about places to drink.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118352997598234004938/reviews

Dean Stanton,1,"Brilliant and comfy. Great food. Large portions.  I love this place.
DOWNGRADED TO 1 STAR RATING.
OPENING TIMES HAVE BECOME COMPLETELY UNRELIABLE.
PUBLISHED TIMES ESPECIALLY FOR LUNCH ARE NOT RESPECTED BY STAFF WHO JUST SAY THEY ARE OUT OF DATE.
PUBLISHED SET LUNCH TIME IS UNTIL 3.30PM DAILY. ARRIVED YESTERDAY AT 2.21PM AND WAS TOLD LUNCH NOW FINISHES AT 2.15PM.
BEEN HERE 15 PLUS OCCASIONS AND TAKEN CLIENTS THERE BUT BASED ON THIS UNRELIABLE EXPERIENCE THEY ARE NOW BANNED FROM MY LIST OF FOOD PLACES FOR MEETINGS.
OPENING TIMES HAVE BECOME COMPLETELY RANDOM. IT'S RUN MORE LIKE A HAWKER STALL. WHENEVER LAH. TERRIBLE",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110787586800293934743/reviews
