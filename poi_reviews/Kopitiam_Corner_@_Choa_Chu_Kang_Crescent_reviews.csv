Happpie Bunny,1,The new open malay stall price is too expensive. Ordering nasi lemak with ayam masak merah and a vege cost $8.30 and the seller attitude is so bad. Will not support the stall again,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104063194958304448021/reviews
Quek Han Jun,1,"Renovated 3 times over the few years, been here since my younger days. Now the food is ridiculously expensive and worst of all, still no aircon for such food prices.
Everything is up at least a dollar+
Only affordable stalls are dim sum and cai peng, coffee is still reasonably priced.
1 star for this poor decision to renovate ðŸ¤®and jack up the prices.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106044771667079095861/reviews
Rogrknight,1,"atmosphere is acceptable, service is good at least for the drinks stall male staff. food price is very expensive. bought duck rice today and specifically requested for boneless yet encountered a sharp piece of bone which pierced my lip. very disappointed as the food wasnâ€™t that great either, it is overpriced too at $5.30 with add on egg. the food quality DOESN'T JUSTIFY ITS HIGH PRICE. would rather have walked the extra distance to yew tee to get food in future. would recommend as a spot to chill out in the afternoon but not to eat.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116240258347882451797/reviews

AlexNicholas,1,"I ordered the Chicken Mushroom creamy pasta from the western stall and I can tell yall, that was one of the worst pasta I've eaten. sauce wasn't creamy at all, just tasted very jalat. chicken was dry and bland, whole dish just no effect at all. store also ran out of rice, chicken wings etc.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106023226129429339053/reviews
