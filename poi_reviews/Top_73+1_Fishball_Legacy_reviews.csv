L. Online,5,"Hidden Halal chinese food shop at AMK Ave 10. The Chili Ban Mian is very delicious. Ikan bilis is crispy and yummy, and the mince meat and chicken ball is very tasty. The noodle is just nice.. All perfect. No wonder they get Singapore Best Food! I will come back to try others in the menu.

Love it!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116620772267484554878/reviews
andyloe,5,"Was in search for a quick dinner on a weekday and walked into this empty stall. Surprising, this is one of the best fishball noodle I tried for awhile! The big fishball told me that it is homemade without even trying. Upon the first bite, it was heavenly good with its chewy and tenderness! It was fresh and awesome, worth that $5.50 I paid. The noodle was chewy and spice to the perfection! A halal certified stall that sells fried rice and other sides like fried wanton too. During that 20 min of dining in, I was proven wrong that it was a quiet looking stall. Many people walked it to collect their takeaway and seems like it is a popular go to for residents of the estate. Surely will be back and with my family soon!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110109116555826289679/reviews
Yusri Samad,5,"I happened to walk past and saw this small shop tucked just nicely in front of the carpark. Ordered a bowl of chicken minced meat noodles. I liked the paste, just about a nice amount of taste that will bring me back to try their other menus.

Nothing fantastic about the dining area, just enough for you to enjoy your bowl of noodles.

Very nostalgic area for me as I grew up there and came back years later to find this gem.

What's more important to me is that it is halal certified.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105884105702066588509/reviews
elyca,5,"this food place deserves a ton more recognition.
one of my highly recommended food-eatery to try! been a regular customer since their shop back in Thomson and could never deny on their top notch food quality & undeniable good service from staffs. would always be welcomed with the brightest smile from the owner, and he would go beyond his ways to ensure that customers are being served in the right manner.

quick recommendation+a must try: excellent quality handmade fishball noodle/soup, chicken mince meat noodle, prawn paste chicken, and dumpling.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110871615036135126729/reviews
Kendrick Wee,4,4 big fish balls. Handmade. Bouncy. Noodle was Al dente not much oily. Chili ban mian was small.  It was their signature believe it or not for a fish ball stall. I would say taste was average but serving size for $6.50 was well below average. Flavor was alright. I think EAT chili ban mian was much better.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115793547912532718349/reviews
