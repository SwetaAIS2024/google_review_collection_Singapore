      "text": "Run by an elderly couple, this stall offers roasted and white chicken rice options. Cash only establishment.\n\nHad the white chicken rice (白斩鸡饭) for 4 bucks. While the chicken seems to be poached well, perhaps the rice needed more flavour. They do give a bit of taogei with the rice. Amount of rice can be adjusted without surcharge, so from a price point perspective this was pretty good.",

I prefer their boiled chicken but it seems that their roast chicken is more popular as the foreigners in this area like it.So they prepare lesser of the \"white\" chicken.\nChilli & soup is ok too ! Rice texture needs improvement ,but they don't charge for extra rice so don't KP lah !\nTry it ! Singapore National dish ! Yummy! Don't like the usage of plastic fork and spoon when eating there .\nUpdated 2Mar 2025 look at the queue  ! A picture tells a thousand words  !!!!",
