You pretty much can find a playground, a fitness corner for young people, fitness facilities for the elderly, obstacle courses, as well as a swing.\n\nThere are also plenty of benches with shelter.\n\nOne round around the outer track is about 475 metres.\n\nThis park is connected to Ang Mo Kio Linear Park.",

So, thumbs up.\nThe BIG problem though is right smack in the park proper stands a large white signboard that carries this caveat \"Private land .. use at your own risks..,. (and ending with) Spore United Estates Pte Ltd.\" Question, as this is a public park by NPark, how does this signage fit in?",

It is smaller than the adjoining AMK Linear Park but I think Luxus Hills Park is more beautiful with plenty of shade. Toilets are located beyond the western edge of the park (at the side of AMK Linear Park).",
