Nur Iman Rostam,5,"Burger King Singapore has launched their new limited product, which is Cheesy Sour Cream Burgers which comes in both beef and chicken served in their famous long bun, smothered with sour cream, pieces of turkey bacon and a good layer of cheese.

I decided to opt for 2 burgers ala carte because I wanted to try the two different offerings and see which was worth the bite and interestingly, both are winners in their delights. The beef burger offers two radial patties and they pair well with the cream sauce whereas the chicken burger which compliments the crunchy turkey bacon well.
