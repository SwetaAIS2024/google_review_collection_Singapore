Melissa Lee,4,"It‚Äôs generally a good clinic. Both Dr Lee and Dr Lo are friendly, put me at ease and listen to my feedback before providing the required medical advice. The clinic has upgraded to having AC. And though it is a slower clinic as we need to wait 30min to 1 hr on average to see the doctor. The clinic has put in place workaround such as having a WhatsApp contact to inform you that your Q  is approaching so you can do other things or wait at home before your turn comes.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114116477263498855208/reviews
Roy,5,"Saw Doctor Lee Hwee Ming in the afternoon. She's a very patient person and conducted a thorough check for my condition.

When I asked her for a referral letter to a specialist, she was attentive enough to note which insurance company I came under so she could recommend a specialist that's covered under the insurance plan.

While I had to wait pretty long before my turn (1 hour), it was because there were 5-6 people in front of me.

Definitely a slower paced clinic but I did not feel it's because of their attitude but more because the clinic is run by 2 experienced nurses who are a little more senior as compared to some other clinics.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106818245172820515294/reviews
