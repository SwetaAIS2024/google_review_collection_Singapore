A thoughtful touch was the free pack of belachan given to all mothers. The food was good, serving up traditional Peranakan flavours just like home. Indoor seating is limited, but there are alfresco outdoor seats as well. A great spot for comforting Peranakan food.",

The taste of the slow cooking dishes was sensational and with so many different layers of taste, the consistency as tender as it gets. As a bonus, the lady from the restaurant explained to us the background and philosophy of each dish when it arrived. Considering the superior quality of food and laid back atmosphere of the restaurant I felt that the prices were extremely modest. Thank you.",
