Kudos to one of the staff in assisting, when i was curious how big the room was, gave me suggestions on the room that i should take, and even showed me how to use the system. Didn't catch his name, he is a young gentleman that wears a jacket. Very passionate and polite !",

      "text": "Visited on a busy Saturday night. The equipment is new, and each room has its own air purifier. We appreciate that it’s a non-smoking facility, although we did experience a brief issue when someone(found out later, a foreigner who didn’t know the rules) in another room tried to light a cigarette. The smoke traveled through the HVAC system and entered our room. However, the staff handled the situation very professionally — they addressed it immediately, reprimanded the guest, and ensured it didn’t happen again. They even offered us an extra 30 minutes time extension as an apology, which was a nice gesture. Overall, a good experience despite the minor hiccup.",
