      "text": "One of the better, quieter libraries in the west, tucked in a cozy corner of Pioneer.\n\nIt is a simple but effective library for both students and members of the public, with a unique semicircular shape that reminisces of a modern-era Roman amphitheatre, or it could be futuristic in that sense.\n\nThere are plenty of spaces to study or just to relax, albeit with controlled noise. Most study spaces have their own charging points as well, so you're covered. When you enter at the 2nd floor, you will be drawn to the odd shape of the building, as you would either have to turn sharply left or turn right to find spaces along the narrow walkways, flanked by rows of bookshelves.\n\nStudy spaces are on the 2nd and 4th floors, while a cozy cafe is situated on the 3rd floor and is usually populated by students hanging out.\n\nI love this library as it holds a ton of unreserved books that are usually heavily rented in other NLBs. These are quality books, either biographies or histories. One example is 'Neither Civil nor Servant', fully booked in all NLB libraries till next year, but sitting idle on the shelf of this humble library.\n\nWiFi is ample no matter where you sit in the library, and guests can use the unsecured network for 1-hour periods. Toilets and water coolers are situated on each end of the library and are dead easy to locate. Overall, this is what a library should be like: spacious, comfortable and full of resources.",

Despite its humongous size everything was in the right place (books).\n\nWalk in and you will immediately feel the yearning to learn. Sit down and your mind will start to open up. Start reading and wisdom will fill your soul.\n\nTired? The Canopy cafe will invigorates you. Must see to believe.",
