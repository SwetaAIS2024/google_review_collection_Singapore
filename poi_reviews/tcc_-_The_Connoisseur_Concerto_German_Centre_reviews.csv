David Lum,5,We usually have our lunches and coffee with our clients and visitors whenever they are here in IBP. Itâ€™s really convenient and the service is excellent. Aisyah who has been serving us mostly in the recent months is always courteous and friendly,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113207349532907883238/reviews
Jennifer,5,"Super impressed with my dining experience here! Itâ€™s a clear five star rating for me.

Firstly, the price point is lower here and taxes are already included in the price. Hence, whatever amount you see here is nett. Since this is a smaller outlet, the menu is similar to that of an express outlet, where the variety of dishes have been scaled down. However, this in no way affected the quality of the food.

Secondly, the staff members here were friendly and personable, especially this older lady who took some time to talk to us and informed us about the membership promotions.

Lastly, the place is clean and nicely maintained. We came before lunch time and had the corner pretty to ourselves.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110520605084204408119/reviews
