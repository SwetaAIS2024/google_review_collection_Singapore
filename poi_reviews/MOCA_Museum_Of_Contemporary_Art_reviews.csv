k c123,4,"The current exhibition of oil paintings by Chinese artist 尹朝阳 at MOCA was interesting. The artist piled on thick layers of oil paints thus creating a 3D effect and interesting texture. The place smells of oil paint as soon as you walk in, a testament to the amount of paints used. The paintings are mostly colorful, some bordering on being garish, while others do look beautiful with the colors used. Some compositions remind one of Chinese ink landscape paintings. The more abstract compositions are nicer, in my eyes. He also does sculptures but these are mostly busts with twisted, monster-like faces; this does not seem to gel with his expressive , colorful landscape paintings. Perhaps a reflection of the artist’s inner struggles?",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110375681798195157814/reviews
