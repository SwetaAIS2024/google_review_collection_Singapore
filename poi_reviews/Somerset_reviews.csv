Grace ho,1,"One of the escalators is down, should have notice up to show commuters the way up or down to the platform rather than allowing commuters to jam up the gantry area. Better way to facilitate smooth human traffic during peak hours would help a lot.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100858111347252768205/reviews
Flo Yeow,5,"Somerset MRT station is a very interesting set up, being one station away from Orchard, and Dhoby Ghaut. It's home to the many malls that have flourished around here, all strung up by the underground walk ways.

Station has been around for a long time, yet it's still clean and very well maintained. The station also connects to the many Bus Stations that you'd likely need to transit at.

Personally I like to leverage Somerset as a slightly strategic place to transit, given the many sheltered walkways they have established, so whether rain or shine, you'll have protection getting from place to place.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Luke Phang,5,"The MRT station located between Dhoby Ghaut and Orchard. You can visit several shopping malls directly above here, notably 313, Orchard Gateway, Centerpoint, Scape and Cineleisure. H&M's flagship store and Pan Pacific are also nearby this station.

If you're feeling adventurous, alight at this station and take a stroll towards Dhoby Ghaut or Orchard MRT to enjoy the sight and sounds of Singapore's shopping district!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117681118694147432030/reviews
Vom Sandro am Albis,1,"Ticket machines do not accept credit cards for reloading the rail card, the information desk refers to the ticket counter and there we stood in line for over 30 minutes. Very customer unfriendly. So riding the subway during the vacation is no fun.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106023994001691028472/reviews
