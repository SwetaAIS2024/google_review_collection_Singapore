      "text": "I just discovered this hidden gem of a home-based coffee business and I'm hooked! The couple running the show are warm, personable, and total coffee connoisseurs. They're passionate about what they do, and we had interesting conversation about coffee.\n\nToday's flavor, Lychee, was a revelation - rich, smooth, and utterly delicious. I wanted a new cup as soon as I've finished one. I love that they source high-quality beans and change up their offerings frequently to keep things fresh and exciting.\n\nAnd the best part? It's an absolute steal at just $3 per cup! I've paid double that for lower quality coffee at  cafes.\n\nIf you're a coffee lover like me, do seek out this home-based biz. You won't regret it!",

Extremely rich mouthfeel without being overbearing, with a subtle hint of fresh lychee fragrance in the aftertaste. No regrets ordering at all! üëç Would probably have regretted if I never tried their coffee üòÇüëç",
