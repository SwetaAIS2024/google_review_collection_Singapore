Lilian Sim,5,Thank you Ron for the awesome experience in framing our artwork and photos! From intending to frame 2 artwork in our first visit to returning multiple times to frame more artwork and photos! It was truly enjoyable going through the artwork and hearing Ron's proposals of how different frames would bring out different effects of the artwork. Thank you very much! We will definitely be back again!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114875610520117195384/reviews

CHOO Emily,5,"Chance upon Framelines Gallery website while google search to frame my painting. Was glad that I chose Framelines. Ron is very patient and professional in providing many suggestions which helped me in my final choice of frames. I have ended up getting him to frame two items. While the cost is not cheap, but it’s the overall service and end products that satisfied your soul :)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116722276647443257479/reviews
