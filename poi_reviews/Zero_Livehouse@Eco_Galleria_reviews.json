The young waiters and waitresses are busy playing with their mobile phones and every time we need anything we need to ask them to come over. They did not even put coasters on our glasses. I think the management need to give some training to them. In the end, we have to bring one bottle of whisky back after spending less than 2 hours there. However, the live band is good.",
