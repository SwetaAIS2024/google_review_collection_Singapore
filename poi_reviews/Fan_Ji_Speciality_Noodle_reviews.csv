Richie Ng,5,"There’s something incredibly comforting about a well-made bowl of pork soup noodles, and this one did not disappoint. The broth was rich and deeply flavorful, with a perfect balance of umami and sweetness. It had that slow-cooked depth that comes from hours of many ingredients, making every sip satisfying.

The noodles were cooked just right—firm yet springy, soaking up the broth without turning mushy. As for the pork lard, it was very crunchy, with just the right amount of fat to keep things indulgent but not overwhelming.

Overall it was a heartwarming dish that delivered on both taste and texture. Whether you’re craving comfort food or just looking for a solid noodle dish, this is definitely worth trying.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100862545602288578155/reviews

LP Pua,5,"Ordered a bowl of Mee Pok with Prawn for $7, which I initially thought was pricey. First impression: the portion of Mee Pok seemed small, but I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the prawn. The Mee Pok was slightly hard at first, but after a few bites and stirring, it reached the right texture and paired well with the sauce. The bowl of soup was packed with ingredients, justifying the price. The prawn was fresh and even better than what I had at a famous prawn noodle stall the week before. Overall, it was an enjoyable breakfast.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Timothy Chong,5,"Perfect bowl of BCM. Easily my favourite in sg! Noodles super springy and umami, with an extremely comforting bowl of soup that is packed full of flavour and different ingredients.

This store hits different. It is clear that they emphasize on freshness and quality. Makes me want to eat again and again! Chilli on the side super good too!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112687873823645442560/reviews
