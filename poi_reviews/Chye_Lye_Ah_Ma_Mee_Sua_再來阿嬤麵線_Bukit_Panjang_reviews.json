      "text": "Probably the best Mee Sua in Singapore. Very smooth Mee Sua, rich and tasty soup with a pinch of rice wine. Very generous with ingredients including thick slices of liver, handmade pork ball, mushroom and egg. Asked for other type of vegetables but they said won’t match the Mee Sua taste, gave me more spring onion instead. Seems like they are really serious about their food. $4 for a large bowl, really worth it. Usually long queue, try visiting during weekday afternoon when there is less crowd.",

The soup is flavourful and does not feel thirsty afterwards.\nIf take away, stall will pack separately the soup and mee sua, so the mee sua will not turn soggy.",

      "text": "This is a noodle dish where pork is the main ingredient. In the bowl, it has minced pork meat balls, normal meat balls, pig liver, pork slices, egg, decent mushroom slices.\nIt is served with these ingredients inside a big bowl of hot soup. The soup is delicious, and tasty. The smallest bowl that I have is of $4 but it is enough to fill up an average sized guy like me. During cooling weather, this dish tastes especially nice.\n\nBesides mee sua (thin noodles), they serve 生面 which is thicker noodles.",
