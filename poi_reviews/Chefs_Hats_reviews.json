Its location is quite good right behind the bus stop so I know now. The pasta dishes are so good. Fried crispy and hotly served. Lava cake was superb. Reasonable price. Surely will be back again!",

      "text": "Had a really great time at Chef's Hat! I went with the mixed grill and the white button mushroom soup for dinner—both were spot on. Simple, delicious, and cooked just right. The service was warm and attentive, and the price felt just right for the quality. But what really stood out to me was the vibe of the place. It felt super homey—lots of laughter, people chatting, and just this cozy, happy atmosphere. Honestly felt like having dinner at a friend's house. Definitely coming back!",

      "text": "Located in a small neighbourhood mall, this is a small steakhouse cafe with cozy environment and atmosphere.\n\nThe mains are nicely seasoned and cooked with love.\n\nTheir sides are of course great - healthy, delicious and elegant.\n\nHowever, if you are a steak enthusiastic person, you will need to understand that this is not really a steakhouse. The steaks, although delicious, are more towards a relaxed genre.\n\nOverall, it can be abit costly as the steaks are rather thin for the price. I would rather recommend their spaghetti, which is more of their specialty. (I lost the photo for this).",

      "text": "Best place in the neighbourhood to get my fix of delicious pasta. This place has been around for more than 10 years and I’ve been a returning customer ever since it’s opened.\n\nI love their aglio olio as well as their cream based pastas. The pastas are easily customisable, and you are also able to upsize the portion as well. Their grilled items such as the pork chop and chicken chop are always cooked well, and really yummy as well. They also have lunch set menus on weekdays which are more affordable.\n\nThe husband and wife owners are always present at the establishment. They are always friendly and hospitable, greeting us whenever we visit. Will continue being their loyal customers!",
