The staff was warm, welcoming, and very professional, especially nurses Jess and Angie, who went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable and informed.

G gan,1,"I booked a pneumonia vaccine appointment on the MOH website for Jan 3, 2025, at 11:30 AM. However, when I arrived, the staff informed me that they didn't have stock.
