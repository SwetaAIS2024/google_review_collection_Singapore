Although during the day time the sun might be too strong, but the atmosphere is the early morning and late afternoon are nice and breezy.\n\nAs mentioned by others, it does not have toilet facility. The nearest one will be across the green grass at Kopitiam @ Acacia Breeze. Hopefully when the small food court at Saraca Breeze is opened, we can have access to nearer toilet facility.",

      "text": "Good place for morning walk, I can't run nor jog due knee cap issues thus can only walk. Get to see some nice birds fly/hopping from tree to tree (nice green/yellow colour bird), also happen to see some ants (hubby says looks like termites ) building up huge nest at one of the rocks facing block 513 traffic lights - do not know where to feedback on this. See some area leaves dried up, er maybe covid thus leaves are on the grounds all over. Many people jog, run, brisk walk n exercise too, good to see they do do safe distancing too, hence safe to have walks in this park.",

Very well-equipped and I’d highly recommend visiting and using its facilities around 6.30am to 8am in the morning. It’s a great way to start the day.\n(My friends and I practise parkour conditioning exercises here fairly often. Feel free to join us!)",
