ernesta cheong,1,"A Wednesday 9.30am at Jurong East Pickup to KL. Firstly, it was late for almost an hour. It came this old coach (not with transtar brand), noisy engine, fallen seat cushions, malfunctioned air-conditioning system. Added was driver's reckless driving. We were almost thrown off the seats multiple times posing safety hazards. I had expected Transtar to maintain its standard as a top coach service provider but now it's not.
