Catherine Goh,3,"Mee Hoon kueh and chicken rice is really good. 5 stars. The rest are meh. The worst is the current bao and dim sum vendor. Never had such bad dim sum. Everything is way too sweet. Tried the specialty lo mai kai, Chee Cheong fun, har kao, siew mai, xiao long bao and HK style chee Cheong fun. Really bad except for the xiao long bao that’s edible but the skin is thick and hard. Filling tasted too porky.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117456296229518057665/reviews
Richard See,4,"02 May 2022: Landed at FoodHub 59 for early lunch. Saw one person in the queue and decided to order wanton noodles soup from CHEF KIN HK WANTON NOODLES. Nice savoury soup, springy noodles and the wanton is really good. We also ordered from RONG CHENG ROU GU CHA…peppery style bak kut teh, soft juicy meat, soup is really shiok and topping of soup is allowed. Enjoyed our yummy lunch and would to love to come back for other interesting choices.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101090694756471719639/reviews
