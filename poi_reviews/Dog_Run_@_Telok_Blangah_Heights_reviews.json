The space itself is rather small but the bigger sins would be the lack of shade trees or a water point.  Also why all the sand? a simple check with other dog runs will show that grass is best.",

      "text": "There are dog runs that get it right, and then there's this dog run - a sand pit of swirling disappointment. All dogs really need is ample room to run about off leash, but this narrow gated space is stuffed to the brim with unnecessarily enormous agility obstacles, random concrete boulders(???), way too many benches, and dirty sand with NO wash areas. They say big dreams happen in small spaces, but this dog park is no more than an awkwardly placed white elephant in the middle of an HDB cluster.\n\nI won't be returning unless I want to remove sand from my car and house for days after, or get a panic attack every time my dog almost collides with the hard structures. Did the construction team even consult actual dog owners when they built this?!",

With all the oversized agility items, my mid size dog barely have enough place to RUN! What a Dog Run!\nRest assured, dogs that visited will each bring back some souvenir home. Either loads of sand all bounded in their fur or they can have some snack of crackling sand! It's a compulsory souvenir as there is no water point to clean up as well.",

Step right up to this 'unique' dog run experience ‚Äì tucked away in a hidden area between a multi-story carpark and HDB block. üè¢üöó\n\nPrepare yourself for a sandy escapade, complete with 'beach vibes' courtesy of the sandy terrain that generously gifts you with a sand bath every time your dog runs. üèñÔ∏èüêæ\n\nAnd let's not forget the pi√®ce de r√©sistance ‚Äì the strategically scattered green Mario pipes! Because that's where you can hide if you do not like the sand bath from your dogs. üçÑüê∂\n\nFeeling the need for speed? Unleash your pup onto the circular sandpath and watch them go ‚Äì just remember, it's a tight squeeze, so limit the race to just 1 participant at a time! üèÅüêï\n\nIn conclusion, if you're in the market for a dog run that prioritizes creativity over practicality, look no further!
