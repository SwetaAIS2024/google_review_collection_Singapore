The standout, however, was the friendly and efficient service provided by the counter staff. Considering the quality of the food and service, the prices were very fair.\n\nAddition for the owner: The staff who served us is in the picture. It was on 4 Dec '24 around 18.30",

Surprise you tiao had different kinds - normal, sesame, almond...not bad at all. You tiao not too hard, it is tasty and good. Appreciate the staff to check how sweet I would like my bean curd. Definitely recommend this place.",

Assam fish can be a little sour at times and the space can be tight during lunch hours but other than that it's alright. Will definitely miss the auntie when I'm no longer working nearby to patronise the shop",
