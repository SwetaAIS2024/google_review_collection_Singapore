The chili sauce provided was not good. Suggest to eat on its own.\n\nPeanut ang ku Kueh was soft and peanut filling has the right balance of salt and sugar, unlike some others where it is sweet.\nUnfortunately they use synthetic paper as the base to steam rather than coconut / pandan leaves..",

      "text": "There's good and bad..so good part first. Curry and sardine puffs are nice but quite expensive, $1.90 each. Putri salat also still nice, not too sweet. Plain Chee cheong fun is very nice and no weird smell! They sell 10 rolls in 1 pack. We unrolled it at home to add filling and steam abit. They never give sauce so we made our own too.\n\nBad part... Huge disappointed... Peng kueh & soon kueh there used to be very nice but now quality drop badly. Skin for both is super thick. Can microwave Abit to soften it but thick skin isn't nice, it's unbearable. Soon kueh filling is very bland, no taste. Fried yam cake is quite bland and the amount of yam have decreased, taste more flour now.",

This is the worst 白糖糕 ever. 白糖糕 supposed to have 米香味, but this has nothing.\n\nGlutinous rice is bland, tasteless, dry and hard. Is it that hard it is to make it better?\n\nThe soon kueh and ku chai kueh skin is so thick beyond belief. The filling is also tasteless and not delicious to a point I feel it’s a torture to go for 2nd bite. Is it just this batch of kueh has such standard? What happened to those 5 stars given by others?\n\nIt’s not about the money, it’s about you make consumer pay for non palatable food and end up the food goes to the dustbin. Waste money waste food. Not recommended.",
