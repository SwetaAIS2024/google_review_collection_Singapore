Jordan Atchison,4,"The hotel was decent but the rooms were very, very small. We actually had inquired about upgrading and were told that we were already in the largest room, which including a full and twin size bed with hardly any room to move around. The 4th floor swimming pool was fantastic. The hotel dining was less than convenient though.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111393913759349697630/reviews
