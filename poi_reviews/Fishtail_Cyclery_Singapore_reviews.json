It was an absolute joy to deal with them. I made an appointment to have my first NJS Fixie build done, and everything was delivered timely and error-free. I also learned so much during my time there. The environment is quiet and nice, with Kopi-O and hawker stalls in front.\n\nI highly recommend them and will always come back for more!\n\nRIDE YOUR BIKES and chill out lah‚Äù - Marcel",

Then I returned to the shop and asked them to make it shorter, but they didn't want.\nI had to try so hard to convince them and eventually managed to let them do it right. They were clearly not happy and didn't tighten up the rear wheel. So on the way back home, the rear wheel came off üòÖ\nAlignment was ridiculously bad as well.\nI attached the photos.\nOh btw, I was over charged as well. So amateur.\nAgain, don't go there!",
