From understanding my aspirations and passions to shortlisting colleges and guiding me in my applications and esaays, they have been super helpful. I‚Äôd like to thank the entire team for helping me build a strong profile for college. I‚Äôm excited to start my journey at Duke University.",

      "text": "Guys don‚Äôt go for this consultancy. Trust me, the person who contacted me for initial call couldn‚Äôt answer my questions and was moving in circles. After 15 minutes she said that she wouldn‚Äôt be able to move ahead with this and then the call ended.\n\nEdit: Answer to the firm‚Äôs reply.\n\nI don‚Äôt know how you understood that I am looking for a ‚Äúfree of cost‚Äù service, when I didn‚Äôt say that at all.\n\nYes, I agree, your firm spends a lot of time trying to find naive clients or people who simply don‚Äôt want a world class education and just want to go to average schools. According to your firm, clients can only thrive at average schools where your firm can actually get them admitted. I asked during the communication if your firm had any admits at any of the world top 10 schools for my course, and the answer was unsurprisingly ‚ÄúNo‚Äù.\n\nAlso, I have communicated with a lot of firms during my admission process and you‚Äôre the one and only firm who supposedly ‚Äúcan‚Äôt proceed without parents‚Äô consent‚Äù. Your firm called me first and then when I asked for more details regarding the conversation I was told that we can‚Äôt move forward without parents‚Äôs consent. Why did you call me in the first place then? üòÇ\n\nIf someone is legally an adult and capable of funding the education themselves ( or even taking a loan in their own name), who are you to say whether you need to be in contact with my parents or not? Of course my parents would‚Äôve been a part of the process, this is not a small decision for anyone. But, I won‚Äôt disturb my parents for such a bad firm, who can‚Äôt even handle my questions, let alone my parents‚Äôs questions.\n\nIn a nutshell, your firm was incompetent, didn‚Äôt have knowledge, didn‚Äôt have any record of previous admits at any of the world top 10 schools for my course, and then you expect me to connect you with my parents. Sure, why not.",
