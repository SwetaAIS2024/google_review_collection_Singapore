      "text": "Kitty and I recently concluded a dinner at BKK Bistro & Bar in Punggol Settlement. Kitty had discovered their legendary $0.80 boat noodles online, which definitely piqued our interest. Although we opted for a wider variety of dishes this time, the allure of those incredibly affordable noodles remained.\n\nOur order included two Chang beers, glass noodles Tom Yum prawns, rice noodles Tom Yum pork, glass noodles herb beef balls, rice noodles herb beef, rainbow sticky rice, and the Thai fish cakes, which were the clear standout.  The fish cakes were absolutely exceptional, perfectly crispy on the outside, incredibly flavorful, and cooked to perfection.  A true highlight of the meal!  The other dishes were also enjoyable. The Tom Yum soups were flavorful and well-balanced, and the beef dishes were tender and savoury. The only disappointment was the rainbow sticky rice; while the sticky rice itself was good, the mango was, unfortunately sour, lacking the sweetness we expected.\n\nWe observed many patrons ordering the 80 cents boat noodles, and from what we saw, the small portions seemed perfectly suited for sampling the different broths and meats.  The total bill, including service charge and GST, came to around $50,  a very reasonable price considering the generous portions and the high quality of most of the dishes.\n\nThe atmosphere was lively but not overly crowded or noisy, making for a pleasant dining experience.  The service was prompt and friendly during our visit, although online reviews suggest this can be inconsistent.  We experienced efficient service with friendly and attentive staff.\n\nOverall, BKK Bistro & Bar provided a tasty and satisfying conclusion to our staycation.  While the boat noodles are obviously the main attraction, the other dishes are well worth ordering too, particularly those amazing fish cakes.  It's a great place for a casual, affordable, and delicious Thai meal.",

      "text": "BKK Bistro & Bar (Punggol Settlement): Delicious Thai Food and a Lively Atmosphere (4/5 Stars)\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n• Food Quality: 4.5/5 (Exceptional Thai fish cakes, delicious boat noodles, other dishes enjoyable)\n\n• Value for Money: 4.5/5 (Reasonable price for variety and quality, especially considering the famous $0.80 boat noodles)\n\n• Atmosphere: 4/5 (Lively but not overwhelming)\n\n• Service: 4/5 (Prompt and friendly during our visit)\n\nOverall: 4/5 Stars\n\nBKK Bistro & Bar, located in the convenient Punggol Settlement, provided the perfect ending to our recent three-day staycation. Donkey, who’d discovered their legendary S$0.80 boat noodles online – a fact that certainly piqued our interest! While we opted for a broader selection of dishes this time, the reputation of those incredibly affordable bowls certainly added to the excitement.\n\nOur order included two bottles of Chang Beer, a serving of Glass Noodles Tom Yum Prawns, Rice Noodles Tom Yum Pork Slice, Glass Noodles Herb Beef Ball, Rice Noodles Herb Beef Slice, Rainbow Sticky Rice, and Thai Fish Cakes. I must give a special mention to the Thai fish cakes – they were absolutely delicious, perfectly crispy on the outside and wonderfully flavorful. However, the Rainbow Sticky Rice was a bit of a letdown. While the sticky rice itself was well-prepared, the mango was unfortunately quite sour, lacking the expected sweetness.\n\nThe boat noodles, while not the focus of our order, were undeniably delicious and a testament to their reputation. The portions, as expected, were small, but perfect for sampling the different broths and meat options. The total bill, including service charge and GST, came to S$49.64, a reasonable price considering the variety and quality of the food. We’ll definitely be back to try those famous S$0.80 boat noodles next time.\n\nThe atmosphere was lively but not overwhelming, creating a pleasant dining experience. While service was prompt on this occasion, we've noted from online reviews that it can be inconsistent. However, our experience was positive, with friendly staff and efficient order fulfillment.\n\nOverall, BKK Bistro & Bar offered a tasty and satisfying meal that perfectly capped off our relaxing staycation. While the boat noodles are the star attraction (and something we're eager to sample!), their other Thai dishes are well worth exploring. We'd happily return for another meal, especially for those delectable fish cakes! I would recommend this place for a casual and affordable Thai dinner.",

Accepted the staff’s apology due to lack of manpower. Broth was good but prawns were mushy.",

Went for their 80cents boat noodles, but it’s surprisingly tiny portion and I feel their tom yum flavour is not that good, but rice noodle herb beef slices is good. Love the environment, maybe we went on weekday, so it’s not that crowded, very chilling. Will definitely go back and order more food to try again in future!",

Comfortable for couples and family members to dine and have a little drink. Try most of the bowl noodles and is very nice. Only for the claypot lala glass noodle is abit too much of the dark sauce(salty).",
