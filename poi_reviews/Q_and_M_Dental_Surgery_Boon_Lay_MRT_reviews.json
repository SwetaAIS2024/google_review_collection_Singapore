      "text": "I visited the clinic on 25/11/24 due to a chipped tooth that required an immediate filling. Dr. Joey Chen was a friendly and engaging dentist who ensured I was comfortable throughout the procedure. However, on 20/12/24, less than a month later, I noticed the filling started to feel loose, and using a flashlight, I could see a visible line. This was disappointing, as the previous filling on the same tooth lasted over two years before it came off due to a fall. I feel the recent filling may not have been done properly and hope that it can be rectified.",

      "text": "First time visiting this clinic and also first time visiting Q&M in general for routine dental procedure (scaling and polishing). Left pretty disappointed due to the following reasons\n\n- As a first-time patron of this clinic, I would have expected the dentist to spend more time to assess the condition of my teeth, since they have no prior records. Dentist went straight into the procedure without any assessment done.\n\n- The scaling and polishing procedure took  1 year ago . All my prior experiences with other clinics usually take about 30mins at the least.\n\nAll in all, I left feeling disappointed and questionable on whether my teeth was checked properly, or even cleaned properly, which is exacerbated by the fact that clinic has such great google reviews. Not sure if this is common standard across this franchise or just my luck that the dentist that attended to me didnt seem too invested in the work. Will definitely have to reconsider whether I should come back again.",

      "text": "I recently visited Q&M clinic; Boon Lay outlet for a consult as I was having pain in my lower molar. I must say I was extremely impressed with the level of care & professionalism I received. The staffs were friendly & welcoming. The facility was clean. The clinic smelled so good, just like hospital standard. The dentist was thorough & knowledgeable. I felt comfortable throughout the consult. Which made me fix another appointment with the same dentist, Dr Koh Teck Chuan; the same week itself to remove 2 of my wisdom teeth. Not forgetting, Nurse Elna, Lee San & Aisyah, thank you for making my dental visit a pleasant one. I highly recommend this clinic to anyone in need of dental care! :)",

He recommended extra services to fix my teeth which I agreed (but later found out that he did extra filling which I was charged for...)",
