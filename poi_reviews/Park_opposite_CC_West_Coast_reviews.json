Here, is where you can jog, walk, or just roam without the risk of being knocked down by errant cyclists or foggies on Personal Mobility Devices.\n\nThe hilly terrain is challenging. The free ranging chicken fowl is real. The occasional squirrels a bonus. The magnificent view enthrall. The air- ever so fresh. The tranquility - precious.\n\nBut you must first find out where to park your cars - that's a state secret",
