I arrived around 7pm expecting a queue, but luckily there were still a few seats available.\n\nI had never tried frog porridge before and couldn‚Äôt quite imagine how it would taste, but it completely exceeded my expectations! The frog meat was incredibly tender and bouncy while the porridge was so smooth and soft. you could almost eat it without using teeth, haha!\n\nWe also ordered cockles and grilled fish, which were both fresh and full of flavor. The dishes came out quite fast too, so there was no long wait.\n\nOverall the experience was satisfying from start to finish. üëçüèª",

Open daily from 11:00 AM to 4:00 AM, it‚Äôs super convenient‚Äîjust a heads up, it gets really busy at night and into the late hours.\n\nThe menu has all kinds of frog dishes like frog porridge, claypot frog, and fried frog, plus seafood, chicken, and veggie options too. You can choose portions for 1, 2, or 3 people for the porridge and claypot frog, so it‚Äôs fun to order different spice levels and share with friends.\n\nDry Chili Frog (ÂÆÆ‰øùÁî∞È∏°)\nThis one‚Äôs spicy! It‚Äôs frog cooked in a sweet soy-based sauce packed with dried chilies. If you‚Äôre not big on heat, go for the Ginger Spring Onion version instead. The frog meat includes legs, shoulders, and more‚Äîtastes kind of like a cross between cod and chicken. The thighs are especially juicy and flavorful!\n\nGinger Fried Frog (ËíúÁâáÁÇ∏Áî∞È∏°)\nThis dish has chopped frog pieces lightly battered and fried until crispy. Each bite is crunchy on the outside and tender inside, with a simple salt seasoning. Don‚Äôt forget to dip it in chili sauce‚Äîso good!\n\nPlain Porridge (ÁôΩÁ≤•„ÉªÂ∞è)\nLime Juice with Sour Plum\nIce Jelly (ÊÑõÁéâÂÜ∞)",

I decided to try the famous Kung Pao Frog with porridge which is highly recommended on social media. The plain porridge is lightly seasoned with ginger, pairing perfectly with the tender and flavorful Kung Pao Frog. It was quite enjoyable! ü•∞ The owner also suggested trying the Singapore-style grilled fish, but I felt the seasoning was a bit overwhelming. Then just noticed other places offering promotions like 3 frogs for $18, making this spot feel a bit overpriced üôÅ",
