The app somehow changed my location to another location and she still tried to make it work instead of having me travel all the way to another branch just to get my food. Patient and kind and knows what to do when there’s an issue.\n\nThank you Katherine! :)",

At around 8:20pm I was standing too long after 1 hour to make my payment by cash. Many customers are waited 1 or 2 HOURS to get food on time after order were mixed up not in sequence. 2 staffs are rude & bad attitude.\n\nAnd also NO sprite & no ICE at all. To use my Coke instead. That I order 8676 my receipt. Won’t come back again. After my food receive @ 9:42pm is 2 HOURS & 20 minutes.\n\nI give ZERO star.",
