STEK TAN,4,A small Japanese restaurant that serves a large assortment of Japanese food. The sashimi was surprisingly fresh and good. Rest of the dishes such as the tempura as well as salmon mentai rice bowl was decent too. The only thing I don't like is the green soba noodle which had a metallic taste. Place is small with a small indoor area as well as an outdoor area by the side walk. Reservation is recommended.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109294014164387963929/reviews
maria umali,5,"First of all, I love the service (Very attentive and warmly)
Secondly, this is officially my favourite sushi go to place for a high quality and quick fix.

What I ordered:

- Aburi mentai hotate don (10/10!!, Every bite was soo succulent)

- Salmon sashimi (100/10!!!, This is one of the best and freshest salmon Iâ€™ve ever had. It literally melts in my mouth)

- Uni 20grams (8/10, Portion is really worth the price but quality is not too bad. I love how creamy it was with each bite)

- Ikura sushi (9/10!, a burst of umami in your mouth)

- Aburi mentai hana maki salmon (6/10, Least favourite as it was too salty for me)

Overall damage: $100++ incl. gst & svc charge

I will come by soon again",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110937521727032152738/reviews
