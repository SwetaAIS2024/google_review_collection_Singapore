J2 ACE,5,"My three kids went to CGM between 2009 and 2020. After the experience with my first child, I had absolutely no seconds thoughts that I would send my second and third child there. Even though I had moved homes and had to travel quite long to get there, I did so without any hesitation for my third child.
These foundational years really helped my children and myself as a parent as their solid curriculum is a two fold approach that involves parents. I would recommend this kindergarten to anyone who is looking for a nurturing place for their child to develop, learn literacy and numeracy skills and develop healthy, respectful relationships with peers and teachers.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109762724136950869504/reviews

Grace Ho,5,"My daughter was here for 3 years from N2 to K2. Now she is in P1, and I'm very grateful for the foundation she has had in CGM. This kindergarten is rather more old-school in terms of parent involvement, HBL and ""play"", but I think they have prepared my daughter very well for P1 in terms of academics. The teachers were very available and Mr Pang the administrator most especially. I'm also grateful for how they have taught the faith to my daughter. Thank you, CGM!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115137057510300821962/reviews
Esther L,5,"My 2 kids have studied in this preschool since they turned 4 yo. Mrs Choo, the principal and Mr Choo (the vice-principal) are very nice and patient people. Some of the teachers in the school have been rather nice although I admit 1-2 teachers have been rather fierce. I like that the school gave them homework as now that my children are in primary school, they are used to doing homework after school. The transition from preschool to primary school is easier for them. I don't mind it alot of homework but just enough to get them to practise writing and doing Maths",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104969476524894989110/reviews
Tony's Onions,5,"I studied here, 13 or so years ago. It was a perfect balance of education and fun. They didn't force the religion on you, and treated everyone equally. The teachers there really loved children and it was evident in my time there. Everything was clean and I looked forward to go everyday. Lots of songs too, I even remember some, like ""jesus loves me yes I know, for the Bible tells me so"" accompanied by the little actions to accompany the song",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107950863462693990532/reviews
