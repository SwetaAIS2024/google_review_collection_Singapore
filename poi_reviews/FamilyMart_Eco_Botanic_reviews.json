The staff were friendly and welcoming, making the visit pleasant. A convenient spot for a quick, casual meal or snack break.",

      "text": "So this is actually one of my favourite FamilyMart branches. The aircon is not arctic... haha. So it's comfortable to sit here and have a meal. My unfortunate experience of the other FamilyMart branches in the vicinity has been extremely bad customer service.... However this branch, the staff was very pleasant and attentive. Cashier was wearing a mask, but you could tell she was smiley and friendly. And she was willing to help me when I asked for a straw for my drink and some tissue paper, unlike in the past where the staff looks at you like you told them something really offensive when you ask for anything. They were well stocked, and have some really interesting drinks too in their selection. Good job to the Eco Botanic branch and please keep up the good work!",

      "text": "Why am I forced to queue with Oden buyers when I'm not even buying Oden? There were four staff members and two counters — an express counter and an Oden counter. Yet, only the Oden counter was open. One staff member was busy attending to Oden customers. When I approached the express counter, I was told to pay at the Oden counter.\n\nHere's the outrageous part: After serving the Oden customer, the same staff member immediately started scanning items for yet another Oden buyer, completely ignoring me even though I was right in front of the counter. Are you kidding me? You chose to ignore a waiting customer just because I wasn’t buying Oden?\n\nWhy should I waste my time waiting for people to pick their Oden when I’m not even buying it? This is unacceptable, disrespectful, and downright infuriating!",

When asked questions, her responses were neither welcoming nor helpful. Additionally, she did not pay attention to my order for hot food but reacted unpleasantly as if it was my fault. I hope the management takes note of this and improves customer service.",
