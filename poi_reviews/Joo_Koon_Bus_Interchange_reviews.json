They sent 2 single deck bus on a peak hour, bus stop at Opp westwood Sec had at least 40-50 people waiting and most already waited for nearly an hour. There was a student worker recording the busses and another SMRT conductor at the bus stop. What a genuine waste of resources.",

Is there shortage of drivers due to Covid19 at Joo Koon bus interchange? If there is no route at 759am, pls remove it on the screen. So misleading and really not punctual. Please rectify bus 255 schedule time accurately. Thank you.",
