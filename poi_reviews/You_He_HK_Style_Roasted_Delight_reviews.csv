Agnatta Teng,4,"There was a short queue (a few person in line) on a Tuesday lunch time. Many food choices, but managed to only try the Dang Gui Roasted Duck rice this time.

Portion is big and price is reasonable at $4.30 but taste average. Rice is a bit lumpy and sticky kind which is not to my personal liking.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102986467512829632835/reviews
Jee Nee Lim,5,"I ordered the ABC soup (no rice). Good value for money ($3:80). For a small bowl, there were 4 pieces of pork rib, several pieces of potatoes and carrots. Soup was very tasty but not salty. The pork rib was soft and tender. Great for a light lunch.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101109994280504072291/reviews
ShiJie 12311,5,"This roasted delights store has changed over the years. This one is quite good, the uncle says ""Enjoy your meal"" to all his customers. The food is 9/10, chicken WILL have bones but I ordered the 3 combo meat meal, honestly I find it eorth the money. Add egg if you're feeling extra hungry.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109091097226241688016/reviews
