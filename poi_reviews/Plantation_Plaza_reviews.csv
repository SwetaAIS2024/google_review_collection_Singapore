Capture Asia Photography,2,Still a lot of empty premises. At least there is proper foodcourt and spacious Giant supermarket. There are more fast food restaurants on ground floor around the corner. Overall still a work in progress. Will review next year again if i am back.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113796572659279486041/reviews
Alvin Li,4,"First and foremost, Plantation Plaza is nowhere near Tengah Interchange, do not make this mistake!

After waiting 6 months, we decided to venture down to check out Plantation Plaza. Even then, they are still not fully open. Thankfully, there are enough amenities to live by.

Basement 1 is mostly functional, with a Giant supermarket, snacks, health products and DIY shops. R&B Tea (a rare sighting right now) is having a nice minty chocolate drink.

The access to the car park is here.

Presently, there is a convenient homeware showroom at the atrium (or what you call the central area on the first floor) for new flat owners to furnish their BTOs.

Level two and three will mostly be a combination of F&B, retail and services. There is a link bridge to the Community Centre (closed at the moment) and another link bridge to MRT station (still in construction phase).

Koufu sees the biggest crowd, with dining in and takeaway diners aplenty, who wishes to have their meal before heading home.

There is also an unmarked row of amenities leading outwards from level one. Look out for McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut, 7-Eleven, Daiso, Thai Food, Enrichment Centre. You can spot them on Google Maps.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101636040394390892825/reviews
Raymond Lee,5,"The service was great, with friendly waitstaff. The restaurant manager was also very polite. Just a small suggestion: the seating arrangement could be improved. Some tables for two are quite small, and I noticed that a single seat was placed at a table meant for four.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107590983128837540418/reviews
