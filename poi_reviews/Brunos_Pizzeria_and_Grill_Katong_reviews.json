Serving Italian fair that’s well priced yet fantastic. Portions are pretty generous as well. Their pastas, pizzas and mains are good. There’s quite a good selection of off menu items written all over the blackboards on the walls that deserve a try. It’s a place that you can definitely visit when options run out.",

Escargots could have had more salt to my taste but that was an easy fix.\n\nOnly small thing to complain was toasted bread, which was way too hard and crispy to be able to obtain the taste from cold cuts or escargots. And as bread basket instead was mouthwatering this a little strange but that’s splitting hair.\n\nTiramisu topped with chocolate sauce was a bit sus but given not a single atom was left behind I guess it gets my seal of approval as well.",
