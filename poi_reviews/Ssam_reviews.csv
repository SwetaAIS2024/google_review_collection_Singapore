Colin Tan,5,"Super value Korean BBQ set at RM 115 with 2 types of BBQ pork, seafood pancake, soup and more than 10 types of side dishes! More than enough for 2-3 pax. They have kids rice too. Also they BBQ in the kitchen for you so you don't have to do it yourself.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100214940784614789355/reviews

YNEZ,5,"I went there on Monday evening for dinner. They offer a generous amount of refillable banchan, which is so fresh and delicious.

Everything was great, especially the pancake! The pork belly pairs well with a type of marinated leaf, I’m not sure what kind, but it really suited my taste buds!

The portions are huge, so be prepared to take some of your dishes to go. The way they prepare the take-away packaging is also very professional. Highly recommend!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108865220016118725753/reviews
Janice Koh,5,"Restaurant looks simple and ordinary when we stepped in.  First time being served 15 side dishes in a Korean restaurant, amazing! Ordered the Ginseng soup, just nice and not too overwhelming. Recommend this place.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101680492463479383776/reviews
