Ming Hui,4,Quick lunch at the maple business city area. It's a fast Korean food kind of place. Tried the beef bibimbap with an add on for steam egg. I would say the food is not too bad but it would really be just for quick lunch. Not like something that will blow you away. Instead it would be the coffee beside the food area that is more interesting.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108198322351045531056/reviews

CWL C,4,"My first time trying this coffee. The staff recommended vanilla latte and I gladly accepted but without sugar syrup. To me, itâ€™s  a little sweet but still acceptable. Remember to ask them donâ€™t put sugar syrup unless you like it very very sweet (they put 2 pumps syrup by default!). I was there during off peak hour, so thereâ€™s 50 cents off the coffee. Staffs are friendly. Will visit again to try other stuffs. ðŸ˜Š",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114665379022288092577/reviews
Nurul Mimsy,4,"Quaint spot in the middle of MBC, a shared space with Paikâ€™s Bibim. Their food is not halal but I went there just for the coffee. Pretty quiet spot thatâ€™s only busy during morning rush or lunch hour.

Weirdly, their original Paikâ€™s Iced Coffee wasnâ€™t available at this branch. Got their Iced Caramel Macchiato instead and it was too sweet for my liking. ðŸ˜£ But otherwise, nice spot for a quick coffee session.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102522653922194368534/reviews
