XY Lim,5,"Newly opened snack franchise store from China at the basement of Vivo not far from the escalators. The store stocks a wide selection of snacks ranging from sweet and savoury and also has freshly roasted chestnuts. The cookies and pastries all tasted quite natural and aren't sweet.
The store was pretty crowded due to their opening promotions but the staff did their best to assist and give out samples to try. Worth a visit to check out the interesting snacks!
[And no, this is not one of those paid 5 star reviews, just giving 5 stars because it's their first day of opening and I can see the staff are trying hard and the products taste nice]",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109785791498103122701/reviews
