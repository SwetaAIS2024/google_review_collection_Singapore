Yew Leng Goh,5,2nd visit to the clinic and attended by the younger Dr Victor Gan.  He genuinely tries to understand more of my conditions before dispensing the appropriate medicine. The staffs were very helpful in assisting me with the claim against my company's insurance company when I first visited 2 months ago.  My chronic medicine is quite expensive and this clinic carries them.  I was there at 11am and out within 30mins.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105914899298005575069/reviews
Phyllis Ng,1,"Worst attitude from a doctor I have ever seen. There were no patients in front of me and I had to wait 30 mins. When I went in presenting my symptoms (bad migraine on 20th week of pregnancy) to him, the doctor actually had the audacity to ask me why I am having migraine in a bad attitude. I had to name the obvious and tell him I came to see a doctor to get diagnosed.. He also likes to powerplay his patients by staring at them for 20 seconds without saying anything. Except from prescribing me with panadol, he did not check me for anything else.This is by far the most unprofessional and unqualified doctor I have ever seen. Highly discourage anyone feeling unwell to see this doctor as it will only make you feel more stressed up while already unwell. I think the overall reviews are telling of his skills and professionalism.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110618123912311350759/reviews
Isabel Yee,5,"I have been to this clinic for years now, and the doctor here has always given the best treatment he can give. Although he can be strict sometimes, he's very experienced and knows what is best for the patient. Not to mention, it is also cheaper than most other clinics found at void decks of a HDB flat. With all these factors combined, what's not to love about this doctor?

Note: The queue here can get quite long during peak periods, be prepared to wait if you intend to go during these times.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103660320944900255839/reviews
Kelvin Heng,1,"Worst doctor ever. Bad manners, attitude and super arrogant. The sign board put 2pm to 430pm and I reached at 2pm. Door was closed and I called the number to ask. He said ""ya la opening now la, you cannot wait meh."" That is no way to treat a patient. When I went in, he just stared into my eyes for 20 seconds and asked me what's wrong. this doctor is unprofessional to the max. Please do not visit. I would have given 0 stars if I can",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112289621791041350246/reviews
Luv Honest,4,"Visited clinic a few times n noticed doctor comes in later than opening hours.  Understand from staff that he does visiting to old folk home.  The clinic's business seems very good, always see non-stop influx of patients. Price is considered reasonable n sometimes lower than most clinics at HDB flats.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108527516643880174030/reviews
