N T,2,"Closing hours at 10:30pm, but at 8:45pm this aunty with glasses start packing up chairs sweeping floor with customers still around, dragging chairs everywhere, sweeping dust up when people eating, very very annoying. Management should really look into it. Whats the point of stating 10:30 when at 9pm all the chairs already packed up and blocking the enterance, people will think its closed and it ruins the experience of people eating there. This way, they are paying for labour when no one comes in thinking its closed. I got my food pretty fast though unlike other review",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114465691278468973439/reviews

hawa isa,5,"Staff at the cashier was very welcoming, even though it was night time and was low on customers at the time I came.

Food was up to standard, and I chose the wrong type of chicken, and he was quick to assist so that I could change it to what I wanted. However, the samyang double down burger, was a bit cold hence a little tough which may be due to it, possibly, being reheated a couple of times. Which we could tell from the taste.

Other than that, we were really craving KFC and was so glad that this outlet was open 24 hours. Just wished there was an outlet neare to us, in Woodlands, that was 24 hours.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108085351406798695193/reviews
