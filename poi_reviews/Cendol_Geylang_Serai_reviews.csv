Anirban Mukherjee,1,"Got the take away cup (with ice). It was spoilt.

I made the mistake of going after 3 pm. Apparently they do ice only take away after 3. That’s fine, but I guess they pack the remaining product at the end of the day. That’s probably the reason it was spoilt. Long day + time to pack drink. It smelt and tasted funky (I eat chendol once a week or so … I know exactly what it should smell/taste like).",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116402824517768858025/reviews
demilios fercudo,1,"There was no customers and yet the bowls were sold out, a huge price difference between the bowl ($2SGD) and the takeaway cup ($3SGD).
No red beans are included, so avoid if you prefer authentic Chendol.
Utter waste of time and money.
Not recommended.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113605988652487121722/reviews
