      "text": "Well, I guess they are rated at an average of 2.6 stars for a reason. I did my MRI on 11-Feb-25, 5pm. I was told MRI report would be sent to me the next working day. Guess what? It‚Äôs 14-Feb-25 and my doctor‚Äôs follow-up appointment is happening within an hour and I have yet to receive my MRI report! Had to call up their hotline just to get them to rush out the MRI report. How accurate can that report be if they have got to rush it out? Absolutely disgraceful service quality. Ludicrous. Period.\n\nUpdate: They deducted $300 from my CPF-Medisave on 20-Feb-2025. It‚Äôs 10-March-2025 now and I‚Äôve yet to receive $300 from them. Not even sure why they‚Äôre withholding funds that are rightfully not theirs!",

When I asked why didn‚Äôt the nurse turn on the machine earlier, the answer was they were not sure if the patient would turn up‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the point of having medical appointment if they wait for the patient to turn up at the door to start anything? Ridiculous\n\nNot forget to mention they also charge $1400 for a treadmill ESG test, there are better private clinics elsewhere for better service and cheaper price",
