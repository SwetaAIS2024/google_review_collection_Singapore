The menu has a wraps with drink meal besides ala carte egg, tuna, chicken sandwiches, big croissants, muffins and chocolate squares, not forgetting the beef pastrami croissant with homemade special sauce. And there's the unique Beef Rendang Pie  Its meat filling is tender, moist and authentic.\nAll items very affordably priced. I would have to pay more elsewhere. Go grab them since they're newly opened (on 1 October 2022) and initiatives of young food-preneurs. We'll done, Ming & partners.",
