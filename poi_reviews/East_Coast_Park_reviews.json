The hawker center has something for every taste, the walk paths and surrounding areas are well maintained and groomed. There is an automated water ski lake with three levels of difficulty for every skilled level. Very beautiful and serene place to spend time.",

      "text": "We had an amazing day at the Swan Valley Cuddly Animal Farm with our two kids! From the moment we arrived, the staff were super friendly and welcoming. The kids loved feeding and cuddling the baby animals—especially the lambs, bunnies, and guinea pigs. There were also goats, ponies, alpacas, and chickens roaming around, which made the experience even more interactive.\n\nThe tractor/train ride was a big hit, and the playground kept them entertained for ages. There’s plenty of shaded seating and picnic areas, so it was easy to relax while the kids explored. It’s such a wholesome, hands-on place for young children to learn and have fun. Highly recommended for families visiting Swan Valley!",
