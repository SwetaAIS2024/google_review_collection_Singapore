      "text": "His upma was uncooked . So I informed the person at the counter and he took photo and said will inform the cook. It was a genuine feedback from me as it is below my office.\nSubsequently during lunch after a few days when I went to buy the owner confronted me and said if his mutton is not cooked I should not complain in a very rude way before other customers . In a way very hostile that I would not come back to his stall again.\nSo next time friends donâ€™t give feedback to the stall .. inform singapore food authority with the pictures and let the owner face it legally with SFA.ðŸ˜‚",

Also marinated well and cooked perfectly.\n\nOverall one of the best briyani in Singapore (in my humble opinion)",
