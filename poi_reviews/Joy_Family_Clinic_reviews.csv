Anna Tong,5,"Dr Penny Lo is a very caring sincere doctor. Although I am also put off by the impolite manners of the front counter staffs, having a good honest professional doctor is far more important to me.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117887188450773974417/reviews
Jenn,1,"""Wait la, the doctor is still writing!"" The reply given when I asked if my turn was next and one of the 3 receps looked up from her phone, and said ""Yes, after this.""
""After this"" meaning...? The patient had exited a couple of minutes ago. So I mentioned that and that rude reply given by another recep - a more senior one maybe?
""Why was I so impatient? Can't I wait for my name to be called?"" - that was the implied message beneath it.
Was she unhappy with her life, her job? We are patients to the clinic, ill and waited for 2hours to see the doctor. I don't think a polite reply is difficult to be uttered. Or a simple ""We will call your name when the doctor is ready to see you.""
Last visit to this clinic. They won't miss me since they're always busy but just to inform future/potential patients.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106516935875859596041/reviews

She examined my body carefully and meticulously. She is very conscientious and I am deeply impressed by her attitude and service.
