Porter KHOR,3,"Short handed.  Tables at peak hour not cleared.  Felt sorry for the elder lady behind the counter.  Owner should call for last minute gig workers rather than overwork the one person.

Again it's not the employees fault. More of the employer not getting enough labour to support.

Food wise same as usual.  Won't win Michelin stars anytime soon",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115681434361834317527/reviews
Yan Ting Lim,2,My friends and I ordered flat white and latte on 7 Dec. The latte was quite cold and the flat white’s taste was lacking. Not to mention the absence of latte art. It was quite disappointing as I had good experiences at the other Cedele outlets eg HillV2.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117799853721059393396/reviews
antonio fiorentino,5,"What a lovely discovery! I enjoy the cappuccino here very much, hot frothy and delicious. It s a great place to unwind and relax in tanglin mall. The sandwiches and cakes are also very inviting. The lovely owner and  staff are extremely kind and welcoming. I found a little place I can call a local on my every visit in Singapore",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109740706973658647527/reviews
Nikhil Verma (NV7),1,"The bakery is small, and there is very little variety for food. The sandwiches were off the mark and tasted very avg. The cheesecake wasn’t too great either. The quality of the food is a major concern. Moreover, the order took too long. The staff were too ignorant to understand the simple instruction that we wanted the coffee along with the food and not after, despite repeating it twice. The food was overpriced too.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116934338148395790613/reviews
Peter E,1,"Unfortunately this was a disappointing experience. The sandwich was drenched in the aioli sauce to the point I had to request napkins to soak up the sauce. Otherwise it was inedible.
But more inconvenient than that, their drink selection was not conducive to kids so we purchased some drinks at a nearby Boost.
After receiving our sandwich and attempting to sit down, we were told “no outside drinks”. So we were kicked out and forced to deal with the sloppy and not very tasty sandwich.
Will not return and don’t recommend. I should have seen checked the reviews first.
What a waste of money and time
Update. We threw the sandwich away. Such a bad experience we will never visit any Cedele Bakery ever again",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111330457178677601741/reviews
