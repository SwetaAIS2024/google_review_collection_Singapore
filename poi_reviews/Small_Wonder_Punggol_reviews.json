We have our four month old infant enrolled to the school and on the first day of reporting the school teacher informed us that they are not aware of my child being enrolled on the day. Despite multiple email communication with school on the registration process and all payment has been done, the school is not informed of my kid’s first day. So what they suggested is to come back the next day so they can have enough manpower to “sort things out”. this is crazy beyond imagination.",

      "text": "Has been queueing and waiting for 5 years but no vacancy is given to me yet. And I just live beside their school, the vicinity isn’t one of their considerations for enrolments. Their staffs kept saying the priority all goes to those who elder siblings. That’s being so unfair for those with 1 child only like me, we will never get a chance to enrol our child in this sense! It’s a ridiculous rule.\n\nThe worst thing ever is I have never ever once receive a call from them asking me if I am still interested or letting me know if I am still under their waiting list or not. I cannot even bother to call them up to enquire as I think they are totally not interested and they cannot be bothered with someone like my case who has only 1 kid. Very disappointed to know this preschool is popular yet very irresponsible and unreliable!!!\n\nNow my child is entering P1 soon but still no SINGLE CALL BACK from Small Wonder Punggol, very lousy & irresponsible preschool!",
