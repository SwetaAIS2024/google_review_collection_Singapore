      "text": "Unique location that is hidden within the golf range. Outside seats are available, which allows you to take full view of the golf play.\n\nThis is a really food place for couples of drinks. Their drinks are rather affordable and have high standards of yakitori.\n\nThe owner recommends the ox tail curry rice, so i orders. It is certainly delicious, flavorful curry and generous portion of oxtail, which is tender and goes well with the curry.\n\nTiny deep fried prawn and mentaiko french fries are very good companions to your drinks as well.\n\nOverall, its a excellent place for relaxing.",

      "text": "The seats were mainly outdoors next to the driving range, with a couple of tables indoors. The skewers were very succulent and tasty. Highly recommending the oxtail curry rice. The oxtail was extremely tender and the curry reminds me of a good rendang. The portion was generous but it was so delicious we finished it in no time and even licked every drop of the curry off the plate, haha. We'll definitely be back soon to try other dishes.",

      "text": "Wide selection on the menu - karages, chargrilled & yakitori sticks, soba, udon, curry rice, etc. nice little chill place w alcoholic drinks - beer, wine, soju. Situated inside the golf range on L2. Opened till late. Kitchen is available from 12pm-10.30pm for food. Really enjoyed the smoked duck soba (cold), had a strong sesame taste & aroma. The Kani (soft shell crab) karage though crispy had a little after taste of oil. Tea is served in a pot.  Probably can provide napkin/serviettes for diners. Overall nice ambience w ample paid parking. Overall satisfying dinner.",

      "text": "Donkey and I recently visited Tend Bistro, a restaurant located within a golf course. While I had been there before and praised the pleasant ambiance despite the higher prices, this time I invited Donkey along. To Donkey surprise, the actual size of the restaurant was smaller than expected, with a cozy feel and interesting decor like beer towers and crates in the dining area, shaping the overall atmosphere.\n\nThe service team seemed a bit lackluster, but we tried to infuse some energy into the vibe. One standout was Yan, a staff member with a positive attitude. We chatted with her about the crowd and the restaurant's ambiance.\n\nWe ordered the smoked duck Goma soba and the Yakitori Platter, both of which we enjoyed. The duck dish had a satisfying flavor, and the Yakitori Platter was reasonably priced and delicious. We were pleasantly surprised by the Chuga Makgeolli on the menu, a fusion drink mixing Japanese and Korean influences, although the quality didn't quite meet our expectations.\n\nThe bill totaled SGD 74.55, including the dishes we ordered and a service charge. We also noted the subpar air conditioning and the lack of interaction from a woman we speculated might be the owner, impacting the overall experience.\n\nSome menu items were pricey, but there were also reasonably priced options like the Yakitori set. We noted the happy hour promotion offering discounted Heineken bottles until 6 p.m.\n\nOverall, we rated Tend Bistro 4 stars, considering factors like the atmosphere, staff energy, and pricing.",
