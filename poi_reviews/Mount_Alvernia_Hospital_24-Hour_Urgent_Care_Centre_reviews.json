When we arrived at the A&E for admission as referred by our doctor-in-charge, we informed the reception nurse the doctor in charge name and we also informed our doctor that we had arrived. We arrived at 11am and still waiting when is 2.20pm, not admitted yet. Nurses were all looking at their computer behind the reception counter rather than attending to patients outside. There were many patients still waiting at the waiting area to be attended to.",

      "text": "Visited on a Wednesday night around 9.30pm due to persistent high fever from Tonsillitis. Waiting time was only around 30-45 minutes including seeing nurse and doctor. There was no crowd at that timing and the Urgent Care Center was peaceful.\n\nRegistration was quick and easy, just scan the QR code with your Singpass and the hospital can access to your details without having to produce a physical IC.\n\nNurse provided good service, took my BP and asked important questions to ensure she gathered as many information as possible before seeing doctor 5-10 minutes later.\n\nWas seen by Dr Shaun Rama and he was really professional. He gave advice on when I should come back/where to go if symptoms do not subside by which day.\n\nPersonally, I feel that pharmacy and cashier should switch places as hospital should allow patients to check on the list of medications first before payment. However, on that day I was told to make a payment first before checking on the medications which I felt did not make sense.\n\nSure enough, I had 2 medicines which I didn‚Äôt want to take as I already have them at home (ibuprofen & famotidine) because I saw a GP that very same day in the morning. In the end, we had to go through the trouble to reverse the first payment and to charge a new amount again which felt unnecessary if we were allowed to check first.",
