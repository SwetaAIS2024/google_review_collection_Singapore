Flo Yeow,3,"This is the final stop right before the Newton Circle, and before any buses were to turn elsewhere. It is also the bus stop to alight at, if you don't have a choice but have to change to Newton MRT.

It's a nice quiet bus stop, and right by some of the expensive condominiums in Singapore. That said, there's no full shelter to the train stations, but there's some good shelter leading you toward Newton Road, to switching buses that come from Scotts Road, if you need to.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
