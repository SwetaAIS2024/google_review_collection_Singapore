Soup pack a punch of favour. Pig tail soup on the other hand was generous in the portion of meat but lacks favour, a little watered down. Try their pumpkin rice , very decent mouthful of goodness.",

Your team need to be trained again in food hygiene. Soup tasted inconsistent. Hope can be improved. Will still patronize again as this is my favourite stall. Hope improvement can be made.",
