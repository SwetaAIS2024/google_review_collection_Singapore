      "text": "The fish head curry at Canto Jumbo is an absolute delight and easily one of the best Iâ€™ve tried in a long time! The dish is a perfect harmony of flavorsâ€”rich, aromatic, and just the right amount of spice. The fish head is incredibly fresh, tender, and packed with flavor, while the curry itself is a masterpiece, with a balanced blend of tangy, savory, and slightly sweet notes. Every bite is a burst of deliciousness, and the portion size is generous, making it a truly satisfying meal. If youâ€™re a fan of fish head curry, Canto Jumboâ€™s version is a must-tryâ€”itâ€™s a standout dish!",

      "text": "Have eaten at Canto Jumbo now twice, meeting a colleague and friend when I pass through Singapore. A classic coffee shop restaurant. If you are looking for fancy dining in aircon, this isnâ€™t it. Itâ€™s an open air restaurant on the curbside of the road. Excellent food with a wide selection of crab, seafood, chicken, meat and veg dishes. Better chili crab than Iâ€™ve have at stalls and restaurants that specialize in such. The food is good, the beer is ice cold, and you can waddle into the kitchen to wash the chili crab off your face and hands. Highly recommend.",
