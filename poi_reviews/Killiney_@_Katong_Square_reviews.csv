siawhing goh,5,"I was so disappointed after being treated rudely by the staff here. I would never come here again. But I found out this morning that the staff changed, so I came here to try it out. I found that the coffee maker had a nice smile and wore an apron. He explained the difference between coffee and coffee c very politely. The point is that the coffee he brewed was rich and the amount was well controlled. I felt that I was passionate about this shop again. Hope owner will not change this coffee maker üôèüèª",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117091384978075857196/reviews

Perrine Cavat,1,"Should have read the reviews before coming‚Ä¶ tasteless and tough curry chicken, gloopy curry sauce, cheese sandwich served fridge cold. Avoid, plenty of better places to go for a good kopi / toast breakfast.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103614592592591638316/reviews
KKT,4,"The Kaya here is so luscious üëç!
Bread toast softens quickly so eat asap when served.
Coffee just traditional but lacks cafe aroma.
Half boiled eggs are overly cooked to me.
Laksa quite delicious...",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399770588752359508/reviews
Shane Raja,4,"Paid a total for $11.20, extra $3 for the 2 hotdogs. I ordered the Laksa with Milo. Overall it‚Äôs okay, I mean you‚Äôre getting average food. Usually I‚Äôd have the kaya toast here. The staff could be more friendly and smile more but other than that I‚Äôd rate this place 4/5. A good alternative to the Cafes nearby, I quite like that it is hidden also. I sometimes have meetings here too.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115714455413461623586/reviews
