It offers a good selection of snacks, beverages, travel essentials, and basic groceries. The store is well-stocked and efficiently run, making it a reliable stop for last-minute needs. However, prices can be slightly higher than regular stores, which is expected at an airport. Overall, it's a handy spot for quick purchases before a flight.\n\nThank you, and God Bless",

Needed to exchange some large bills that I got from the ATM for smaller ones, so I opted to buy a drink here. There is a large selection of canned and bottled drinks to choose from, as well as an extensive snack selection. The size of the store was surprisingly big as there were a lot of products to choose from. If you are a quick nibble or drink, this store is well-equipped to fill your needs.",

Immigration gates are now automated with I'm Officers ready to assist you along the way, physical booths are still apparent yet kiosk are more now. You wont get a stamp you arrived (or left) in SGN, you will get an email notification. A link to the other terminals is located at the far side on the right once you get out of immigration. Before that you will see a lit of kiosk providing sim cards. For now it has a big cardboard pop up of the monopoly man. As always, Changi has set the standard of what a clean and modern airport is. Glad to have flown here again. #RP",
