Fairy,5,"The roast pork, roast duck, and cha siu were of good quality but were cut into very small pieces.

I like this stall as it offers vegetables, making the meal well balanced.

This food centre is quite hot, even with the large fans.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110707374703256523409/reviews
derek neo,4,"Overall taste is quite good, worth the price if you just want a quick duck fix. However, you get what you pay for. Duck is not as finely cut as restaurants and a much smaller size. The wrap itself is also not as soft.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113015523826545524096/reviews
J Lim,3,"Ordered the peking duck ($52 + $2). While food was ok tasting for a coffeeshop standard, I would say there is some value at the price point for food which require more skills to prepare. A higher rated on service as the staff patiently shared how to make hot the duck.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110038663296565266404/reviews
Chut Michelle,1,"Location is not easy to find. Came to try out after reading the articles online. Very disappointing. Ordered half a Peking duck, roast pork and char siew. the meat is not chopped properly. Perhaps the chef lack skill. Feel that the roast meats from supermarket is more value for money.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112180304554421855489/reviews
Happ Red,2,"I came across Zhou Chu Ming's TikTok about the Tham’s Peking duck at his Bidadari kopitiam and decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, the experience was very disappointing.

The service was poor—staff members looked unfriendly and unapproachable. I ordered a full duck to try. The presentation of cutting the skin were ok.. nicely placed on the keropok.
While the skin was decent for the price, the meat was cut into overly large pieces and was very tough to eat. They didn’t ask if I wanted the carcass, so I had to specifically request it, only to find there was still a lot of meat left on it.

The wraps were soggy, the keropok was stale and soft (""lao hong""), and overall, the meal did not meet expectations. We couldn’t finish the food and asked to pack it, only to be charged an additional $1 for the packing. On top of that, we were charged another $1 for extra sweet sauce.

This was my first visit, and it will definitely be my last.

Now I know why not many people order their food. A lot of customers there eating the bak chor mee and mala staff or the Malay food.
I will try other stalls.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116955132625319682425/reviews
