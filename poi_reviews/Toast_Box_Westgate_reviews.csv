Geoff Holmes,3,"2024-09: Simple local food at a convenient location from the MRT and mall, with a view of the upcoming ITH site.
Often busy at peak times.
Food seems mostly prepared in advance fast food style, so not the place to go if you have higher expectations.
Rotating specials on advertised on sign boards outside.

Jone Par,5,"Always my comfort coffee, But today was Wow... Laksa gravy thickness just nice, not overly powered. The ham and cheese was great today cos the bread was covered and toasted with butter.
