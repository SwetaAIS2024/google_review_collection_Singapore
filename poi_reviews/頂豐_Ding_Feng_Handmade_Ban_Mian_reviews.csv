nicnicxun,4,"First time trying food at this Hawker Centre. Food much more better than blk 633. Normal taste not salty just nice. For those prefer spicy can ask boss to add more chilli as it not very spicy tbh. Attentive to customer, unlike some stall in same shop not paying attention just know how to chit chat only.
I like the banmian texture, serving just nice.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105369917600002020050/reviews
Jacqueline,4,"Handmade ban mian has great firm chewiness texture! Satays are rather small and thin, especially the pork ones. Texture of otah felt like there's a bit too much flour and a bit too sweet for my liking. Staff are friendly and polite.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117874191110003037272/reviews
