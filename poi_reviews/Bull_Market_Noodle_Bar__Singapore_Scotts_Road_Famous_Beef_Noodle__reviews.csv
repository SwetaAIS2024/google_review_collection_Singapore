yong thefoodmonster,5,"“Bullish on flavor! 🥩 Bull Market Noodle Bar serves up long-hours boiled rich broths, tender beef, and noodles that hit the spot every time.” Started from a humble store in Scotts Rd, now charging into 43 Craig Rd with a revamped menu anchoring their 4-Generation passed down recipe and culinary passion, aims to bring the best beef noodle to you, the way it has always been. 😋

What we tried; 😋
🐂 BULL CHARGE 🌟
🐂 BULL OX FACTOR
🐂 BULL MARKET 🌟
🐂 BULLIONAIRE

Our favorites are marked 🌟.

What I like the most is their mastery in handling the need, it has no gamey smell, super tender and melting beef,tendons/tripe, non-rubbery at all. They take pride in using only premium ingredients to serve the best quality at reasonable price making it accessible for everyone to try. 💯 👍🏻 my only complaint is the plating/presentation can be improved. 😊",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114149027050066921329/reviews
Jasper koh,5,"I just had an insane dining experience at Bull Market & I’m definitely coming back for more.

Tried their bull market noodle and was really blown away when I mixed the noodles, sauce & A5 Hokkaido Snow Wagyu beef slices.
I also tried my friend’s bowl of noodles with A5 Hokkaido snow wagyu steak. O.M.G.
Who even does that…

On top of that, I also really enjoy their highball with Laphroaig whisky. It had a really nice smoky, peaty flavour towards it.

Thank you chef & owner Abel for whipping our awesome dinner up. We will be back for more.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103969433559486829987/reviews
Food Kakis,5,"They have a limited time 1 for 1. promotion on their A5 Hokkaido Snow Beef, 🥩 Bull Charge Noodles (U.P. $28) till 7 june when you show @foodkakis video. Located near Outram Park/Maxwell MRT,  they pride themselves in serving the legacy of Singapore’s true food heritage, reimagined through the lens of affordable luxury ✨.

You need to try two of their famous beef noodles:

🐮Bull Charge (Soup)
A5 Hokkaido Snow Beef Shank, OZ beef tendon, NZ beef tripe, wagyu collagen broth, flat rice noodles, cilantro, beef chilli aioli

🐄 Bull Market (Dry)
A5 Hokkaido Snow Beef, wagyu collagen sauce, sago vermicelli, scallion, beef chilli aioli.

Unlike other beef noodles which uses ordinary grade of beef, they use A5 Hokkaido Snow Beef 🥩 which is considered a rare and highly sought after delicacy! The A5 Hokkaido Snow Beef has a luxurious, buttery flavour and melt in your mouth texture 🤤.

We also tried their Merchants’ Fish Soup 🍲 and the Prawn Mee Race 🦐 which we also enjoyed very much! This is the place to chill and dine while enjoying a modern take on a variety of local food with great company ☺️.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112276475321726019597/reviews

Tim Tam,5,"I’m staying at a hotel nearby and decided to give this place a try and I’m very glad I did. From the creative finance-themed concept to the warm atmosphere and, most importantly, the incredible food, this newly opened restaurant delivered exactly what I look for in a dining experience.

I ordered the signature “Bull Market” dish and was blown away: the wagyu beef was tender, the noodles perfectly cooked, and the broth rich and flavorful. Chef/owner Abel was incredibly friendly and shared the story of his family’s culinary tradition, which made the meal even more memorable. While I don’t live in Singapore, I’ll definitely be back the next time I’m in town.

One final note: I believe older reviews may be for a different restaurant previously at this location—don’t let them deter you from trying this gem!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117142291032268974418/reviews
