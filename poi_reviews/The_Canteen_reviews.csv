Joyce Lim,5,"Avocado milkshake from juice farm is 2.50 here, 50c cheaper than juice farm outlets in shopping malls, but tastes a little weird sometimes, like not fresh. Wanton noodles with charsiew add roasted pork at 5 bucks was very tasty, aunties serving me was polite and friendly. Taste of Thailand pineapple fried rice was 5 bucks, my daughter loves it and keeps asking for it. Indulge grilled chicken rice with edamame, onsen egg and corn was 6.90, tasty too! Will be back to try the duck rice and kway chap.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114306834103372851451/reviews
