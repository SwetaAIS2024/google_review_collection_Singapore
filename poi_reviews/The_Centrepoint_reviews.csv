David Lee,4,"The mall holds a special place, a nostalgic mall filled with cherished memories. While it's evolved over the years, its familiar layout and mix of shops still evoke a sense of warmth. Though perhaps not the trendiest, it retains a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere, making it a reliable and personally significant destination for me.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118189120962645425435/reviews
SeungJun Kim,4,"The Centrepoint is an interesting mall at Orchard which has non-Orchard vibes. This mall has interesting tenant mix - mainly focused on the arts (dance, Taekwondo, music) and aesthetics (jewellery and fashion). There's a random Beauty in the Pot on the top level as well. Fun to drop by whenever I'm at Orchard. It also has those random games that they constantly change according to the trends - like Animal Kaiser and Pokemon Gaole.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100958975977925692266/reviews
A B C Traveller,5,Old mall that has been renovated many times. It is located right in the middle of orchard area. It is more suitable for families. It still has the same smell of the furniture shops and carpet shop.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116585614877993483182/reviews
Ashley Liew,5,"The Centrepoint truly has stood the test of within the busy ever-changing Orchard area. I have been coming here with my mother since I was a child decades ago, and now it is somewhere I can bring my own! They have reinvented themselves with a nice renovation, with stores like Decathlon on ground level and Cellini on third level providing many offerings. There are restaurants for everyone too. Will be back again for sure!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
