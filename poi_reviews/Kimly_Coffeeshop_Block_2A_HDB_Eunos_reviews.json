      "text": "Small popiah ($4.5 for 2 rolls, 4 small pieces per roll) probably because the hawkers are stingy on the ingredients. Taste ok with nice crunchy bits but nothing remarkable.\n\nBeef hor fun from zichar stall was unremarkable, quite tasteless. Not to mention poor service - staff assumed I was taking away without asking me, probably because I was carrying my bag when I ordered. Didn't apologise upon realising, and when returning the amount charged for takeaway.\n\nWouldnt order from these stalls again.\n\nThe only good thing was that the coffeeshop is clean - perhaps that's driving the prices up.",

Noodle is bouncy and meat is just nice. Sorry for the 3-star rate but boo to the Hokkien noodles though, might return to taste test for the Yang Zhou fried rice!\nBut just fyi the queue for noodle stall is about 20mins, quite insane wait…",
