プー,5,"The other day, I was introduced to you by my senior, and I visited you for the first time. I am very satisfied with the feedback! It was good! In Japan, I often go drinking in the Shinjuku and Roppongi areas, and there are all the cute girls there, and I feel that the quality is high. I sometimes go out for drinks in Singapore, but personally this restaurant was the best! I was a little disappointed that only one out of every two girls was there right after it opened, when there were a lot of customers, but we still had a good time. I think it would have been even better if there was a food menu, but I would like to visit again when I go to Singapore again!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104378518343114053931/reviews
