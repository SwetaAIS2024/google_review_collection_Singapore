I liked the battered fish but the fries were wimpy and cold. And the salt shaker was wet so no salt. A wee bit sad, that was. Yet the service is friendly and fast and the atmosphere congenial and relaxing, so I will definitely return.",

And then tried to charge $11 a bottle instead of $12 a pint. Owner sorted but had to rant a bit beforehand for it to get resolved. This place should last. It has been well done and thought through",
