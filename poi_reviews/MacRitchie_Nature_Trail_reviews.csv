Micha L,5,"A wonderful way to escape the hustle and bustle of a big city…
Several hiking paths to choose from with varied length and difficulty levels.
The hikers have the chance to observe many native plants and animals, such as monkeys, monitor lizards, squirrels, many species of birds. I even got to see a family of wild boars!
There are toilets and water fountains available at the ranger station.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110705898470810365330/reviews
Aidan Le-Devenish,5,"Always such a nice hike, with a good chance of seeing wildlife. The closest Singapore has to a jungle trek. And it’s not too bad. Gets crowded from 8am. Try and hit the trail from 6:30am.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105895070945247841144/reviews
Forest BK,5,"🦛MacRitchie Nature Trail starts next to the entrance of Prunus Trail, winding it's way inside the Catchment's secondary forest towards Venus Link.
🦦The trail is a forest track of dirt & gravel, en-route passing two shelters, Terap Hut and Rambai Hut.
🐿️These strategically located shelters are a great place to take refuge from the sudden downpour.
🐒🐵Do not eat at the shelters. The monkeys will come for your food.
🦨The MacRitchie Nature Trail offers hikers a raw, rugged hike through the wilderness.
🦫Hike the Trail, break some sweats and immerse in the great mother nature. 🍂🍁🌿",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Estelle Cros,5,"Nice walk just before dawn. Lots of monkeys, some of them a bit agressive because of babies… careful with water bottles as they are fast! Weird big blue fish in the reservoir and lovely flowers. Will definitively go back.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105018260651386953652/reviews
Tuan Chieu,5,"In here you can also enjoy panoramic views of the verdant greenery of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve and the placid waters of Upper Peirce Reservoir.

I had a great experience here and now I would recommend this place to those who love natural beauty 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114459043999847108353/reviews
