Xling Tang,5,"Trying out Luckin Coffeeâ€™s Matcha Latte and their newly launched Oat Shakerato. Both are so refreshing!

The Matcha Latte is smooth and velvety, featuring a light, non-greasy texture thatâ€™s perfect for matcha lovers.

While the Oat Shakerato is made with OATLY Barista Edition oat milk. This plant-based, lactose-free alternative is shaken with classic vanilla and ice, creating a smooth, creamy froth in every sip. You can get their Oat Shakerato for just $0.99 when you sign up as a new user on Luckin Coffeeâ€™s mobile app, or grab a 40% off voucher from the link in their IG bio!

Besides the Oat Shakerato, they also have a launch special for the Oat Milk Latte, available for a limited time at just $4.50 until September 30th! Donâ€™t miss out!

By the way, did you know that you can also opt to upgrade to Oatly oat milk for other selected beverages on their menu for just an additional cost of +$0.50? Check their app for more info!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103954248798037993511/reviews
Perl Three,3,"Update 28/2/2025
Repeat orders for hot coffee drinks selections has been very diluted. Barely taste the coffee.

Ordered a few times since they opened. Slowly trying all the menu in the list. So far all that i tried taste great except for the extra strong americano, It doesn't taste like extra but coffee is still good. Ordering is easy with the app. Thumbs up to staff who are keeping up with their speed to meet coffee lovers needs. Great service.

Josh Kuek (#jkgourmets),5,"Luckin Coffee usually located at town area, this Waterfront Point branch was one of the rare branch at far housing area, another one at Tampines.

Its located at main lobby area, beside Decathlon store. Particularly loved their coffee with coconut milk and many others interesting flavors. Of course many are C and D sugar level. But still have lots of B and Some A drinks for selection.

Glad that Luckin Coffee coming into Singapore market, beside using good coffee beans and variety of flavors. They are very generous giving away big discounts voucher thru their Apps. Now good coffee become affordable, as compared to Starbucks that getting more expensive than before.

Definitely recommended Luckin Coffee.

Stephanie Hale,5,"Wonderful coffee. Very good good taste. This Chinese brand can easily give Starbucks a run for its money.

The cheese velvet coffee is delicious. It has a very rich taste. Hope, once the promotions are over, they are not that expensive.

A price point around $4-$5 should be good enough. But anything beyond that will be tough.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118047026544237739365/reviews
