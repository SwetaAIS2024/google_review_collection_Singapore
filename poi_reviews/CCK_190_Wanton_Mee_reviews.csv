lynn,4,"wow this stall managed to elicit praise from my fussy mom! she praised the noodles for how Q they were, and she also said that it has a 古早味 (traditional taste)

only minor gripe is that the wanton didn’t have much filling!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113035353984436054163/reviews
L L,3,"If you prefer slightly overcooked noodles and a generous amount of pork lard. This bowl of wanton noodle might just be the one you are looking for!! The dumpling wrap was probably too much in comparison to the meat filling, making the dumplings taste starchy. The soup was strangely sweet; likely attributed to rock sugar.

Ordered a large portion for $5 a bowl.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110682024260831808592/reviews
리ybbo비읍,3,"Decent Wanton Noodles. Ordered a chillis version. Noodles was normal, not really springy. Char siew has a red fermented tofu taste? Soup was not really tasty. Dumplings’s too little to get the texture ( abit of “Tee Po” dry fish), and, a bit mushy. The lady owner was abit rude today. $3 for plate is reasonable.
Will try the black version next time. Maybe it is different?",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105378886233372205305/reviews
Y C,4,Visited on a wheelchair and it was a bit of a challenge getting there in the rain. I had the wanton noodles in black soy sauce without chilli and it was springy and nice. But the wantons were a disappointment - the wanton skin was too thick and the minced meat inside had no taste. The noodles (not the wantons) are worth a try if you are nearby.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110623451475848169438/reviews
Crabby Dancer,5,"One of the rare shops that offer $2.50 portion. It is great for those on a diet. Noodles are springy and char siew is lean. Chilli is rather spicy but good thing is, there isn't lard. Definitely a healthy option without compromising on taste",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100688349581284563658/reviews
