Have not been posting previously. Love their samosas which I always ordered 10 to takeaway üòÇ.  Ordered my favourite Masala Dosa again. I love all the dips they served. A mix of flavours to my liking. Prices are really affordable for an air-con shophouse!  However was abit disappointed that we need to cancel our order for Gobi. Will be back again.  ‚ù§Ô∏è",

Very very unhygienic food as cook barely care what to provide to customer. kitchen is worst. Staff itself tells us they are using same clothes for cleaning shelf and plates too. Hygiene wise minus out of 10. Food Cost is ok. But Big NO. There are other better restaurants with good taste and hygiene at Farrer Park near Mustafa.",
