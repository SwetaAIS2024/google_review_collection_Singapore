Prawns and lala are fresh, sauces are üíØ esp the mantaiko mayo!\n\nTried their prawn vermicelli for the first time at their new stall and got addicted to it. Busting with flavours. You can customise the dish by adding more seafood or less/more pepper corns. They cooked the dish using thai garlic too. This has become my go-to vermicelli dish üòÑ",
