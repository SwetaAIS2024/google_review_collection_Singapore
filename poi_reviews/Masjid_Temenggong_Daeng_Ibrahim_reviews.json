      "text": "Alhamdullilah. Prayers at this masjid is always so pleasant. The prayer hall inside is large, airy and really comfortable to pray in. The sound system is also very effective so it adds another dimension to the overall experience. There are lots of volunteers so you really feel like this is a close-knit community who runs the operations here. This masjid is unique - it is operated by MUIS but is owned by the Johor state government.\n\nCentrally located, it is a stoneâ€™s throw away from HarbourFront MRT. For drivers, it is recommended to get there early as parking inside is limited - the nearest after that would be at Seah Im Food Centre.",

If you travelling around Vivo City or Santosa Island and have difficulty to find place for praying, you must go to this Masjid.\nI was staying for 4 days (15 to 18 April 2018) on Bay Hotel, beside the Masjid and was enjoying to pray in this Masjid.\nYou can ask people in this Masjid where you can find halal food on the neighborhood.\nI will consider to stay near this Masjid for my next visit to Singapore.",
