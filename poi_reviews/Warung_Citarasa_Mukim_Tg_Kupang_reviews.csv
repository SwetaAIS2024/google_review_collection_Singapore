Patrick Lee,5,"A Malay-style cuisine restaurant that feels like it's in the rural end of Johor, located right next to a morning fish market where local fishermen bring in their daily catch of fish, prawns and crabs (and if youre lucky, lobster) of various sizes.

Relatively affordable, it doesn't get more sea-to-table than this, where all you have to do is get your seafood from the Pasar Pendekar Laut market and ask the friendly Malay aunties manning the kitchen to whip you something.

Cooking styles will differ based on the seafood you buy, with some chit-chat with the kitchen about what you want.

To get here, just park along Jalan Gelam near a roadside market stall and the Pendas Floating Restaurant, look for the stone bridge walkway that leads you past the small mangrove forest to this restaurant.

The place is clean is enough seating for about five or six tables for a little more than 25 seating capacity, and you'll be greeted by fishermen relaxing after a morning jaunt at sea.

Note: There is little to no data connection in this area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114418190861551504445/reviews
Michelle Yip,5,"A truly hidden gem! Food is of good portion and is incredibly delicious. If you can't take spicy food, best to let them know. My favourite thing to do at this warung is to purchase from fresh seafood from Pasar Pendekar Laut and bring it to the makcik for some on-the-spot hot dishes. Would definitely come back here multiple times for some comfort Malay cooking.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101416452623848847944/reviews
Heidi Asia,5,"Very friendly and generous service accompanied delicious seafood cooked Malay-style. I enjoyed grilled turmeric squid, sea snails with sambal and jackfruit in coconut gravy! Prices are so reasonable, too. It's right by the busy jetty, walk through some mangroves via the concrete bridge..",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109417691032595115214/reviews
