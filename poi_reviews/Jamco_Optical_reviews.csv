Wesley Tee,5,"A friend recommended Jamco Optical as my wife and i were looking to make a new pair after many years.

Went to look for Bryan and he was friendly and patient as we were trying on many many frames, he recommended many that suited us pretty well. Finally we managed to find one that each of us really liked!

I chose the one by Taylor With Respect
While my wife went for Zio.

They have a wide range of frames for different budgets. All of great quality compared to those I tried elsewhere. Some are limited so be sure to grab them if you like them.

They accept quite a number of payment methods, so no worries.

The place is quite small but cosy, they have a few units beside for other frame selection. The staff there were friendly,professional and service was top notch. Felt really comfortable over there. Remember to make an appointment before going down!

Will recommend my friends & family to Jamco if they need anything from them! Thank you!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111757751266100789357/reviews
Kai Jie,5,"Jamco has a wide range of spectacles to suit different budget, and I love the higher end brands they bring in. What‚Äôs more important is that they provide great service which makes me feel super comfortable during my visit in getting my pair of spectacles from them. They were accommodating in letting me try a dozen of frames and also made recommendations on what I could get. Eventually I purchased my first pair of Yellow Plus (model as shown is Stuart) and walked away from the shop super delighted with my new spectacles.

They are located in the basement of Katong Shopping Centre and when you‚Äôre there, don‚Äôt forget to pop by and get the famous banana pie from Dona Manis Cake Shop (same level) and chicken rice from the food court (also same level)!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116040620256115569605/reviews
