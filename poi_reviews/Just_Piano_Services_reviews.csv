Augustine Cheah,5,Mr Wong did an excellent job cleaning the mould inside my grand piano. Looked like new again after he'd finished the job. Furthermore he was prepared to come over just for the cleaning. Other service providers would only clean provided tuning services were included. Highly recommended.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111847731206148687471/reviews
