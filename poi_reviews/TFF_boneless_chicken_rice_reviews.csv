Marc Seah,1,"Rude and dishonest. Asked for the bigger portion at $5.50 instead of $4.50. Was given a miserable portion of rice and the amount of chicken meat was like no difference with the smaller portion at $4.50. When asked to add more rice since I already paid $5.50 for the big portion, still had the cheek to charge me an extra $1. Paid $6.50 in total. First and last time here. Avoid this stall unless u enjoy being scammed. To the boss of this stall, U do business like this, better u close shop lah.

Färrah S,1,"used to be my fav chicken rice place but recently they increased the price (i guess it’s okay cuz times r hard) when u up the price but quality stays, nevermind. but seems like they r out to cheat their customers cuz chicken rice quality dropped, now they pack more rice but less chicken. even bought a WHOLE chicken the other day and guess wot, missing all the breast part lol never coming back ever again

can’t believe this is how they treat their loyal customers.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117337552408556089218/reviews
