Priscilla,4,"I recently visited Chez Suzette and it was a delightful experience. The ambiance had that charming Parisian touch—cozy, elegant, and welcoming. But the true star of the evening was the crepe.Perfectly thin and soft, with just the right balance of flavors. The ingredients were fresh, and the presentation was beautiful.

The staff was attentive and friendly, which made the experience even more enjoyable. If you’re a fan of authentic French cuisine—or just great crepes—this place highly recommended 👍🏻",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101272773540199175301/reviews
Hana Ip,5,"Loved this place! Food was fantastic—dessert nailed it. I am not a huge fan of orange but I love their crepe.
Outdoor area’s super chill, while the indoor spot feels cozy and quiet (AC bonus!). Big thanks to Frank, who’s really friendly and even gave me a mini tour of the restaurant. Perfect mix of vibes and flavors. Definitely coming back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109374191554971468996/reviews
LiJie Ang,5,"Chance upon this cafe, no reservation but we still got a table immediately.
All the staffs are very friendly and smiling all the time.
We tried their egg benedict and steak with fragrance rice. The bread is soft and steak was good.
Also their crepe, has a nice sour sweet taste which is different from our usual butter and cinnamon crepe that we tried before.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112086552760444998839/reviews
Jj Liu,5,"Had dinner at Chez Suzette. It’s a cosy place with a lovely French cottage vibe. The staff, especially Nathan and the owner, were friendly and welcoming, which made the experience even better.

The starters were alright — the escargot was okay, though it could have used more garlic. The house pour red wine was served cold, so do check if you prefer it at room temperature.

The mains, however, were very good — tasty and satisfying. They really made the meal worth it.

Overall, Chez Suzette is a great spot if you’re looking for a chill, easy-going place to enjoy dinner. I’d recommend it for a relaxed night out.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114184366343336860329/reviews
Yan Liu,5,"To be honest, everything is wonderful! Service is so sweet and food is delicious. I like duck leg and 蜗牛！ salad is perfect and suitable for me to keep fitting. To be honest, pasta is okay , not so great but not to bad. Generally speaking, it is perfect brunch! Love it",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105810818585361395806/reviews
