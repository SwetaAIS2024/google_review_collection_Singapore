      "text": "My daughter has tried many of the dancing schools for the past ten years and so far I would say Iâ€™Glow Dance School is the best choice for her where she can excel and develop her potentials there.\n\nBeing a Champion Dancer in Blackpool, Dimitry has very good experience in teaching Latin and Ballroom Dances. He is such a fantastic, enthusiastic and patience teacher and we can see how he pours his heart and soul (with the extra efforts) into daily lessons with all his students.\n\nI really appreciate him being so patient with my daughter and working so hard to boost her confidence. I would say we are really lucky to have found you, the BEST TEACHER in this world at this time, for my daughter!\n\nThank you so much and you are always the best!!\n\nYou are definitely worth more than 5 starts!",

      "text": "Dimitry is one of the best instructors i have encountered. He is very patient and teaches the techniques well. In fact, he goes to the extent of helping me understand how to execute the moves with clearly illustrated diagrams according to the music beats. Such is his dedication. He would also plan a petsonalised cheorography and makes the lessons interesting and not so stressful. Also useful are the exercises he teaches to train my muscles so that i can dance well.\n\nI find myself improving under his instruction and guidance and looks forward to every lesson.",

I do enjoy learning dancing from him.",
