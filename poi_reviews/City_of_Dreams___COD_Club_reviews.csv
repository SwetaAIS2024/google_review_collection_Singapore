Userless profile,3,"The club is good, the music was great. What ruined my experience was the siambu or Thai girls working in the club expecting me to diaohua/offer a flower further beyond my obligations to do so. In understanding that they are working they are not supposed to pressure a customer's will to do so.  Won't be coming back to this club anymore as I don't want to be pressured to diaohua again after all my main intention is to chill and to relax in the club after a weary day at work.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114574967466762102350/reviews
Bypaas Pass,1,"Had a bad experience with their reservation staff call ""Alan""

This guy is playing trick with people. Make customers come down for nothing and told us he didn't book the table when we had told him 4 days in advance. He said okay will reserved the table for us. When we reached there he said he forgotten ""we have to remind him again""

This method he used many time to avoid customers. He didn't even book for us in the first place. My another friends had this experience with him too. He don't intend to book for us

Trash this guy. Dont fkin Waste people time come down lah. Not the first time he been doing this. COD PLS do something about it.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107812457456317093368/reviews
