Shub Balasubramaniam,1,"Killiney what happen to you? Plastic plate, bowls n cutleries for eating in? Thats ok. Worse was the quality and taste of the food. I ordered curry chicken with rice. I had such fond memories of eating it near Middle Rd in my twenties. Firstly, chicken was hard n stale, not fresh and so bland, like it was boiled and dunked right in before serving. 2ndly, the curry had no salt, taste-wise was yucks with a very raw chicken taste in it. Revolting! $9.30 for unsatisfactory lunch. Ate the potatoes n left the chicken, it was yucky! Please dont lose your standard left by your forerunners and cut corners like this. Thats hows business run aground!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105970147040864828817/reviews
Blue Angel,3,First time here after morning run. Ordering process was simple and ample seating available. Food is slightly off the mark from the Kiliney orchard branch. The Mee Siam gravy is not so thick though.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107945861603703795761/reviews
Alethea Joy Chua,5,"A SOLID 5 STARS. PLEASE READ TO THE END.LOOK AT THE PHOTOS TOO! The owners were very friendly and nice. I had breakfast here with my mom and brother. Their Laksa and Ham and cheese sandwiches are to die for. Not only that, when I went to purchase a big pork pau, one of the owners gave me not only one big pork pau, but also a char siu pau! He said we can share among the three of us. My heart is melting as I write this. Their service is super good too, quick and easy. From my mother, she also praises the teh o peng that she ordered. I strongly recommend you patronising their stall!! There truly are amazing people here ðŸ’ž",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110594847485335772644/reviews
David Poon,3,"Tried the prawn noodle here and really like the broth which was pretty authentic to local prawn noodles, but the portion and the quality of the prawn can do better. The coffee I ordered while sweet (and didnâ€™t taste sour like some reviews mentioned) did not taste like the typical Killiney coffee we grew to love. This corner eatery is still a nice place to stop by for a break, and the sandwiches displayed did look delicious.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110685593802432093334/reviews
