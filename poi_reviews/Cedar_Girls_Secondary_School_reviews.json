      "text": "As a student in cedar, I find cedar very amazing as it is very clean, and the seniors and very nice, kind and welcoming especially on your first day of school. It is also very fun in cedar because therefore are many different activities for you to participate in. There are also houses (bougainvillea,oleander,rose,gardenia,ixora),where the school is split into these five houses and there are houses challenges every term. The teachers in cedar are also very amazing. They make sure that the students understand the key points of the lesson while making the lesson fun. The facilities in cedar are also nice.\nShoutout to ROSE ðŸŒ¹!! IT IS THE BEST HOUSE THERE!! ROSIES ARE THE PROS",

      "text": "I was at a public library last time doing homework when 2 girls from this school came and then I accidentally heard the two of them talking bad about my secondary school. My friend said that she heard them saying â€œ\"oh (my school) sucks\" \"the al range is so high they must be bad and you guys mustnâ€™t end up in the same sch as them!\" Even tho I agree that our al range is high but that doesnâ€™t mean that my school is only school that has a high range there are many other school that has high range and so what if it is high? That doesnâ€™t mean we donâ€™t have good students that score high. Even tho Cedar girl school has a low al range and is smarter than my school it doesnâ€™t mean they can just talk bad about other schools that have higher ranges than them.",

      "text": "My daughter in JC now. She doing just fine in Cedar. The admin staffs are friendly and helpful. The teachers are good too. My daughter was lucky because her teachers Mr Jeremy , Mr. Ang and Ms. Cheng being attentive and responsive. Remedial classes were offered in Sec 4 for those who doesn't doing well in certain subjects. My colleague was Cedarian too. Now she is a professional. She said Cedar is a good school. She said, in Cedar , students are encouraged in self-learning.....rather than spoon-fed. Which is true. For those students who are motivated and comfortable with self- learning, Cedar is just fine. For those who need more guidance from teachers, Cedar isn't an ideal choice. I hope this review will be useful for parents when considering Cedar. A lot of dissatisfaction will arise when your expectations not met",
