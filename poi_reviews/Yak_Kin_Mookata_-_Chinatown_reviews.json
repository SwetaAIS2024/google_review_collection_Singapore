      "text": "Trying out Yak Kin Mookata, the popular, authentic and delicious Thai Mookata spot in the town area of Singapore. Awarded  Singapore Best Foods 2023, its mouth-watering flavors truly live up to the hype!\n\nThey offer √† la carte options, Mookata platter sets, meat platters, and Lala hotpot. We were impressed by their wide range of √† la carte items and decided to go with those. They had everything we love, including Marinated Pork Jowl, Teriyaki Chicken, Tiger Prawn, Lala, Baby Cuttlefish, and more. The rich and creamy milky white soup made from simmered pork bones was incredibly comforting, and the dipping sauces were equally impressive, adding the perfect touch to the meal!\n\nIf you like beef and oysters, they also have Premium Beef Steak and oysters for you to sizzle and grill.\n\nBest of all? there‚Äôs no GST and no service charge!",

Only order chit.\n- Orders wasn't confirmed;\n- Just told to sat down.\n- But service guy was really hospitable\n- The meat was good;\n- Wasn't too thin, nor too thick.\n\nOwnself found out, they provide some photos at the front of stall.\n\nBroth was clear & mildly sweet.",
