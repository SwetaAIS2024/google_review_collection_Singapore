      "text": "My family and I used to visit Jurong Hill Park quite frequently over 20 years ago, mainly because there was a fantastic restaurant there that served delicious and affordable food. It was always a great spot for a casual meal with a view. Sadly, the restaurant closed down about 10 years ago, which led to us visiting the park less often.\n\nRecently, I had the chance to visit the park again, and it was a pleasant reminder of the peaceful moments we spent there in the past. The view overlooking the Tuas Industrial Park is quite unique and gives you a different perspective of the area. Despite the surrounding industrial landscape, the park itself is still a calm and serene place to unwind and relax.\n\nHowever, it was unfortunate to discover that the park‚Äôs remaining facilities were also closed during my visit. While it was still nice to revisit the spot for old memories, it felt a bit empty without the restaurant and the usual vibrancy it once had. Even so, if you're looking for a quiet place to chill and take in the scenery, Jurong Hill Park still offers a peaceful atmosphere. It‚Äôs a place that holds nostalgic value for me, even though it‚Äôs not quite the same as it used to be.",

      "text": "This is an absolute beauty for sunrise/sunsets, peaceful getaway in the west and for serene bird‚Äôs eye view from the highest point in the west. It feels abandoned with the garden of fame and tower accessible via a road (behind bird park), no one would explore if they didn‚Äôt know about the place. There‚Äôre cyclists, exercisers, dog walkers, bird watchers, mediators, history lovers and for seeing the planted trees by dignitaries in the past.\n\nBy public transport, it‚Äôs one stop by 194 from Boonlay and 10min uphill walk up the road adjacent to the Jurong Bird Park (should I say old, because it‚Äôs moving to The Central catchment area).",

It really brings back good memories. The Japanese food was good, and the surround planted trees by famous people and royalty who came over the years. It was known as an inspiration point.
