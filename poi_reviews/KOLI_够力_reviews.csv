Joey Low,5,"I absolutely love Koli Pain Relief Plaster! It gives a variably minty cool / soothing warm sensation depending on my body state, which I’ve never experienced with other brands. I always feel a whole lot better pasting Koli overnight to sleep. I use the orange muscle injury after an intense workout session and the classic red for lower back pain after a long day in the office. It’s a good gift from Singapore to get from the airport and it comes in beautifully designed boxes. Highly recommended!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100920247458652353672/reviews
