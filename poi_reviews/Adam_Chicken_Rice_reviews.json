      "text": "Got the Ayam Penyet for $7 and it was quite delicious. Rice is very flavourful and the portion is good. Definitely cooked with some kind of chicken stock. Chicken is crispy and perfectly salty, although I would like it to have been hotter. Perhaps they were making a new batch. Tofu and vegetables are a nice side touch. Be careful of the chili if you can't take spice. But I love how it is sweet and spicy and is very delicious. Pairs well with the rice and chicken. If you can take spice add loads of it! The chicken soup also pairs well with the entire dish. While $7 is slightly steep in my opinion, I would definitely get this again. I went at 1pm on a Saturday afternoon and it was one of the few stalls without a queue. Would definitely get this over Nasi Lemak which always has a long queue.",

The roasted Chicken are very crispy outside and soft inside...perfectly done. The chilli is very nice not too spicy. Just nice. The vendor is very friendly and welcoming. Prompt service. For $6.00 is worthwhile going to the hawker centre. Well done üëè",

      "text": "$6 for Ayam penyet. Had it as an early lunch. Soo delicious and no queue. Crispy chicken and flavourful rice that was just nice to match the chicken. Sambal belachan was the winner. It's fresh, very spicy, and fragrant with pungence- exactly what you want out of your sambal belachan.\nI dont understand why this stall has such a low rating, it definitely deserves more!\nOwner had a friendly smile too!",
