fabrice,5,"Dr Chong has been treating my right knee for meniscus, cartilage repair using stem cells techniques.
After surgery i was able tonresume sport about 6 months after and fully recovered in 9 months.
I therefore got a crashed by a car while taking a coffee, my right leg was in bad shape. He took care of it , and we are pending for other i juries to heal for scheduling another surgery for ACL and meniscus. He went to visit me during days off as well as every morning to check after me.
