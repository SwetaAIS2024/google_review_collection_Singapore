Bobby C,5,"I just sent my domestic worker to treat her tooth ache. Dr Joel attended to us. It turned out it was her wisdom tooth that was badly damaged. Dr Joel was assuring and calm despite seeing  such terrible condition of oral health. Extraction was done within minutes. Steady and confident gives patient a comforting experience. The nurse Hwee Yee is also friendly and helpful. My helper couldn't speak a bit of English but they patiently waited for me to translate line by line to her. Wonderful team indeed. Thank you Dr Joel 🙏🏼🫶🏼🙏🏼🫶🏼
