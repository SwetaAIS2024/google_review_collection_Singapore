He didn’t even assess my wife properly and kept insisting that “healthcare workers must take care of patients” not kept taking MC. My wife tried to finish her shift even though not feeling well. Then the next day see the doctor. But instead of getting better, because of this arrogant doctor, my wife became more unwell and some more embarassed during the check-up. To all the healthcare workers, who are feeling exhausted and sick, do not come and see this doctor. NOT WORTH IT.",

He also kept hinting that my illness wasn't real and that i just wanted to fake an MC. He made zero effort to hide his greed for money and kept insisting that 40 dollars was not a high price to pay for medicine (that i didn't need). Never met such a greedy and rude doctor in my life.",
