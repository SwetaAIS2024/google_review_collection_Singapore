Julia Low,2,"Chicken Chop Lor Mee $4.50 (4/10)
Gravy is thick, and very starchy, with a slight herbal sweetness. I had to add a generous amount of vinegar to thin it out, which altered the flavour profile.

The chicken chop batter had the taste of flour, which could have been improved by longer seasoning.  Lastly the hard boiled egg was overcooked, and had the sulphuric smell. This was edible, but never again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116360636909081420398/reviews
Zi Liang Ng (Zi Liang),4,"Had the 5$ lor mee. Gravy was thick but lacks a bit of flavour. Ingredients were generous. You can add more vinegar, chilli or garlic at the self-serve.

Overall recommend if you are nearby.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108052186752286239077/reviews

LULU EVOX,3,"The egg is braised to the fullness. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ like Taiwan style. Abit hard but full of favor. 1 pcs batter fry fillet , ngoh hiang & pork belly.. But to me, the Gravy is thick but not flavorful. feel Avg for it.. ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜— I guess wonâ€™t be back for it again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107012020161541736403/reviews
Osaka,2,Not worth having a bowl of lor noodles without the authentic taste. Even the ingredients are less and condiments is not refilled. Aftertaste need to drink water to ease the thirstiness.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107632274615367341328/reviews
