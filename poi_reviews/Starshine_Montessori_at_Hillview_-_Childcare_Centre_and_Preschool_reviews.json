      "text": "We’ve had a wonderful experience with Starshine Montessori. Our 3-year-old attended for five months, and the growth we’ve seen has been amazing. The teachers are incredibly nurturing, patient, and genuinely passionate about what they do. They created a warm and welcoming environment where our child felt safe, confident, and excited to learn every day.\n\nWe especially appreciated how they fostered independence, creativity, and a love for learning through hands-on activities and thoughtful guidance. Even after just a few months, we noticed improvements in communication, social skills, and problem-solving abilities.\n\nWe’re so grateful to Miss Ross and her entire team for making our child’s first school experience such a positive and enriching one. Highly recommend to any parents looking for a caring and inspiring Montessori program!",

The teachers are incredibly attentive and consistently share thoughtful updates, photos, and any important news—always promptly.\n\nWe’re especially grateful to Ms. Ros, Ms. Reva, Peng Laoshi, and Ms. Elly for the genuine care and support they gave our child. Their encouragement has helped him grow in confidence and joy.\n\nHe especially loved the outdoor playtime and the engaging extracurriculars like cooking, Brain Boosters and Show & Tell.\nWe’re so thankful for the positive impact Starshine has had in such a short time!",

The school has very good teacher to student ratio which allows him to receive attention and love. Teachers are Montessori trained and will let the children take the lead. Their ways of handling tantrum are gentle and flexible. We were happy with his progress here.",

The teachers are very patient and attentive as the student to teacher ratio are quite low. There’s frequent communication with parents and child’s progress is updated every half yearly. My son has been here since 2 years old, he loves to go to school and come home happily everyday.",
