But when I wanted to buy isotonic drinks that cost more than $10 after the cigarettes buyer, he told me the shop only accepts cash after 930pm. I asked him why the inconsistency. Then he showed me a black face and process the payment.",

      "text": "The admin staff at the cashier counter is very rude. Bad shopping experience for two times. I think is the same lady around 60 yr. First time is because there was a long queue waiting to be paid, an uncle just cut my queue, the cashier lady look at us and knows what happened, I thought she will ask me to pay first, but she ask the uncle who cut mg queue to pay without any apologize. The second time is when I am payinv for my things, I got attracted by the slime (toy) placed at the counter, I took about five seconds to choose which color I want, and then she shouted at me with a very fierce tone \"are you done?!\". I am shocked why she is so rush as there is no one queuing after me and I just took five seconds only. Horrible shopping experiences",
