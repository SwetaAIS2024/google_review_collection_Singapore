Eleanor L,1,"This Lao Yao Xiang La Guo is the worst Mala Xiang I've ever dined in. We order grilled fish, requested to add soup/water, but they said they don't have soup, so we were ok with water. After 10 minutes, the lady came to us and said they don't have WATER. So I asked her, what do you mean, if you don't have water how do you cook this grilled fish? She then said her water has added salt and other spices, she don't have water. So I asked her again, you mean you don't have a tap inside your shop? Win liao lor, she said don't have. Worst service and food isn't even thay fantastic to begin with. Attitude of the other staff were bad as hell, will never and don't advice others to dine here as well. Good food will eventually turn bad because of lousy service. She could have gave us water. Our grilled fish soup were dried up even before we finished our dish. üôÑüôÑ",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112432602881634667323/reviews

Linda Oh,3,"What do they bother put up notice ""no outside food allowed"" when none of their staff dares speak up? Ppl bought drinks/food from i-tea & hawker centre n boldly occupying the seats ignoring others' needs.

In front of the Indian Muslim stall, there are always 2 old men who seem to know the stallholder, always sitting there for hours, doing nothing ordering drinks after drinks just to sit there occupy the whole table esp now of the vivid, lesser seats",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104041836706861679693/reviews
