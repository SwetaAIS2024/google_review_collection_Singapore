Josephine,4,Nice cosy spot for coffee. Love that they have plant-based milk options!ðŸŒ± I ordered their Almond Latte - not bad but I do find it a tad diluted for my own liking.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102993754624799625007/reviews
Del Hamid,3,"Itâ€™s my first time here. I donâ€™t really expect much.
What I had: 1. A set of Americano & chocolate danish.  Coffee is a little diluted. It was a surprised that the Danish not served on a plate. Need to request.
2. Muffin and matcha frappe. A lot of ice was used to blend so much so that the frappe remains frozen. Not an ideal sight when my son had to keep sucked it out from the straw.
When we requested the plates & utensils, one of the staff gave a side eye. I donâ€™t think we were asking for the sky & moon here. Just a basic stuff.
Staff are shouting not communicating with each other. More like a coffee shop environment. If you like quiet, this is not the place.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104900919431491242159/reviews
Jen W,3,"Choose a nice-looking pie but received a burnt pie after the cafe heat it up, so I'm kind of disappointed as that was the last chicken pie available. Crust was bitter due to the burnt. The wrap tastes great.

Shop was not busy, and there are many seats available . Shop has been maintained well.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109959343059209480603/reviews

XW,4,"A cozy little cafe with a comfortable ambience. Tried the hojicha oat latte. Perhaps it would be better tasting if it has lesser sugar (I think need to say lesser sugar) . The sweetness is covering the fragrance of the hojicha. It is not too hot to drink, but not too cold as well. But overall, it's a good experience.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105730413810291799067/reviews
