Will,4,"At a corner at the 3rd floor of Harbourfront. Quite well hidden beside mother care, along ferry booth, Japan home, towards mother care.

Coffee is fragrant, eggs is a bit watery. National Day special durian toast is not bad.

There's always a crowd here, it is either crowded or very crowded. 2-4pm less crowd.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118119525043286062929/reviews

Crosby Ong,2,"Rare occasion I give this poor ratings to my favourite Kaya Toast joint but for these 2 reasons,
- refused to sell me a cup of iced water (I don’t mind tap-water). Need it for a medical condition but didn’t feel I needed to divulge this. Insisted I pay for their overpriced bottled water.
- their eggs were a little over-boiled (see photo)

Nearby, another Ya Kun at B2 of Vivocity is a lot more customer-friendly.

Sigh! Too bad.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112276992196460215229/reviews
rizki ra,2,"Bad attitude of one of the female employee. Curse while doing her job, bang all the appliances while making drinks, shows her upset face to customer while taking orders. Come here during lunch time 27apr2025",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101493877316227909814/reviews
Diane Wang,2,It took a very long time to serve the food. The auntie who prepared the hot food (laksa) has no gloves on. She is seen clearing the returned items as well. The returned items are placed at the same window where prepared food is collected. This outlet needs to be better organised and its hygiene improved. The staff are friendly though.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113755342539259173098/reviews
