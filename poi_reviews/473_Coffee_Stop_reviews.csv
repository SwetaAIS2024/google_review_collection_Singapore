Zelfy Wong,3,"I loves the food here especially the Roti Prata, and Nasi Lemak at affordable price.

but the environment are bad. As the smoking corner is very near to the non smoker area.
I always smelled the smoker smoke while having my meal.

One thing to highlight, the drink store have some attitude problem.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117648008315296752302/reviews
kevene wong,1,"Unless you have 0 expectation of the drinks that came out, dont buy the drinks from the drink stall. Not only the staff are rude, they argued with customers about their ""wrong orders"", when the actual fact is that they did the drinks wrongly.

The smoking corner is exposed, so when there is breeze, even if you sit inside, you will be getting second hand smoking.

The food is good - I will be taking away the food rather than having it there next time. Of course, wont be buying the ""wrong drinks"" anymore.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113644163301440992146/reviews

Lester Eng,5,"Tried the prata (kosong and egg) so far. One of the nicest, imo, in the fernvale area so far. The ones at jalan kayu standard has dropped alot over the years.

Bak chor mee is nice too

Will try the other stalls over time and update again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108850528755012680553/reviews
GoldCup Lee,1,"Food here is great ie Indian, roast meat, Malay n Korean. But but but... terrible hygiene.  Full of bird shit here for longest time.  Toilet bad too.  Even washing basin unkempt.  Smokers corner always drift second hand smoke to entire area.  Wind n breeze direction blow wrong way.  NEA please come here, inspect and have a word w the kopitiam operator",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112663857071000780011/reviews
