燕子姑姑C,1,I give 2 times try on this store( I’m a Thai food fan).  I tried grass noodle & Thai fried rice. I have to be honest on it. The taste is very disappointing. There is no original Thai food favor and Thai fried rice’s chickens full of chicken skin. Vegetables are too raw. No recommended.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117794691312198326942/reviews
Ed Seet,5,"Affordable authentic Thai food, run by a group of Thai ladies. So far, we have tried tom yum fried rice, basil pork fried rice, garlic pork fried rice, tom yum soup & mee mama (spicy fried mama noodle). All of them did not disappoint. Will be back to try other 'zichar' dishes when we have larger pool of people. Highly recommended.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106443726830878088320/reviews
Jessica Ann,5,Really enjoyed the food here. Affordable and delicious. Recommend the Thai basil pork rice! The steam fish and kai lan were really yummy too. Although only 2 ladies managing the stall they were very friendly and welcoming. Do support if you’re in the area.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117403348518056357469/reviews

Adrick Loh,4,My first visit on this Thai stall in this coffee shop. 3 Thai ladies working here so the Thai food cannot be wrong. Ordered the crazy spicy fired  kway tiao. Really spicy and wok hei and flavor is substantial. Will try other dishes in the future. Packet their Tom Yum clear soup and my wife approved the taste. Sorry no pictures taken in the soup.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116967523325064503672/reviews
