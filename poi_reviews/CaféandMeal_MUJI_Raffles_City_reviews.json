      "text": "the cold delis were amazing! all the fresh ingredients were cooked to perfection, nothing was mushy or limp! and the sauces went perfectly with everything, the fruity notes added a kick to it! all the different ingredients used felt like they had been meticulously curated and chosen to make a harmonious taste profile! üëèüèª i used to think that hot food always has more flavour than cold food! üëèüèªüëèüèª\n\nthe hot delis were surprisingly overshadowed by the cold delis ü´¢ the beef was nice and tender, albeit boring compared to the cold delis. we both preferred the halibut because it was more unique!\n\nthe 16 grain rice was nicely cooked, soft and just moist enough! the carrot soup tasted more like pumpkin soup, but it was so good and creamy!\n\nat 12~pm on a weekday, there was already a long queue! the food queue moves quite fast, but the queue for the tables is slower. would suggest you go at 11:30am latest!",

      "text": "Healthy food choices over here with multi grain rice option. Meat portion is pretty small as their set encourage more on cold dish. The only food taste good is the creamy mushroom dish.\n\nTheir coffee selection was out of order at that moment. Probably due to closing soon. We came about 7.30pm.\n\nGenerally for the price for this portion of food, is not really worth it. I guess I pay more for the comfortable atmosphere.\n\nKitchen is very tidy though. A+ for that",

I love the explosion of flavours and contrasting hot and cold dishes that go well with their 16 grain rice. Even their miso soup is delicious!\nLong queue during lunch peak mainly office crowd but it clears fast as there are enough manpower to do the orders and cashiering.\nThere was a nice middle age female service crew who assisted me in getting seats.",

There're some noisy guests who rather spend to talk then enjoying meal here. The hospitality here is well and you had to queue two times for the table.\n\nThe carrot soup is a favourite and must come back for the rice and the deli set!",
