Jun Kawabata,5,"Tuas Link MRT Station, the terminus of the East-West Line, is one of those places you often see on train destination boards but rarely think about visiting. One day, I decided, ""Why not?"" and made the trip out of sheer curiosity. The result? Nothing. Absolutely nothing—and that’s what made it oddly entertaining.

As you step off the train, you're greeted by vast industrial areas and open spaces with very little in the way of attractions or activities. The station itself is clean and functional, like all MRT stations, but the surrounding area is a stark contrast to Singapore’s bustling urban hubs. It’s almost surreal in its emptiness.

Despite the lack of things to do, there was something amusing about the whole experience. It felt like a mini-adventure to the edge of Singapore, a place designed purely for functionality, not leisure. Tuas Link isn’t a spot you’d visit for fun, but if you’re in the mood for a quirky trip to nowhere, it’s worth ticking off your list. Just be prepared to enjoy the silence and the novelty of going ""all the way west"" on the East-West Line!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116401292503871100566/reviews

Forest Gardenia,5,"We took train from Clementi Station to Tuas Link station today, on a Wednesday. The train had just a few people when we arrived at Tuas Link station. The toilet was clean. We took exit A to the bus stop to take CW7 to Tuas checkpoint. It was about 5 mins walk. The bus CW7 was already waiting.  We used Manjalink cards to pay for the fare.  It was $4.50 for the entire trip from Tuas Link station to Aeon Bukit Indah. I bought Manjalink cards at Jurong Point a month ago.  The entire journey from Clementi Mrt station to Aeon Bukit Indah was about 1.5 hrs. We had a smooth trip without any crowd at the checkpoints. On our way back, we took CW6 back to Jurong Point instead of Tuas Link Station.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109486574632706511341/reviews
