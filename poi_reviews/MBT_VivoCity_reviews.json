      "text": "Don't buy this shoe. It's worse than a cheap $30 shoe from Queensway despite the kind of price that u pay for it (cost me $159). The outsole dropped out and I made a complaint, the management said it was too worn out (after I wore for 11months from the day I bought). Put it this way.....all my shoes ranging from $30 to $259 never had such problem even after 2yrs of wearing, but this one is the worst. The only consolation is that the insoles r indeed comfortable. But I will never buy a 2nd pair from this brand forever.",
