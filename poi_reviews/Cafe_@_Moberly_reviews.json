Finally got the chance to visit during one of the personal training session.\n\nTheir chicken chop and fish n chips are great. Heard from the owner uncle he uses 7 different herbs to grill his chicken chop. Really taste nice. Recommend to all of you who studied there or got opportunities to visit there for self improvement courses\n\nThey are conveniently located near at a hill top near to FC3.",

The food was decent, but what really stood out was the friendly and attentive service. The boss was incredibly friendly and kind, taking the time to share his experiences and stories with us, which added a personal touch to our visit. The overall experience was made memorable by the excellent service and warm atmosphere. I would recommend this cafe for a casual and friendly dining experience.",
