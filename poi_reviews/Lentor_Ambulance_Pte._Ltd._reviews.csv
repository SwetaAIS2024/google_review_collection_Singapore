Alice BG Lee,5,"**Review for Sanjee from Lentor Ambulance – Exceptional Compassion and Care**

I have been using Lentor Ambulance’s services since August 2024 to transport my mother for her medical appointments, and Sanjee is, by far, the most outstanding crew member I have ever encountered.

Today, we engaged their service again for my mother’s neurology appointment at SGH. When Sanjee arrived at the nursing home, I was still feeding my mother. Instead of rushing us, he kindly reassured me that there was no need to hurry, as the traffic conditions were manageable.

During the journey, my mother was initially positioned facing the opposite direction of travel, which made her feel dizzy. Sanjee immediately suggested stopping the vehicle to reposition her safely. Concerned about delaying the trip, I hesitated, but he insisted, saying, “No worries, it’s manageable.”With great care, he adjusted her position himself and continuously checked on her, asking if she felt better and gently patting her for comfort.

Throughout the ride, he also took the time to reassure me, letting me know we would arrive earlier than scheduled and encouraging me not to worry. His kindness and attentiveness were truly touching—he went above and beyond to ensure my mother’s comfort.

Sanjee’s compassion, professionalism, and genuine concern for patients and their families make him an exceptional caregiver. I am deeply grateful for his support and highly recommend Lentor Ambulance, especially when he is on duty. Thank you, Sanjee, for your outstanding service!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118376774992592188766/reviews
