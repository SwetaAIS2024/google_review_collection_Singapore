k d,1,"Iâ€™ve had several disappointing experiences at this store. Some of the staff at the counter, particularly a Malay and an Indian lady who wear heavy makeup, have been quite rude. They often leave expired promotional tags on the shelves, which is very misleading. On multiple occasions, I picked up items thinking they were on offer, only to be told at the counter that the promotion had ended. When I pointed out the offer label still displayed on the rack, the Malay lady staff removed it abruptly, saying it expired yesterday, without any apology. This is not only careless but also quite unethical. I hope the management takes this seriously and trains the staff to be more professional and customer-friendly.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103242964738595299965/reviews
