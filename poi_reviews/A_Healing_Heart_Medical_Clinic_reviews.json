The other 2 heart clinics didn't even bother and wanted me to repeat the tests. Dr Gerald also took time to explain to me my medical condition and finally I understood. Most importantly, my medications were adjusted and I am beginning to regain my stamina. 2 thumbs up.",

I have become so jaded with doctors but Dr Gerald proved me wrong. The precision and effort put in by the doctor was even more admirable even with his usual nurse away. I will definitely recommend A Healing Heart to my other family members.",

All aspects of the business are administered in accordance with respective medical SOPs.\n\nI am grateful to have found such a company in which I can place my professional trust in concerning my health and overall well-being. My experience here has been far better than that of other private clinics. Much appreciated to the doctor and staff!",

Would definitely be recommending this clinic to my family and neighbors.",
