MacamBagus M,5,Second time here. Did not disappoint. We enjoyed eating the dishes we ordered for both visits. We have tried other brands selling similar dishes that are halal. So far this is the best! We tried 2 of the toasts...so syiok!! My wife loves the porridge...Hainan Chicken Porridge. Flavourful!!,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116732439144194056904/reviews
Carolyn Choo,4,"A short stop at Iskandar Puteri on our drive back to Puchong. Had lunch here. The sar hor fun had wok hei. The chicken chop was as good as advertised, flavourful in each bite. The Singapore fried mee was OK. Would have preferred the thicker white noodle and white squid. More gravy too. Long wait to get a seat.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109617659305455075297/reviews

jpm,2,"This was another place that wifey suggested we eat at because she had seen an acquaintance having a meal here and making positive comments.

It was certainly very crowded so it's undoubtedly popular. It was also kind of hard to find parking. But parking was not the main issue, the underwhelming food was the let down.

But I have to add that we only had mee soto and hor fun. Both dishes did not taste like what we were used to or expecting. We've definitely had better versions elsewhere. Maybe we should have found out first what's the must eat here?",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107587473700248132752/reviews
Charyane Tan,5,"Breakfast at Hua Mui was not only satisfying but also exceeded expectations in terms of portion sizes and presentation. The dishes served closely matched the enticing images on the menu, ensuring that what you see is truly what you get. Every plate was generously filled, making it a hearty meal to start the day.

Beyond the food, the dining experience was comfortable and clean. The restaurant maintained a well-kept environment, with no flies in sight‚Äîsomething that can make or break a meal in open-air or casual dining settings. This attention to cleanliness added to the overall pleasant atmosphere, allowing diners to fully enjoy their food without distractions.

it‚Äôs a great spot to enjoy a well-prepared and satisfying breakfast.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117167784261581750897/reviews
