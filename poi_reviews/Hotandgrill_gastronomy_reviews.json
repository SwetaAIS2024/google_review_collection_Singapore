      "text": "Overall, superb value for money I must say. Restaurant food quality standard! Hidden gem amongst the popular stalls around.\n\nThe chef is a really humble and polite man. He is also highly skilled. I watched him baking the pizza. It really shows in his food. Very wide selection of choices. I went for the chicken chop and Hawaiian pizza. This is my second visit to his stall.\n\nChicken chop was grilled to perfection. Black pepper sauce was very well done. Tasted really balanced.\n\nPizza was simply delicious. The pizza crust tasted exactly like those you'd find in high end restaurants.\n\nDefinitely looking forward to trying out the other menu items!",

      "text": "I recently visited this western food stall and was amazing by coffeeshop serving delicious dishes. The truffle pizza was a highlight - the aroma of truffle oil wafted through the air, teasing my taste buds, and the first bite did not disappoint. The crust was crispy, the cheese was melted to perfection with the truffle flavor added a depth of richness that elevated the entire dish.\n\nThe chicken chop was another standout - juicy, tender, and cooked to a perfect golden brown. The portion was generous, and the flavors were well-balanced.\n\nBut the real star of the show was the fish and chips, which was so good that it disappeared before I could even take a picture! The fish was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and the batter was light and non-greasy. The chips were cooked to a perfect crunch, and the entire dish was served hot and fresh.\n\nOverall, I'm impressed by the quality and taste of the food at this stall. The prices are reasonable, and the service is friendly. I'll definitely be back for more!\"",

And yes, like the other comments, this is not a coffee shop western stall, it definitely tastes premium and in fact better than a lot of restaurants. Well done üëçüèª",

Would have been perfect if served with a slice of lemon.  Good portion too!  Overall very satisfied to have such good standard western food in a neighbourhood coffee shop. I shall return to try the rest on the menu.",
