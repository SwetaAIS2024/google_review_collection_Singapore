Jie,5,"So far this is the best lor mee i tasted in Singapore. I first tried this very long time ago, more than 7 years if I am not wrong. And on off i will have craving for it. Uncle and auntie are always friendly. Got once I forgot to bring cash and phone, uncle allows me to pay the next round. Thank you! I always requested for no beansprout and noticed there are quite many other fried items. I always order small size and the portion is always good enough. Highly recommendedüëç",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106459075259281753048/reviews
Glen Ho,5,"A lor mee that's value for money, and with a soup that's not too starchy/viscous. This is also the first time I finished the soup as though it was a bowl of ramen!

They offer 3 sizes of $4, $5, $6 for the portions. My picture shows the $5 portion. I loved the great noodle firmness and texture. Flavours are awesome and you can adjust the flavour by adding as much vinegar as you want.

Will definitely return for more!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100044167054534704701/reviews
 ç…æ…¥,5,"Located near the extreme right end of the Circuit road hawker center (last 2nd to be exact).

Ever since exposed to this when I was working at Ubi area, occasionally when time permits, I'd take bus to Circuit rd hawker during lunch. Just to eat his lor mee. A pity would be in the past, the operating days are kinda inconsistent.

Although slight increase (now at $4/ 5/ 6) of price, the quality seems to taste better. And I'll definitely go for the large one. Regardless $5 or $6, any day.

Uncle is always friendly. Always in a jovial mood everyday.

The ingredients he used is fresh (just look at the beansprout, man). The Lor in the Lor mee is the main star. Subtle hints of spices yet not too overpowering. Consistency of the Lor works for my palate. Pair it with a cooked-just-nice flat yellow noodle, that's your comforting bowl of lor mee. Works even better on a cold rainy day.

Highly recommended for dine in for the optimum shiokness.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103383404265528637492/reviews
Victor Ng,2,"This stall is a classic example of how the standard of hawker food in Singapore is in quick decline.

This lor mee used to be choke full of ingredients. Now for $4 you only get a few boiled egg slices, some flour crisps and a few pieces of pork belly.

They have also conveniently omitted the red cut chilli and parsley toppings.

Their vinegar is on the sweet side.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115343125507441223772/reviews
J K,5,Its actually quite hard to find good Lor Mee these days. I love the soup base and the ingredients that is added inside the soup. I personally don't like to have Beansprouts in my noodle choice. So this is a perfect bowl!,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106852703375133242070/reviews
