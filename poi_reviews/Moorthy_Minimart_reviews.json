      "text": "Was here for shopee self-collection. I had 9 packages, but the whole process was so messy and disorganised that I could only find 8 packages. I told the lady that I would be back for the 9th package another day since she could not find it.\n\nThe next day, I noticed the package now read \"completed\" and \"delivered\", meaning the money had already been taken. I went back for the 9th package, and to my horror, even though the package was right in front of our eyes, another Indian woman would not let me take the package as the \"pin code\" was wrong.\nOf course the pin code would be \"wrong\" as the first lady had marked the packaged as completed, and could not find my package earlier on!\n\nI highly recommend setting your pick up point for the other mini mart a few doors down. The process is a lot smoother there.",

(because her sister took so long to look for the second item) like hello?? THT'S MY ITEM, EVEN IF ITS NOT FRAGILE WHT IF YOU BREAK OR SPOIL IT??! when she asked me \"what did you buy?\" the old lady at the counter had to lecture her in front of me \"it's none of your business what people buy!?\" i just feel kids should not be \"helping out\" at a place of business. this girl clearly lacks the savoir faire and professionalism to facilitate smth as simple as a shopee self collection. FIRST AND LAST TIME IM PUTTING THIS MINIMART AS A PICKUP POINT. HORRIBLE.",
