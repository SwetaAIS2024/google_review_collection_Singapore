newchicgal,5,"Monday morning 10.20am. I ordered a Make Your Own Breakfast with a raisin bagel $3.50 with butter spread $1, avocado $4.20 and mushroom $4.20. Coffee is a double 12oz Flat White. Breakfast is great, the grilled mushroom is fabulous and avocado is ripe and buttery soft. Flat White is delicious. They have many salad and sandwiches to take away. Highly recommend this place for a quick breakfast, which isn't very crowded at this time. However, the spotlights near the side are super warm, not environmentally friendly in our tropical climate in Singapore. I was perspiring while having my breakfast.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112864980348745239039/reviews
Wang Huiyuan,4,"First time trying out for breakfast. Ordered cheese toast set n egg avocado croissant set with cuppucinno n early Grey tea.  Prices at such shop within  Collyer Quay area like this.

Maria Christine Asuncion,5,"Love that they open early. This is my go-to place for breakfast here at raffles place area. Lots of options and prices are reasonable. Sandwiches are not mind blowing, but at least the bread and fillings are of good and consistent quality. Service is fast and friendly.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102534443550978293575/reviews
The Biodynamic Duo,4,"My favourite sandwich shop in CBD but I gave it 4 stars. Read on.

I have been patronizing this place for lunch sometimes since 2018 when I came across it. I introduced my colleagues and any business visitors who maybe were not accustomed to the Asian food.

There used to be a variety of sandwiches over the years, my all-time favourites were the beef one with dried tomatoes and when that became unavailable I went for the salmon brie baguette.

In the second half of 2023 the sandwich options have been reduced and to my sadness, there are mot that many good options. The prices have been constant over the years which probably makes it more difficult to have a better variety (the exception is the soup, the price increased from 2$ if I remember well to 4$ now for a small cream soup).

Another thing that’s been consistent: Service has always been super friendly.

Nevertheless I hope the sandwich list will be revamped in 2024 so I can enjoy a good lunch when I am in the office.
PS: they have salads too but as the name states, it’s a “sandwich shop”",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101966057015930925345/reviews
Richard Messark,3,"Pretty busy on a lunch time but still made my sandwich to order very quickly.
My issue was more that they had mayo on literally every sandwich as a butter substitute which is a classic way to make cheaper and lower quality sandwiches. I asked for butter instead, and was given a sandwich with no spread at all. The bread was a little bit dry, which I guess they fix by putting mayo on usually.
If I had to make a comparison I'd say it was about the level of a Tesco pre-made sandwich but for four times the price.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104844651266628323953/reviews
