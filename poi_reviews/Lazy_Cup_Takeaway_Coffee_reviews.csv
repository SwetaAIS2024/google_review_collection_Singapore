Nithya Sugumar,5,"Tried The Lazy Cup‚Äôs signature Cloud Coffee and now I see why it‚Äôs the favourite! It was incredibly delicious and so easy to finish in one sitting. The people behind it were really friendly and sweet.

Looking forward to trying more from their menu soon. Highly recommend supporting this cozy home-based gem!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106024827582731737814/reviews
