Gasper Chan,3,"Food was not bad, but nothing special. Service was pretty slow. Even though the indoor dining space was empty, we were not allowed to choose another table indoors even though we had a large group.

Overall would be a decent place to go if youâ€™re in the area but not a place I would specially recommend.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116187504655013802323/reviews
Henry Cheng,5,Delicious food with magnificent view of the golf course. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seatings. We ordered the assam fish tail and prawn paste chicken for dinner coupled with 2 pints of Guinness. The fish was fresh and the portion was really generous. Taste was on point as well. Prawn paste chicken was seasoned and deep fried really well. They were really plump and juicy while still being crispy on the outside. This is a really good place to have dinner away from the hustle and bustle of the city.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108151994390288524704/reviews
S Foo,3,"Lovely and airy with a soothing view of the golf course if you sit out on the non air-conditioned terrace.
The wait staff was helpful and polite.

Ordered the promotional item of $9.90 ++ per individual serving of shark's fin. Tasted average with small pieces of fins. Was disappointed to find fillers of gelatinous fin look- alike.

Signature Golden Chicken did not disappoint taste wise. This dish was loaded with fresh ginger slices and garlic pieces. A must order. Take note that the chicken pieces were all mid joint wings .

Prawns were succulent and fresh in the dish of Broccoli with Prawns. Glad that the chef was light with the salt in this dish.

Would return for a quiet lunch amidst beautiful greens.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103252058657576066792/reviews
Elaine Chia,4,"Nice food, nice ambience and good service.

The food was generally alright, the chicken was tasty. The $10 offers - prawn and fish were fresh. Some dishes were on a sweeter side. The yam paste was a good dessert to consider.

They do have various locations for dine in. We opt for the aircon area and it was very retro looking, old school. The outdoor dining areas were nice, just not nice for such a weather.

The staff were pretty attentive and service was rather fast.

A good place to have a meal, will definitely want to go back one day.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109984404323679586196/reviews
Always Hungry,3,"There are promotions every month i was told. Each month, 2 dishes are sold at high discount. This nov month is assam fish (ordered the tail, quite nice but alot of small chopped bones. Troublesome for someone who hate bones) and lala pot (nice but got abit salty as it boils). Also had half a truffle duck (soft but nothing special, ex), and crab fried rice (nice). Next time will just order the 2 promotion dishes and a fried rice. It should be nice.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117827564676364182643/reviews
