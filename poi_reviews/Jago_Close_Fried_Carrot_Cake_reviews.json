      "text": "Didn't get to try the food because the carrot cake was sold out. But the reason for the rating was because the service was utterly bad. The man who was cooking was manning the stall on his own. But I don't think I caught him at the peak hour. He didn't say anything and kept gesturing and grunting impatiently. When he saw that i couldnt understand, he asked angrily pointing at the picture of the fried kway teow if i want to order it. When I asked for carrot cake, he just snatched the device for collecting the food away from me. Needless to say, I wouldn't want to order anything else from this man even though I was famished. And lucky for me, there are other great fried carrot cake stalls still available to satisfy my craving.",

Old lady serving was very courteous though.    To be fair, dish wasn’t impressive though it was not bad.  I won’t mind impatient hawkers if the food was good.",

For the white carrot cake I requested for chilli and the smell from the sambal was overpowering, would prefer no chilli in future. There was an option to include local kopi and it tastes pretty decent.",
