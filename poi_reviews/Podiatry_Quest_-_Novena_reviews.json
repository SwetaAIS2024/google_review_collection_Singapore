      "text": "I went to them back in August 2024 for the fungal infections on both of my large toes. I met Dr. Aaron Teo at Novena, and he has been an absolute star. They recommended the PACT UV treatment. It's a slow process, but Dr. Teo was great, and it definitely gave me the results I expected. He knows how to talk to patients and guide them on their treatment. The Novena clinic also has competent administration staff. Overall, it was a great experience. Unfortunately,  Dr. Teo is leaving, but I am sure the good services will continue.",

His expert advice on my recurring in grown toe nail was very valuable. Made me feel at ease during the whole procedure and taught me how to take care of it after bath.\n\nVery humble and unassuming character. Comfortable clean rooms, highly recommended ðŸ‘Œ!!",

      "text": "Boon Kiak is an extremely proficient, caring, and effective podiatrist. I went in with a couple of issues with my left foot and he was spot-on in catching the symptoms diagnosing the root causes after a few quick tests and visual examinations.\n\nThe consult was also easy-going and light-hearted, which I appreciated. Boon Kiak has excellent bedside manner and went beyond medical-speak to explain my issues simply and with analogies that helped me understand better. He also provided highly effective solutions and has been extremely responsive in the follow-up since. I eventually went with custom insoles after which there is no turning back!\n\nI would definitely recommend him as a first port of call for all podiatry needs.",
