V,5,"I’ve heard plenty of great things about this teppanyaki spot, so I finally decided to try it for myself. The restaurant has a sleek, modern ambiance, and we were seated at the bar with a front-row view of the chef in action!

Service was smooth, the staff kindly informed us of a 30-minute wait before seating us, but our food arrived in less time than expected. While the dishes were decent, nothing particularly wowed me. That said, it’s a great option if you’re in the area, especially considering the reasonable pricing.

Bonus points for the excellent service and the chef’s charm (yes, quite the eye-candy lol). All in all, a pleasant dining experience worth checking out!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113989276641195154173/reviews
Rachel Ng,5,"Highly recommend! Was there yesterday with my colleagues. We tried the grilled mushroom salad, rib eye steak and seabass steak. Great vibes. Good food. Will def return again. Do make reservations before your visit as they have limited seats and it takes time for the chef to cook for your food for you.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108137183757011820984/reviews

The overall seating arrangement close to the cooking area is nice.

A bit disappointed with the pricing of the seafood place that we ordered. The overall taste of the food was ok.

Better experiences with the serving crew can be better.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104234572596322175340/reviews

Genie Lew,5,"From the moment you step in, you can feel the authentic Japanese ambiance. Watching the chef perform teppanyaki live is truly a feast for the eyes—flames dancing, aromas filling the air—it’s enough to whet your appetite even before taking a bite!

✅ Fresh & Delicious Food – Whether it’s chicken, seafood, or vegetables, everything retains its natural sweetness, making each bite a delight!
✅ Reasonable Prices – Compared to many teppanyaki restaurants, the value for money here is excellent—you can indulge without worrying about your wallet!
✅ Clean & Comfortable Environment – Whether sitting at the bar or a table, everything is well-maintained and spotless—perfect attention to detail!

If you love high-quality teppanyaki but don’t want to overspend, Takara Teppanyaki is definitely worth a try! Will be back for sure!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115645631700945503903/reviews
