Lim Xiang Long,5,FusionWorls showcases a wide variety of innovation and science research. The atmosphere there is really surreal and interesting as it has different kinds of technology which help to boost Singapore in different sectors such as healthcare and transport. Dont worry too much as there is a guided tour to explain all those technologies. The staff there is really kind and welcoming too.üòÅ,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112449595722086972837/reviews
