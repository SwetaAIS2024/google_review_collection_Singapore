Joining the church has been one of the best decisions I've made in my life so far; my spiritual life and relationship with God is great, and I love my PS fam!! ðŸ’“\n\nPlus the praise and worship is AWESOME!!! It's so good to be alive praising Him with all my heart, mind, body and soul (I need to improve my stamina for all that jumping/dancing.. ðŸ˜‚)\n\nIf you're reading this review and deciding on a church to visit/make your home, come find me after service! I would love to get to know you ðŸ¤—",
