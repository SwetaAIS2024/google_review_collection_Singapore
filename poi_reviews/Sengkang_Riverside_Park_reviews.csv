Damcho Tshering,5,"Just a 5-minute walk from Kupang LRT, Sengkang Riverside Park turned out to be the perfect weekend escape. Lush greenery, calm waters, and the beautiful floating wetland made it feel like a quiet little world tucked right into the city.

The fruit-themed boardwalk and constructed wetlands were a nice surpriseâ€”spotted a few birds and dragonflies along the way too. Great place for a slow walk, a bit of reflection, or just a breather from the usual routine.

Grateful for spaces like this that offer peace so close to home.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116833702802756994837/reviews
JT,4,"A 'relatively' undiscovered gem of a little park (actually 2). Whilst not huge they are easy to walk around, one has a nice lake in the middle. Lots of wildlife to see. Quite accessible from Senkang sports centre. There are toilets, a water fountain and a restaurant, although this was closed when we went in the morning.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104476150861702942539/reviews
