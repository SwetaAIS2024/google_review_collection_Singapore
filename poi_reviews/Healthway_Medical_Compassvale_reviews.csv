koh hayden,5,"Dr. Vincent Chong is an outstanding doctor who treated me with extreme care, professionalism, and a truly pleasant attitude. He is not only highly skilled but also deeply compassionate, making the entire experience reassuring and comforting. I have immense respect for him and his dedication to treat all his patients well.

As well as the frontline clinic team is equally wonderful - welcoming, kind, and treating patients like friends. Their warmth and efficiency make a real difference. As the way they handle their patients are very quick and smooth",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114382811043373486448/reviews
Wee Le Tan,5,"Dr Chong is a very dedicated and compassionate doctor. A simple act of standing up, opening the door for the patient and greeting the patient comes a long way. I could tell his patients felt at ease when he did those things. He is empathetic and tries his best to understand his patients. His patients always seem very happy around him.

Although he is busy with his patients, he also takes time in between seeing patients to check in on us and explain to us the different conditions and treatment plan to help us better apply what we have learnt into clinical setting. I really appreciate Dr Chong’s teaching and guidance during my year 1 medical GP attachment. Thank you Dr Chong!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114415844091751513673/reviews

Kevin Yip,5,"I had an exceptional experience at this clinic. Dr. Chong was not only highly knowledgeable and professional, but also genuinely attentive and compassionate — taking time to explain everything clearly and ensuring I felt comfortable and informed throughout my visit.
