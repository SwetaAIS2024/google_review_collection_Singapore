      "text": "Feedback on unhelpful service at Suntec City Branch\nI am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the level of service I received at your Suntec city branch on 19.12.2024 @10.10am. We are attempting to use Suntec City Vouchers at the self-service kiosk. As we were unfamiliar with the process, we approached a staff member for assistance -a Chinese Aunty stationed near the self-service kiosks. However, we were met with a disappointing response. That Cold Storage Chinese Aunty refused to assist us, claiming that it was \"too troublesome and we as a customer by right should know how to redeem the voucher at the self-service kiosk\", without making any attempt to guide or help us. This experience was both frustrating and disheartening. As customers, we rely on staff for support, particularly when navigating unfamiliar processes. Being dismissed in this manner is far from the standard of service we expect from a reputable brand like Cold Storage!",
