KKT,3,"Lok Lok as it is..
Sauces and spices are nice.
Freshly fried items never go wrong.
Fridge may be too cold, pandan leave chicken internal not cooked, but staff apologetic and mitigated with smile.
Otah bun, may be abit not so fresh or not cooked enough, but just eat...",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399770588752359508/reviews
Doraemon,3,"Kitty and I decided to check out the Fei Zhu Lok Lok & Claypot LaLa Soup outlet in Ang Mo Kio after loving the one in Kallang Wave Mall.  Unfortunately, this location wasn't quite as impressive, especially after comparing it to our first experience at the Kallang Wave Mall location.

While it was clean and had a nice ambiance, the variety of ingredients wasn't as extensive as the Kallang Wave Mall location, and the pricing was a bit confusing. We were disappointed to find that some ingredients were priced higher than advertised, and the taste of the lok lok didn't quite match up to the flavorful skewers we had at Kallang Wave. Kitty particularly enjoyed the fried broccoli, but even that didn't quite reach the same level of flavor as before.

The atmosphere at this outlet was quieter than the Kallang Wave Mall location, which might be a plus for some but not for others. The service was okay, but nothing special.

Overall, if you're looking for a great Fei Zhu Lok Lok experience, I would recommend sticking with the Kallang Wave Mall outlet for your first visit. It has a wider variety of ingredients, tastier food, and a busier atmosphere.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112665277904119154671/reviews
Tony Ho,3,"Not bad, can try. Went there on a weekday morning. Not crowded. Noodles were a let down. Other than that the rest are ok. Parking can be difficult. Prices are a little on the high side.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118107194548169906203/reviews
ʍɾɴ,3,"Fairly disappointed. The fridge looks like it lacked of life. Very minimal ingredients. Some ingredients look pretty old; with a huge amount of shaved ice in it, as if it was there forever. Options were pretty limited too.

No options for vegetables also.

Ended up still picking a few. Total was $12 (among which were squid that cost $3 each).

But chilli is not bad. Especially the red one. Packs a punch.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103383404265528637492/reviews
Tendou Rudi,5,"Super friendly boss. I didn't know the meat was premarinated with flour as I am on Keto diet. The boss volunteered to switched items for me even though items has been cooked.

Top quality of service and customer oriented.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113776744076976344831/reviews
