Worth eating.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113175319567959304019/reviews

Levin,3,"The fried chicken briyani was overall average once you account for the $7 price.

Rice was fluffy with spices being on the milder side. The gravy on the side and the achar were both on the blander side of the spectrum.

But the fried chicken batter was pretty tasty, albeit salty. The chicken was also chopped into chunks, akin to Hainanese chicken rice; so the bone bits were a bit annoying to deal with.

That was all to the dish, so the value isn't exactly there.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112878374817848127411/reviews
