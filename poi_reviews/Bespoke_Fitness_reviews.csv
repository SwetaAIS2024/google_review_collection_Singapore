Edward Loo,5,"Cozy little 24/7 gym. Perfect for nearby resident and working people. Affordable and finger print door lock (very high tech sia).

There is public transport everyday and shuttle bus from one-north on weekdays, but the last bus is around 8.30pm for public bus. A bit harder to access on odd hours which defeat the 24/7 purposes but overall a great place to workout.

They have great cross fit classes according to my colleagues. I join mainly for the open gym, equipments are maintained, a little bit limited due to the space and cross fit themed but the owners themselves being gym goer would see to our needs.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107614300706056424032/reviews
dharshen mahalingam,5,"Amazing gym, trainers all have wonderful personalities. They’re very helpful and really cheer you on as well. Best place for a fantastic 60 minute HIT (no interval) workout. Definitely would highly recommend it!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112089674282226750533/reviews
Sharin Nair,5,"I decided to try this gym out after the nearby Gymboxx decided to shutdown. Though initially skeptical since the gym is fairly small - I couldn't have been more wrong.
Run by siblings - Yan & Tiat. Both provide excellent coaching - crossfit style. They provide classes at a very reasonable price which I would highly recommend. Each day is focused on a different body part & is never the same through out the year. If you are serious about your fitness you will not be disappointed. #nowimpyworkout",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113910767734982991028/reviews
Benedicta C,5,"Bespoke fitness has changed my lifestyle in a way that I didn’t believe possible.
I have always been very lazy when it came to workout due to a very busy life. And the fact that I am skinny by nature didn’t help because I simply never felt the urgent need to workout.
Bespoke got me addicted in few months I saw my body changing but mostly it was beneficial to my mind.
My back problems have improved a lot too.
Couldn’t recommend bespoke fitness more.
Open to everyone: skinny, overweight, old, young, fit , unfit :)",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113022097207125881707/reviews
Jennifer Helssen,5,"The best gym in Singapore! The classes, coaches and entire Bespoke community are wonderful. Workouts 7 days a week- always challenging and always fun.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113914434071534875086/reviews
