It took around 15 mins of wait and I ordered royal flush set.\n\nThe Nasi Lemak is above average, I find it better than the crave, maybe becos of the freshly cook wings. The rice is light and fragrant, paired with the slightly sweet sambal is heavenly. Definitely a must try if you come to Adam road food center.",

      "text": "Selera Nasi Lemak came highly recommended by colleagues, so I was excited to give it a try. While the meal was good, I felt that it didn’t quite live up to the hype.\n\nI ordered the Royal Flush ($6.50), which came with basmati rice, ikan bilis, peanuts, a chicken wing, otah, bergedil, and a decent portion of sambal chilli.\n\nTo give credit where it’s due, the rice was fluffy, fragrant, and well-cooked, and the sambal was spicy with a nice umami kick. Unfortunately, the rest of the ingredients were pretty average. The biggest letdown was the chicken wing—it was crispy but lacked flavour, as if it hadn’t been marinated properly.\n\nOn the bright side, the staff were really friendly, and the food was served quickly, which made the experience smooth.\n\nOverall, it wasn’t a bad meal, but I’ve had better nasi lemak elsewhere. If you’re already in the area, it’s worth a try, but I wouldn’t go out of my way for it. 7/10.",
