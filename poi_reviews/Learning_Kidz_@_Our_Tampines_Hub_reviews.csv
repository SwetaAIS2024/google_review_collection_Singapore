A2P 3Z,1,"1 Star – Disorganized & Disrespectful – Avoid This Preschool

We booked a school tour around 10 days in advance through their official platform, which explicitly showed availability on a public holiday. The school confirmed our appointment via email, assigned two teachers for the tour, and sent multiple reminders to us—even the day before. Yet, when we arrived on time as a whole family, the school was closed, with no staff, no calls returned, and no replies to emails. This resulted a wasted morning for us.

After waiting a week for an apology or explanation, they only sent a tone-deaf email asking for ""feedback"" on the nonexistent tour. This level of disorganization, disrespect for parents' time, and refusal to acknowledge mistakes is unacceptable. If they can’t manage a simple tour responsibly, how can we trust them with children?

Most of their branches have low ratings—now we understand why. Avoid this preschool unless you want chaos and a lack of accountability.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109301790892078461008/reviews
