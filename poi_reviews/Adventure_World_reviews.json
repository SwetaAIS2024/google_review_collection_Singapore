Super durable, hardy, good size and most critical is the 1 hand manuveur where you can open the water bottle with just 1 hand,  such a critical and useful feature for action sports.\nI have travelled with mine for 4 years and it has survived 15 countries and got thru every terrain, temperature and knock. Took 4 years before I had to have them replaced.\nBest bottles ever!",

She was careful to check with me to make sure I got the correct pants size, which I actually got it wrong. She changed the right size for me on the spot. Really appreciate her help.",
