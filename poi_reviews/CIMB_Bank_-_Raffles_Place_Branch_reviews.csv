Cindy Low,5,"Outstanding Service from Sonia – A True Asset to the Bank

I would like to commend Sonia for her exceptional service and professionalism. From the moment I stepped into the branch, Sonia greeted me warmly and handled my banking needs with efficiency, clarity, and a personal touch. She took the time to explain every step patiently, ensured all my concerns were addressed, and made the entire experience seamless.

Mingwang Zhang,5,"I had an absolutely amazing experience at CIMB, thanks to Doris Leung and Emily Tan. I arrived at the branch after office hours, thinking I might have to come back another day. But to my surprise, Doris welcomed me warmly and stayed over two extra hours to help me sort out multiple banking matters. Her professionalism, patience, and dedication were truly eight-star service!

Emily also stepped in to assist with form-filling and made the whole process smooth and efficient. They even offered me bottled water while I waited — such a thoughtful touch.

I’m genuinely grateful for their help and impressed by the exceptional service. CIMB is lucky to have such outstanding staff. 墙裂推荐！
