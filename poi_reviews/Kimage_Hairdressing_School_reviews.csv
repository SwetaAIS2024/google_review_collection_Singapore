Chris Pope (Lucidreams),5,"Linh was so good!! I had a great experience. Be prepared to be patient, but by giving them extra time and letting them figure out the process, I definitely recommend as the staff are lovely and I am more than happy with the curls and the cut. Thank you!!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100670151512857616230/reviews
Bobbi Yeo,5,"I went for a haircut and treatment today and I was pleasantly impressed with the service. I was served by Graduate Yun Han and he was really gentle and detailed with his work. Having been to many pricey and renowned salons that boast about their products and service, tbh I don’t see any life changing difference in the treatment advertised by the expensive salons, the quality provided here is definitely comparable! If you are looking for a fuss free and economical service, I would recommend that you give this place a try! Do bear in mind of their opening hours and to make an appointment!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109465194366801883258/reviews

Jane M,5,"Hair colouring was done by student ,John. He was attentive, careful and hair wash plus massage was excellent.  He suggested a hair color that was slightly lighter as i wanted an overall brighter look.  The end result is very even and looks naturally blended with my hair.  Will recommend to my friends and come again. Saloon ambience is clean, airy and well spaced.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115386625531730680642/reviews
Su-Yin R.,5,"Good value for money and you are also helping students gain experience.

On average, bearing in mind that the hairstylists are students, colouring can take from 2.5 - 5 hours depending on the service while a haircut can take up to 2 hours.

The students will sometimes seek advice and approval from their teachers before moving on to the next step of the service that’s carried out.

The teachers will also go around to check on the students’ progress to be sure they are on track.

I’ve tried their services for root touch up, full hair colour and cut. The school uses L’Oreal for my hair colour and root touch up.

Cutting short hair can sometimes not be how I would have liked because it does take skills to strike a balance between length, cut and facial features which the students are still learning.

Overall though, the service is good and the environment is friendly and spacious.

I’ve been a customer for a few years now and I’m happy with their services.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116029408605627349817/reviews
