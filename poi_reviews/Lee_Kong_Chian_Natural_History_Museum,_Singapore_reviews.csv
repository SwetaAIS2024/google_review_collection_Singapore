Ivan Loh,4,"A well-maintained and impressive little museum tucked away on the NUS campus. Entry is $18 for resident adults, but it’s free if you visit during your birthday month or if you’re an NUS student or staff, which is a nice perk. The museum is on the smaller side—you can comfortably see everything in about an hour—but the exhibits are high quality, especially the towering dinosaur skeletons, which were a real highlight. It’s very educational, though not the most suitable for young kids. My 5-year-old daughter was frightened by some of the lifelike stuffed animals, and we noticed other young children reacting similarly. It's worth a visit for the unique displays, but do note that it’s a bit out of the way and not near other attractions.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114542374982525257775/reviews
Poh Leong Ng,4,I have been to many Natural Museums in the world and is impressed with what on displayed in LKCNHM. It is not a big museum but it has enough to enjoy with a toddler who is first-time experiencing the wonders of nature. A great place to learn and be amazed together with your kids.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102277716143660732726/reviews
Ken Tay,5,"Absolutely fascinating museum! The Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum is a hidden gem in Singapore. The exhibits are incredibly well-curated, especially the dinosaur fossils – they’re breathtaking up close. There’s so much to learn about Southeast Asian biodiversity, from rare plants and animals to marine life and geology. The layout is spacious and thoughtfully designed, making it easy to navigate and enjoy at your own pace. Perfect for both kids and adults. Highly recommended for anyone interested in nature, science, or just looking for a unique experience in Singapore!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116191322787657534557/reviews
Xun Hooi Chng,5,"Very nice and cool. The whale display is interesting, and the dinosaur bones are real, which is really cool. I could lift the meteorite next to the dinosaur exhibit, very cool. The real elephant skull is interesting. Felt real chills down my back looking at the taxonomy exhibit. The skull and skeleton display is very nice. The first floor is already full of interesting exhibits and informative text. The second floor was also really interesting.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100957153273783892771/reviews
