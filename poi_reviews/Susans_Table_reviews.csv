Chatter Box,2,"I didn't experience the 5-star experience as reviewed by a number of Google reviewers (and some reviewers eg. Bianca Flores, Nessa Q, Jana Timtiman --   Are these reviews real?  Maybe they reside in Singapore.... but I wonder.).

1. Good, but didn't deserve 5-stars:  I thought the food was good, but probably didn't deserve 5-stars, maybe 3-and-half stars.

I had high expectations, but that high expectations were not met.

2. I ordered when the special menu included seafood & meat pancake, both of which had a smell (that suggested the ingredients may not be fresh).  so, minus 1 star.

3. Some of the foods were good (eg kimchi).... but not exceptional. (but it's supposed to be made by Korean chef, so it is taken for granted to be good.... ) so, add 1/2 star.

4. Rather pricey (and the ingredients don't seem like they are that premium.  e.g. the ingredients used for the pancake, the galbi).  the minimum order of $130 for free delivery is quite prohibitive, and there is an additional GST charge on the price you see.   Would be good if the pricing was all-in...  :) so, minus 1/2 to 1 star.

all in, 2 to 2.5 stars.....

(PS.  I ordered in Nov 2022.  this is a delayed review.  I haven't ordered any since then.... )",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100914644565708273331/reviews
