Was about to consume it yesterday 27 Nov, however turned out to be all mouldy although expiry was 12 Dec.\nEmailed SMH foods right away, yet there was not a single acknowledgement nor reply from the company.\nI believe that SMH foods can really work on this issue and do better in terms of food quality, customer retention and satisfaction.\nI decided to post the email as well as the pics here on Google Map for everyone to take note.\n\n** SMH Foods replied this afternoon 2 Dec acknowledging this issue, this problem. Willingly to do a refund/ exchange.",
