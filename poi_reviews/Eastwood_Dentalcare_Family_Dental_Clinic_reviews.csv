Sebin Aum,5,"Dr. Ang is amazing! I was nervous about getting my wisdom teeth removed, but she made the whole process so smooth and stress-free. She checked in on me throughout the procedure, which made me feel really cared for. Everything healed up great and I couldn’t have asked for a better experience. I’d definitely go back to her. Highly recommend!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114850649310296200652/reviews
Rashida yaacob,1,"A visit to see dentist Dr Ang & A nightmare for my treatment ….
As it was first time seeing her & her explanation to me was to  remove my crown molar to save my tooth     .
Cost total cost was $4k
She charge me $910 for the first job ..
She was a sole practitioner or an individual that works there
It took an hour for the drilling I’m able to withstand it without  her nurse
to help me .during the drilling .
Normally it alway a nurse to assist a dentist ..
She written a referral letter to recommend me to see an Endodontist
After the treatment I felt pain & sensitivity  and I could not eat & wen she  call me  to check on my condition which I refused to see her again ..
The recomended Endodonist  was away for holiday @ I cannot wait for too long .  I have no choice but to see another  top notch Endodontist .
The Endodontist examined my molar tooth & found out there is a tiny hole .
It is no longer treatable and the tooth cannot be saved & will need to extracted .
Dr.Ang was so confident that the tooth can be save  and to come back to her for fixing of molar crown after my root canal treatment ..
Now that I can recalled . Dr Ang did check on me prior to if I visited to see the Endodontist
Now I understand , her drill broke abit of my molar tooth , due to her negligence and a tiny hair line crack  at the back of my molar .
Not only she charge me a bomb for her service of 1 hr drilling    to remove crown molar tooth but left me a a big hole in my pocket !!!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112890167972918163607/reviews
Sumithra Whyte,5,First time visiting Eastwood Dental Care. Have phobia for dentist but Dr Joanna Ang is very experienced and the nicest. Minimal discomfort and she checks on you regularly if you’re feeling ok. Made me feel comfortable and I was happy. Will surely visit again for routine dental check-up whenever I’m back in Sg,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118309213261339154042/reviews
Fann,2,"Was quite a painful experience when I did my fillings here. I was given three shots of LA for my filling cause the pain was too unbearable.

Also the dentist gave me grey fillings which I have not seen in a long time. (Even years ago when I did my fillings, i had the white ones done) Later, i found out from other dentists that it actually costs less to do the grey ones than the white.

My experience here wasn’t the cheapest and wasn’t the most comfortable. Although I must say the receptionist was really polite and friendly. :)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111980012340186517982/reviews
