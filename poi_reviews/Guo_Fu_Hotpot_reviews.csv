KY Chow,3,"The food selection is quite decent. There are two options available: a one-time payment for buffet-style steamboat, or a set meal.
For beverages, we opted for the free-flow option, priced at $2.90 or $3.90. The pricing also includes a sauce bar, similar to HDLâ€™s setup.
We chose the set meals (come with individual hotpot) and ended up paying $38.60+ per person.
The environment is cozy, making it a great spot for large group gatherings.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113999415499081292268/reviews
Mr J,5,"Hot pot paradise.! Great setting and good quality food. Individual serving of soup with good options of soup bases. Instead of the buffet (which had a wide spread which comes at a higher cost), we opted for the set menu. It came with generous servings of meat, veg and noodles. Very satisfying.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110048148088114334117/reviews
RaChelle sy,5,"I was pleasantly surprised by the location of Guoco, which is on the carpark level. The food quality was quite good, especially the buffet spread. I appreciated the high quality of the meat and the extensive selection of vegetables. The restaurant was kept very clean, and the service was prompt. I would definitely recommend it!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101946108062311189159/reviews
Rachel Alison,5,"Weâ€™re return customers! ðŸ˜Š as usual, the staff are really friendly and helpful! Place is clean and I love the ambience really like the idea of individual hot pots. The ingredients are good and fresh,  xiaolongbao was yummy. There were sides like fried mantou with condensed milk and the scallion pancake as well, but wasnâ€™t really a fan of the fried banana fritter. Lucky that we came when thereâ€™s an anniversary promo. Will definitely come back again.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112613607698536741421/reviews
Teck Boon,4,You get your own individual pot and can select either one or two soup bases. Meat and seafood will be served and vegetables are self-service. Service is generally prompt and attentive but can see some of the staff are quite new so they might take a while to figure out whatâ€™s going on. Overall still a decent dining experience if the place is not too crowded.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105978834231481267643/reviews
