If you call for noodles and chicken on side be sure include chilli in noodles if not it just tasteless. Can try if you are in the area. Stall near escalator. You can't miss it.",

      "text": "Came here at about 4pm and they were still open, so I'm not really sure how accurate the hours are.\n\nQuite a good stall for soy sauce chicken rice! There's a $3.50 and $4.50 portion. Getting the $4.50 portion seems worth it to me, as you are served quite a big portion of chicken too. I got mine with extra rice for $0.50, thus the picture may seem like it has alot of rice.\n\nThe rice is higher quality compared to typical chicken rice stores, and it does show from the taste. The chicken is also not dry and rather chewy. Not many people would comment on the soup, but the soup here is also quite tasty and light compared to other stores.\n\nOverall, I do feel like the place is worth another visit! Do note that they only accept cash payments, but it shouldn't be an issue as there are ATMs for the 3 major banks here across the street at Taman Jurong Shopping Centre.",

      "text": "As usual, it is hard to find a day gone by without seeing any queue when you have a crave for traditional Hong Kong Soy Sauce Chicken.\n\nThe queue is made worst during Chinese New Year Eve, when people will order one full chicken. Why? Because for half piece chicken @ $7.00 and whole piece chicken @ $14.00 during normal time.\n\nFor this Chinese New Year, the boss is just doing a service with a small mark up @ $20.00. How not to order from this stall? üòÅ\n\nNow, for the food, I always go for the Soy Sauce Chicken Noodles. The boss is always very generous with his giving. My wife all time favorite is the Chicken Rice.\n\nA check with the boss on the review here that someone posted the use of MSG. His replied is he never claimed that his chicken sold at stall does not comes with no MSG. What is a small usage may be a lot to others, while what seems to be a lot may only be a small portion in the eyes to some. And there is no claims to said MSG cannot be used in cooking.\n\nIn conclusion, all I can say is, so far I have got no complain about the overall, be it service, attitude or price.\n\nThis is a MUST TRY stall if you are in Taman Hiring Food Centre.",

This stall served white rice with soy sauce chicken.\n\nThe white rice is solid and of high quality. The soy sauce chicken are not just a few pieces, but a spread of more than 5 pieces over the bowl. A good amount to feel shiok after the meal.\n\nThe chicken are flavorful and tender.\n\nThey served it in a big bowl with chopsticks. Spoon and fork are not available.\n\nI ate it twice and I still love it. If it's chicken rice other than white rice, it will be even more attractive to me.",
