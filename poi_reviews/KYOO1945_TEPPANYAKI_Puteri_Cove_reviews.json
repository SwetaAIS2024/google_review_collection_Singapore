The vegetables were so flavourful and the beef was so soft and tender.\n\nRicky served us and was very friendly as well. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a affordable lunch trppanyaki",

When we arrived, we were greeted by a not so friendly staff that told us a large family came and there's no more counter seat.  Told us to come back 1hr later and he will only hold the seats for 10 mins.  But the resturant was not even that crowded when we head back 1hr later. Nothing great, will not go back again.",
