The captivating aroma of Indian spices filled the air, tantalizing my senses and building anticipation for the culinary delights to come.\n\nThe attentive staff members were knowledgeable about the menu and provided excellent recommendations, ensuring that every aspect of my dining experience was exceptional as always.\n\nI couldn't resist trying the Chicken Biryani & Chicken Mee Goreng. The tender chicken pieces melted in my mouth, leaving me craving for more. Each spoonful was a delightful explosion of flavors.\n\nBarakath restaurant is truly a gem, I highly recommend visiting Barakath Restaurant.",

They gave us a bottle of chilli, but the chilli wasn't spicy at all.\n\nTeh Tarik so so only.\n\nSaving grace was the omelette, at just $2, for the price, it's good. Service was good as well, that is why I gave two stars.",
