      "text": "Yor Ying Thai Cuisine has officially earned its spot in my Top 3 Best Thai Restaurants in Singapore! Having visited five times already, I can confidently say this hidden gem serves some of the most authentic and flavorful Thai food around.\n\nOne of the standout experiences this time was discovering a special off-the-menu dish—a creamy shellfish creation cooked with coconut milk and a medley of rich Thai herbs. The dish exuded the essence of Thai countryside flavors, boasting the perfect balance of creaminess, spice, and herbal aroma. It felt like a heartfelt homage to authentic Thai cuisine.\n\nThis isn’t just food; it’s an experience. Yor Ying Thai Cuisine consistently delivers the bold, rich flavors that remind me why Thai food is so universally loved. I’m already planning my next visit. Highly recommended, reasonable price with no GST and service charges too.",

While the prices seemed higher, they don’t charge GST or service fees. We ordered Phad Thai and Pineapple Rice, both of which were enjoyable. The serene and pleasant environment makes it an ideal spot for a quiet lunch.",
