Angelia Ong,4,Oh. Very traditional type of Wanton mee. Looks plain but yet Comforting. The chicken feet is damn good. Noodle texture a bit raw for my preference but really subjective. Deserve a try for sure,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104210258669802767274/reviews
GouRmeT PaLatE,3,"This stall has recently undergone a change in ownership. Currently, the serving size is more generous than it used to be. The char siew is delicious, and the wantan is also flavorful and filled with substantial chunks.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103735107529798264433/reviews
Daniel Wong,3,"Had the large wanton noodles due to the good reviews. There was even a queue of 6 persons. The char siew, wanton and the soup was good. However the most important thing to me, the noodles was a disappointment. It taste of lye and the texture was not chewy (QQ)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115145949078497107987/reviews
Sean Goh,4,"Tried this wanton noodle in one of the coffeeshop at blk 69 Bedok South. There was already a short queue when I was there, there were at least 4 people in front of me. While I was queuing up, notice many people were eating the wanton noodle from this stall. Queue moved pretty slow, as the stall was operated just by 1 person. Wanton noodle starts from SGD$3.50 onwards. Apart from the standard wanton noodle, they also served braised chicken feet and dumpling.

Noodle was nicely cooked. Texture of noodle was springy. The sauce has that old school taste to it. Wanton was flavorful. A pity that the charsiew was too dry.Overall, I think that it was an above average wanton noodle, no wonder it was so popular with the residents.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Gary Goh,5,My first time coming here for breakfast. Tired the wanton noodles and I was very satisfied with the servings and taste of this wanton noodle. I would say it exceeded far my expectations and I would strongly recommend my frens and family to try it out here.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115188000065458803058/reviews
