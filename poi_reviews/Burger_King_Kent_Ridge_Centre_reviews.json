Not worth the money in my opinion plus service terribly slow, I came in mid-day weekday and so little staff and all slow-mo need wait more than ten minutes.\nNo utensils given at all I ownself take from their counter which was for dessert.\nOn and birds are regulars here too, eating crumbs every now and then. Aunties do yall think floor can sweep itself?",
