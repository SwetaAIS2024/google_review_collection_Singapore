As usual, I love their signature dish duck roasted with angelica herb, I can never feel enough. ü§£ Their baby kailan is nice, yet I forget to take a pic on that.  ü§™ Highly recommend these 2 dishes.\nI'm someone who loves sweet and sour pork, yet over here this dish din win me over, neither is the fish.

      "text": "Dropped by Dian Xiao Er for a family dinner and the experience was a mixed bag of culinary highs and lows. The signature 10 Wonder Herbs Roasted Duck is a delight, with a sauce that's both aromatic and flavourful, creating an irresistible herbal combination with the succulent duck juices. The Roasted Iberico Char Siew is another standout, tender with melt-in-your-mouth fat that‚Äôs kept me going for repeated servings. However, the vegetable sides were a letdown. The Kailan had a puzzling sour aftertaste, and the Spinach with Egg Trio was especially disappointing, lacking any egg presence in its clear broth. While their meats are commendable, the vegetable dishes need improvement.",

      "text": "Food: it's really good, though opinions are divided especially among the elders. The ducks of all flavours are a must try. The other meat dishes are underrated, I guess because most ppl get duck for meat. Quite diverse options for vegetables.\n\nPrice: be prepared to spend. However, you may get good deals from their memberships or dining in offpeak.\n\nService: order via QR code. Food came relatively quick.\n\nAtmosphere: Chinese restaurant style. Noisy when crowded, medium-high seat density.\n\nOverall, will recommend to come when there is memberships/discounts promos.",

Hotplate fiery sambar squid and prawn was good.  Roasted duck with angelic herb was good.  Service wasn't great.  Requested for refill of tea took a while because they were busy packing up.  Overall not a good experience at this outlet.",
