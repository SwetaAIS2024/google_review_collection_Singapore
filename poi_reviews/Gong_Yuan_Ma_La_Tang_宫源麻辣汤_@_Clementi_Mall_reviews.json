      "text": "Price is around $15 per pax for a filling dinner! Dined in at this Clementi Mall outlet on a weekday dinner at 6pm, staff were swift in taking orders. I had tried the mala soup and added a “beaten egg” which made the soup super creamy. There’s a condiment bar with free flow kimchi, spring onion, coriander and sesame paste. Would be good if they could add on peanuts as a condiment as well. The food counter (meat and vegetable) area was kept clean with no foul smell that mala places sometimes have, and condiment counter was rather clean. You have to self service from taking your own food to returning your plates etc, but there’s no service charge so definitely reasonable! One point is that I wish the tables were better cleaned though. Because everyone returns their own dishes, the tables aren’t cleaned by staff as frequently. Would recommend getting the potato noodles as that paired really well with the broth. I’d skip on the instant noodles selection the next time. Meat and vegetables were all fresh!",

However, I found the soup a bit too salty for my taste. The service was quick and efficient. It’s a self-service style where you pick your ingredients and pay by weight.",
