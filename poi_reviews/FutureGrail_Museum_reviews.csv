Cyrus Yong Wei Jie,5,"First time taking my time to come down to FutureGrail, which is an amazing watch museum for watch & horology enthusiast to learn more about the vintage luxury timepieces, as well admiring all well-preserved and maintained antique pocket watches & other timepiece collections.

Jessica Lange,5,"Futuregrail is the best place to learn on Watch Terminology üíê

Alongside each piece were notes with specifications written thoughtfully ‚ù§Ô∏è

Was hoping to see Omega but Futuregrail focuses on Patek Phillipe for their Vintage Pieces but hey, it's free admission & so so value added when education sets in üôèüôè.

This museum opened my eyes to the world of Enamel Pieces to me ‚ú®

The thought of creating true to life images on minute surface areas in the past bewilders me as they had little devices for it, as with the chisels too ‚ù§Ô∏è.

Details were extremely intricate and it surely took great skills delicately to commit to each piece ‚ú®

Such a pleasure to my soul to be in view of these Vintage Time Pieces üî•

Thank you Futuregrail for opening up this place, it has been very helpful in my Vintage Watch appreciation journey ü´∂.

Will be back to learn more again üôå",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115771738317627070649/reviews
Michelle B,5,"I made a visit in September with my partner and left 1.5 hours later having good vibes from the conversations with the senior timepiece advisor Sam. Not only did Sam gave us a personal guided tour of the watches on showcase (which we didn't expect), he was generous in sharing what he knows and patiently entertained all the questions that we had. Thank you Sam! :)

Will recommend anyone keen to be acquainted more knowledge on luxury watches to pay a visit to FutureGrail, it's free after all!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111380319348392351547/reviews
