My favourite Thai organic red brown rice is still available.  And I would like to thank the TL for the relevant section for ordering the Taiwanese green max brand of multi grain ‰∫îË∞∑Á±≥ rice for me.  Highly recommended to visit this outlet as you won't be disappointed with the good variety of products and also the sushi and baked chicken. The staff are also very helpful with our purchases.  Highly recommended!",
