Billy Mo,5,"I've never been there eating. I always get delivery from them for the workers here. And I've changed my order items due to our workers are vegan.. and *Nila* has been patience enough to keep updating my orders. This is first class service.

Talk about food quality. I've ordered 18 - 30 packs in 1 shot but nothing changed and tasted just great pippin hot food served.

Delivery is on the dot. I need it for lunch they delivered on lunch time.

Side note for Nila, you've done a great job and your are still doing great. Keep it up!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100529225867493862857/reviews
