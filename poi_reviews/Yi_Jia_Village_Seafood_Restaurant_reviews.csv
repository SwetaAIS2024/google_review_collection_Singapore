Ivan Michael Pung,5,"This Zhi Char Resturant has been in Toa Payoh Lor 7️⃣ Market for well over 20yrs. 📆 Moved once from one coffee shop to another but the consistency 💪 in the food 🍲 they have produced over the years is truly admirable 😎.

Staff : Are mostly old 🧓🏻 timers who I now know by heart ❤️. They have been with them for ages. Friendly, patience and always ready to recommend a dish or two 💁🏼‍♀️.

Food : They say in Singapore, 🇸🇬 “Good stuff, cannot bluff!” Really have Wok Hey in the fried food and always well marinated, well prepared and well cooked! I would recommend this few simple dish 1) Their Prawn 🦐 Ball, 2) The Cai Poh Tofu 🧈, 3) The Black Bean Beef 🥩Hor Fun and 4) Cereal Prawn 🍤 . These 4️⃣ dishes 🍜🧆🍲🍤 stands out the most for me. Unfortunately, I will honestly say their crab 🦀 is not up to the usual crab restaurants (will not mention other names) standards. And the crab are not Sri Lankan 🇱🇰 crabs so, I will not normally make it my first 🥇 choice to order crab here.

Overall, an affordable and enjoyable 🙇‍♂️  eating out experience. Oh and they give free desserts 🍧!! Lol 🤣 so of course, we will be back 🔄!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100551027047446956883/reviews

Jun,3,"Went on Sunday lunch, little crowd. Good serving and affordable.
Big portion of Hor fun about 12 bucks with good serving of fish slices,pork slices, about 3-4 fresh prawns.
Cereal calamari has more batter than cereal but has a good amount of serving.
Garlic kampong chicken is tender and comes with some nai bai, also has some minced garlic-ginger and spring onion sauce.
Pork ribs is normal.
Spring onion fish slices has good amount of spring onion and ginger.
Caipo crispy toufu has a touch of crispy rice on top. A good dish to go with rice.
8 pax for about 120 is really a gd buy.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107886663772698444350/reviews
Florence Leow,4,"🥢🍚🟫  This Yi Jia Village Seafood Restaurant is one of the better zhi-char 煮炒 stalls here in Toa Payoh East area. The quality of the dishes here is pretty good.

🟩 A good quality zhi-char stall should be able to churn out a varied array of dishes to order.  🔷️ I can tell you the zhi-char dishes here are great, and that's why the kopi-tiam ( coffee shop) here is also very lively.

🟠 During festive occasions, like Chinese New Year or the Mid-Autumn Festival, this place is packed to the gills. That is testament to how good this zhi-char stall is.

🟤 They do very good zhi-char classics here, but I like their Gu-Loh-Yuk alot. 🟧 Their Sweet & Sour Pork is succulent & juicy,  the batter coating is very crispy, and the entire dish is drenched in this sticky, tangy but flavourful sauce.

🟫 The 2nd dish I love from them is = the Chye Poh Braised Tofu. 🥢 The entire slab of tofu is deep-fried first, then braised in this sweet-salty umami-filled soy sauce gravy and laden with tons of chye poh nibs.

🔷️ The result is a scrumptious & savoury slab of soft, smooth & silky tofu topped with lots of chye poh ( preserved radish)

✅️ Previously, they used to drench the braised tofu with minced meat or bak chor. But they changed the recipe recently, but it's still good.

❇️ Service-wise, as with most kopitiam zhi-char stalls, the service staff here are efficient, swift and amiable. 😅 The atmosphere you get here is that of a bustling and boisterous ambience in a typical HDB coffeeshop zhi-char setting.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews
J C,1,"Came here for dinner. Reservation was 6.30 but food was only served at 830. Can’t blame them, it was around CNY. Food was average at best due to the sheer volume of cooking. Seating was cramped as it was raining. Some tables were set at the wet market. Probably come here another time when it’s not so crowded for another review.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116952722861631945204/reviews
