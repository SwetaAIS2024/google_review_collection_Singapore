      "text": "My solo trip to Singapore was elevated by the Fairmont Singapore. Its prime location above City Hall MRT, with access to multiple train lines and Raffles City mall, was perfect. The Marina Bay View room was stunning, impeccably clean, and the bed incredibly comfortable. The spacious bathroom with a soaking tub was a treat. Staff were exceptionally welcoming and helpful, and early check-in was greatly appreciated. Check-in and check-out were seamless. For its location, luxury, and service, the Fairmont Singapore is the best hotel I've experienced in the city.",

      "text": "Fairmont Singapore – A mixed experience with some highs and lows.\n\nThe staff were professional and courteous throughout our stay, though there was a noticeable lack of warmth compared to other hotels we've visited in our travels.\n\nOur biggest issue was the room temperature—it was uncomfortably warm, and the air conditioning settings couldn’t be adjusted enough to make a real difference. Despite requesting assistance, the problem remained unresolved. The in-room fridge was also disappointing; unless you're purchasing hotel-stocked items, there's barely enough space to store anything else—just a slim 60mm slot at the bottom.\n\nOn the positive side, the view from our room was stunning, especially at night when the city lights up. The pool was a great place to unwind, though it’s worth timing your visit as it can get quite busy.\n\nLocation is a definite highlight—centrally placed with easy access to major attractions like the Merlion, Singapore Flyer, and War Memorial Park, plus a range of food and shopping options right downstairs at Raffles City.\n\nOverall, a decent stay with some lovely features, but comfort concerns held us back from fully enjoying the experience. Probably a better fit for adults travelling without children.",
