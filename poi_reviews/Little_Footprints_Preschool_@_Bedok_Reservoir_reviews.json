      "text": "I have two sons who attend LFP and I am very thankful to the staff and principal for their care and dedication to my kids. Ms Sikin, the principal, is hands-on and stepped in to help my older son when he initially had difficulties adjusting due to his poor command of Mandarin. The teachers are amazing! They are friendly, professional, caring in spite of their workload. There is always an open line of communication and I know I can trust the educators there. My sons have thrived in the last 2 years and are always talking about their laoshi and teachers. My three year old even roleplays as his teacher because he loves them so much. As the year comes to an end and my son is graduating from K2 soon, there’s a bittersweet feeling, but I am very grateful that he’s attended a good kindergarten for his preschool years.\n\nBig thank you to the K2 teachers - teacher Sha, Hou laoshi - and the Pre N teachers - Liew laoshi, teacher Astel, teacher Amie!",

      "text": "Lovely experiences with the teachers since Callum started attending school here in K1 last year - and just like that, he's going to graduate from K2 at the end of this year. Teacher Astel is very caring and attentive towards the needs of the children, and is always available to answer our queries and to assure us that the little ones are in great hands. Teacher Sikin and the other teachers, although not his class teacher, are also very warm and friendly towards him from day one.\n\nCallum will miss all of you once he leaves for primary school. Happy Teachers' Day to all teachers and staff of LFP @ Bedok Reservoir!",
