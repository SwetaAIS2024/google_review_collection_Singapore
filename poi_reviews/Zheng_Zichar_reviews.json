      "text": "The portions are just right, and the pricing is reasonable, considering the location and partial sea view. The white wine, priced at $38 (inclusive of GST), is a good deal, though it would be nicer if they served it in proper wine glasses instead of plastic ones.\n\nThe curry fish tail, at around $30+, has ample curry but not much meat. On the other hand, the large vegetable dish at $11.90 is great value, offering nearly double the portion size you‚Äôd find elsewhere for a small.\n\nThe food flavors are decent, though nothing particularly stands out. I wouldn‚Äôt mind returning if I‚Äôm in the area.\n\nNo crowd on a public holiday (labor Day)",

      "text": "1st visit since they took over Bellyview.  It's Zichar food but it's really nice and value for money. An outstanding item with the Seafood Trio which comprises big prawns, small squid and a generous serving of clams in a delicious zesty Thai that is out of this world. Service was also excellent with Chris (Mei Ling) our server being so cheerful and helpful. Her sincerity and friendliness made us so feel so at home.\n\nThe ambience is perfect on a cool evening, listening to the lapping waves and planes flying overhead as we enjoy yummy food over sunset\n\nUpdate 30 Dec 24: Our 3rd visit - food, service and ambience never fails. We came at 630 pm n stayed till closing at 9 pm. It was so good to enjoy good food and service with the seabreeze, sounds of waves and planes flying overhead. Mei Ling and her colleagues were so helpful and friendly. She recommended the lobster which was only $57. Very reasonable indeed. We had it in chilli Crab sauce and it was yummy with the mantou. Flesh was succulent and tender unlike some other lobsters I've had.",
