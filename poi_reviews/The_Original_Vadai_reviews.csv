웬케빈,4,"I recently tried the cheese vadai from a popular vadai stall at our local cooked food centre, and it was an absolute delight! The crispy exterior gave way to a soft, flavorful interior that had just the right amount of spiciness from the cheese. It's perfectly balanced—not too overpowering but enough to give your taste buds a little kick. This snack is incredibly versatile and makes for a great treat any time of day. Highly recommend giving it a try if you're in the area!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107458777477246149283/reviews
M P,2,"Somehow it doesn’t taste the same as the shop from Beach Road

It’s taste abit oily and the spices not as strong as before.

I don’t recommend",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112908652574347918174/reviews
