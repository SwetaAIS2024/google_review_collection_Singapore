Eugene Ching,5,"A really quiet and ""inside"" place that is incredibly comfortable. You'll probably have to drive or get a ride to get there though. Nice ice cream flavors, and an interesting experience when paired with their mochi waffle. The staff there are very friendly and helpful, the ambience is pleasant and inviting. The place has both indoor and outdoor seating, so you can choose whichever suits your fancy.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110175332674403973273/reviews
