Chemical917,3,"Went here for the buffet. 30++ per well it is worth which such various choices with this price. So price aspect is pass. Taste is normal, the seafood is fresh no doubt. The pasta is too salty I can't even finish it. The roasted beef was good originally it has a splendid taste at the beginning but after few refill it getting worse. Overall is ok, I like the swimming pool view.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100243410242905503064/reviews
