      "text": "With the new principal who has just came on board for 1.5 years, the school has finally begun to see remarkable improvements and positive transformation. He has clear vision of academic excellence and is instrumental in ensuring the boys are raised properly and not bullied in school.\n\nFacilities are still old but he transformed it by upgrading to his best efforts, which was not seen and neglected by the previous principals. The PSLE and O-levels results improved vastly over a short span of his leadership. As proud Marist, We hope to see Maris Stella raising its standards and going back to its old high days again!!",
