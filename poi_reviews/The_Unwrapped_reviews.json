      "text": "Good food, friendly staff, big portions and at a fair price! This restaurant provides a great deal for those who are looking to get their fill of mediterranian cuisine. Ordered 2 servings of their butter chicken burrito bowls, with extra protein, which came heaped with loads of fresh veggies and meat. On the side, greek ranch and a spicy sauce was also provided.\n\nAs an appetizer, we got the 5 pc of falafel with hummus, which was well balanced with flavour and piping hot.\n\nAlthough this restaurant may be listed as a delivery spot, they have a decent sitting area on their second floor, accessible via a stairway.\n\nDefinitely drop by if you are hungry and in the area! They are currently running a dine in promo with eatigo, and you can get up to 50% off at selected dining times.",

Staff is very humble, polite, & takes your feedback very honestly. It has become a go-to-go place for me.",

      "text": "I've ordered multiple times via Foodpanda and Deliveroo, always leaving positive reviews. However, todayâ€™s order was a bit disappointing. While the delivery was 25 minutes faster than usual, the food arrived cold, and the portion of chicken shawarma was noticeably smaller than usual. I also found it odd that the item was marked as \"not available\" on Foodpanda but was still selectable on Deliverooâ€”perhaps due to low stock? I hope the quality and portion sizes remain consistent in the future.",
