Bdepp,3,"Deep fried pork strips awesome. Tomyum soup and Sotong not bad. Lala sauce was too diluted for some reason, Omelette so not worth it and plain, can cook your own at home.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118193857300881927633/reviews
Stanley,4,"Pineapple rice was well fried, not too oily and topped with pineapples, raisins, cashew nuts and chicken floss. Tom yum soup tasted sour and it wasn't spicy at all.  It was awesome and price was reasonable too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109779294020772182875/reviews
