Zi Xuan Lee,4,"I visited their Trifecta outlet (opposite 313 Somerset with views of Asia’s first urban snow, surf & skate playground!) for a weekend brunch and also to redeem the Burpple Beyond 1-for-1 deals!

Using the 1-for-1 Bar Bites coupon, I scored both dishes at just $20.71 after GST which is an absolute steal for central Orchard.

Meatballs with Toast ($18)
Seven generously sized, handmade pork and beef meatballs came drenched in a hearty, herby tomato sauce — reminding me of a comforting butter chicken curry gravy.

The meatballs had a distinct herb-forward profile, with each bite bursting with flavour. Parmesan shavings melted slightly into the sauce, and the two thick slices of crispy, tangy sourdough toast were perfect for mopping up every last drop. The edges of the sourdough dough were a bit burnt, making it pretty hard. Still, this was simple, satisfying, and a great sharing plate (or a main all for yourself hehe).

Mentaiko Mac & Cheese ($19)
A rich, creamy base of cheddar and mozzarella, laced with a generous amount of mentaiko sauce. Bonito flakes added a smoky flair while tobiko gave a fun little crunch. However, some macaroni bits were noticeably dry and overcooked, making it super tough to bite. While there was crab meat, it was really minimal.

They really deliver a wide variety of choices with their menu, from brunch to bar bites, as well as bakes such as banana cake, croissants and brownies.

With sourdough done right and good vibes, Yeast Side Trifecta is the perfect pit stop before or after catching waves, slopes or skating thrills. Pro-tip: grab those Burpple deals : 1-for-1 pizzas, brunch and bar bites!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108657541934577016131/reviews
Amrita Bala,4,"We ordered this on Grab after having some lovely Pizzas a few days prior, at their Farrer Park outlet. The Trifecta pizzas were just as good! We ordered the Spicy Beef, Margherita, Salami, and Shrooms Pizza. For sides, we got the Truffle Fries, Cauliflower Bites and Wings. All were great except for the Cauliflower bites. The description on the menu says they are fried, so we the florets to be battered. However they were slightly roasted and somewhat tasteless. Nonetheless, it was a good meal.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109291788701225036133/reviews
Munny L,4,"Above average Sourdough Pizza at Trifecta Somerset – Worth a Try! 🍕✨

I visited this pizza place at Trifecta Somerset using a Burpple Beyond one-for-one voucher, which made the meal quite affordable. Since I was curious about their sourdough pizzas, it was the perfect chance to give them a try!

🍽️ Ambience & Service

We arrived on a weekday around 8:30 PM, and the place was very quiet 🏙️. There wasn’t any staff to greet us, so we seated ourselves. It’s a self-service concept—you order via QR code 📱 at the table and make payment at the counter.

The restaurant has a dark and cozy bar setting 🍸 but lacks a lively ambience. If you’re looking for a buzzing atmosphere, this might not be the best spot. However, if you prefer a quiet, chill place to enjoy your food, it could work.

🍕 Food & Prices

We ordered two pizzas and one side:
•	Carbonara Pizza ($22) 🧀 – This was the highlight! The béchamel sauce made it creamy and rich, and the cheese was super aromatic. I’d 100% order this again! 🤤
•	Pepperoni Beef Pizza ($26) 🍖 – A bit too salty for my taste, but that’s expected with pepperoni. If you enjoy bold flavors, you might like this one.
•	Popcorn Chicken with Mala Dressing ($16) 🌶️ – The mala dressing gave it a nice spicy kick, and it came with a mala coleslaw 🥗. The chicken itself was crispy and decent, but for $16, it felt a bit overpriced.

🍕 The dough was nicely done—not too burnt, which was great! It had a decent springiness, not super airy or bouncy, but slightly above average in chewiness. The crust had a nice bite without being too tough, which I appreciated.

🍽️ The pizzas are 18 inches, which is HUGE! Two pizzas were more than enough for two people—we were super full! 😋 The sourdough crust was great, but because the place was quite cold, the pizzas cooled down fast, so eat them quickly for the best experience.

🌱 Vegetarian Options

They also have vegetarian pizzas, which we didn’t order, but it’s great to know for anyone looking for meat-free options! 🍃

💡 Other Notes

✅ Tap water is self-service 💧 – You can grab glasses at the back of the restaurant.
✅ Restrooms available 🚻
✅ Payment options 💳 – They accept credit cards, Burpple vouchers, and there’s GST & service charge.
✅ Total Cost 💰 – After using the Burpple voucher, we paid $42 for two people, which is a great deal for two large pizzas and a side!

⭐ Final Verdict

If you’re looking for sourdough pizza at a decent price (especially with Burpple Beyond), this is a solid choice! The Carbonara Pizza was the standout ⭐, and I’d might come back for it.

🔹 Would I return? Maybe, if I wanna have pizza in town! 🍕💖

Jacqueline Gwee,5,"We tried the meatballs, crab mac and cheese, pesto chicken and kale pizzas, cauliflower, mushroom mash, chorizo and eggs. All were remarkable! A hidden gem located near Somerset MRT. Spacious open air area - you can watch the surfers too.

Andrea Soh,5,Passed by this cafe after my snowboarding class at Trifecta. Found out there was a $12+ lunch time set on weekdays which is a pretty good deal actually. Check out (in picture) my salmon burrata tartine + flat white which I polished off! Cheers to the very friendly staff - Silva as well. Will definitely be back again :),3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105611673279881713534/reviews
