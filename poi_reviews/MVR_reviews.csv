Lycane Jason,5,"Sharing about the new mala store that opens here. Regarding all the other stores, will update slowly.

Spiciness is good and the taste for the meat and crabmeat really bland together with the Tau ki. Really sweet taste that revolve around your tongue. The below portion for $10.80, definitely not the cheapest out there but I believed for the taste, it's reasonable. Worth a try",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112206511887992644774/reviews
