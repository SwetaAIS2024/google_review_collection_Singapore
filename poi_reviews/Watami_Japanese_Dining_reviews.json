Althought the standard of the food has probably deteriorated over the years, but with its reasonable price and setup, it's still a reasonable good restaurant with relatively good price(especially with the 30% offer on hotpot) for a fair meal. I have a pork hotpot with chicken karaage for $13.30. Almost the price you will have to pay in a food court. Recommended!",

      "text": "I was wondering why this outlet kept changing its staffs and today I couldn’t help but notice the female manager or senior scolded the uncle just for asking how to change udon to rice from the pos. She should be strip out from her position because she’s not suitable for the role. We walked in and the uncle served us very well and sincerely.\n\nWe stayed for our lunch for about an hour yet the tables didn’t even clear but only left the uncle doing everything. From serving to cleaning to going to different tables to help and explain the lunch set menu.\n\nThe tables stayed the same from when we came and left. One was sleeping, two were sitting down chatting.\n\nWhat I see is disrespectful to the elderly and no teamwork at all.",

      "text": "Went to the restaurant on 16th March 2025 for dinner and unfortunately, we experienced very bad and slow customer services. Our chicken skewer not fully cooked, told the staff about it and the staff asked us what he should do instead... we asked for an exchange of the skewers set (since they took the plate with other skewers too), almost half an hour in, and we only received the chicken skewer. Checked in with the staffs and was told there the other skewers were on the way (but we doubt so as we had to explain the whole thing to them again). 10mins in, we were still missing on the other 4 skewers and 2 set of salmon maki.\nEnded up, we left the restaurant with the missing orders, although we did manage to wavie off these items upon our request.",

Even helped me on a previous visit because I was not aware of the lunch deal promo and I saved some money instead of overlapping my order.\nThere is a membership that is off value where a 2 x $15 voucher is given and every visit gets a fries or kaarage chicken.\nNot bad.\nFood quality is good too.\nThere is a wide variety and they are nicely cooked and taste great.\nWill return.\nWell done.",
