Gator,4,"Nestled in the heart of eco botanic, LPS offers a delightful mishmash of global cuisines under one roof, catering to cravings for Western, Thai, Chinese, and local fare. With its broad menu, this spot is perfect for groups with mixed tastes or solo diners eager to explore.

**Variety & Taste:**
The restaurant’s strength lies in its impressive variety. From juicy **Western-style fried chicken chop** (a standout—crispy on the outside, tender inside, and perfectly seasoned) to aromatic Thai Tom yam and hearty local noodle dishes, there’s something for everyone. The **Chinese section** of the menu, while flavorful with classics like claypot dishes, does come with slightly modest portion sizes. That said, the quality of ingredients and authentic seasoning shine through. Thai dishes like tom yum soup strike a balance between tangy and spicy, while local specialties (think nasi lemak or hor fun) are comforting and well-executed.

**Service & Ambiance:**
Staff members are cheerful and attentive, offering quick recommendations without hovering. The casual, cozy vibe makes it ideal for laid-back meals.

**Value for Money:**
Prices are reasonable, especially given the generous portions for Western and local dishes. While the Chinese options might leave heartier eaters wanting more, the overall affordability makes it easy to order an extra side or dessert.

**Final Verdict:**
LPS is a gem for those seeking variety without compromising on taste. Don’t miss the fried chicken chop—it’s worth the visit alone! A great spot for families, friends, or even a solo treat. Just keep the portion sizes in mind if Chinese dishes are your main draw.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews

kok hing chong,5,"Dine in around 6:30pm on the second day of Chinese New Year. Comfortable environment (air conditioned space). Friendly service. Tasted the curry laksa (bee hun), it tasted reasonable OK. Personally, spiciness is mild, but it may more suitable for people with less spicy.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105421159330374702561/reviews
