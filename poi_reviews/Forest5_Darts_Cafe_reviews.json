      "text": "2 staff with horrible service (working on the night shift on 15 Feb). For context, there was a total of 3 tables (including my group of friends - 6 of us) and the entire bar was almost empty. Firstly even though we purchased the darts live card, we were allowed to only get 2 sets of house darts and the reason is ‚Äúoh we usually do that‚Äù. Like hello?? We were willing to put deposit so why does that matter when your bar is totally empty. Secondly, karaoke system was turned off on our side and we had to shift to the other side of the bar just to select songs. I think don‚Äôt operate better, looking at the crowd it won‚Äôt last long too.",
