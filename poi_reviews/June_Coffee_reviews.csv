k.ristenkhoo,4,"first of all, LOVE their coffee!!
rich and fragrant taste was tempted to get another glass. their matcha drinks were not bad too!

overall taste was good, it is just the service that needs improvement. understandable that it‚Äôs a saturday afternoon, but our food did take quite a long time to arrive and having the 70 min dining rule was a bit much, especially when it‚Äôs full house.

but i will say my overall experience there was nice, and we were well fed!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111653192598122041617/reviews
Hannah Banana,5,"Nice ambient and good service. As for food, I think I‚Äôll need to try more to be able to comment. Taro Matcha latte was good, yet to try their coffee. The sweet potato fries was nice! Will visit again to try out the other dishes, I like the variety of pasta they offer üòÜ",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109066902689296292448/reviews
Alice Koh,4,"Tried June Coffee and walked away pretty satisfied‚Äîespecially with the drinks. They‚Äôre definitely the strong point here. That said, be prepared for a wait. We waited around an hour for a table on a Sunday afternoon as they don‚Äôt take reservations.

Overall Drinks Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Strawberry Matcha Latte: 10/10 ‚Äì Perfect balance and refreshing. A must-try.

Black Sesame Latte: 8/10 ‚Äì Rich and nutty.

Kinako Matcha Latte: 9/10 ‚Äì The saltiness pairs surprisingly well with the bitterness of the matcha.

Overall Food Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Miso Carbonara: 7/10 ‚Äì A very light miso flavor. Not quite sure what the hype is about; tastes like a slightly salted basic carbonara.

Eggo Mayo Toast: 8/10 ‚Äì The highlight of the food menu. Not too eggy or greasy‚Äîjust a really good balance.

Crab Linguine: 8/10 ‚Äì Nicely cooked pasta with a light crab flavor. The sauce is subtle and not overly creamy, which keeps the dish from feeling too heavy. Not intensely seafood-forward, but still enjoyable and well-balanced.

Tater Tots: 8/10 ‚Äì A dish that‚Äôs hard to go wrong with, though the portion is a bit small.

Overall, it‚Äôs a great place for drinks and a decent bite. I‚Äôd come back for the drinks alone.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102554380811098840966/reviews

Val Kor,5,"Very clean aesthetic, ordered the rose pasta and the crab pasta which were both very unique and delicious! Ordered black sesame coffee and pistachio coffee too. But thought the coffee was mid. The cream flavours of both were rich but the coffee was quite tasteless to us.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105856891240495637042/reviews
