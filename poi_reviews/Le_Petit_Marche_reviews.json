      "text": "Recently, I had the pleasure of trying the honey and cheese platter, specially curated by Chef Nicolas, and it was an absolute delight!\n\nChef Nicolas was very generous to provide 4 types of cheese and 3 types of organic honey from France complete with crackers (still crispy though i consumed 2 hours after i bought the platter), nuts and fruit.  Sufficient sturdy wooden spoons were also provided which helped cut through the cheese and scoop the honey with ease.  Could tell that a lot of effort and thought was put in.  Overall visually appealing and good value.\n\nMy favorite was the goat cheese pairing with lavender honey.  I scooped some of the cheese onto crispy crackers (also included in the platter) and drizzled lavender honey on it and was simply mindblown by the delightful contrast of flavors and textures.  The slight salinity,  and funk of the creamy and tangy goat cheese is perfectly balanced by the subtle floral sweetness of the delicate and smooth lavender honey.  Truly a match made in heaven - i think even people who dont like goat cheese will like such a pairing.\n\nLooking forward to try other pairings as well.  Will order again and recommend to everyone i know!",
