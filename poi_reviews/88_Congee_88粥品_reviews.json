      "text": "Yep. The bad reviews about this stall is true. To sum it up: mediocrity in a bowl. At a price tag of $5, there is practically nothing in the bowl. The fried dough fritter(油条) is ridiculously thin. Perhaps the fritter has been starving for months. Porridge is bland and ingredients are ridiculously little. Even the amount of cheap supermarket pork meatballs is little in this one.  High price meets low effort, a winning combination for any hawker. Give your money to more deserving hawkers, even if it means topping up a little more to get a decent meal. This is the worst way to spend $5. Trust me on that.",

      "text": "Ordered slice fish porridge + egg. It came without egg (which aunty claim she forgot, but there is no other customer except for me) the plain looking bowl of white porridge  only had 2 thinly strips of fish. I was freshly disappointed and went back to check with the aunty if it was genuinely fish porridge. She claimed it was. Super disappointed by her attitude, never ever coming back to this stall again... the younger aunty even commented, \"for $4.50 fish porridge, what do you expect\"",

      "text": "I have been craving a good bowl of congee after having hearty bowls at Tim Ho Wan and also Man Zuk  lately. So was looking forward to my visit to Congee 88 today. I remember their porridge being scrumptious and satisfying from a visit several years ago. Unfortunately, it was an utter let down. Ordered a fish and century egg congee. But there was barely any fish nor century egg! I felt i was eating plain white congee. Which seems like a raw deal for $4.50 at a hawker centre.\n\nI recall this shop used to be run by two men. It was two women at the stall today. Wonder if the vast difference in quality standards is due to different different owners/cooks. Based ok my experience today, i will never patronise this shop again.",
