      "text": "They're a legacy historic brand here at Lagoon. To be honest, this rojak is not something that can travel well. The sauces, mixed with the supposedly-crispy taupok and dough fritters, would have made the thing soggy by the time you're home (even if it was just 15 minutes). That said, if you were to eat there, I'm sure the rojak will turn out well. Uncle and auntie looks super friendly and passionate about what they're doing as well!",
