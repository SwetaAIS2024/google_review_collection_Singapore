The food is tasty authentic Japanese food.\n\nFor the lunch menu, it has a lot of side dishes to order example gyoza, tamagoyaki, edamame, tori karaage, salad, ebi tempura, and miso soup.\n\nThe don set can upgrade to set by adding $3 for any 2 sides to choose.\n\nHowever, the noodles do not come with a set meal.\n\nWe had 13 pax, and we set in a corner. Table full of food.\n\nFor the dinner menu, it has other varieties, including the yakitori.\n\nPricing for lunch is expensive, since in Joo Koon hub, there is food court. But once a while, can spend more during dinner time.",
