      "text": "Our experience with Global Tots Braddell has been absolutely wonderful! We looked at a few preschools around the Serangoon area and decided to enroll our toddler here, as we find that the principal is hands-on and responsive.\n\nTeachers are caring and attentive, creating a nurturing environment where our child feels safe and supported. We love that the curriculum is play-based, encouraging creativity and exploration through fun, interactive activities.\n\nThe large outdoor area is a huge plus, giving the kids plenty of space to run, play, and learn outside. Highly recommend this school for anyone looking for a warm, engaging, and well-rounded preschool experience!",

My kid is now more vocal and confident, often comes home telling me about her school with smiles and giggles. The outdoor play area is very big. My kid‚Äôs health also improved a lot, I believe it‚Äôs due to the wide range of physical activities they have in the school. It‚Äôs also a blessing to have swimming pool in the school so that she can start learning swimming at early age! I have nothing more to ask for! Thankful to GT Bradell!",

      "text": "Global Tots (GT) @ Braddell has been wonderful so far for my 2- and 4-year-old (enrolled since Jan 2023). The environment is lovely- indoors always clean, neat, well decorated and well lit, outdoors even better with lots of space for the kiddos to run around, slides and even a trampoline! The teachers have been amazing at engaging the children with learning and play. Lots of well planned activities, weekly waterplay and tiny tots (a kind of sports class). Plus, plenty of photo updates (which parents love). All the children at GT are always in smiles whenever I do meet them and this tell a lot about a school. A big thanks to all the edu-carers and also Aunty Karen for keeping the school sparkling clean!",
