We review,5,"Studied here before and have seen so many batches come and go! Whenever I walk past, I see the teachers bringing the kids around and being very patient and caring towards all of them! When there are no students, they are busy packing and cleaning the place! Talk about good cleanliness and environment for the kids! The exterior walls have multiple artworks of the kids and i think that is a pretty nice gesture for them to do that! Such an act will inspire and motivate the kids to do better and be proud of their effort at the same time!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101387943070592425719/reviews
