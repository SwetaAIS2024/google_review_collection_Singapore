      "text": "The present West Coast Park was developed in many phases.\nIn the 1998 redevelopment, a plan was made to include a Marsh Garden, comprising of a pond, with mud flats and wetland vegetation around it, aiming to provide a sanctuary for both local and migratory birds.\nThe Marsh Garden, located at the west end of the Park, is hidden from view. As you walk on the Boardwalk to enter the serene Marsh Garden leading to the pond's water edge, you can hear the calls of different birds from above. The viewing deck is quiet and shady. Immerse in it's surrounding vegetations and calm waters, and be mesmerise by it's tranquility.",

There are various kinds of trees to look at as well. I would recommend that you visit Marsh Garden during the day when the sky is blue, it will be nicer to take photos and appreciate the nature",

      "text": "Marsh Garden at West Coast Park is a pleasant spot dedicated to preserving Singapore's dwindling natural wetland environment and native flora. The small boardwalk over the marshland provides an enjoyable stroll under the shade, offering a peaceful experience. While there's only one observation point with limited views, the garden adds a nice touch to West Coast Park. Although not spectacular, itâ€™s a charming highlight worth visiting.",
