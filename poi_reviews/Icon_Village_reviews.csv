K Tan,4,"Icon Village is a cozy and charming mall, perfect for those yearning for good food and convenience. Tucked away in the heart of Tanjong Pagar and next to Mrt Station.

The selection of cafés, bakeries, and sandwich shops is impressive, offering everything from fresh pastries to gourmet sandwiches and specialty foods. Whether you're craving a hearty meal or just a quick coffee, there's something for everyone.

Location is accessible and ideal stop for office workers and residents nearby.
Overall, Icon Village is a  convenience place with quality food and lifestyle offerings.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105592887493237423833/reviews

Hendrix Oliver,3,It's more like a pathway to get to the other side of the block. There's not much inside except for a few restaurants. But there’s probably some issue with the venting system because it always smells kind of weird.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114272204961305016869/reviews
Flo G,5,"Nice quiet mall away from the main hustle bustle in Tanjong Pagar that houses mainly eateries, yoga movement Tanjong Pagar, an aerial yoga studio, some dental & medical services.

I like the tranquil settings, a place to sit for a coffee, tea break or longer. Personal favourites are Nick Vina Artisan for great bakes and Alice boulangerie.

There are plenty choices for brunches, meals, evening drinks and dinner.

The mall is designed with 2 main passage which gets somewhat confusing to locate certain eateries at times.

It is just 3 mins walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113094459489500763998/reviews
