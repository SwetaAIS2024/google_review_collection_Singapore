Eddie Tay,1,"A family holiday dinner turned Bitter and Upsetting. I’m a pretty easy going person who seldom post reviews, maybe 1 or 2 in 5 years. we specially chose to dine here hoping for a pleasant last night of the holiday, ordered many recommended dishes but a short curly hair female manager took and serve the wrong orders, over order our size portion and gave sarcastic excuses when we checked our orders with her. Please don’t get me wrong, we are willing to pay for good food and ambient type customers but please don’t take us as fools. Totally ruin our dinner and first impression on this LS restaurant.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117036716702900285943/reviews
jjohn cheow,1,"I would not recommend trying their Peking duck—it’s def come from frozen and lacks flavor. None of the dishes tasted fresh, and everything had a taste reminiscent of instant meals. The overall quality felt far from authentic or freshly prepared.""",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101711704649329999986/reviews

fb fb,5,"The food was so good.   Only the charcoal Tauhu was a bit too plain. No taste. The dessert was so fine, amazing.  However, the waitress who served our table could not under English.  Hence I’m giving only 3 stars for service.

The fish maw soup is very good. My mum likes it a lot. The lemon chicken is also good. Tried 3 types of bean curd. All not good. They are weaker in handling bean curd.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108988953130764487931/reviews
