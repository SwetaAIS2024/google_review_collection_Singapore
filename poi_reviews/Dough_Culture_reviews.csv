alyaa alya,1,"I did not buy food from here but I’d like to file a complaint. This worker working on Wednesday 28 June 2023 at 1.05pm was being disgusting and disrespectful. When I walked past this stall, he called out to me saying ‘excuse me’ as I turned to him as I thought I had dropped something, he gestured to my drink and asked if he could have some and started smiling creepily. I walked away quickly as I felt so disgusted and appalled by this disgusting behavior. He started laughing and so did his colleague. As I made my way to Old Chang Kee which was behind this stall, he continued smiling at me creepily making me feel very uncomfortable and disrespected. I went back to take a picture of him because there should be consequences but I felt unsafe and scared that it’ll happen again so I couldn’t get a clear picture of his face. I hope there will be consequences as this is just WRONG. Working in the F&B line includes serving customers, it is NOT making them feel violated uncomfortable. I wasn’t even a customer, just a passerby and yet I was made to feel uncomfortable and disgusted. I hope there will be consequences. Shame on him for acting that way at his grown age and shame on his colleague for just laughing along. Disgusting and inappropriate!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117579813594286316010/reviews
