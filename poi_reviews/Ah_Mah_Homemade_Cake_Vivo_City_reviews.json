It could be unsold cakes for a certain duration. However we proceed to take as it's not spoilt.\n\nHowever,  today we take a few more pieces and realized the taste is not right. We conclude the castella cake could have been unsold for few days or other reasons that result it's taste being not good.\n\nThus, we truly hope the management could look into maintaining freshness of the cakes.\n\nIn terms of customer services, it's generally ok. The cashier attending to us is polite. However there is another female staff who ignored us and turned her head away even when we said thank you.",
