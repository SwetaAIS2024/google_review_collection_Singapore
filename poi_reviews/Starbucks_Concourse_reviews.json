It is also impossible to contact you.

Spacious and rather quiet, the place accomodates approximately 50 pax with only indoor seatings but large tables. You get the usual drink menu with choice of cakes/sandwiches that can be re-heated upon request. Suitable for meet ups or a short coffee break for nearby office folks. Service crews were friendly and serve time was fast.",
