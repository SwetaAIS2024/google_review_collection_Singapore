They helped me to develop my leadership skills and gave me many opportunities to host events, plan things etc. The students there are okay, some can be a bit rowdy but you can still find some that are well-behaved. The school environment is pleasant too. I would highly recommend this school to those staying nearby or in Clementi.",

But everyday, the PA speakers are blasting too loud, way out into residents' homes.  Wouldn't it be perfect to tune the sound level down to what only the students and all in the school can hear? She doesn't need to shout, her voice is amplified already. Grateful if you heard me. Thank you.",

He said hi and she cried for no reason, blaming my friend for making her cry. It seems that the teachers have adopted an ideal that girls are more truthful than boys and so without any evidence whatsoever, made my friend copy the entire science textbook five times. Absolutely disgusting behaviour, my friend was extremely upset about this and hurt. Please fix your staff.",
