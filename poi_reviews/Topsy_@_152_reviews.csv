Shawn Chua,4,"Topsy@152 Bar is a charming and vibrant place with a lot to offer. The ambiance is cozy yet stylish, making it a perfect spot for both casual drinks and small gatherings. The cocktail menu is creative, with some unique twists on classic drinks that really stand out. I particularly enjoyed the [insert specific drink if applicable]—it was well-balanced and refreshing.

The staff is friendly and attentive, though during peak hours, service can slow down a bit. The food menu, while limited, has some tasty options, but I wish there were more variety or larger portions for the price.

One minor downside is the noise level when it gets busy, which can make conversations a bit challenging. That said, the overall vibe is lively and fun, so it’s a great place if you’re looking for energy.

Overall, Topsy@152 Bar is a solid choice for a night out. With a few tweaks, it could easily be a five-star experience!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110148836935463026308/reviews
Nicolas Levitte,5,"Nice little divy place bar in Little India. I love their selection of Belgian beers. A pretty large choice of food for a small place. Service is good, no nonsense business. I like the staff.

Please keep that selection @owner of Topsy :-)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106415946519062391897/reviews
