emilia mok,2,"The coffee at this outlet is rather inconsistent. Some days it's perfectly fine, but other times it's far too bitter to finish. Today, I ordered a Kopi C siew dai and it was served without the evaporated milk. However, there is one guy who consistently makes excellent coffee. I always hope he's working when I visit. I hope management can address this issue and provide more training to ensure consistent coffee quality. The service is generally good, but the inconsistency in the coffee is a concern",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104430643862645048978/reviews
Jennifer Loy,5,"This joint is one of my favourite place for my get to coffee ☕️, the team are very nice & they keep the place clean by removing all the cups/tray/plates after customer leave. The counter staffs are all friendly & food and drinks are quite consistent. I highly recommend this place cos it’s very near to the MRT station. The only flaw side is the cafe is beside the window 🪟 & during very hot days the sun ☀️ shine in and causes the temperature at the cafe to be on a more hotter side. Else not this is a nice joint to hang out for a talk with friends & business associate !

And if you happen to see the cafe outlet supervisor Ai Li , do say Hi cos she is one of the most friendly person I know compared to a lot of other Toast Box outlet !",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100747820698914158458/reviews
write an email,1,"Very disappointed of kovan outlet. The Chiba staff very rude and she saw have hair on the cup she just remove it and make the coffee. Never ever change a new cup for me. This is very disgusting 🤢 and the curry noodle oil more than the soup. And also the outlet without ac, very hot and humid 🥲👎🏾",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109192590911144732501/reviews
