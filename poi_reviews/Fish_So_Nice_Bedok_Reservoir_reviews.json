BOTH dishes were just too ^damn^ salty!!!  My heartrate totally spiked with the amount of salt in both dishes‚ù£Ô∏è\nCook either did not taste-test or was really *very* generous this evening.  üòí\n\nLater, we did see \\ notice the earlier customer (who ordered same dishes below) throw away more than half their portions!!  Guess we were just being too nice; brought up to not waste food, no matter how awful. _sigh_",
