YP,5,"Went to Dr Sean for issues in my ankle/heel area. He was attentive and skillful during the treatment. Felt the improvements in my ankle/heel after my second treatment, was able to walk properly without feeling the pain/tightness. Another note is that the price is really good as it encompasses consultation, treatment and Chinese medicine. Consistent service after my 5th visit today. Not something I can find easily elsewhere.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110736627487776070978/reviews
francis lim,5,"Was having extreme pain on my leg that went through ACL surgery 15yrs back. Luckily I chance upon Chime TCM and they diagnose that I had a sprain. After acupuncture session by them, my pain was totally relieved.

Highly recommended TCM!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103103385873132976825/reviews
Wilfred Teo,5,"I came to CHIME to receive acupuncture treatment for Bell's Palsy. Dr Shaun was both professional and kind. The facilities were up-to-date and I always left feeling better. This complemented the medication given by NTFGH.

The front counter staff was also professional and kind in her interaction with me, always checking to see if I'm better.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117936109089258108384/reviews
Isabel,5,"Dr. Sean is SUPERB!

He is such a humble, knowledgeable, enthusiastic and empathetic physician! I appreciate how Dr Sean even takes his time to address the concerns we had about other family membersâ€™ ailments who he hadnâ€™t personally treated before.

Dr Sean is also bilingual, which is harder to come by with Chinese physicians and what makes it so much easier for me to communicate my needs and concerns effectively.

Also, the rates were reasonable for all types  treatments and Iâ€™ve never felt pressured or been hard-sold for anything! Appointment scheduling was such a breeze too since his assistants are quite on-the-ball with replies via Whatsapp! There truly isnâ€™t a reason not to come back again and entire family are now all regulars ðŸ˜†",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114994443457176546259/reviews
Tan Bengwee,5,"Probably the best acupuncturist Iâ€™ve ever met , Dr Sean is indeed  professional and skilful . I had the worst ankle sprain thought it may take weeks to recover but lucky being recommended by friend to Dr Sean it only took 2 sessions of acupuncture and everything is back to normal. Really unbelievable skills he had. Highly recommended for sports injury personnel.Thumbs up for DR Sean and team!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116475685150858975158/reviews
