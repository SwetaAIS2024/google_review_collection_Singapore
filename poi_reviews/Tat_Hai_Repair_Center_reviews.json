Within 20 minutes, he had my washing machine fixed efficiently and professionally.\n\nThe service was not only fast but also very reasonably priced. What stood out most was his patienceâ€”he took the time to answer all my questions, shared useful knowledge, and guided me through everything I needed to know.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a reliable, skilled, and friendly handyman. Thank you, Tat Hai and Mr. Aung!",

The company didn't have to gasket at hand so I bought an OEM gasket from Shoppee and paid for installation. Benny was the repairman and came on time. The installation process was very complicated but he was very fast. The best thing about his service is he gave me advice on how to maintain the machine and what to do of machine breaks down again.",
