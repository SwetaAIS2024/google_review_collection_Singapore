jiaxin,5,"It was my first time doing lash extensions and Vanessa was very detailed in doing my lashes. She is also very friendly and approachable! The ambience was very relaxing also with background music and a comfortable bed to lie on while she does my lashes, almost fell asleep a few times~ Recommended to do lashes with her :)",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111411085642367863870/reviews
