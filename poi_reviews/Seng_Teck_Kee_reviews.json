      "text": "Had a late dinner and see only a few stalls open, Seng Teck Kee is one of them. Ordered a seafood fried rice, paid $6 for it and to my surprise it was ready in about 2mins. Good for the faster than fastfood service speed. However, was utterly disappointed with the meal. The fried rice came with a few pieces of sotong, 2 prawns and plenty of oil. The prawns were not fresh and it was actually cold when I bite it. Usually I'm not too picky and would just eat it, but this time round it felt really not right. I hope they can improve their cooking and not rush it. Fried rice is the simpliest asian dish that should not be messed up. For the price and being in a popular place, they need to live up to the standards.",
