Roy Chua,5,"Was warmly greeted by the staff when entering the restaurant. Pleasantly surprised by the complimentary welcome drink which was brilliant.

Food order was taken quickly and staff was very polite. Food serves quickly and every dish looks amazing with great taste. Staff even served us complimentary water halfway through the meal.

Overall my family had a great pleasant lunch at Chef's Playground. Thanks for the good service and nice food.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113384682403219579483/reviews
Calista Koh,5,"Loved their pesto chicken on my first visit. Pesto sauce is made in-house; and taste really fresh and nice!

Today is my second visit, pesto chicken didn‚Äôt taste as good (not sure why, could be due to different batches of basil); and tried their mentai scallop pasta. Am amazed with the balance taste of the pasta, and didn‚Äôt get sick and tried when completing the plate of pasta. We finished off with a salted caramel coffee cake, and are surprised with the quality for the price it is at.

In all, would recommend others to here.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107455560008322976225/reviews
