It really surprised me with the amount of duck meat and the flavor was really good.\n\nThe signboard and menu still showing the old pricing. Now everything has increased at least 50¬¢ each. Mine duck noodles was now $4 increased from $3.50.\n\nBut $4 is still a reasonable charged with their quite a large amount of duck meats, I will said is worthy. Will definitely come back again. üòã",

The $4 set of kway chap comes with a big bowl of kway and a plate of pig organs including half an egg, tau kwa and tau pok. This stall has been here for a long time (more than 10 years?) and they have kept their prices despite the recent inflation. Definitely worth to support them when around the area.",
