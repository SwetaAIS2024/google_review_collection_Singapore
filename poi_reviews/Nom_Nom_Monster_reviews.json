Spaghetti with chicken was good too. Comes with full chicken thigh again. Spaghetti was creamy. Much better value and quality than you get from Astons in the same building.",

Fish & Chips is crispy on the outside, juicy and tender inside. Foods are well presented on plates. Highly affordable. Waiting time is reasonable. Will be back to try more food. The only downside is the food court is stuffy and hot.",

I have ordered grilled chicken & Dory Monster Combo, and classic chicken cutlet at $9.9 each.\n\nThe size is very generously large given their prices. I really enjoyed the meal. Will visit it again.",
