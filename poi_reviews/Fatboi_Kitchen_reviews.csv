Darrchana,4,"Took dinner at Fat boi restaurant with friends, the spaghetti grilled chicken taste good but the portion was very less couldn‚Äôt satisfy my appetite which was disappointing.
Atmosphere was great, felt more like bar type restaurant.
Service would be 4 star had to wait a long time for the meal to arrive.
Moreover the price is definitely not worth for the portion we paid.
In my opinion, the restaurant was too overrated and maybe just a one time experience for me.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117097094688552338560/reviews
sunnyboy31,5,"Small establishment with only 2-3 workers but luckily crowd still manageable.
Waited 10-15mins for the appetizers.
Ordered pork chop and porchetta, both also tasty and delicious.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109006918138390927712/reviews
Anushka Perera,5,"Had an amazing time at Fat Boi Shop! Their burgers are seriously next level ‚Äì juicy, flavorful, and cooked just right. You can tell they put effort into quality ingredients and it really shows in every bite.

The place has a fun, laid-back vibe that makes it perfect for a casual meal with friends. Service was friendly and quick too, which made the whole experience even better.

If you're craving a great burger, this spot should be at the top of your list. Can‚Äôt wait to go back! üçîüî•",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106389320156360385323/reviews

Tran Minh Quang,5,"Had a great experience here! The Chef/Waiter was so kind and servant hearted!

The Restaurant was noisy as there was drilling but he was still very patient and met our each and everyone of our needs!

And the Food matches the Service too! Amazing! The waiting time is reasonable as it was made to order. The wings took longer than usual but when I tasted it I was short of words and it was AMAZING...!

All in love this place and definitely deserves more recognition.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101390811140267490147/reviews
