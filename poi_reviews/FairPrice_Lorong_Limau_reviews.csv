Tiffany Boogaloo,3,"Place is open for 24 hours so it‚Äôs good for you to get your groceries at any time. Fresh produce is a little lacking at times especially night time (probably cause stocks have not come in yet) and fruits don‚Äôt look that fresh. There are dead flies in the refrigerated areas so do look out for those.

There is a slight stale smell around the whole shop, probably from old produce/foodstuffs.

Other than that they are well stocked and do provide fast service when it is crowded",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103546682351624755795/reviews
