As a beginner, I feel deep mental relaxation and can feel a positive shift in myself. Kavitha Ji's teaching has been instrumental and she inspired me to be consistent with my practice. I am glad that I invested my time joining this course for my personal growth. Thanks Kavitha Ji!!  Jai Gurudev!!",

So many golden nuggets of wisdom. The exercises that we do during and after the day of the course really enhance the experience in the most positive ways.\nThe breathing techniques had me sleeping like a baby every night.\nI highly recommend this course for anyone who wants to be happy and looking for a better quality of life",

It is worth it both in case you are freshener and in case you are repeating the courses.\nI did the advanced meditation course with Kavithra. she taught me the technical skills to continue meditation on my own at home. Very happy with the entire experience !",

I learnt to relax every part of body, to live/breathe at present to clean the minds with meditation. Instead of looking for love externally, search it internally: You are the joy, peace and love. Yoga is a charger of life.",

The program taught us unique breathing techniques to reduce our stress, increase our energy level. Kavitha, the teacher has shared with us many life theories on how we could manage our interactions and connection with people better, how to be more positive thinking. I hope with consistent practice, I could be a better and calmer person and can spread to people around me.",
