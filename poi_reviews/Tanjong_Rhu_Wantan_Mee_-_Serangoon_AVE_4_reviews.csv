Jonathan Lim,1,"Food is decent although service is slow which made it hard to move this to 4 stars. Operationally they are not the most efficient but the wantons, both the soup and fried ones, are pretty good. This is a chain store but quality seems to vary across the outlets. The one at this coffee shop is not too bad.

UPDATE 12 Feb 2022: They changed the recipe for the worse, the char siew is now not authentic and uses colouring, the wontons are much more starchy with less meat, the noodles are not springy and just dense. They are clearly cutting costs, but all items have increased in price across the board. It is no wonder that the long queues of the past are no longer here. I would not eat this again. Stay away.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114473725027611542564/reviews
MSAI guangway,5,"Went here 4.30pm 2 Dec 23. Noodle extraordinary springy, char siew has no black burnt part, no fats but wanton noodle is supposingly a healthy dish. Wanton lack fillings and it’s mostly flour, but the noodle is only 4.00

But for sure the springy noodle is the killer and made everything worth. Existing review don’t do justice. Auntie is abit rude and emotionless tho.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109220847958584369541/reviews
Lee EL,4,"We normally go off peak around 3pm so no Q.  When I last asked in May 2022, they open everyday.

The Vietnamese girl does a good job of the preparation. Not dunked in unnecessary sauces - you can choose the black or white version. Both of us like the dry preparation which is a good portion for a normal meal $3.80. Dislike tomato sauce so we always ask her to leave that out.

The wanton is nice and the noodles are springy, without any strong after taste. Generous with the green chili. Server’s temperament is pleasant enough.

The char Siew is ok - nothing to rave about. There is the Kim Heng char Siew stall at the other end of the same coffee shop if you need better char Siew. We usually top up our char siew $12 from that other shop.

Just take note that those char siew people there have their grumpy moods. But the Vietnamese at the wanton shop is pleasant enough. No attitude.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102744870402735321344/reviews
Harry Tanujaya,5,"Easily one of the best wanton noodles out there. Price is good for a generous amount per serving. I do agree the waiting time is a tat longer than usual, perhaps, they really put in effort to serve the best bowl everytime. Definitely must try!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106987765672023327539/reviews
Hazel Menon,2,I had to go back to the store to insist that they add more sauce as the food was tasteless. The servers were not polite!,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106801102673833705582/reviews
