When we first sat down in the non-smoking area, one of the stall attendants even sat down beside us with a lit cigarette. Fortunately, he was decent enough to move away when I requested him not to smoke there. The place indeed looks clean otherwise. Food wise, we had the economical rice and it was very normal. I’m sure the other stalls might have more interesting offerings.",
