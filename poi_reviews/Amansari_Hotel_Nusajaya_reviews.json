      "text": "‚ÄúBedbugs and Dirty Carpet‚Äù\n\nApart from the issue with bedbugs and the dirty carpet, everything else was satisfactory. Unfortunately, I found at least four bedbugs crawling on my pillow. I had to steam iron my bed before I could sleep. Since I checked in at 11 PM and only discovered the bedbugs at 2 AM, I didn't ask for a room change. Packing and unpacking again seemed too cumbersome, so I opted to steam iron my bed and pillow instead. I ended up killing a lot of bedbugs on the headboard. Moreover, my pillow smelled like it hadn't been washed in a year, making it impossible to sleep and I had only one pillow. The carpet also needs replacing, as it felt overly dense and uncomfortable. The infested room number is 1016. Please address these issues because the Hotel has strategic location, affordable, spacious with tons of rooms making it suitable to accommodate large groups. It would be a shame to let the hotel perished.",
