Yvonne Tan,4,"Food that I like: croissant or bread (choice of tuna or egg mayo, comes with vegetables such as lettuce, cucumber and tomato), cookies (the one with cranberries in it is very nice and addictive), chicken mushroom pie (I love this when it’s warm and a bit crispy - otherwise I’ll heat up briefly in a toaster)

The cafe is run by persons in recovery, do be patient with the staff and the wait if you intend to support them :)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116951738481823875805/reviews
