gino wong,5,"Very homely food. Not easy to find decent made mee rebus and mee soto so far had this two dish on seperate occasions.

What made me come back the 2nd time it's that the food quality as I didn't get to have my mee soto first time so I order mee rebus usually I don't order that as it quite hard to have good quality one. Anyway I did and I didn't regret. Had the taste of my primary school which was nostalgic.

And it's the human touch of kaka. Really made it very worthy to promote. It's a family run business. Please support the good people :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106384003697222374000/reviews
