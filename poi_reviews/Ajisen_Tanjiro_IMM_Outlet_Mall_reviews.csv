Michael,1,"Real disappointment in the quality of the food.

Ordered the seafood ramen set with fried chicken as the side dish.

The squid in the bowl of noodles were so soft that you can easily break it apart using chop sticks! See pictures taken. Never have I had squid of this nature. Looks, feels, and tastes fake.

The fried chicken was soft and slimy. Some parts are okay, but some parts are feels weird eating it. See picture taken. Simple fried chicken, yet it doesn’t taste and feel right.

Used to patronise Ajisen here in IMM before the renovation. But now, it is far from decent food expectations.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115908361280059341890/reviews
Xavier Ng,2,"On a busy Friday night, we chanced upon this restaurant that was fairly empty and decided to give it a shot

Service was rather slow and the website crashed while we were trying to place an order, appreciate the staff for finally helping to place the order manually

Food took about 25 mins to arrive which was borderline too long for us…but it’s okay maybe Friday night things

We ordered 5 pcs of regular gyoza, 5 pcs of crispy gyoza, pork chop maze soba, chicken cutlet maze soba

Gyoza was pretty good and fit the price, but we were really disappointed with the maze soba that were clumped together, with small portion sizes. Pork chop was overcooked, resulting in a very tough texture. Chicken was nothing to shout about but honestly we were pretty sad about the meal

Table beside us was getting grumpy about the food coming out slow as they waited for about 30 minutes

Unlikely to return :(",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107816105323448148983/reviews
Sandra Salazar,3,"Ordered the Pork Chop Mazesoba and disappointed, they didn't use Udon noodles, no vinegar and salty.  Fish cake was okay, lychee drink is small but nice taste. Gave the orders at 12:49pm and served at 1:05. Internet connection in this area is weak.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113403577415569028587/reviews

Doraemon,4,"During my visit to Ajisen Ramen at IMM Outlet Mall, I found the overall experience to be satisfactory. While the service was acceptable, there is room for improvement as it did not stand out. Despite varying reviews, I personally found the ramen I ordered to be tasty and satisfying. The price point for the weekday set lunch, coupled with the available promo, was reasonable. The ambience of the restaurant was okay.

Although Ajisen Ramen may not offer the best ramen I have ever tasted, taking into account the price point, service, and ambience, I believe it deserves a 4-star rating. The combination of tasty dishes, reasonable pricing, and acceptable service makes it a commendable choice for a casual dining experience.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112665277904119154671/reviews
