Patricia Lin,5,"Cozy cafe run by young adults. Owners are very creative and the food is prepared by the owners in their kitchen. To name a few we had, the soufflÃ© is amazingly bouncy, soft and delicious, including the sushi bake which is tastefully prepared.

kyle campbell,5,"If you're a tourist like me, don't be put off by the fact that this is a little bit out of the way. The souffle pancakes were absolutely incredible and the espresso soda is exactly what I needed to get through the Singapore heat. Definitely recommend especially if you're heading over this way to check out Haw Pa Villa or other attractions over this way.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114015500738302067602/reviews

Li Sheng Tan,5,"A cozy cafe with awesome drinks and friendly owners. The matcha latte is some of the best in Singapore - concentrated premium matcha flavour (not the typical diluted milky kind). The coffee was good too, strong and smooth. We enjoyed the mochi waffle as well ðŸ˜‹",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103080916091331724742/reviews
