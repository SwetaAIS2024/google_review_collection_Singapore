Benjamin Sim,4,"This should place comfortably in the top 10 Nasi Lemaks in SG. Portions are filling, proteins, especially the Rendang Chicken are done right. No basmati rice here, but the jasmine rice has good separation and mild coconut creaminess. Sambal is sweet and not too fiery. Sous vide rendang is fork-tender. No telor dada here or sunny-side egg tho. They give a jammy ramen egg which is a little out of Character. Located on the 3rd floor of Bugis cube. Seats are ample- not too crowded on a Saturday lunchtime. $15/pax.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103987333962497841910/reviews
Hansen Ku,5,"Food was great, i ordered the wholesome nasi lemak. For me personally, it is not to my liking. There are so much going on in this food; my taste bud confuses between the gulai, curry, spices, and all. Not saying its bad, just not to my liking. Perhaps next time i will order the regular Nasi Lemak, which i saw everyone was ordering it for their tables. See you next time!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102832563818225452167/reviews
Aqidah Ho,4,"The rice is fluffy and fragrant. The chicken doesn’t taste oily and I love the onsen egg. It’s pricey for nasi lemak ($10.80) but it’s worth it for an occasional treat. Ps- don’t request for less rice, you’ll regret it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108049809458406004499/reviews
Jimmy Boey,5,"Running out of food options in Bugis recently and a friend recommended Husk’s Nasi Lemak. We ordered the slow-cook mutton and was super flavourful. Also, the rice portion is small, so opt for full amount to enjoy it with the side dishes! This is probably one of the best nasi lemak in the East!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106422115320754938753/reviews
Ars 3276,4,"Chicken was so soft and tender. Very nice. Pairs with the curry kind of sauce, sedap la.
Abit pricey thou but chicken size was big as well. Chilli nicely done and we asked for 2nd serving which was given with a great smile.

Great chicken to compensate for the sad meal i had yesterday (at another chicken shop as reviewed)

Seems to be very crowded always.
Service was top notch from the team as well.

Will be back to try other dishes as i think their spices are nicely done",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114029124935079806014/reviews
