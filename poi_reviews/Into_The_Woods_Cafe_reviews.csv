Clement Cher,4,"Googled and found the following recommendation and decided to go ahead to try. Located in a quiet part of the neighbourhood, Reached there just after 2pm and there were no crowds and sitting was not a problem.  We could choose our own sitting.

Cafe was quiet and tables were either studying or having group chats. place is very instragamable. It become more crowded after 3 plus.

Minimum staff interaction which was ordering at counter and being served the food only.

Ordered honey glazed wings, Hawaiian pizza and smoked salmon waffles. Drinks called are latte and hot chocolate. Food was prepared very quickly. Food tasted great and for the portion ordered is just nice. Latte could have done with more milk in my view.

I didn't experience any bad food or service and will revisit again. A last feedback is perhaps to look to change the cushions as some are very stained. Recommended.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113278228004850197170/reviews

Dom Yeo,5,"A wonderful hidden gem in a quiet neighbourhood. The food was delicious, ingredients were fresh and high quality. Lots of options to choose from too. The apple pie was legit! Stacked layer upon layer with apple, and the pie skin was soft. Best apple pie Iâ€™ve found so far.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107888016986820582629/reviews
Lauren P.Y.,3,"Inconsistent service quality. 5 days ago, all is nice and good. Service timely and good is delicious.

Today came again. Place not thatn crowed. Waited 50mins to serve 3 dishes and missing out on the 4th dish. Has to remind many times. In the end, we have to leave without the 4th order.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103627435343462361847/reviews
