Our highly recommended favourites were Har Gow, Salted Egg Buns, Century Egg Porridge and Fried Mango Prawn Rolls.\n\nHowever, some of the items were pricey such as a small portion of Chinese Lettuce in Soya Sauce at RM12.00++ and 2 pieces of assorted Yong Tau Foo at RM6.30++. Furthermore, the Prawn Chee Cheong Fun Rolls were quite bland too.\n\nWe were surprised to see the dim sum being served in trays instead of being pushed around in a trolley.",

She was super attentive and very friendly. ) We happened to walk by and saw the bustling customers inside and decided to give it a try. And now we found a new fav dim sum place at Eco Botantic! Dim sum is served like trolley style, but on trays.\nDefinitely will go back!",
