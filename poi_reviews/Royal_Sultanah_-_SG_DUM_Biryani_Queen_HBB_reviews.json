Somehow feel that the marinate is only on the surface and not infused into the meat.\n\nOverall good for a dish made by home cooks.",

      "text": "Having eaten a lot of gravy based Biryani's at Singapore, I was craving the real authentic dum type biryani with masalas that tingles my taste buds.\nFor the price it is a hidden gem in Singapore. I can hands down say it is the best Biryani in Singapore.\nWe liked it so much that we ended up ordering in bulk for the weekend. It took me back to my childhood days in Mumbai when we would have this delicious home made biryani that would punch you in the face with the perfect blend of spices.\nThis muslim owned biryani food delivery is something that is authentic and different.\nWe ended the meal with their perfectly balanced kulfi which is often described as \"traditional Indian ice cream.\"  It was a really nice afternoon meal filled with happiness and a taste to remember that might probably be the best Biryani in Singapore.",
