JiXiang FuGui,1,"Super Expensive 1 Mug Plain Hot Water Charged $0.70 The Most Expensive Place In Yishun 846 Coffee Shop, I thought Singapore Government request we eat healthy less oil, less salt and drink healthy less sweet, than how can let this 846 Coffee Shop charged we 1 Mug of Plan Hot Water $0.70...???
Singapore Government should give those Coffee Shop Price List For Charging 1 Mug of Plain Hot Water at affordable Price, Please Don't Let Those Coffee Shop Anyhow Charging We All..
Normally I order 1 Mug of Plain Hot Water Cost $0.50 already quite Expensive But this Coffee Shop Charged 1 Mug of Plain Hot Water $0.70 Really Really Too Much...
Singapore Government please doing something about this ... Thank you",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115034616460253753499/reviews
OM Padme,3,"The economical rice is good. They have been there for a long time. Try their morning breakfast ready fried noodles esp the fried yellow n white noodles. Plenty of eggs n vege. U add curry chicken all in for $2.60 only.

The noodles stall sell a a bigger version of kway teow which is diff from other stalls
There is a nice reasonably priced chinese rojak stall.

For coffee i go for the coffee shop directly across.

Update: No longer at this location.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116995159557076591645/reviews
A Google user,1,"The newly opened tang gui duck stall, lousy quality and service. Their price is expensive too, $4 for roasted pork. Asked for lean meat but didnt get much lean and served unhappily when asked. Will be my first and last time patronise the stall. Coffee shop beside Junction 9 served much better tang gui duck.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112119371828308460989/reviews
D C,5,"My experience:
- Mixed vegetable rice is pretty good (nice variety of dishes, and delicious) and affordable. They occasionally even experiment with new dishes!
- Fishball noodles has good soup (used to be a bit too salty, but they have improved ever since) and nice flavour for its dry version, and is generous with their amount of noodles given:
- Fried Kway Teow and Fried Prawn Noodles are tasty, especially when the person preparing it is the guy. Sometimes a lady prepares that and certain customers (including myself) tend to not like it, since she makes the fried prawn noodles a little too soupy, whereas the guy is able to stir fry it to a more dry and roasted extent.
- Porridge is decent but slightly overpriced for what it offers.
- The staff selling and serving drinks are always prompt and attentive.
- The staff clearing tables are also attentive and efficient, which makes it a super clean and inviting environment to dine in.
- The location of this coffeeshop makes it ideal for people watching since there's lots of traffic passing by all day and night.

This is actually one of my top favourite coffeeshops in the area.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117158264009566524264/reviews
