Hrmgr,4,"First visit to this coffee shop and happy to find a Kway Chap stall. It is not expensive at $4.70 a set. What I like was it did not had the smell or taste of pig's internal organs in the braised sauce and kway.
The set has lots of pork belly, tau pok, egg, fish cake. What I missed would be the internal organs like stomach and intestines. Otherwise it would deserve another star.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews

YY Ong,5,"Coffeeshop assistants over here are by far the most efficient and hardworking I have ever seen! Within a minute of sitting down, you can be assured that one of them will come over to take your drinks order. On top of that they are constantly clearing and wiping the tables.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115210183137268211575/reviews
Michael Yuen,1,"Decent food and drink but consistently worst patrons of a coffee shop I've ever experienced.

Doesn't help that they allow a beggar uncle to walk around the whole area playing his erhu, asking for money, blocking the way and being a general nuisance. It's the worst coffee shop I've had the dispeasure of going so far.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110779529509263037442/reviews
