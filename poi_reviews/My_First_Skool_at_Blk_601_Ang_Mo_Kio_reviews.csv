Zelsius Teo,5,"We couldn‚Äôt be happier with the school and staff here! The staff made us feel welcome and cared for. The teachers are warm, patient, and truly dedicated to helping the children learn and grow.

Our child loves going to school and has made so much progress‚Äîboth academically and socially. The activities are engaging and creative, and we appreciate how they focus on building confidence and independence.

The communication from the staff is excellent. We always feel informed about our child‚Äôs day and any upcoming events. Knowing that our child is in such a safe and nurturing environment gives us peace of mind every day.

We highly recommend to any family looking for a place where their child will thrive!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116506871840337964669/reviews
Eric Tan,5,"My boy loved this center very much. The teachers, the principal were really great. No regrets to switch over to this center. Sad thing is though he was here only for the past 6 months, I‚Äôm very sure it leaves him good memories over the bondings between the teachers n students.

Keep it up. Well doneüëçüèºüëçüèº",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102306892986161834357/reviews

Denash,5,"Being first time parents, we were naturally concerned about choosing the right playgroup centre. During our first centre tour, we were impressed by the teachers and the learning environment. We felt the teachers genuinely cared for each and every child.

Having enrolled in the centre for about 8months, our child has shown great improvements in his social skills and is more independent.

Thankful to all the amazing teachers! Special thanks to Principal Ms Weiwei, Teacher Yen, Teacher Krisha, Teacher Liu, Teacher Yi-Ting üéâü•≥",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111548015364237412183/reviews
