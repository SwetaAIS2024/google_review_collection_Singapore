Koh Gary,5,"Guinness on tap was awesome, fresh and tasty.
Keropok was nice and reasonably tasty
Would recommend the Fish n Chips, fish was fresh and succulent, would be even better if the batter was a little less oily.
The Chicken Roulade was a disappointment thou, the sides were good but the chicken itself was rubbery and we didn't finish it as it became a chore chewing it, maybe it was just a bad piece hopefully. üôèüèæ",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105560260708224180224/reviews
Aerosmith 09,3,"Great selection of craft beers.

I came on a Friday evening with a friend. We had a plate of fries and a shepherd's pie, along with 2 ciders and 2 pints of beers.

Firstly, I wish there were half pint options available. The menu only has full pints shown.

Secondly, we ordered fries to share and then decided to get the shepherd's pie later on. As you can see, the shepherd's pie also came with fries. In the menu it is indicated that she shepherd's pie comes with mash potato (it does). I wish the staff had informed us that there is another portion of fries coming or that they might've given us the option to swap out the fries that came with the shepherd's pie. I would've been very impressed if this was the level of service.

We found that for $19.90 the portion of shepherd's pie is extremely small. Not because we were sharing, it was just a very tiny serving. Taste was great, just don't feel that it is worth the $19.90++ price.

I'd come back for the beers. Service is decent. Not so sure if food is worth it.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115116173651150473045/reviews
Irene Lim,4,"Was drawn here by the good reviews. As expected, good reviews were more for the drinks and beers üç∫.
Service was ok, friendly and quite fast, even though there was only one server.
Prawn paste chicken cutlet was quite good. Really ‚Äúsmelly‚Äù if you know what I mean for prawn paste. Well seasoned. Noodles texture is good.
Chicken roulade was quite good too. Chicken was also well seasoned. Mashed potatoes has some lumps, which I didn‚Äôt like.
Coffee is horrible. Do not order. Looking at the picture, both are cafe latte but look different but taste equally bad.
Overall, food is good.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105804445185126817371/reviews
lontongstroong,4,"Great craft beer place in the West. Wide selection of tasty beers - from IPA, lager, stout, and fruit beers, both canned and on tap. Tried several select beers - the hazy IPA (forgot the name) was crisp, refreshing, ""hoppy"", with good deal of citrus notes. ""Cheat Day"" stout was bold and strong (8.5% ABV) yet uniquely sweet, malty, and buttery (with some spice notes like cinnamon). It's like drinking a very tasty liquid cookies lol.

The meals are also served fresh, albeit rather overpriced given the location. The pasta was cooked al dente with sufficient (but not overwhelming) garnishes and chicken chop was freshly made and come with large portion for a dinner and nice mushroom sauce.

The semi-outdoor patio is also much appreciated - not that big but still nice and airy enough to enjoy the pint with peace.

If there's any room for improvement (aside from the price) - perhaps the management should consider serving more sizes of beer, including smaller pint aside from the tall pint currently used. A beer taster set (like picking 4-5 different beers in small glasses) could also be considered for those who can't decide which beer to be ordered or are beer enthusiasts.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews
Eugene Wang,4,"Cool bar in the HDB blocks. Lots of new and innovative craft beers on tap. Tried the Bali Salt Bae. Truly unique and delicious. Would definitely come here again. Prices are average for happy hour.

They have complementary prawn crackers which was nice.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114747557607427381629/reviews
