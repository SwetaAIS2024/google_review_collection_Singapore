Curry comes in a bowl, with copious pieces of chicken wings, potatoes and tofu. Chicken falls off the bone, potatoes is perfect, and tofu is great vehicle for the curry sauce. Rice was ok, nothing special. But as a meal , pretty yummy! Air conditioned environment is a plus!",

Then the second batch of eggs were overcooked so I got to wait 30min for the 3rd batch of eggs while my toast and tea had gone cold. In the process, I think they wasted more than 15 eggs in the 2 cooking batches. Please get your SOP right and train your staff better.",
