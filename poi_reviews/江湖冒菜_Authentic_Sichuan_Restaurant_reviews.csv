Gibson NG,4,"Tried a variety of dishes at this Chinese restaurant, including their BBQ skewers, Hot Pepper Bullfrog, Stir-Fried Shredded Potatoes, and Stir-Fried Bitter Gourd with Salted Egg. For the skewers, we went for beef, pork, chicken, and buns—each one flavorful and well-prepared. All the dishes were enjoyable, except for the bullfrog, which wasn’t as fresh as expected and was overly spicy for my liking. The menu offers a great variety, making it a good spot for those seeking diverse Chinese cuisine.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106524133269249506401/reviews
MNG,2,"A comfortable setting for families. QR code ordering system and help yourself to the soft drinks and beers at the fridge. Many mainland Chinese selection and prices of beers are attractive.

Twice cooked pork was dry and tough. It was half eaten. Don't waste calories on this.

Mouth water chicken was probably pre-cut and left in fridge. It was cold and hard. The seasoning was average at best.

Grilled fish with peppers was of average quality and taste. For half a fish of this price, it is noticeably expensive compared to the big brands / chains. The fish was way overcooked and tough in texture. Not something I will come back for.

BBQ squid was pathetically tiny for its price. It was on the overcooked side, save by its seasoning.

Pork and chive dumplings were better amongst the dishes.

Eggplant with garlic was the standout amongst all. Then again, difficult to mess out this dish.

A comfortable setting but let down by its quality of dishes. Service is prompt.

Unfortunately we were super thirsty after the meal throughout the night.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews
Elaina Poh,4,"I had a wonderful experience at this establishment. The ambiance is not only clean but also spacious, providing a comfortable environment. The staff is exceptionally friendly, making the overall atmosphere warm and inviting.

What makes this place even more unique is its affiliation with the restaurant next door. As a sister company, it offers a diverse culinary experience. I particularly enjoyed exploring the distinct flavors—Sichuan cuisine in one restaurant and Dong Bei cuisine in the other. It's a fantastic concept that caters to different taste preferences, and I appreciate the effort in bringing variety to the dining options.

Overall, I highly recommend this establishment for its cleanliness, spacious setting, and the delightful staff. The dual focus on Sichuan and Dong Bei cuisines adds an exciting dimension to the dining experience. Looking forward to returning soon!

Orange,3,"Generally okay. Price for 6 adult is ~$150.
Best dish is fried egg with tomato. Perfectly executed.
Their chuan chuan also pretty reasonable priced and meat has no 骚味。
Beer also cheap! $5 for the big bottles.

Always long Queue. Space in restaurant is pretty small. Largest group is 6 pax.

Good for supper.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
