Selina Lee,5,"Great steamboat and BBQ 2in1 buffet. All the meats are marinated very well and they are so tasty after BBQ. If you‚Äôre looking for a fantastic steamboat and BBQ experience, this restaurant is a must try. The variety of fresh ingredients, including premium meats, fresh seafood, and crisp vegetables, ensures that every bite is flavorful. The broths are rich and aromatic, with multiple options to suit different taste preferences.Downstairs there is a VIP room with KTV accessories. This is very amazing and very fit for family or friends gathering. Great eating experience here. We will visit again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103394046212719262685/reviews
Swee Teng Low,5,"Most exp price is $29.90++ per pax, which is reasonable. You get free flow condiments and sauces (even have bbq powder and chilli powder), free flow items in the menu (less ala carte and drinks). Get free flow drinks at $1++, and soup base at $8++ (regardless whether is it 1, 2 or 4 soups).

Chicken soup, tomato soup and mala soup all very nice. Tried mushroom soup, which was a bit bland, but maybe because it's more for vegetarian? I'm not sure.

Meat wise, we only ate chicken and pork, pork tasted better for bbq than chicken.

Free flow drink top up of $1++ only allows you to take from machine - coffee (2/5), milk tea, orange juice (3.5/5).

The waitresses actively clears your empty plates, service is not too bad. I asked many questions because this was my first time there, and they were very patient to answer me.

There was indoor area with aircon, most importantly is that the bbq plate and soup pot is side by side. The bbq plate worked a bit slower, just bbq longer lor. Outdoor area the bbq and soup is like mookata, not very good I feel. Oh yes, there's no time limit, and the staff doesn't really chase you. We were there for 2ish hours haha. Can use credit card to make payment after meal.

Will go back again üëç",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104006423189756098729/reviews

Gabriel Aloysius,3,"I stumbled upon this place through another food review and decided to give it a shot. Tucked away in a quiet corner of Jalan Kayu, the restaurant greets you with a row of red lanterns outside, giving it a cosy, traditional vibe. Inside, it‚Äôs a small and intimate space ‚Äî nothing fancy, but comfortable enough for a casual meal.

We made a reservation via Eatigo for a discounted price of $21++ per adult. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the lady boss. We informed her about our reservation and the 10% discount. However, she didn‚Äôt seem too pleased and mentioned we were 9 minutes late, so she was quick to deny the discount. Thankfully, the male boss stepped in, and after checking, he gave the nod to honour it. That interaction left me a little taken aback ‚Äî not the warmest welcome, especially over a minor delay.

We proceeded to order via their in-house app. Shortly after, we were told that the soup base ($8) and free-flow drinks ($1/pax) were charged separately ‚Äî something not clearly stated upfront for what was advertised as an ""all-you-can-eat buffet.""

As for the food, it was decent. The dishes were served promptly. Some of the marinated meats were flavourful, while others leaned a bit heavy on the seasoning ‚Äî slightly salty but still alright after being cooked. The skewers were a highlight, and the seafood was fresh enough.

Drinks-wise, there were only two options: sour plum and ‚Äúmilk tea.‚Äù The milk tea tasted more like powdered creamer rather than actual tea ‚Äî definitely underwhelming.

They do offer free-flow ice cream outside the restaurant (chocolate, strawberry, and a berry flavour), which was a nice touch for the kids.

At the end, we were told the actual price was $23 instead of the $21 listed on Eatigo ‚Äî though they still honoured the 10% discount.

Final bill: $100.40 (incl. GST)

2 Adults: $53.75

1 Kid: $18.75

Soup base: $8

Free-flow drinks: $3

Overall Verdict: 3/5
The experience was okay ‚Äî not terrible, but not outstanding either. For the price point, I‚Äôd personally prefer to spend a bit more at HDL or Paradise Hotpot for better quality food and service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107644531805077113457/reviews
