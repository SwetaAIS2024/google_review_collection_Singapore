      "text": "Got it! Here's a revised review incorporating those details:\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nChee's Cafe Corner is a fantastic takeaway home-based business that has become my go-to spot for coffee and bubble tea. The variety they offer is impressive for a Home-based business, with options that cater to all ages in the family. Whether you're in the mood for a classic coffee or craving a refreshing bubble tea, they have it all.\n\nThe prices are very affordable, making it easy to treat yourself without breaking the bank. The quality of the beverages is excellent, and you can tell they use top-notch ingredients. I particularly love their iced americano and match latte, which is always perfectly made and delicious.\n\nThe convenience of a home-based takeaway/delivery service within the district is perfect for the neighborhood, and the friendly service makes the experience even better. Chee's Cafe Corner is a true gem in the neighborhood. Highly recommend giving them a try!\n\nPS very cute design of their logo on the cup and the kids are learning how to do deliveries in their neighborhood!",

      "text": "My wife super love the ice lemonade. Till we forgot to take the photo!! Super refreshing for recent hot humid weather.\n\nHad also ordered cafe latte and hazelnut latte (packeted, super convenient to drink it the next day). IMO, why ordered from Starbucks when Chee‚Äôs coffee is better/cheaper. Most importantly easy to order if you‚Äôre staying near this cafe. Will definitely ordered again!\n\nThe Boss is friendly and talkative too.",
