Suhail Ahmed,5,"Yunan Garden and Nanyang Lake at NTU are serene retreats featuring lush greenery and charming pathways, ideal for relaxation and picnics. Yunan Garden showcases a vibrant array of plants and well-maintained paths, while Nanyang Lake offers scenic walking trails and picturesque views, particularly during sunset when swans glide across the water. Both locations are equipped with benches for unwinding and encourage outdoor activities like jogging and cycling. Their proximity to university events creates a lively atmosphere, making them hidden gems that perfectly blend tranquility and natural beauty for students and visitors alike.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106299231867709696747/reviews

Min HL,5,"Located in front of the Chinese Heritage Centre.

This is a very clean and well maintained garden that is bigger than 12 soccer fields. Kudos to the gardeners for maintaining the greenery well.

You are able to find a 5.6m tall man made waterfall here that flows into the Nanyang Lake - where you can find turtles in it!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103965869018673563240/reviews
