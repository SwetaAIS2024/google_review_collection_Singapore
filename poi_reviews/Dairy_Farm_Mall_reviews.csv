Koh Gary,5,"Nice quiet place to do some groceries and have some food and coffee without too much crowd.

Jeremy Ong,1,"First time drove in here, a pretty chilling place, however, the parking price here shocked the hell out of me, $3 for less than 30min here, how can it be priced so much higher than Hillion/Bukit Panjang Plaza area. Shall be my last time here.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102795650412750728627/reviews
Marco Reichel,2,"Parking is ridiculous expensive for the place. We were locked in the car park because the fire alarm went off and they couldn’t open the shutter gate. Yet they made us pay for the whole time we needed to wait which was almost 2 hours.
Shops there look good but design of the walkway also a bit off with many stairs and not wheelchair or stroller friendly especially when it rains.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112060884815758920830/reviews

Y X,1,Parking really too expensive given the limited shops operating which means most won’t stay too long here. Yet we’re being overcharged for parking fees. Pls lower rates if you wish to have returning customers.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112126136388763503686/reviews
