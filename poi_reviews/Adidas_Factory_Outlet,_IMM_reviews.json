      "text": "The visit encountered by my friends today (20/4/2025) doesn’t deserve even one star at all! Very poor service encountered with a prestigious international acclaimed brand! Big discounts can be found here , that explains why there is also a discount in their service attitude! I don’t mean to be nasty and post this but I am stating the facts here. Below is a feedback I gave to them :\n\nDear Team,\n\nI’m here to offer a service feedback. My friends had went over to your outlet at IMM today afternoon  20/4/2025\n\nUpon making payment, The service attitude of your 2 staff is totally unacceptable. Your staff did not ask if my friends are member or not. And the tone of voice of your staff used was unacceptable as it is very loud.\n\nIs it that my friends are from China and your staff thinks that they don’t understand English and overlooked on the asking of the procession of your esteemed membership?\n\nOr is the service standard at IMM outlet store  is of such as your selling price there is lower than other outlets?\n\nThis service attitude is truly unacceptable for such a prestigious international acclaimed brand of yours ! And this incident had already caused the mood of my friends for the day.\n\nI would appreciate if you could have a reply to me of the course of actions you are going to undertake on this unpleasant shopping experience at your IMM outlet.",

      "text": "I commend Ms.Kiwi for her assistance last July 2, 2024 when I shopped for a couple of shoes. She even went by foot to their warehouse just to get the size I need for one of the pairs that I bought. She is not pushy in selling, but at the same time, you will feel at ease knowing that she's a few arms' length away if you need anything. I bought a total of 5 shoes for a very discounted price. I was very happy with my purchase. Thank you!",

      "text": "Got an adidas running tee @ regular price from the outlet. Upon payment, I checked with the counter staff if app voucher can use . Her reply is no voucher can be use and no exchange or refund can be made once paid in this outlet. Therefore I ask her to check if the tee is available in app or other store, she did a check and say is only available at this outlet. Once I got home , run through the app again, found the same tee in the app and voucher of 30% can be use…..",
