Rachel Tan,5,"Deeply thankful to the principal Isabelle and the teachers who has been guiding and taking care of my 2 kids - P6 and P2. I had a switch of sc for my elder when the prior sc couldn‚Äôt help in the basics - getting homework done and spelling learnt properly. Once my kid was switched to lion heart, she was guided patiently by the teachers and no more problems with getting homework done nor tackling spelling. The teachers also offered daily tuition (pre-teach some of the topics, does revision for exams) and In the chase of keeping up with our stressful academic standards, you realise that this takes a load of working parents as it is a very academic focus sc. Another biggest virtue that is consistently demonstrated throughout the 5 yrs my elder is with sc would be how genuinely caring and invested the teachers are with the kids, I believe the culture set by the dedicated principal that personally see through the running. Thanks ü¶Å ‚ù§Ô∏è, keep up the great work to take such good care of our kids.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113764369423593830379/reviews
