      "text": "Room was very cold, told the staff, can't do anything as it was centralised but I think everyone else dinning felt the same way so should have just adjusted either way. One group even went outside to sit instead.\n\nFood was bad and we waited so long for the food. We ordered around 7pm but only left close to 9pm, more than half the time spent waiting for food.\n\nNever had such bad zichar especially at their price point. Only the crab promo was worth it and at least edible. The rest not so much. We paid for a steamed red grouper for $80 before taxes but the fish was tough and not tender.\n\nOther than the two, we ordered tequila chicken, dragon chives, pork ribs, XO fried rice, drunken prawns, caipoh beancurd. Only the XO fried rice was good. Others was the worst I had comparing to other zichars.\n\nDuring payment, we were even charged additional fried rice which we didn't order. Was lucky I spotted it if not we would have been charged for it.\n\nWill never go back.",

A 250g set should feed 2 adults very well. The restaurant also had many seats available. Would recommend anyone in the area to try.\n\nFood takes quite awhile to cook, but honestly not a very big deal for us.",

Love the brinjal, mackerel fish and duck. The best was the pickled pumpkin passion fruit. I do not recommend the chendol. It‚Äôs so watered down with too much coconut milk and it was not cold. I will definitely come back to this restaurant.",
