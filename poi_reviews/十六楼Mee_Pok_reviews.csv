Sin Sin Chia,5,"I patronise this stall regularly for years, for their fishball or prawn mee. The noodles are flavourful, fishballs are bouncy and soup is clear and sweet. I enjoy eating there early in the morning, the coffeeshop and the area has a retro old feel to it and the famous Eng Kee chicken wing stall is located there too (open only from lunch onwards), together with a breakfast snack stall, a roasted meat stall and a drink stall. Patronised by a lot of regulars and the lady writes your order down, so don't worry, she won't forget your order. Do be prepared to wait a little at times but they have a buzzer system to call you when your food is ready and you are eating there. Highly recommend anytime. Absolutely love this stall.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111808189574629378010/reviews
