Sho Chen,5,"PROS: Service was good especially from Lily Auntie! Love her enthusiasm and passion.  Felt right at home. Ordered a variety of food we love the braised pork, peanuts and sliced fish the most!

CONS: I come on a saturday night, the menu was quite limited. The Usual Beancurd Skin, Barley and some drinks were out of stock.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115837628081105438194/reviews

Clement Cher,3,"Reached about 7 pm  and there is still places to sit.. Orders need to be placed at the counter.  Staff on hand will usher in diners and serve food or clear the table.  Those who served my table are friendly.

Ordered as in the photos and the dishes came quickly even as the place started to fill up with other diners. The soup which was the main item was disappointing as it only hinted a slight taste of bak kut teh at the start. Subsequent soup refills seem to bring more taste. Other items like the you tao, veg, bean curd skin and pig intestines  tasted great.

Generally ordered slightly more but based off the soup and rice it should be filling for a small eater.

I will consider the soup and rice decently priced but at this visit the soup is disappointing but the sides are the saving grace to balance out the meal. Perhaps this is the soup recipe but will need to return another time to try to confirm",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113278228004850197170/reviews
Tricia Y,2,"Don't be deceived to think that this is a good place for BKT, the pork ribs broth lacks depth, with no hint of garlic and a muted taste of white pepper. Also ordered a mixed stomach + tenderloin soup. I’m someone who usually enjoy eating stomach, but i could not finish this. Pig stomach had a bad taste. The tenderloin was decent.

Very much subpar compared to the many other brand names.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100488353604601035891/reviews
