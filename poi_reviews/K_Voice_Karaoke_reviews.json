I am a singer and i really like the sound quality, very smooth and easy song navigation via QR code. Literally wide range of song choices which we didnt find in most of the karaoke outlets we went to and whats really cool is that you can choose songs from YOUTUBE to sing along! This one is really very shiok one!  You will also be welcomed by the nicest couple owner Ms Yen and Towkay Steven who untiringly greets everybody with a big smile and  warm family-like  service. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",
