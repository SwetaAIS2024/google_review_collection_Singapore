Tk Sim,5,"Nice old-school mall with 1980s vibes - the entire mall is air conditioned inside. Roxy Square kopitiam has a variety of food outlets including the famous Katong laksa.

For antique and paper money & coin collectors, stop by Dong Hai Trading on level 1 - there is a display of various world paper money on the shop window and more selections inside.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104162819671900610659/reviews

Amresh Mishra,4,"Roxy Square is a decent shopping center with a good mix of stores and restaurants. The parking lot is spacious and easy to navigate, and there are plenty of entrances to the mall. The interior of the mall is clean and well-maintained, with ample seating areas for shoppers to rest. The stores themselves are varied, ranging from clothing and accessories to electronics and home goods. There are also several dining options, including fast food chains and sit-down restaurants. Overall, Roxy Square is a convenient and pleasant place to shop, but it doesn't necessarily stand out as a must-visit destination.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106760588086520120469/reviews
