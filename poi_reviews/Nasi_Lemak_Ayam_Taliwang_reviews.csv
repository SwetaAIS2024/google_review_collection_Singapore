Luqman Hakim,5,"Great Nasi Lemak with Excellent Service!

I had a superb meal at Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang in Changi Airport. The chicken was cooked to perfection—tender and flavorful—while the sambal had a well-balanced taste that complemented the dish beautifully. The portion size was just right for the price, making it a great value-for-money meal.

Beyond the food, the Changi branch stands out for its excellent staff and service. The team was friendly and efficient, ensuring a smooth and pleasant dining experience. The cozy environment made it a comfortable spot to enjoy a satisfying meal before a flight.

Highly recommended for anyone craving a delicious plate of nasi lemak with a unique twist!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106669934280414926705/reviews
Ryan Tan,2,"Saw the food setting in the picture and think the food must be not bad. Ordered meal number 3 to dine and it was put in a paper box when it was served. Fork and spoon were plastic type. The box was so small, and with plastic utensils, difficult to eat with the thigh meat. Totally disappointing. Other stalls were provided with metal fork and spoon. How come this stall don't have? They want to cut cost by providing plastic utensils and no need to pay for washing fee??? What kind of service is this. Never go back again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113480107826816722985/reviews
Yan Qi,5,"A Delicious Discovery at Changi Airport T3: Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang

I recently discovered Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang, a new outlet in Changi Airport Terminal 3's food court. This eatery specializes in chicken dishes, but also offers other options like Sambal Sotong and Beef Rendang.

Their signature Ayam Taliwang, Curry Chicken, Sambal Sotong, and Beef Rendang have become my go-to orders. Due to limited seating, I usually opt for takeaway, which is made convenient by their eco-friendly boxes that keep everything organized.

The staff's friendliness and efficiency impress me, as they manage high orders without long queues. Pricing is very reasonable, especially with my staff discount.

What draws me to Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang is the ease of enjoying a well-cooked, tender meal. Their Beef Rendang and Sambal Sotong are particularly flavorful.

It's no surprise that they've won Michelin awards at their Yishun outlet - the quality and taste are exceptional. I'm hooked!
