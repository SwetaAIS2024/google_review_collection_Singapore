Audrey lsw,5,"I had breakfast at Tangerine and wanted to commend the exceptional service provided by the server, Fish. He was very friendly and polite, recommending several different breakfast options, including Western, local specialties, and healthy meals. His suggestions were thoughtful and perfectly suited my taste.

Although the restaurant is relatively small and quiet, and doesn’t offer a full buffet breakfast, this makes the dining environment more comfortable and private. If you’re looking for a more extensive buffet, you can visit the nearby Ora Hotel. Breakfast at Tangerine is served from 7 AM to 11 AM (last order at 10:30 AM), which is great for those who want to sleep in.

Overall, this is a great place to enjoy a delicious breakfast, and Fish’s service added a lot to my dining experience. Highly recommended!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101625087611977737367/reviews
Chris,2,"Very very disappointed with the breakfast! Being a Ocean Suites guest, I was expecting a better breakfast, rather than a below average breakfast.

It is a semi buffet breakfast, they made us decide our choices of breakfast, before we can get seated. Maybe they lacked of staff to enhance their table service.

We tried  both Asian & the western set. Both taste worst than normal cafe breakfast.

To make it worst, the coffee taste like plain water, so diluted (see my picture), and they don’t serve latte or cappuccino, just “freshly brewed” from dispenser. To me, this is not acceptable for a guests who are from Suite Room.

The only comforting factor is the surrounding greenery ambience .",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110193342752842235843/reviews

Crystal Koh,5,"Had the 3-course ($38++) lunch while my friend ate 4-course ($62++). Portions are quite substantial contrary to my original assumption. Food is of very good quality and very fresh, especially the fish. Short rib beef is superb, breaks apart in your mouth easily.

Area is serene and quiet, located inside Espa, so it's good for a nice, relaxing lunch.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115830770081303202896/reviews
See G Tan,5,A very peaceful spa restaurant in the middle of a spa. Highly recommended for people looking for a relaxing meal in a very tranquil environment. The cooking style is Thai fusion and the best thing is the creative use of spice that's not spicy. A number of herbs used are grown in-house in the restaurant's garden.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118094093818765183459/reviews
