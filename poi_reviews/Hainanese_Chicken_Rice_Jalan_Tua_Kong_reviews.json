      "text": "Probably the best chicken rice in Tanglin Halt.\nChicken breast is not too dry at all, It's soft and juicy. Portion is very generous, I can't even see my rice and uncle is friendly. Best part is uncle do not smack the meat until flat flat.\nBig bowl of soup as well, sometimes you get chicken feet in the soup. Chili is punchy with ginger garlicky taste. They have curry chicken noodles too!\nTell me where can you still find such valuable and tasty chicken rice.",

You can expect the best powdery curry potatoes you can get if you get the curry noodles (or just curry with potato and taupok!)\n\nThey ensure you are well-fed with food portion sizes.\n\nBonus: super friendly!",
