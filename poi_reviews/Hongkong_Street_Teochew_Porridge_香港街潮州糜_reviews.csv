Wilson Chang,3,"Next to Koufu, Hongkong Street Teochew Porridge 香港街潮州糜 specialises in Teochew Porridge and Dim Sum.

Came here to try the dim sum which is mediocre and tasted more like ""factory-made"" instead of homemade dim sum? Price wise, $15.10 for 3 pax is definitely value-for-money.

Seems like most people come here for their Teochew Porridge, and we will try next time!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102589058598808274925/reviews

Yang Ping Wong,2,"Was here for breakfast. Had only dim sum and their breakfast set. Dim sum was said to be handmade but wasn't spectacular. Breakfast set is very affordable at 2.80 for 2 soft boil eggs, 2 slices of thick toast with Kaya butter and a drink. Be sure to eat the toast while it's hot. Kopi was on a lighter, a tad too sweet side.

Overall, easy to get seats, price is ok, but food is mediocre.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108355896870242150579/reviews
