Due to my clumsiness, i dropped the teh iced cup on the floor. The owner helped me to clean it and made another cup of teh iced. They’ve been so kind to me.",

      "text": "Came here for lunch and the place was packed. I ordered the curry chicken with bread and laksa with extra fishcake (+$1.50) and it was absolutely amazing!\n\nThe highlight for me was the curry. It was thick, rich and perfectly spiced, with just the right consistency. The flavors had a satisfying kick, the chicken was tender and the potato was cooked just right, not too soft. The bread was soft, making it perfect for dipping into the curry.\n\nThis is hands down one of the best curry chicken I’ve had in a long time. I’ll definitely be back for more. Highly recommended for anyone who loves a good bowl of curry chicken.",

      "text": "On a recent visit to Queensway Shopping Centre, I decided to indulge in a taste test at the well-known Janggut Laksa. This spot is particularly popular among Singaporeans who prefer not to make the trip to Katong for their laksa fix.\nInterestingly, there are two laksa stalls situated near each other, both with their own loyal patrons. Naturally, my curiosity led me to try both to determine which one stands out.\nJanggut Laksa:\n\n• Menu Options:\nJanggut Laksa offers a broader menu, including dishes like curry cutlet rice.\n• Laksa: The portion size of the laksa is smaller, but what it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality. The taste is creamier with an intensely flavoured dried shrimp fragrance that sets it apart.\n\nOrder System:\nTheir order system is quite efficient. Once there are people leaving, they will seat you and hand you the menu.\nGiven that it's an open space in the mall, orders need to be paid for before the food is delivered.\nOverall, I found Janggut Laksa to be quite enjoyable. The laksa's rich and creamy flavor left a lasting impression, and the efficient service added to the positive experience. I'll definitely be returning for their laksa, Otah, and curry cutlet rice.",

      "text": "Visited 1 Mar 25. I didn't find it as good as their neighbour 328 Katong Laksa, unlike many. I feel their laksa soup was coagulated and lumpy, and had way more sediments or leftover threads of lemongrass, giving it an unsmooth texture. The noodles were not cut too. The portion of prawn was also smaller, and their serving of chili was limited.\n\nTheir kopi was a bit on the sweeter side.\n\nThe English-speaking auntie managing the queue was quite loud and many will dislike her tone but I feel if you want to try the laksa, you have to accept the establishment's quirks. In any case, another elderly auntie took our order who was very patient and kind.",
