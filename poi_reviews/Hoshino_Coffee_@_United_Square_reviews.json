When the food arrived, we were eager to tuck in to a hearty meal!\n\nOh but what a disappointment greeted us!\n\nThe moment we opened the cover of the lobster bisque, the rancid smell punched us in the nose with my reaction wanting to puke!ü§Æü§Æü§Æ\n\nThen we quickly opened up the rest of the order which seemed ok except the mille crepe which seemed to have melted (??)! Our house is jus 2 bus stops or 5 min away from United Square!\n\nThis is definitely a great letdown!",

      "text": "We came on a late Saturday morning and ordered a Katsu Omu Souffle Curry Rice with Salad and Mini Soup combo, Orihime Blend and Hoshino Blend.\n\nThe Katsu was crispy on the outside and surprisingly I liked their salad as well. Loved their Orihime Blend, preferred it black. It's indeed light-bodied and mild with a clean taste laced with biscuity flavor. Hoshino Blend on the other hand is richer and smooth, goes better with a dash of milk.\nOrihime is my personal favourite and I even joked that I want to bring it home.\n\nService was what I would expect from a restaurant which was decent.\n\nI would come back again.",

Pasta was to my liking, no so creamy and not so bland. I didn‚Äôt even like omu rice, but I like this one. The desert was a bless. The different ingredients blend in nicely. We were so full at the end but still insist to finish everything. The only thing can do with improvement was staff‚Äôs recommendation when we ordered. A bit confusing‚Ä¶",
