      "text": "Entry to the museum is free but depending on the crowd outside you could be waiting up to 30 minutes to get in. Upon entering, the staff will give you a briefing on what you can and cannot do inside of the building. There are three levels. The first and third floors being dedicated to pottery of different time periods. The second floor is more for temporary exhibits and more exploratory things. The exhibits on this floor could use more explanation instead of a number next to such exhibits, as I had a hard time understanding why it was even displayed in the beginning. Overall a good place to visit if you happen to be within a stones throw from here.",
