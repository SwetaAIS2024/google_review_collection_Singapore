Stephanie Faye,5,"Friendly, thoughtful and professional! Owen suggested to give my dog some time to sniff around for his first visit and get comfortable in the shop before carrying him into the shower where he usually tries to run from. I was worried if they would be able to handle/lift him at 26kgs into the tub etc. but he was professionally cared for and his grooming went well - my medium/large Singapore Special looked great and happy after!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113897452991321096451/reviews
