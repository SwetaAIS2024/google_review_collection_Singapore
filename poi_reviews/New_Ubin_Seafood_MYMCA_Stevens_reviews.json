      "text": "Apparently the must-get dish here would be the Angus Rib-Eye (served medium rare) that comes with a complimentary Heart Attack Fried Rice.\n\nMy personal favourites were the two carb dishes - Hokkien Mee and the Boss Bee Hoon!\n\nI also found it smart to sell the Chilli Crab sauce without the crab for those who want to dip with mantou buns like us, but it was disappointing taste wise, nowhere close to the real deal.\n\nThe other dishes - Squid, Har Cheong Gai, Kai Lan, were pretty great. Wouldn’t mind bringing my family here for a meal one day but maybe the other outlet as it was so warm the entire time.",

      "text": "This place always have drink pairings with food. This time round, it was the whisky pairings. This was a fabulous whisky pairings session. The chef paired the Israelis whisky with local food. The sup kambing was one of my fave, didn't expect that to pair so well with the drink. Meat were tender & not gamey at all. Soup was rich & couldn't help myself of couple servings.\nThe Korean Fried Chicken burger was well marinated & was also pleased the diners.\nThe Smoked Pork Curry was infused with smoky flavour which was interesting, great to pair with dead sea single Malt. Very well thought menu, kudos to the team to have made it happened.",

      "text": "I very rarely leave reviews, but I've gotta say the service at New Ubin Seafood amazed me!\n\nThey had a whisky (M&H) x food pairing event which had a minimum of 2 pax to register. None of my friends were free so I asked them to let me know if they had any extra seats and were willing to slot 1 pax in. To my surprise, within the hour they took my reservation (even giving me the early bird rate)!\n\nOn top of this, they went above and beyond to recommend I use Grab Dine-Out to get an additional 10% off. I happily made payment using Grab Dine-Out, but forgot to apply a separate $10 voucher I had. I decided to ask if it was possible for them to reverse my payment so that I could make payment again using my voucher.\n\nAlthough I didn't expect it to be possible, they exceeded my expectations and got their finance department to do a full refund!\n\nThe most amazing thing is that all their staff have a great service attitude and none of them responded to me in an impatient/rude way (they have multiple staff handling the whatsapp account at different times). Special shout out to Larra, Flor and Julio for making this a great experience!\n\nPS: The food here is also really good - the bee hoon (super strong wokhey) and smoked pork curry were the highlights for me.",

      "text": "Upon entering the restaurant, you immediately notice the simple yet charming design, with old photographs adorning the walls that evoke a sense of nostalgia and warmth. It sets a laid-back atmosphere that seems perfect for enjoying a meal with family or friends. Now, let’s talk about the seafood, which is undoubtedly the star of the show. The freshness is palpable in every dish, making it clear that they take pride in sourcing quality ingredients. The drunken prawns were exceptional; they were succulent, bursting with flavor, and expertly cooked. Each bite was a delightful experience that left us wanting more. Equally impressive was the chilli crab, which lived up to its reputation. The sauce was rich and flavorful, offering just the right balance of heat. The crab was tender and cooked to perfection, making it a dish I would recommend without hesitation. However, only some of the dishes hit the mark. The sambal stingray was a letdown. It felt like something essential was missing from the flavour profile, and the sambal was a bit overpowering, drowning out the natural taste of the stingray. I wanted a more balanced approach to highlight the fish rather than overshadow it. Additionally, the beef dish we ordered was overcooked, resulting in a tough texture that made it hard to enjoy. It’s a shame because, with better execution, it could have been a standout dish. The vegetable dishes didn’t impress either, as they shared a similar flavour profile that became monotonous very quickly. This similarity in taste deterred us from ordering more, as we found ourselves craving some variety on the table. One of the more frustrating aspects of our dining experience was the service. With our large group, it was understandable that there might be some confusion; however, the waiters seemed overwhelmed and made several mistakes with our orders. It’s not ideal to remind staff about items we've requested, especially when everyone is excited to try what the restaurant offers.",
