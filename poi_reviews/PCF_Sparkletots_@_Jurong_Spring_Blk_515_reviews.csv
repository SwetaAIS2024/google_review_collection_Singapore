siti nuraini,1,"***fyi - I’ve copy paste here the feedback I send to the centre HQ

To SparkleTots HQ,

I would like to feedback on one of your centre.
Namely PCF Sparkletots @ Jurong Spring Blk 515.

I have registered my interest with the childcare somewhere in Nov 7.
Its bad enough that they actually messaged us telling we can only view the childcare from outside????
What sort of nonsense is this??
How can we parent make an informed decision before placing our child ( IF we only get to view the childcare from outside )

Another thing - appointment was already made in advance for us to go down and view the childcare from OUTSIDE on 9th Dec.
Even though we knew we only going to view from outside, we still decided to go ahead..
Appointment was set way in advance and time for the appointment was set at 12 noon.
But the centre admin decided to call us at 1035am on the day itself to say we cant view the centre as the principal or whoemever is away???!!!!!!

Mind you, i have a 16 months old baby with whom i get to skip her morning nap just so we can view the centre from OUTSIDE!

Pls look into this case asap and hope you can feedback this matter to centre to be more professional.

Thanks,
