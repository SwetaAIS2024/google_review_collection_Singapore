Even got a free plate when we ordered 10! The kids can’t get enough of the prawn chee cheong fan, siew mai, har gao, and char siew pau, while my mom is living for the chicken feet & pork ribs. So happy we can enjoy all these tasty treats without breaking the bank! We’re definitely making this a weekly tradition!",

But today it's really disappointing.\n\nOrdered 11 items, only received 10, realised it only when I got home.\n\n1 of the service staff was impatient and aggressive, wanted me to leave when there were 8 or so items only, but was told there were more items by another colleague. Or else I would only have 8 instead of 10 items.\n\nQuality was shockingly bad from my previous experiences. All of them are worse than saizeriya quality except for yam cake and the Zhu Chang Feng.\n\nExtremely disappointed.",

It is true that they are not on par with restaurant grade dim sum. But at this price point, honestly it is definitely worth more than it's price.\n\nThank the bosses for having such a wonderful shop over here. Support.\n\nWould have given 5 stars but I only give 5 stars for restaurants with something really special. I will definitely return.",
