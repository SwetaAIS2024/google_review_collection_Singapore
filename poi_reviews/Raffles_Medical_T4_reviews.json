      "text": "My 6-yr old child needed a quick treatment, which was replied that we had to wait for an hour until a doctor/nurse came in. We consulted with our doctor by phone and was told to just lie down so we came back to this facility asking whether she could just lie down in the emergency room, but again was told that \"what if other passengers need a treatment, etc etc..\" which was weird as if us and our daughter were not passengers who needed a very simple help & treatment..\nSo in my conclusion this facility was only put there as a \"I don't know what for\" medical facility because no matter the condition it seemed impossible to get some help out of this facility. This happened on July 20th 2024, at around 1700ish hours SG time if needed a review from CCTV from the management.. Fyi, my child was experiencing bleeding and need a light treatment and lie down while waiting for our airplane.",

The doctor in charge attempted to dislodge the wax in my ear, without success. Upon returning home 3 days later, I discovered that I actually had a serious throat infection, which effected my ear but there was no actual ear infection, hence the efforts of the doctor in vain to cure it! When I wrote to complain of a total misdiagnosis, my claim was dismissed and no compensation or apologies were offered. Clearly their bottom line is to make money from travellers who don't have any alternative.",
