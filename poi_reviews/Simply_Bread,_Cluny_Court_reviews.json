Went to dine-in & ordered for their mushroom with no cream; everything sandwich & sticky bun.\n\nDefinitely cannot finish it all, had the rest of bakery at the later of the day. No wonder the sticky bun so sellable. A cinnamon taste with sticky bread & nuts. A humble & simple bakery, yet their breads & sticky buns are awesomely delicious üòã",

Feeling lucky for zero waiting time though the cafe was full.\n\nPaired my gorgeous sticky bun with a rich and revitalizing iced Americano, it's the perfect combo to brighten up my May Day. üòç",

Plain Vanilla was filled up (no seats) and I didn‚Äôt really feel like taking away any of their pastries as they aren‚Äôt really healthy nor substantial. Anyways chanced upon this place in desperation for a quick bite and boy was I surprised at how good the peanut butter and banana sandwich was! And it‚Äôs not even the price of a flat white elsewhere!",

      "text": "My personal favorite bakery - they do their bread simple and they do them good. No frills all honest love. Their Croissant feels like a mix between croissant and shio pan - not complaining. The best find was their Chunky egg sandwich. Eggs were super tasty and AMPLE, bread was good and warm, but the show stopper was the iceberg cabbage.\n\nThank you for always being consistent with the quality of ingredients you use!!",
