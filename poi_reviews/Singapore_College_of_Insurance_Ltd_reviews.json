      "text": "1July24 Today's exam was terrible! It didn't resemble the mock exams at all. There was no network in the classroom, so I couldn't access my IC on Singpass. I almost got rejected by the rude staff at the counter, who continued to harass me after the exam as I was leaving, reminding me to bring my physical pink IC. Sigh...\n\nI achieved a score of 99.4% on the mock exam, but only 34% on the actual terminal exam today. I'm worried about the discrepancies in the scoring. It's frustrating that the mock exams seem designed for students to fail. I am concerned that the system is monopolized and that there may be unfair practices in place. Sigh ðŸ¥²",
