Rick Koh,5,"Superb bowl of lor mee. I had the signature bowl. It comes with fried fish, lor bak, chicken bites, fried wanton skin, braised egg and the usual yellow noodles and beehoon. I like it that the gravy is not super starchy, it has more of a runny texture. A really good hearty meal for my brunch. At $5.50 for the large size portion, it's really very reasonable.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106510842319180067826/reviews
PeiJu Jiang,5,"I eat the noodles since I was a child when I lived in Tanglin Halt. Love the dry noodles with a mixture of braised shredded chicken, fried fish and braised egg that come with a complimentary small bowl of herbal soup. The owner is very generous with the serving . The price is very reasonable and affordable on the back of rising cost of living.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115445518027206194373/reviews
