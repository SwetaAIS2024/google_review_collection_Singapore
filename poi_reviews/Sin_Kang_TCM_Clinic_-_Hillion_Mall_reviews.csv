Physician Zhao is experienced and skilled in TCM, and always careful to ensure every detail of the patient's needs are well taken care of, in her gentle and professional style. I always feel better with her acupuncture treatment.

Excellent clear explanation from Physician Gow, on my condition. Very skilled. She relieved my aching neck with bone adjustment and acupuncture.

Counter staff YuRou is a sweet little angel and always ready to make reservations and adjustments accordingly, with precision and accuracy. And seeing her smile is always a treat :).

JC,5,"Writing this as I left the session feeling much better.

I had a two hour Tuina session with Sharon yesterday. She’s been at this outlet for two months, with seven years of experience overall. Her technique is unique and effective, where she use firm, rhythmic pressure on meridian points to release tension and improve energy flow.

She also took time to understand my pain and tailored the treatment, which really helped with relaxation and relief. Highly recommend her if you're looking for a skilled Tuina therapist with a special touch.

One area to improve: Consider adding more stretches.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115548968879234218173/reviews
