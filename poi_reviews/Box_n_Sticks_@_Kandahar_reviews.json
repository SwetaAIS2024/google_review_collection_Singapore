The grilled sticks can be skipped in our opinion, nothing special for the price. The beef rice bowl however was decent though a bit on the saltier side with an overpowering black pepper taste (works if you like black pepper).",

The bara chiraishi is good. The sashimi and maki are great too.  The buta buns were served hot and I enjoyed the herbal like taste.\n\nI would skip the skewers if I return though. Didn‚Äôt really get the freshly chargrilled taste I was hoping for. The tiramisu is also a miss as it was very watery.\n\nOverall, spent $201 for the table of food for 5 people.\n\nService is alright.\n\nWould return for the dons and maki.",

Price point wise is pretty affordable contrary to other izakayas.\n\nüíß Water is no complimentary.\n\nThe skewers came pretty quickly too and we would recommend the mentaiko chicken skewers.\n\nAlso ordered a good variety of pastas and the soft shell chilli crab donburi. Portion size was just right for an average eater. Ambience is rather quiet, but I like that 1 small pint was $5.80++ and makes a good gathering spot for dinner.",
