tian tan,5,"Grain’s catered CNY meal was better than even freshly made food at a restaurant. Excellent menu selection, none of the boring old items every other catering business is offering. Nothing was dry or overcooked as catered food often are. Everything tasted fresh, juicy, flavorful. Every dish received accolades from our guests. Only the dessert was a little puzzling, savory mixed with sweet, can tell its creator was trying to do something different and less unhealthy as with the rest of the menu. It wasn’t bad but it didn’t quite hit the note either. All in all, food was excellent, worth the slightly higher price point, we’ve already made a mental note we’re ordering again for CNY 2026.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111311461505392439633/reviews
Jush Chen,5,The portion is huge. Ordered for 10 but can easily feed 20! The food quality is awesome. Ingredients are fresh and the taste is heavenly and flavourful. Really thanks to Ting for the incredible service. I was able to directly contact her when I needed any assistance and her responses were instantaneous. This is probably the 3rd time I've used their catering and it won't be my last.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107197174286943598445/reviews
