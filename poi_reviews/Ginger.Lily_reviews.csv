Kai Ling,5,"Wonderful mother’s day high tea experience. Amazing to hear from such a humble elegant lady, a role model mum~
The sharing session and collaboration elevates the overall ambience. Had fun interacting with the team while savouring every mouthful of thoughtfully prepared item be it savoury or sweet.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100635259993109346258/reviews
Paulina D,5,"Service was excellent and Shirlina, Lorenz and Syahril looked after us really well. Teas were superb, especially Velvet Brew which had notes of chocolate but wasn’t sweet and very well balanced.
Savoury treats were good while sweet treats were a bit bland in taste. Nevertheless, they all looked good and service made up for it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114063354645086391313/reviews
Jasmine Wong,5,"Lovely afternoon experience at Gingerlily! The savouries were delectable and desserts exquisite. Just look at the pics.. every piece was thoughtfully crafted with multiple layers of harmonious flavours and textures. Simply divine!
TQ to Lorenz & Leo for the excellent service we received all afternoon - attentive, knowledgeable & yet non-intrusive.
In short, Gingerlily has certainly won over my heart❤️.....",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108436454718212468254/reviews
Ave,4,Stirling and Lorenz are the ones who attended to our table. Their service was prompt and meticulous. They are always smiling and friendly when we asked for assistance such as refilling hot water.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112127480755659572880/reviews
Kero Ong,4,"Had the afternoon tea. Very accommodating when I mentioned my partner was unable to make it (their website states 2 diners minimum but I was able to dine solo). Savouries were very good; I wish they focused more on the savouries because I think they were better than the desserts. The pre-dessert poached pear dish was excellent though, as was the cocktail! Also my server Shirlina was lovely, even helped me take a photo :')",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103512457607418100025/reviews
