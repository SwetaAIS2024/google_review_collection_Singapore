Constance Li,1,"I am absolutely appalled by the horrendous attitude displayed by the big-sized female security guard at the French Embassy. It is completely unacceptable to receive such deplorable treatment from a frontline worker, especially considering she is the first representative of the French Embassy. The management of the French Embassy needs to take immediate action and educate their staff on how to speak courteously and with a gracious attitude. Such behavior ruins people's moods and cannot be tolerated!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114444653847109449081/reviews
Md Tapon Mahamud Jony,4,"I was reading lots of complaints regarding the Asian security lady. I’m agreed with this mater. First impression is the best impression. She is representing a nation Embussy. I hope embassy of the France will look into this mater and taught them more about professionalism. I love their place mostly because of located just opposite of Singapore botanic garden.

Few tips :
1. Don’t come early since they won’t allow you to enter inside until your appointment time comes.
2. BOTANIC GARDEN MRT just opposite, if you have plenty time then you can use MRT.
3. Only service seeker person will allow to enter inside.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104455448415632342216/reviews
Amber Lim,5,Me and my husband wish to thank the consulate office of the French embassy for responding to our emails about our student visas.

Peng Cara,1,"Horrified by the security guard’s rude attitude. The female security guard refuses to open the door and makes you stand outside the gate. Yes, even if we need to wait, it would be polite if she could at least tell us and not make us stand outside the embassy. When you are in the security area, she will give instructions in a rude tone, as if she is ordering you to do something.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116445633146664753140/reviews
Gerald,5,"Was there as I had to do a new passport. Very efficient process. Very easy to book the appointment online. Once there, efficient and professional staff and nice waiting area with couches and water cooler. They even have a printer and photo booth which is very convenient if you forgot to bring some documents.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100089302869950222988/reviews
