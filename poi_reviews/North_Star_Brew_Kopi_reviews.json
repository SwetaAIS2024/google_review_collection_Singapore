Good variety or non-muslim food and only 1 -2 stall serving muslim options.\n\nNote the this coffeeshop is located right inside Northstar Industrial building, so yes you need to drive in, drive around (pass rows of pre-school on ur left) and you will see a coffeeshop facing AMK Ave 5.\n\nThe Carpark cost me $4.55 for about 3 hours of parking.\n\nWashroom available on site.",

So patronise almost everyday for my favourite teh-O.\nSome of the food that I like:\n1) Malay stall Lontong\n2) Lor Mee\n3) Prata & Briyani\n4) Hokkien Mee from the Tze char stall ( they are famous for their claypot crab noodles)\n\nDrinks stall currently having promo. $0.80 drink for Sunday 5am-5pm for dining in only. Good deal. So I normally sit there to drink one teh-o before I go back office.",
