Zuriel Mamba,3,"Great service recovery! There was a slight miscommunication with my order, but the staff handled it professionally & kindly. Without hesitation, she prepared a new order for me, ensuring I had the best experience. Truly appreciate the excellent service & dedication.
The omelette was decent,  however the fried chicken was  dry. Good that the noodles were not lump together.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100097027827819745483/reviews
Jaylen Bong,1,"Extremely disappointed with the quality of the food. Ordered a Tom Yum chicken fried rice, Tom Yum soup and pandan kueh.
Fried rice was tasteless and dry, soup was very salty and the pandan kueh was just carelessly strewn into the box.
For someone who always finishes my food, this is one of the few times I simply could not bear to eat another mouthful and left the rice and soup half eaten.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114319794230024975887/reviews
nicnicxun,2,Took some time to prepare. The food was not hot as what expected when served. Wonder why took such a long time. That time is 4pm plus not yet peak hour. The food is super salty. Expected food to be slight spicy as this is Thai food stall(?) but it is normal egg fried rice.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105369917600002020050/reviews

Teck Chong Law,2,"Quite a long wait for the food.

The only thing that had a bit of taste was the minced pork.  But just a little bit of salt taste.

The eggs and fried rice were just bland and really tasteless.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103886416957126587915/reviews
