The design like totally upside-down. 70% to 80% of passage at drop of points need to use overhead bridge to do change bus and this % need to share with the 50% or more ppl that come from the mrt. And 2 bus start point is out of interchange. If je going to be full develop this interchange won't able to hold the further crowd. The only star I give is new and clear.",
