Samuel Wong,5,"Shiok ah! Their beehoon super good and affordable. Sides like crispy egg, luncheon meat, and veggies all very delicious .

Price also very reasonable, wonâ€™t burn a hole in your pocket. Service fast and friendly, portions confirm can fill your stomach. Definitely must try!",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113816589242209160796/reviews
