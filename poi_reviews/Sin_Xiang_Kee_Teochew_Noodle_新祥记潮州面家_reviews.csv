Edward Wong,4,"Paid $4.50 for a bowl of bak chor mee. The noodle was springy. The pork slices were tasty and tender. The pig liver and meat balls were also tender. The free pig organ soup was tasty too. Altough I asked not to add chilli sauce to the noodle, there was no ketchup or black vinegar added - very different from other bak chor mee stalls. Nevertheless, this was the best bak chor mee I have eaten in Yew Tee. Service was prompt as there was no queue.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110173188680901424865/reviews
