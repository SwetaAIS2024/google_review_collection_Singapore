Mahesh Sonar,5,"A must-visit if you're traveling with kids! The dome-shaped IMAX theatre offers an immersive experience with stunning visuals and educational films on space, nature, and science. It‚Äôs a fantastic way to spark curiosity and make learning fun for children.

Perfect for families looking for an engaging and unique experience in Singapore! üåçüé•‚ú®",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111935223689885736036/reviews
Elaine Chong,5,"Omnimax theater is one of the best place for movies like Everest where you can watch at a widescreen. I got my tickets at Klook. Very cool üòé. Visit if you can. Open up your eyes and see the world in a different light . You will enjoy. Not only the theater, snow city, kidstop, science center is just next to the theater. Moreover there is a Indian restaurant Phoenix there too for meals. The annual pass is very worth too. The kids will like it. There is also rock climbing activity too. There‚Äôs car parks readily available too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108752070937988507901/reviews
Sh,1,"Extremely boring. They should change the story. Just a video on universe will do, please don't add Australian tribe stories. We all were sleeping by the end. I have been to a similar theater in London and in Delhi, both are way way better..",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100660602924526319784/reviews

Chee Siong Cheng (CS),4,"Decent setup with free seating upon ticket purchase. Tickets can now only be purchased online. Loved the experiential short docus that is a little 4d like. My kids had fun watching exploring new worlds. Take the seats at the centre of the theatre for the best experience!
