The food was fresh, hot, and tasted great—just the kind of quality you'd expect from KFC. It’s a convenient spot for a quick and satisfying meal, especially for those living nearby or passing through the area.",

I hope the team can work on improving order speed and communication.",

Bought this today for dinner and it was surprisingly not too bad.\nI opted to swap out my whipped potato for coleslaw.\nHowever, do note their standard is inconsistent. They always forget to include cutleries even when I request for it in my app order. Need forks to eat the cheese fries\n\nThere was no queue before 6.30pm. Usually by 7, the queue would be quite long.\nLady at collection/ pick up order counter can be quite hostile and rude.\n\nI ordered the spicy pockett but was given BBQ instead. Disappointed",
