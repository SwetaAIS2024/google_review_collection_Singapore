Yana R,5,"My child has spent the past 1 year at MFS @ Blk 85 Whampoa and her experience there has been positive throughout. When we first came in, the principal Mrs Fong was always around to provide frequent updates on how my child had been settling in the new environment and that definitely made me feel less anxious as a first-time parent. Her class teachers in PG and N1 have been such wonderful gems - Tung Laoshi, Teacher Wani and Li Laoshi - they built such genuine relationships with the children under their care and you can rest assured that your child is in good hands with them as your child‚Äôs class teachers!

The other teachers at MFS @ Blk 85 Whampoa often displayed such positive dispositions too, from the way I‚Äôve seen during the morning arrival, dismissal and even during school trips - even the centre‚Äôs cleaning and tea ladies are a friendly bunch! Kudos to the whole team at Blk 85 Whampoa for all that you do, we truly appreciate it!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104743123295361016948/reviews
