Particularly like the satay! and today we had the assembly fish head, sambal stingray and the fried calamari which were hot favourites too! Our family has grown to 14pax and luckily we can still fit around 1 big round table. ðŸ˜Š",

      "text": "For the price of the food, i would say it is pretty good value for money. However if i were to just rate it based solely on the taste of the food, i would say it is alright. I would recommend the garlic pork and assam fish and thats pretty much it. Im not sure why but the vegetable dishes taste alittle bitter(?), perhaps they didnt wash the veggies properly? Anyway the satay sold there is not that good so im alittle surprised as to why they would recommend us to have some satay. There was no smoky taste in the satay (most likely they used some electric grill) and the meat wasnt seasoned that well.\nAnyway i would still visit this place again based on the price of the dishes.",

Lot of customers the Night i went. It has good reputation, but my friend said the foods taste seems change (negative side) not sure whether due to chef changed?",

It's a neighborhood restaurant and the food was good. Towards the end of our meal came a group of diners for their karaoke room, which can be quite loud if you are sitting next to the room. Alternatively, can sit outdoors which is sheltered.",
