Jacynda Teo,5,"I’d like to express my heartfelt appreciation for the outstanding experience at My First Skool preschool center at 997 Buangkok Crescent. The efficiency and warmth shown by both the teachers and non-teaching staff are truly remarkable. The clean and inviting environment of the school creates a healthy and welcoming space that promotes a positive learning atmosphere. My children genuinely enjoy attending school and often talk enthusiastically about their teachers and friends, which speaks volumes about the nurturing environment you provide.

I am particularly impressed with the thoughtful planning of daily meals and curriculum, reflecting a deep understanding of the children's needs. The enriching courses have significantly enhanced my child's learning capacity. Additionally, the their extension bay offers a well-designed transition into a more structured classroom setting, helping them adapt smoothly. The teachers in the infant care are exceptionally reassuring regarding my child's growth, which has been incredibly comforting for me as a parent. Thank you for creating such a supportive and effective educational environment!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106869789709834461358/reviews
