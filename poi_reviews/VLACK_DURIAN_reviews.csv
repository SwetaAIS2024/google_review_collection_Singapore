Dino KF Wong (Dino Wong),5,"Ok changing to 5 stars not because of the durian but it's their after sales and service recovery service is top notch. The initial 3 boxes i got yesterday were of inferior quality and today after a quick call, they decided to send 3 new boxes to me. I won't say it's the best dream lover i tried, and their durian are on the smaller side, it's still very good. All 6 boxes were ranging 440gm to 495gm. Thumbs up.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102780786019810962297/reviews

Justin Hoyo,5,"Durians here are super good and creamy. One of my favourite durian suppliers in Singapore. I usually request for a range of durians from bitter to sweet, and they never fail to deliver in terms of quality. They offer home delivery or you could go down to their shop if youâ€™ll like (but do note that the seats are super limited and it is outdoor seating). 5 STARS!!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116594589844831001227/reviews

Yvonne Yeo,5,The durian is the best I ever had so far. Is so good and creamy. The seed is small and flat.They seal it so well that you can't smell the durian till you open it. I try most of their different durian and they are  still the best . Their service is always good. I highly recommend to try their durian !!!!ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106171769899964516240/reviews
