Marking this one for Valentine’s Day or CNY - when you need to eat out but don’t want the crowds.\n\nThe saucing for each item we ordered was excellent. I felt this place did the veggies better than the proteins and I surreptitiously ate most of the palak paneer and saag makhani.\n\nMy only gripe was the butter chicken- it was dry and fell apart easily, even though the sauce was great.\n\nThe tandoori chicken was succulent and Smokey.\n\nService was impeccable on a Sunday evening?? They offered to change our plates after the starters and kept topping up the crackers until we stopped the one waiter.",

Some of the dishes we had included the pakoras, aloo chaat , chicken tikka, mysore mutton, prawn masala and paneer. The naans and jeera rice were really good too.Complimentary and refillable sides like the papadums and onions were also provided. For deserts, we had the gulab jamun, rusmalai and kulfi. The favourite was the kulfi (home made ice-cream). The masala teas were also flavourful. We visited on a weekend evening and had a good dining experience. The service was top notch too with staff patient with our queries and requests! We will definitely visit again for the quality of food and service rendered.",
