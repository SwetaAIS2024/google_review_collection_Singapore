Terry Chua,5,Fantastic place nested within mount sinai. Allows food from other restaurants. Ordered their Bak Kwa pizza which was fantastic. Pork meatballs was ok.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114779419389907602398/reviews
KH Chong,4,"Really nice ambience in the evening. It’s an interesting dining place within a condo development, overlooking the pool, sports courts and distant scenery. Staffs are friendly. The food we ordered was average except fish & chips which is tasty and crunchy. Good for family in early evening, hope there’s more of such private developments with public access. Only thing is parking, there’s no designated lots for visitors in the premise so just park on the road outside the restaurant entrance.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108028225713545630861/reviews
Debabrata Biswas,4,"The food is okay and the location is bit odd, being inside the Rigdewood condo. It is the range of their beers that are the main attraction - they claim to have about 100 different beers and ciders from countries all over the world. Go try it if you are a beer lover.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108956843472962080643/reviews
Crystal Koh,4,"Pizza is thin and crust is quite unique. Did a takeaway so didn’t get to experience the atmosphere. Felt the prices are quite expensive for Grab though. $20 for a pizza that’s prob only enough for 1 person. Like the fish & chips though, they use real cod.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115830770081303202896/reviews
Candis Yeo,3,"Nice place to chill with kids in tow. Kept them occupied with finger food while we watched soccer! Interesting selection of pizza, including bak kwa pizza. We enjoyed our Goat's Lager and the cheesy fries with bacon bits were wiped off fairly quickly.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107067156217788465002/reviews
