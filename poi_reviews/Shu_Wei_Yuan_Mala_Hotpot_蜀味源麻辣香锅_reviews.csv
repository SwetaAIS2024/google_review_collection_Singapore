S,5,"Glad I came to try despite the mixed reviews. The MLXG flavor really isn’t as strong as the usual MLXG, ie it’s not as salty and numb as others that I’ve tried, which I enjoyed because it felt healthier & won’t feel jelak. So if you love savory and 重口味, this won’t be shiok for you.

I ordered 微辣 which I taste no spiciness tho, so will opt for 中辣 next time. The slice meat is fresh & chewy (not tough) which I like. Will def come back.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101621206422743155524/reviews

Blu,4,"Quite value for money since no base and tier charges. Taste is satisfactory. Not as strongly flavoured as others, but ok to me. 4 stars is more like an encouragement rating.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108244143418489474265/reviews
C W,1,"Even with the rise in popularity of Sichuan mala shops and Chinese cuisine in Singapore, not every stall is guaranteed to be good. This is one of them. While the ingredients are very nicely stocked, the mala xiang guo is bland and has no fragrance at all. Very disappointing lunch. How can the taste be so bad? Never coming back.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113329429429410159736/reviews
