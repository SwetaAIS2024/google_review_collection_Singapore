Really spoilt the taste of the whole bowl of noodles. Inform the stall owner about it so that she is aware and be more careful in future. Dropped the rating from 4 to 1.",

      "text": "Heard alot about this very famous wanton noodle stall that used to be at blk 632 and later shifted over to blk630.  I was told that this stall always generates long queues. Reached the stall slightly before 1pm. There was no queue, i was able to order immediately upon arriving. Order their wanton noodle which was SGD$4.\n\nNoodle was nicely cooked, texture of the noodle wad springy. Sauce wasnt too my liking though.Charsiew and the wanton was pretty average. Wanton skin has a strong alkenline taste to it.\n\nOverall, it pretty average for me. Had better wanton noodle elsewhere. Noticed that the ppl behind the stall isnt the elderly couple but 2 vietnamese women instead. Not sure if the stall still belongs to the original owner.",
