N. Gan,5,"After a cable car ride on March 29, we found ourselves in HarbourFront on a hot day, craving a refreshing iced coffee. We came across a promotion at The Coffee Bean for their signature Salted Caramel Latte, available hot or iced, as well as the Salted Caramel Blended. Opting for the blended version, we ordered two, along with a Malibu drink, which wasnâ€™t part of the promotion. While caramel usually seems too sweet for my taste, the salted caramel was surprisingly well-balancedâ€”not overly sweet, but just right.

This promotion runs until March 31 and is as good as a 1-for-1 deal, making it even more worthwhile. Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111536004756755931697/reviews
Milky _Way Sky,4,"My lower rating as compared to their outlet in Compass One...
Preferred the one via Compass One as they provided stainless steel fork/spoon/knife as well as real porcelain plates unlike in Vivo outlet unfortunately they served you with disposable ones :(
I wish they standardised across all their outlets!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109602719861136882944/reviews
