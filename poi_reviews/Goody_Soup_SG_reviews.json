Food was delicious and generous in portion. The auntie was super friendly, to the point of being motherly. A beeper was provided to collect orders. E-payment was available. There is even a loyalty reward system. Its location is somewhat ulu so do support.",

Served with a side of rice and minced meat. Very comforting meal overall. Stall owners are also very sweet.",

      "text": "Very excited to find a very good soup stall. Now this is truly hidden gem located at industrial area at Lower Delta Rd. This unassuming corner stall serves superb healthy claypot soups with generous ingredients at great prices! OMG ÂæàÂ§öÊñôÂíØ!! Helmed by friendly and humble couple.\n\nWe had the pork belly soup set & miso soup set at $6.50 each. It's combination of claypot & hotpot style, every set comes with rice topped with delicious well braised mince meat and there's no MSG and salt added. According to friendly lady owner, she was inspired by Taiwanese style of soup using only natural flavour of herbs and also told us staying healthy is better than cure. We are very impressed by the soup, ÈùûÂ∏∏È°∫Âè£Ôºåoverwhelmed with natural flavours of the ingredients, it hits taste spot right, herbs taste and it's not salty. Not thirsty after having till the last drop. All the ingredients was super fresh especially braised pork belly (melts in mouth). Owner was very hardworking, boils 4 types of soup at early 5am.\n\nDefinitely will visit again soon!\n\nüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã",

You can taste the food is prepared with love and that is just something so difficult to come by these days when eating out!\n\nI highly recommend the bittergourd with pineapple. Take a leap of faith! Be courageous. At first glance, just reading it off the menu may seem intimidating but it is a must-tryü•∞ It has unlocked a palate in my taste buds that I have never experienced before. THANK YOU",
