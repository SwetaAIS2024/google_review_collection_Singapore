Wilson Oe,5,"I had a wonderful stay at the Quincy Hotel. The room was spacious, spotlessly clean, and the bed was incredibly comfortable—perfect for a relaxing getaway. One of the highlights was the free flow of drinks and snacks (including popcorn!) available throughout the day, which added a thoughtful and generous touch to the experience.

Special thanks to Cheryl at the front desk, who went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Her warmth and professionalism truly stood out and made our stay even more enjoyable. Highly recommend this hotel for both comfort and great service!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101236353262801889765/reviews
Deilika C,5,"I would say this is the best 4⭐️Hotel in Spore. The service was excellent, they served welcoming ice cream which-seriously delicious, and have 24hours pantry that served coffee, tea, and cereals.

The room is the big, king-size bed, neat, and has everything we need including Nespresso!

It even has bath tub (I stayed at premier room), pool, and gym. I love everything in this hotel. The cons I think compare to other hotel nearby Orchard, the distance from the central orchard is quite far when you’re walking. But I wouldn’t complaint since the hotel rate is below other hotel nearby.

I think the best part of this hotel is their staff! They always welcoming us with smile and always passionate doing their work. Will definitely be back to this hotel. Thank you for the service!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112052540122537298345/reviews

Chen Wang,5,"The staff were amazing and gave special accommodations for early-arrival guests.
Room is clean and spacious. I like the large glass wall.

On the flip side the corridor is not air-conditioned. Not a problem for me but other guests might feel too warm.

I only used cabs for transportation for this location. It's certainly less convenient than the downtown locations but can't complain with the price.

Overall great value for the stay.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108746262661891992014/reviews
