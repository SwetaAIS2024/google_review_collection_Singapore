Patrick Lai,2,"Not as fresh as expected, all are frozen food...
Soup based is counted for per pax!!
Even when it is ONLY 1 pot, and 1 soup base, no È∏≥È∏Ø available.
Sea Prawn was not fresh and have the Ëá≠ÈÖ∏ smell even after cooking.
Limited choices of food.
Waste of money.
Watermelon is kept in the same area as the raw food and the tongs are the same as per raw food.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112317426011899277978/reviews
