Wai Meng Yap,5,"Was at Bird Paradise for a corporate event so didn't get to tour the whole place. Only went to look at the penguins and flamingoes. This penguin is adorable. It kept strutting around the window for the visitors to take pictures and videos. The overall atmosphere is cooling. Can see that the birds are well taken care of. Oh, and you may not need to worry about bird droppings. Seems like they are well trained in this aspect.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107002775994730492083/reviews
