One of the personal favourites was the home made prawn roll, it was awesome and i think it is a must order. Other dishes were pretty good too. Will return to order the crab beehoon!",

      "text": "Awesome dining experience! The creativity in their food and decor shines through. We brought our parents, and everyone loved it! Standout dishes include their crab noodle.  The previous time we came we have tried their salted egg, and chilli crabs, all yummy. (their crabs are huge!). The service was top-notch, too - they even accommodated my dad's mobility needs. Highly recommend!\nRecommended to reserve your seat first as they always have crowds.  Some dishes at the higher price but overall a good dining experience.  Enjoy.",

The prawns were juicy and full of flavor, perfectly charred with a hint of smokiness.  What really stood out was the freshness of the seafood‚Äîeverything tasted like it was just caught that morning.\n\nThe staff were friendly and receptive. Service was attentive, and the ambiance added to the overall enjoyment.\n\nHighly recommend for any seafood lover looking for quality and flavor.",

We ordered both an although they are different it‚Äôs difficult to say which was better. Both are excellent.\n\nRecommend you go early for dinner or make a reservation. We went early and had no trouble getting a table right away. By the end of our meal the place was packed.",
