Lee Brenda,5,"Our Company recently engaged Yat Guan Pte Ltd to pack and crate our materials bound to ship to America via ocean freight.

Our goods are not commonly packed by crating companies here, hence it is not easy to find the right Company till we found Yat Guan. Ryan, the boss himself was involved right from quotation stage and he was there with the workers during crating and stuffing of containers. We were impressed with his level of knowledge, responsiveness and professionalism in allaying our fears and worries as we needed to ensure that our goods were properly packed, protected and crated at the most economical cost and stuffed securedly to weather the ocean.

It has been a pleasant experience working with Ryan and his team. Like to mention Chou, who helped to work out the sizes of crates and pricing, Eric who took charge of the workers and Rashida/Mr Heng too for accomodating us in the warehouse.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111570306282863677670/reviews
