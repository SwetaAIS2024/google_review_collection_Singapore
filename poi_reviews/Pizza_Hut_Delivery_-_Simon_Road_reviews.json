      "text": "Pizza Hut @ Kovan (Simon Road) area is an ideal location for people staying within the vicinity, to get their pizza fix! 😋🍕\n\n🛵Delivery: On time, and pizzas delivered are served hot and yummy!\n\n🚶🏻‍♂️Pickup: Can be a hassle, as it’s just a tight single lane outside the outlet with heavy traffic flow, but there are  areas for cars to stop and do collection!\n\nPizza fix craving easily satisfied! 😋👍🏻\n\nUsed to had another pizza chain “competitor, DMO” just slightly down the slope, along the main road, and I sometimes do alternate between both. But saw that they are permanently closed! 😭\n\n🙏🏻 Pizza Hut please don’t closed down too!! We need our pizza in this area!!!! ❤️🍕",

Waiting time can extend up to >30mins during peak hours and probably also lack of manpower. Quality of pizza and wings have declined slightly over the years. Size of pizza has also shrunk.",

While I see other negative reviews, I have never experienced any issue with my order - either via GrabFood or directly via their website (touch wood hahaha).\n\nI’ve recently tried their crispy thin crust and it tastes kinda like prata (per photo). Perhaps not for me, but I can imagine it catering to a different crowd.\n\nWill be back when the cheesy crust craving hits again (:",
