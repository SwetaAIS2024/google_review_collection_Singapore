Noah Bouremana,5,I came here in the rain to get some food and shelter I ordered one samosa thinking it will be average but it was soooo good so I got 3 with my last few cents and they even gave me some free food that tasted good too except for samosas there is Indian food and good drinks for you to warm up or cool down and also very friendly staff  overall good place would come again 5 stars,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113171278837419171616/reviews
