Surrounded by a small park, there are lots of options for food and shopping. The area is well kept and seems to be quite popular. Restaurant options are quite varied, slightly upscale but still plenty casual. It appears they may have some boat tour launches from this area. I didn't see any while I was walking.",

As the whole place is built around the Singapore river, the ambient is quite surreal and nice. This is especially when night falls, when the surrounding are lighted up and even the bridges are with colours. A good place for couples and social gathering.",
