Jen Jan,5,"My child is in P1 and he enjoys going to school every day. He especially loves his teacher Mrs Kang, who is always smiling. Only 1 level is down for recess at a time, which means very short queues at the canteen. The school has regular programs to instill good character in the kids, and parents can see updates in their FB page.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108655860235365642098/reviews
Jun Hee Sim,3,"During my time in townsville I had to get used to the short toilets, most toilets not flushing and no locks on the doors in the toilets, the other facilities are average but other than that it was a pretty good school, made some good memories",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113353302281328346075/reviews
LT Cohu,5,"A primary school which has a lovely  village feel and old-school caring community coupled with a modern, progressive teaching philosophy. It's no secret that Ang Mo Kio, its catchment area, has an ageing demographic and thus a declining number of primary school age children. Also no secret that TVPS is not a ""brand-name"" school. But these provide impetus for teachers and school leaders to work harder to attract students, and they certainly do. My daughter is studying there - while intellectually bright, she presents some behavioural problems in class. I have been very touched by how patient, empathetic, loving and dedicated her teachers and special education needs officers have been towards her. Not only that, but her classmates have mostly been very understanding and kind to her as well.

Another noteworthy point is the impressive diversity of the school population. Apart from the solid working-class and middle-class Chinese, Malay and Indian demographic of Ang Mo Kio, there is also an amazing array of children of other ethnicities - Eurasian/ European, numerous ASEAN countries, mainland Chinese and Indian immigrants, even Africans as the numerous non-Singaporean/PR kids living in the area are unable to enter the ""popular"" schools. Your child will get an international school-like cultural exposure here and learn how to relate to people of all backgrounds.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103292820593980908336/reviews
