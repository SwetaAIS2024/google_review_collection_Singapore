The whole experience at the Hublot store was fantastic.\nBonnie gave me a great introduction to the Hublot brand and let me try on everything I wanted.\nThat's what a visit to a boutique is all about for me! Seeing something new and getting to know other brands. Away from online and towards personal advice, which Bonnie did exceptionally well.\n\nI felt very comfortable and would be happy to come back.",
