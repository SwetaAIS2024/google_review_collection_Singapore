Ricteo Seow,5,Have been patronising this stall since they were at Blk 109 Bt Batok to 177 Bt Batok and now the current location. My kids love their traditional hand torn mee hoon kueh or U Mian. Their braised pork belly rice is shiok too. Pork belly melts in the mouth. This stall also sells fish or seafood soup but my family always goes for the noodles or mee hoon kueh.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109061707025970284181/reviews
Rach,5,"Absolutely one of the best fish🐟 soup in the west👍🏻💯 love the fish slices that are not only quite chunky but more importantly, taste super fresh😍 My go to is the sliced fish bee hoon with additional fish slices(+$2) and a dash of milk - simply heavenly🤤 Stall owners are quite friendly too. Have been patronising whenever I’m in the area and I hope this stall will continue to operate in this food court for many, many years to come🥹 太好吃了!!!🤩🌟",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100368288078910287205/reviews
