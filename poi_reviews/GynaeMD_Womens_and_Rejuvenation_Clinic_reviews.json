Dr Ng took the time to listen to my concerns, explain possible causes clearly, and walk me through the next steps.\n\nHe recommended a hysteroscope procedure to get a better look inside the uterus, and I felt completely reassured by how thoroughly everything was explained. Their calm and compassionate approach really helped ease my anxiety. I truly appreciate the thoughtful and attentive care—it made a stressful situation much easier to manage.",
