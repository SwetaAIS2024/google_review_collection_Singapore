      "text": "There is usually a lot of take away or grab orders. And you can find seatings easily. The place is not too big and maybe about 10 seatings. It is near to Sheng Siong, and will be crowded on weekend.\n\nI like the fun toast honey French toast with butter. The coffee is nice and gao (thick) as I always request. Another drink to order is the hot almond cereal drink. But I will ask for no sweetness as almond itself has sweetness.\n\nThe chee chong fun is not the traditional type like pink sauce which I prefer. But it is still nice and goes well with the siew mai.\n\nBut the waiting time is longer for weekend but weekday will be good. Good place for catch up with friend over coffee and toast. Or you can have a break after your groceries shopping.",

Come more,  being drinking teh o peng kosong for more than 10 years,  good teh o peng kosong is smooth and nice without the bitterness and siap.  This rivercourt outlet serves 1 of the worst. Will not patronise again.",
