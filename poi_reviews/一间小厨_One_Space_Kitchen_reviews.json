Other dishes pretty decent too.\n\nA great place to have evening dinners with large groups.",

Serving was slow even though not much customers. During ordering, I have stressed that we want all dishes to be less oily, salty and spicy. Turn out to be total opposite of what I have requested for. After 40mins, the ÈÖ∏Ëæ£Á≤â is still not served. Reminded the lady! 1 hour later, still not served. Only when I went to counter and asked for refund then they get to kitchen to cook. Disappointed with the food, purposely went back as the first experience was great. Only 1 month, standard dropped drastically.\n‚ùåDO NOT RECOMMEND TO VISIT ‚ùå\nFeb2025\n1 of the better ÁÉ§È±º. At least better than the shop CHONG QIN ÁÉ§È±º. Price is almost 40% cheaper and taste better n the side dishes are so generous!\nAwesome üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª",

This area is good place for gathering as they serve beers and wide variety meat bbq dishes. They have air conditioned room as well as open air area for dinning but do avoid open air area if you do not like smoking smell.",
