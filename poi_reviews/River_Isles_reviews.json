Overall land area may not be as large as older condos but you can take a nice stroll inside the condo as well as lie on the hammocks. The condo looks beautiful in the evening with the many shining fairy lights. The condo has also easy access to punggol plaza, childcare centres and bus stops. Looking forward to the upcoming new cross island mrt line connecting to rivera mrt, just a 5min walking distance away.",
