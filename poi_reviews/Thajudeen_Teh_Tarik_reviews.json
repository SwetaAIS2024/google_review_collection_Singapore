Decent volume of drink but ur basically drinking 1-1 portion of water to teh tarik.. its not sweet, barely taste the teh.. and at one point i saw him pick up a straw he dropped on the floor to throw away. The next action was not to wash hand but hold the cup with his index finger on the inside of my cup.. Uh.. best to not order from here ya.",

      "text": "Pretty good teh tarik. Taste of tea was balanced with the sweetness.\n\nThe iced teh tarik was good too, with the balance shifting more towards the taste of tea.\n\nEdit: quality can be hit or miss. Perhaps it was a lull period, but the stall just used what's left in the can without topping up. This resulted in an unexpectedly poor tasting teh tarik.\n\nWas 4 stars, dropping 1 star for not ensuring amount of evaporated and condensed milk used stays consistent.\n\nEdit 2: dropped to 2 stars for teh ice that's already diluted from the get go. I suppose its time to find another place for teh tarik given how many times it's disappointed me.",
