      "text": "I engaged Etron Resources to repair my grandma's pre-war house concrete roof and water-proofing on 5 June 2018. Their charges were cheap and workmanship good. They gave us 5 years warranty. On 17 August 2022, I discovered stains on false ceiling in sitting room and kitchen. Etron honoured its warranty and came to do repair today. They are very professional.  They did the repair and even repainted the false ceiling for us. All free of charge. Their services are excellent.  Definitely we will recommend friends who need their services. Great job. 👍👍👍👏👏👏",
