The dining area is spacious, making it a comfortable spot even when it's busy, especially on weekends.\n\nThe fish head steamboat is the popular dish you must order. It's flavorful and the soup can be refilled, which is great for enjoying the rich, savory broth. The fish slices are generous and fresh, and there are plenty of sides like vegetables.\n\nWe also loved the Two Ways Kailan, which was tasty, and the Crab Roe Noodles were definitely worth trying! Overall, a great spot to enjoy hearty, delicious meals.",

Service is pretty fast even though there were many customers (we went on the weekend).\nMost popular is of course their fish head steamboat, very flavourful and soup can be refilled.\nWe also like their Two Ways Kailan, Char Siew, Roast Duck. Crab Roe Noodles is very worth a try too!\nTruffle tofu was a bit overpowering for my family's taste but definitely recommended for those who love truffle dishes üëçüëç",

      "text": "Absolutely loved my meal at Black Rock Fishhead Steamboat. The soup base was a perfect balance of umami richness and light, clean flavors, and the fish was incredibly fresh and tender. You can tell a lot of care goes into preparing both the broth and the ingredients. The charcoal fire added an authentic touch and kept the soup bubbling nicely throughout the meal. Service was fast and friendly, and the portions were generous too. Would 100% return for another hearty, satisfying meal!",

Food is awesome!\n\nService was smooth and fast (they must have read the reviews and improved)\n\nEasily one of the tastier Fish Head Steamboats my fam has tasted.\n\nAlso, char siew is a MUST to order.

Noisy due to poor sound insulation.\nOnly the Garoupa steamboat and sambal potato leaves (the lard helps) acceptable but doesn‚Äôt warrant the price at an industrial park place.\nMarmite Chicken was dry and unimaginative whilst the chilli prawn with beancurd was also forgettable.\nSaving grace - friendly and efficient service staff and aircon environment - hence additional star\nDefinitely not returning.",
