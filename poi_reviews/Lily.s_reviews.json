We ate it all up and forgot to take photo. The add on Vietnamese drip coffee is also highly recommended. We had tried the pho and bun cha before which were also good.",

      "text": "Lunch here at 1120am. Ordered lunch set. Overall tasty food but the pho portion is a little low on the chicken ingredient. Pho tastes great and on point however just lacks that little \"chewiness\" from eating in Vietnam. Their signature cooler although was $10 tastes really great and refreshing. Didn't dare to try their black coffee but I heard it was from Vietnam direct.",

I was bedridden for a day and recovered fully 2 days later (including a very unpleasant trans Pacific flight).\n\nI wouldn't go back even without the food poisoning, though.",

      "text": "My family comes here occasionally and I sometimes pop by with friends, usually for dinner. My favourite starter is the Grilled Lemongrass Chicken Salad, and I'd highly recommend this (unfortunately I did not take a photo). Another dish that is worth trying is the beef cheek (pictured with yellow rice), my dad orders this everytime and a friend of mine who dines here also raves about this to me. The bahn mi is great, and pho is nice, the soup stock is tasty. My husband enjoys the beef stew immensely and he is not usually partial to Vietnamese food. I think Lily's is a hidden gem and I hope it will be around for many years to come.",
