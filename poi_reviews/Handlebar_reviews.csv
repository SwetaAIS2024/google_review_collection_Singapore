Alright folks, Handlebar, a long-standing Singaporean establishment, has relocated to Lock Road, but it retains its charm. Donkey remember its previous location in the Sembawang/Woodlands area, easily accessible to motorcyclists. This time, our friends and us visited the new Lock Road location to watch the MotoGP. We've been to Handlebar many times, and this visit solidified its place as a favorite.

The decor is truly outstanding, a five-star rating is well-deserved! The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with a unique and extensive motorbike theme that permeates every corner, even the restrooms. The service was excellent, attentive, and friendly.  Their beer selection is vast with 'Suicide  Mug' being a clear favorite among regulars. We sampled a range of dishes from their menu, Guinness Draught, 1664, cheese fries, fried pork belly, and blossom onion rings, to name a few. While the food quality was above average, the extensive variety available is a major plus.

It's a fantastic place to relax with friends, especially if you appreciate motorbikes. The combination of great food, a unique atmosphere, excellent service, and a wide selection of beers makes Handlebar a highly recommended establishment.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114556064085815871377/reviews
C,4,"Tucked away in the scenic Gillman Barracks, Handlebar Bar & Grill impresses with its unique biker-themed concept that sets it apart from the usual dining spots. Its convenient location, combined with ample easy parking, makes it an accessible and stress-free choice for visitors.

The outdoor seating area is a true gem, offering a relaxed and inviting atmosphere where you can unwind and enjoy the laid-back vibes. Friendly and helpful service further enhances the dining experience, making every visit a pleasure.

When it comes to food, like the Mac & Cheese—deliciously rich, creamy, and comforting (nice with bacon topping). Another standout is their signature Cocaine Wings, which pack a fiery punch with bold, spicy flavors, perfect for those who enjoy a little heat.

Whether you’re looking for a casual dinner or a fun night out, Handlebar Bar & Grill delivers a winning combination of good food, nice service, and a chill, one-of-a-kind ambiance. A great spot for a casual evening meal with friends!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews

Mark Tan,3,"Hidden within Gillman Barracks, this bar offers an unique experience for motorbike enthusiasts and curious visitors alike. The bike-themed decor is creative and immersive, with even the restrooms adding a quirky, memorable touch. The space is well-suited for a fun night out, with large screen perfect for catching live sports, especially soccer, over drinks with friends. There's ample seating, both indoors and alfresco, making it easy to settle in and enjoy the atmosphere.

The staff were genuinely welcoming and attentive, which added to the relaxed, homey vibe. However, the food fell short of expectations. Dishes like the BBQ ribs, fish burger, and fried cod fritters were either too greasy or overly glazed, making them heavy and unappealing. Unfortunately, the meal detracted from what could have been a perfect evening, as I found myself losing my appetite as I ate.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111684394902487136193/reviews
