YP Soo,5,"Well maintained pool center. Spaces between tables are decent. There are darts live machines, probably about 8-10. A small bar area to order and drink drinks or you could bring your drinks to your pool table also. Very crowded during weekends with a wait queue.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107739220722281476081/reviews

Ruchir Srivastava,5,It looks pretty new and has both darts and pool facilities. It is big and less crowded than many other venues. The lighting is awesome. If I'm not wrong it's accessible by both lobby C and D level 4. Had difficulty finding it the first time but that was when safe entry was active and access was restricted.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115392518120077296747/reviews

Samuel Halim,4,"Good pool hall, quality balls and tables... however tables played quite slow (possibly due to the high humidity during rain season) . Longdraws require extra effort. Pro tournament tables with super tight pockets (4 inches) demands high accuracy. Klassic pool club have drier and newer tables with slightly larger pockets (4.25 in)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118202188915391880095/reviews
