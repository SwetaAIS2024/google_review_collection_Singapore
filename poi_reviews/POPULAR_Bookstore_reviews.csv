ABDUL ROHIM AMAN,1,"Complaint Regarding Unprofessional Service & Denied Exchange Request - Marvin

Dear Popular Tampines

I’m writing to express my frustration with a recent interaction I had with one of your staff members, Marvin. On Monday, 09 December, 17:59 SGT, I attempted to exchange an item, but Marvin refused to process the exchange because the item had been opened. While I understand the importance of return policies, I was unaware that the item contained a wired component when I opened it. Marvin insisted that the situation ""cannot be misinterpreted"" because the picture on the packaging clearly showed it, which I find unhelpful. As a customer, I did not fully recognize the item’s specific details, and I would have appreciated more assistance or understanding from him.
What made the situation even more disappointing was Marvin's rude and dismissive attitude. I expected a more respectful and professional approach when trying to resolve an issue, especially since this was a genuine misunderstanding on my part.

I would appreciate it if you could review this situation and consider a resolution, whether through a policy exception or another alternative. Clearer guidance on product details and return policies would help prevent confusion in the future. Thank you for your time and attention. I look forward to your response.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101281294990406663708/reviews
