Aini Arsad,5,"Attended 2 days course of basic fresh flowers arrangement using the skillfuture. The coach, Xiang Yi is very patient and helpful. She made the class less tense with her friendly approach. She is more like a friend than a coach. Lessons were well planned and easy to comprehend. I truly enjoyed my 2 days lesson. Highly recommended.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113258881323257640438/reviews
chris,5,"Had the most wonderful 2 days with Xiang Yi and coursemates! Found the course most useful, relevant, interesting, enjoyable and helpful. Was v engaged from beginning to end. I will definitely be looking to sign up for the 2&1/2 WS course. Looking foward and mostly just wanted to thank u for a course well executed and thoughtfully planned.. the book that is given to us helps a lot too with descriptions of flowers and foliage etc.
well done Joan and Xiang Yi ❤️",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116703987104202922721/reviews
