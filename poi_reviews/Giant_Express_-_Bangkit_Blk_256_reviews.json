The cashier right Infront of the self check out heard me and was pointing to the entrance when a supposed manager (heard her shouting instructions in another section earlier), a female with specs in Chinese accent walked over and asked me to take another brand, i told her my preference and she just said '没有‘ no more' and walked away. Meanwhile, the cashier brought the packet to me. 5 stars for the cashier whose name is DOLLY,  a little help goes a long way.",

You can’t find stuffs you would typically see in other supermarket here so you would need to find go to nearby marts to get them.\n\nYou will find multiple columns of the same item. You wonder if things were more organised, they can probably have more variety.\n\nBetter still, give it to a proper company like Fairprice or Sheng Siong.",
