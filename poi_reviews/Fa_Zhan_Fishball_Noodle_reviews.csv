Fu Zhou fishball was a little too salty with msg, but texture was soft and bouncy. Noodles was mid, missing the pork lard!

Christofer,5,"Been hving laksa from this stall for many years. Laksa and prawn noodles are both very flavourful. Not forgetting the carrot cake, usually I will go for the mix (black and white).

阿宝,4,"This stall sells fishball noodle & also fried carrot cakes.

When we were there, only a young girl who seems to be in her teenage year was there attending to customers…

Honestly I was doubtful of her skills as she is young & dun seem experienced… but her sunshine smile & friendly approach made the wait bearable 😀😀

We ordered the “yuan yang carrot cake” and it was very nice!!!  Thumbs up to the young teenage girl for the hard work!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews
Desmond Wong,4,The Fishball Noodle is pretty decent but not my top 5 favorite. Saw this on Jasmine Cheng 's favorite and decided to give it a shot but it came out a bit short. The noodles are a bit overcook and the chill is not very special. It is still nice but just cannot match the best.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114220117023892689160/reviews
