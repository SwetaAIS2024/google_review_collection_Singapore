iris,5,"A newly opened Japanese bento food stall at Taman Jurong that I had to try because I really like saba fish but i can’t cook at home as it will make the whole kitchen oily.

Just Bento’s version of teriyaki saba was very yummy. the fish was fried just right and it was fresh and tender. the salad was a generous portion. it even had edamame. the bento also came with fried gyoza.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103358886094489340512/reviews
J,5,"Newly opened stall located on the northwest side of the hawker center on the 3rd floor. Has various bento choices with three sizes each.

Ordered takeaway chicken teriyaki bento for lunch. Food looked great, everything was tasty, fresh, and well-seasoned. Would order again.

After finishing my meal and researching a bit before finishing this review, I realized there is another stall at Maxwell road as well that is positively reviewed, and I can see why :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116586340134852508312/reviews
