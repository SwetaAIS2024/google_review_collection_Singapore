Her Vietnamese colleague readily look at the screen on mobile, asked to show date of redemption ðŸ¤¦, luckily she knows whereabout to locate although had redeemed the coupon right in front of the earlier staff.\n\nThe soy tasted nice, first time trying matcha soy and not much matcha taste, too light. Will go with the original.",
