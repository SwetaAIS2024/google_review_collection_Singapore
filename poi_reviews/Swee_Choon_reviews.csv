Silver Lee,2,"Has been here many times, including those late  nights supper more than 20 years ago.
Sadly, food quality did not keep up with the hype after these years.

Drunken chicken and noodles was super salty. Fried chicken wing was cold and batter was not tasty. Rest of the food was just on the average side.

I rather put my buck in other dim sum places",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103399009560973617124/reviews
Pitcha Green,4,"The taste is delicious. I went to eat late at night and didn't have to wait long. However, there were always customers coming in. It's a restaurant suitable for all ages. I will come back..",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107347576950752877855/reviews
jay fernandez,5,"Traditional dim sum with Swee Choon signature items like their mee suah kueh which was scrumptious and choked full with mee suah in a crispy batter. Their dumplings, siew mai and wantons are generous in fillings of prawns and meat deliciously flavoured.
Service is excellent especially Alan at the front desk who despite the humidity was cheery, welcoming and efficient in managing the queue. Grace who attended to our table was very helpful and courteous and made our dining a  very pleasant experience.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108053899458658024295/reviews
See Ting Chua,5,Staff are friendly and nice. Food serves quite fast and warm.  The french toast can improve. Dont have egg taste and Butter should give more. Overall still a 5star for me.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113105660428170464676/reviews
Ming,4,"My last visit years ago was kinda meh. Went back recently after their shop expansion and makeover. Not only the place was revamped, they have also added many new food items on the menu, not only the usual dim sums. Had the stir fried cheong fun and la zi ji which were pretty good. Surprisingly good service and reasonable price.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109226628464118431877/reviews
