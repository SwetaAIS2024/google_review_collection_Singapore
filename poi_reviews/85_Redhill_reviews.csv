Hrmgr,4,Tried the Bak Chor Mee set and Fish Balls Soup today. The set was good especially the fish cake. Fish Balls soup is tender and the soup is not over seasoned. Overall did enjoy the meal.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews
Caitlyn Tay,4,"85 Redhill Food Centre is a fantastic spot for tasty, affordable eats. The selection is diverse, and the quality of the food is impressive. The hawker stalls are well-regarded, with many offering flavorful, hearty dishes. It can get busy, but the vibrant atmosphere adds to the experience. A great place to enjoy a variety of local favorites!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101550440477906741121/reviews
Wie b l,4,"This is a good meepok fishball noodle. You will love the fishcake. I would say that they have a chance to be GREAT, with just 1 change.
The noodle is relatively taut, I wish it could be tauter--so that it has a nice bite. No, it's not soft and lumpy, no, it still has a nice bite.
The soup is great, it has a hint of Tang Chye (Preserved salted vegetable). IMHO, I think this is the key flavoring ingredient, started from the very beginning--50 years ago, eversince I was a kid.
I love the fishcake, it is firm with a nice tautness in the mouth, and a very normal fish flavour. Some fishcakes are... smell-less, yeah it sounds weird, but it is true, because it has not enough fish in it? Too much flour?
The chilli paste to noodle ratio is perfect. It has a nice flavourful mix where every bite is so satisfying. I would say it leans to the sweet side, because it lacks vinegar.
The biggest weakness is the fishball; it is too soft, it feels like it is made largely of flour, not enough firm fish meat. I think these fishballs are factory made, not handmade by them. When you bite into it, it feels light and soft. So this costs them 1 Star in this review.
I would go back to eat, if I happen to be in Novena. If you are there, please check them out. Add additional fish cake to your meepok.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109201224600301983721/reviews

Joe Low,4,"Price is friendly, had dinner here on a sunday evening, there was no crowd, ordering and payment was prompt. Food wait time = instant collection, food tested good for the price. One star less as the pork chop I order was cold but the curry was hot. Will come back for quick bite.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116713816404358474603/reviews
