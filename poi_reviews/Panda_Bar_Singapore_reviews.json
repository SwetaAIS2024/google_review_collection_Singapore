Staff will not meddle and in fact entertain tables that do not follow the rules. They changed their menu recently and you won’t feel like ordering their food",

I understand that it’s a bar for people to sing in the hall, but the level of screaming in high pitch voice is quite a bummer. Food isn’t as great as before. You can go if you don’t mind hurting your ear drums.",
