For Mee Hoon Kuay lovers, you will prefer the Kuay pinch by hand and littered into the soup, that's how it is served here. The texture that you have on a hand pinched against the machine rolled is vastly different as you will be able to enjoy the mushy and chewy texture on the piece of Kuay. The bowl comes with Kuay, spinach, fried Ikan Billis and minced pork.",

      "text": "Came here because Sarah Ow did a promotion video for them.\n\nFirst of all, this coffeeshop is clean, spacious and windy, I like. And seems like it offers many stalls which serves good tasting food.\n\nThe popiah $2, was good enough for me and the Roast meat stall looks super yummy.\n\nTried the new Ramen stall. And here‚Äôs my verdict about Shinjitsu vs any other  established ramen ya (and not vs other coffeeshop ramen).\n\n1. Price is definitely much lower than any ramen restaurant. Tonkutsu ramen at $6.80 while special Tonkutsu is $10.80 which offers more ingredients, which is 1piece of nori, 1 slice of chasiew and 1 ajitama tamago.\n\n2. Tonkutsu soup is rich enough, but can be saltier to give more impact. (Then again this is up to individuals). But definitely better than Tagaki ramen‚Äôs.\n\n3. Their teriyaki chicken $5 is the usual decent standard.",
