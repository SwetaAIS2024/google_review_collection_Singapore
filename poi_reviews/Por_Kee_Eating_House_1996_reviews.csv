elhanan,3,"Aside from some cleanliness issues, food was okay.
Staff are super attentive and quick to serve.

Food served fresh and hot. However, the quailty of the food seems to have fallen short from my previous visit.

Give the Coffee Pork Ribs and Fish maw soup a try

Ratings of food:  ⭐️/5
1) Coffee Pork Ribs ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Probably the best thing we ordered. Good balance of coffee flavour, pork ribs were cooked well with a good balance of fat and meat.

2) Fish maw soup ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Thick texture, well seasoned soup with bits of minced pork.

3) Crispy chicken ⭐️⭐️⭐️
Chicken skin was crispy, and the meat was well seasoned. However, it was a little dry.

4) Homemade tofu ⭐️⭐️
Tofu was well done, with soft interior.
The flavour of the gravy was okay.

5) Omelette with onions ⭐️
Omelette was alright. Onions were cooked well. Can give this dish a miss.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104156475931560371184/reviews
Sheryl Biangco (Ladylyrehs),5,We ordered 6 dish + 1 dessert for 10 pax and we pay $339. The portions are generous and we almost cannot finish everything. The foods are all very tasty that we have to order for rice. The salted egg prawn was the best for me. The service was great and they serve quite fast. Highly recommended,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116710997281166261580/reviews
Fran G,4,"Authentic local food without the crowds of chinatown. We stayed in the area and found this hidden gem nearby.

Everything we ordered was delicious, especially the sweet n sour pork and the fried rice. Prices are on the high side but the food is worth it.

The server who took our order was friendly and spoke a bit of English, the rest of them weren't.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104100065706005007116/reviews
Stanley Pang,4,"Ordered takeaway for the signature champagne pork ribs, cereal prawn, roast chicken, and eefu noodles. All 3 dishes were outstanding. Pork ribs  was sweet and savory, prawns were plump and we especially loved the cereal batter, while the chicken was nicely flavored.

It's a pity that takeouts would have brought it down a notch in terms of crisp but we enjoyed it nonetheless.

Price unfortunately was on the high side. Bill came up close to $90 for all small servings.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101763161466007280569/reviews
Mao,5,"Recommended chinese zichar that’s air conditioned. Prices aren’t too steep considering the good quality. Yam ring and kailan can skip but the rest were worth it!

Located at the hipster place - tiong bahru neighbourhood. The restaurant looks abit rundown on the outside but still comfortable to dine in, with more indoor and outdoor seats. The staff were friendly despite being quite busy, rare for zichar stall where you always get unfriendly uncles or aunties.

Not sure why, but lots of foreigners tho they are many local chinese as well! Will visit again for sure!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103838334123409426621/reviews
