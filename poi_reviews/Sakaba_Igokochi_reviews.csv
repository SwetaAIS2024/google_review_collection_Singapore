Natalie Tay,4,"Noticed that the closing time is 11PM so I dropped by for dinner around 8:30PM. Chose the omakase and was not disappointed at all for food.

The problem was that they didn’t tell us the kitchen closes at 9:30PM, which means all my food was rushed. I had one dish in front of me then the next came before I finished. I wasn’t sure why until I found out later on. In the future I think it would be better appreciated if they had informed us beforehand so we will choose ala carte rather than a course meal.

The food was delightful but the waitress often did not explain what the food was. The other more experienced staff did when he came by to check on us.

I’d recommend to come! But definitely before 8PM. My favourite dish was the first dish with delectable salad dressing and yellowtail, but every dish was delightful.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102024748599130387710/reviews
Shane Wang,4,The sashimi is fresh and thick. The don would have been perfect if they added less soya seasoning as it is salty to the point that I cannot  bring myself to eat the rice which was soaked in it,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109731227066204220826/reviews
Jeffrey C,5,"Visited Sakaba Igokochi whilst exploring NeWest. Tried the beef cubes. Quite tender and flavorful, perfectly seared to lock in the juices. The cold soba was another highlight; the noodles were cooked to the ideal texture and served with a refreshing, well-balanced dip.
The tebasaki has a unique taste. Worth trying.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106833163410885808643/reviews
