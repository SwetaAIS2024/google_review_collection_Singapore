Kamal Indika Nanayakkara,5,"Pricing:

Prices are reasonable, with most dishes ranging between $3 to $6, offering great value for the quality and portion sizes provided.

Crowd Levels:

During weekdays, the hawker centre is generally not crowded, making it an ideal spot for a quick and peaceful meal. Weekends may see a slight increase in visitors, but the spacious design ensures it never feels overly congested.

Accessibility:

Located near Khatib MRT Station (NS14), the hawker centre is easily accessible via a short bus ride or a leisurely walk. Its proximity to Sheng Siong Supermarket allows for convenient grocery shopping before or after meals.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109967720850402274429/reviews
Gary Leow,1,"I had an appalling experience with Rong Kee Roasted Delights (Blk 848 Yishun street 81). The portion of meat was insultingly small, barely enough to satisfy a child, let alone an adult. It felt like a complete rip-off for the price paid. To make matters worse, they completely ignored my request for cutlery, leaving me without any means to properly enjoy the meal. This level of incompetence and disregard for customers is absolutely unacceptable. I would strongly advise others to think twice before ordering from this stall. Shocking quality and service. Not even deserve a STAR!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110017444865894451259/reviews

YL,1,"I was there around 5 am, the shop was open with the lights on, and someone was inside.  I planned to just grab some takeaway duck rice, but they refused to serve me and were incredibly rude. If they're open but not selling food, they should just close.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102861132130685552631/reviews
Kwong Fei Yee,4,"Ordered roasted chicken rice. Good soft and tender roast chicken rice. Taste is good. Rice is fragrant. The sauce can be better. Looking for the sweet savory and fragrant sauce which was missing.

Overall nice.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118030178376808365901/reviews
