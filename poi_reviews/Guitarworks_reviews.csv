Ryu Khor,5,"It's been a pleasure learning guitar journey with Alan. He shows great patience with me and always provide advice to me whenever I encounter problem during my learning. I'm a slow learner and does not have a strong foundation in guitar, but Alan will always slow down to explain to me when I'm in doubts and encourage me during the lesson.

It's always my dream to be able to play my favorite song using a guitar. Although I'm still in the process of achieving that goal, but every small improvement I made and new things I learn from the lesson, let me know that it's leading me to that goal. I really enjoyed my lesson with Alan and would recommend to anyone that want to start their guitar learning journey.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111115613254906857300/reviews

Joe Yap,5,"I started my beginner's lesson with Alan - with some songs I would like to play. Alan was very accommodating and after 10+ lessons, I was able to play many pop songs, including the ones I requested. Extremely knowledgeable in guitar, Alan has totally no airs and guided beginner like me patiently from zero to hero. His lesson plan is systematic yet flexible enough to cater to anyone. I look forward to every guitar lesson and would like to thank Alan for the amazing experience and friendship. I recommend Guitarworks to anyone who likes to pick up guitar as a hobby or to perfect your guitar skills.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111833439200984936772/reviews
