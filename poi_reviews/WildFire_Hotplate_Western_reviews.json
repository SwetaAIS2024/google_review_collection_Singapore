The flambe effect didn't cost an arm and leg (booo inflation) and the dishes were tasty!üî•üî•üî• The Signature Crispy Chicken Cutlet had the most satisfying crunch when I bit into skin. The tender fillet in the signature chicken chop packed impeccable flavor. Probably had a solid brine! We all loved the black pepper sauce that went with the steak and the Spicy Bolognese  was INSANELY GOOD! They've managed to get me to LIKE their bolognese even though I hate tomato-based pasta. TEXTURE of the pasta was perfectüëåüèΩ",

Steak was overcooked and tough, I need to see a dentist after this. The chicken chop is partly burnt. It‚Äôs a lazy and poorly ran shop that has unusually high rating. Pls do not be fooled and avoid at all cost! I had to apologise to my family for the lousy selection of our dinner based on google review, u can‚Äôt believe what u see until u tried it, and believe me it‚Äôs that bad.",

They poured their signature fire sauce and I could taste the sweetness of it over my burger patty and tater tots which gave it a sweet tangy flavour. Loved it.\n\nWould return to try their pasta. Owner is very friendly.",
