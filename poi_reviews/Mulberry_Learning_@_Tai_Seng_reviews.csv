Andy Ea,5,"Mulberry Taiseng lives up to what it promises. In terms of learning, we have witnessed our child grow since he first started a few months back- from not being unable  to utter a proper word to forming a sentence now at PN level! In terms of learning through fun, our little one looks forward to school everyday with smiles! Thankful for the dedicated team of teachers who are so nurturing and caring all the time!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115039101409629194508/reviews

More importantly, despite being in the PN class for only a few months, he is able to speak many new words- definitely a pleasant surprise!
