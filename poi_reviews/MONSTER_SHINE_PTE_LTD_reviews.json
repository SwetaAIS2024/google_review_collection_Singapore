      "text": "My husband and I reached out to Zach when we saw the car that we wanted. Went to view it on 23/6, had the car inspected at our workshop two days later and yesterday, 1/7 we finally brought the car back home. All in all it was a very smooth and professional transaction. Zach is easily reachable and always ready to serve and attend to any concerns or enquiries that we have. Seeing the urgency of our situation, he did what he had to do and met our expectations. Hand over was pleasant, and whatever issues that were raised prior to the handover were all taken care of. Be sure to look for Zach for your car-related needs!",

It was my first time to sell through consignment and I did not know the procedures, especially handing over the car while not having received all the money. Zach explained in detail and patiently and immediately. His professional business conduct is remarkable and ensured me that the deal will be done to my satisfaction.\nFrom the first meet-up to closing the deal he was very attentive to my questions. He also kept viewing to a limit and the deal was concluded quickly. I achieved my desired price, thanks to his convincing negotiations with the potential buyers.\nI can recommend Zach to anyone who has any car related topics. For me, I will not look for another consignment agent again.",

      "text": "One day I received a surprise call from Monster marketing on my car ads in sgcarmart and was quite skeptical at first of their services they have offered me but after hearing their services I decided to give it a try on my consignment after 2 follow up calls from them.\nSo by fate, Austin and Brandon happened to be my sales agent. They have being through a series of episode of challenges in selling my car, however Austin and Brandon has went extra miles to get those challenges addressed in order to get my car transacted and able to pass over the car successfully to the next buyer. It was not easy for them neither for me as well but we work together and they demonstrated their professionalism on their commitment to me.\nI much appreciated their excellent services towards me. Thank you Austin & Brandon!",
