      "text": "Located just a stone's throw away from the MRT station, Springleaf Prata Place @ Springleaf is a hidden gem thatâ€™s definitely worth checking out. This was my first time dining here, and I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. The prata was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside â€” very satisfying and fulfilling.\n\nThe variety of dishes available was impressive, and everything was served hot and fresh. The curry was decent too â€” not overly spicy, with a good balance of flavors that complemented the prata well.\n\nThe staff were friendly and the service was fast, even though the place was quite busy. Itâ€™s clear why this spot is popular with both locals and visitors.\n\nDefinitely coming back again â€” canâ€™t wait to try more items from their menu next time!",

With egg literally oozing out of the prata and the mozzarella cheese was a good amount of satisfaction for me... a cheese fan\n\nPrice was reasonable, the usual prata reataurant pricing (my husband was the one paying ðŸ˜… so I don't remember)\n\nWe went on Sunday 11ish... brunch time... house was full\n\nDefinitely worth considering if you are passing near... this quiet and peaceful neighbourhood",
