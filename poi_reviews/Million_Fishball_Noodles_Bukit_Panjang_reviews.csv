Weixiong ng,5,Very very very nice ba chor mee. Ask for extra vinegar and extra chill and the whole bowl of noodle taste so delicious!! Added the meat ball soup and it is so good! Will definitely visit again.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110653233575045106316/reviews
MrHoopies,3,"meatball noodles were reasonable but meatballs tasted weird for me.
Average fish dumplings soup , goes well with chilli from prawn noodle stall",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109198891764183999072/reviews
Roger Ng (iUnspoken),3,"It deserves to be called out that the minced pork in the bakchormee is pre-cooked.
You decide for yourself if you wanna have that.
The sauce mix makes up for that though.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112136902182918253601/reviews
Jason Ong,4,"One of the better fishball and minced pork noodles in Bukit Panjang. The fishball is bouncy and nice. The chilli sauce goes very nicely with the noodles, especially when vinegar is added. You can add as much condiments especially the fried shallots and spring onion as you like. Great for a quick and fuss free meal.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101337983538091125134/reviews
