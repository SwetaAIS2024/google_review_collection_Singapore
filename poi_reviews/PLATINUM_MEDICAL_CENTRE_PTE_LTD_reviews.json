They have their own X-ray machine and clinic is in a quiet part of Yishun, some queue but this is normal. Doctors and staff are extremely patient and friendly.  They bother to explain what's  going on rather than merely prescribe MCs and medication leaving you ignorant of your condition.  Highly recommend.",

      "text": "Visited this clinic, hoping to have a straightforward blood test done for a health screening, but was incredibly disappointed by the experience. FIRSTLY, this wasn’t even my first time here, I came last week for the same blood test and despite poking my arm and wrist several times, they said my vein was too small and I was asked to come another day. (Which is today) AND TODAY, same shit again. What’s worst is, the doctor is the one doing the blood test for me. Isn’t this just a very BASIC procedure? If they AT LEAST apologised for it, I wouldn’t be so pissed off. But instead of apologising for it they were constantly citing various reasons like oh my vein were small, I didn’t drink enough water etc, does that mean everyone with small veins have to be poke countless times for a BASIC blood test?  If you’re looking for a clinic where even simple medical tests can be done, this is not the place to go. I won’t be returning and would suggest looking elsewhere for more reliable care.",
