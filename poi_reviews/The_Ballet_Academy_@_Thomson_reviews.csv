Zann SSH,1,"Regards to the refundable deposit for my child who has attended 2 terms since last year.

We have no choice but to stop her class as we are moving to the west which will be very inconvenient for me to bring my child to the class at Sin Ming or Toa Payoh.

I have notified your staff in school on 14th January 2023 that my girl could not continue the new term which is in February 2023.

And I also asked for the refund of $200 refundable deposit. But the staff told me that she can’t as we didn’t give the school 1 month notice period.

Then I told her how about $100 since I only give you 2 weeks notice. She has rejected me and said that the management decision.

First of all, we are not aware of the new term starts in February.  And she claimed that this was informed in late
December 2022 when the school was closed during that period.

I really hope the management should look into this. This amount should be refundable as our new place is too far from your current location which will take us more than 1 hr to travel to your school to attend 45 minutes lesson and another hour to travel back home.

And the first week of January. My daughter didn’t attend the class too. Please reply me soon.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108971689143011231966/reviews
