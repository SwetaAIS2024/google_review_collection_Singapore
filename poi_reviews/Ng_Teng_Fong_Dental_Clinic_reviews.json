      "text": "Worst ever customer service who attend on patients needs. Ms Liza, u need to have basic customer service and have more empathy as you working in healthcare especially dental. Patients comes in with severe pain. Dental pain can cause pain all the way to brain. Waited from 850am, turned off at 1230 and ask to come back at 1.23 by  nurse Huda to reach at 1.45 is ridiculous. At 4.05 attended by doctor , x ray machine was already off n doctor doesnâ€™t even know how to operate one. So obvious all is preparing to pack up for the day. Need the nurse to come in n on the machine; and all she can do was to gv painkiller as the dental has no such speciality. Wasted my whole day in your clinic.",

Enough said.",
