Menu and electronic versions were in a different sequence, as well as items being called different names or placed in a different category.\n\nPlain boiled beef, cubed, served with a watered down demi-glaze poured over. Meat still tough and tastes irony.\n\nSouffle Egg Katsu Curry though beautiful to look at, the group agrees that a runny egg omelette in the dish will look just as amazing and score much better in the taste department.\n\nThe number of desserts ordered by other table around us, made us wonder if Hoshino is better known for their coffees and desserts???\n\nGiven the quality of food... pricey.",

The whole place was empty and I asked for a sofa seat and was rejected, yet they gave the sofa seats to others...who are foreigners caucasian?? And the reason staff gave was: IT IS LUNCH TIME. The nerve! Not only that, staff purposely placed a RESERVED SIGNAGE after I was being rudely declined for that sofa seat when it was clearly not reserved and the whole place was EMPTY! Pictures dont lie… So rude! This is the last time I am coming. Good luck to your business",
