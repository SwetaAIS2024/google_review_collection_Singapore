Stanley Ler,5,"Food was good, service was excellent, place was airy with the mrt style gigantic fan. Standard item price 9s $2.50. 3adults1kid $63 alacarte order, super full. Hidden gem. I would say one of the best at amk. Many mookata around amk are overcrowded, stuffy and hot. This place is so much better. Opens at night. Highly recommended.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105245245817869002111/reviews
Tanko Jiak,3,"Great place to gather with buddies with grill meat selections, slightly different item from the usual mookata places. Another plus is the area has great ventilation no grill smell after the session. Very sincere owner serving. The homemade chilli adds in the kick, luscious dipping chilli fish sauce tangy. Industrial hidden treasure. Plus the canteen serve good range of beers to go with! Cheers!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101417658669432380086/reviews
Mike Lim,5,"Went on Friday with my friends. Great service from the staff & boss. Love the marinated pork & chicken, it's yummy! Big fan at the area which made the place well ventilated.

Ivan Lee,5,If you wanna enjoy dining in peace without seeing crowds of grumpy faces in shopping malls this is one of the places where you can enjoy grilling delicious marinated meat in a spacious venue without smelling smokey yourself after you finished a sumptuous meal.

Sim Zhi Wen,5,"Well ventilated with loads of table around. Hidden but definitely not inaccessible. Auntie and uncle singing and dancing makes it the local kampung spirit feel. Food is good and so is the beer!
