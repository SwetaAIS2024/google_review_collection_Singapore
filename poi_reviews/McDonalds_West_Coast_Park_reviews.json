      "text": "McDonald’s at West Coast Park is a spacious outlet and a great spot to grab a bite after enjoying the park. The food was good and consistent with what you'd expect from McDonald’s, and there was ample seating available, making it ideal for families and groups.\n\nHowever, the cleanliness could be improved — some tables weren’t cleared promptly, and the floors felt a bit sticky during our visit. The air conditioning also didn’t seem strong enough, making the place feel quite warm inside, especially on a hot day. Overall, a decent spot for a quick meal, but the dining environment could use better upkeep.",

      "text": "Dropped by this afternoon to get a strawberry sundae for my daughter. The location is great—right in West Coast Park, with a spacious layout offering both indoor and outdoor seating. There’s even a room for birthday parties and a drive-through.\n\nThat said, the experience at the collection counter was chaotic. It was a public holiday, so crowds were expected, but the order management system really struggled. A screen showed order numbers being prepared, but ready orders were just shouted out, which led to confusion and long waits. I saw quite a few frustrated customers.\n\nI imagine it’s a lot smoother on non-peak days, but if you’re planning to visit on a weekend or holiday, be prepared for a bit of a wait.",

But this does not prevent this from being a very good McDonald's restaurant. You can buy the food you want, sit down on the seats by the coast, and enjoy the food while watching the beautiful scenery from the west coast.",
