Jimmy Liaw,4,"New-ish shop. Lok lok is their specialty... but we wanted to try their ala carte M'sian dishes. Friendly boss lady. Free crackers whilst waiting for food.

Ordered KL Hokkien Mee, Penang Fried Kway Teow, BKT (dry), Herbal chicken, Muar Otak, Braised Lobak.

Generally pretty ok. Hokkien Mee had a nice smoky taste. Fried Kway Teow didn't quite have the wokhei but still acceptable. Otak was nice, quite authentic. Lobak quite close to Penang ones. Dry BKT and herbal chicken were so-so, nothing to shout about.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109624032060261463105/reviews
Gabriel Ignatius,4,"Food was okay, not too bad. Price was actually okay for buffet style for 2 hours. Quite a few variety of food and drinks, even have ice cream, chips and alcohol sold separately. Service was good just that the place was a bit warm and when you leave you will definitely have BBQ smell on you. Overall not too bad.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117467008655575718194/reviews
Cerise Sweet,5,"Newly renovated! Is so much nicer now and the owner is really friendly. As usual the satay sauce is really good with the lok lok.
You can have best of 3 worlds here. Boil, fry and deep fry and I feel is worth the money!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106488736289174935319/reviews
Eileen Neo (Sgsohotleh),4,"Borders close but you can consider dropping by this place for some Malaysia Lok Lok! I feel it‚Äôs quite authentic. They offer fried and steamed Lok Lok dishes. Thumbs up for their fried Lok Lok dishes, it was delicious.

Crowded but the staffs were still very attentive to every request of customers. Lots and lots of selection, the prawns were really huge, and it‚Äôs peeled! Favorite items included fried crab stick, sliced abalone, luncheon meat, enoki mushroom, cheese tofu and satay! Occasionally, the staffs will also go around serving fried items like seaweed chicken, satay, nuggets, chicken wings, fried tofu skin and etc.

Very satisfied after eating and 3 of us in total drank 9 cups of drinks!! For the buffet, it includes free flow of drinks, from hot beverages to canned drink, and even home made drinks like ice lemon tea and lime juice.

Note: Buffet is for 2 hours! Ice cream is also served at the end. üëçüèº",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114986102670574642770/reviews
Hua Mulan,5,"Comfort Food ! Love the simplicity both of the restaurant and the food. Quality is good and clean. Occasionally Chef will serve you satay and chicken wings and some happening pork strips all deep fried ! Yummy! Buffet served at $25-26 per pax, comes with free flow drinks, ice cream, coffee and also crackers! You can choose your items and just let it boil or put a white peg on the plate to note that you want them deep fried . Look for Kelly who manages e restaurant there. Totally cheerful and nice. Wish there were more outlets like these. Pure and simple everytime !",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101197150496755553670/reviews
