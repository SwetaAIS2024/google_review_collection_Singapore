Joshua Chew,5,"Overall food was delicious and nice. There's You Tiao to accompany the porridge. Fresh Ingredients were used. Overall, delicious food, but the price is not really friendly... Quite expensive for porridge but slightly too expensive. Used to be pretty cheap long ago. But it's still very hard to find porridge nearby so no complaints.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100928805220966571942/reviews

Vina,5,"Called them to find out that their opening hours are 6 am to 2 pm.  Had takeaway for century egg lean meat porridge (皮蛋瘦肉粥) and sliced fish meat ball porridge (鱼片肉丸粥). The Cantonese porridge texture is just right with smooth cotton feel (綿綿的). Sliced fish is fresh and white, each slice with equal size. Pork meatballs are handmade. Youtiao used the right flour. It is crispy and not oily.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116951596760433657524/reviews
