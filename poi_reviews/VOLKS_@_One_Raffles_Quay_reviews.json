Pricing confusions (bordering on scammy) abound below.\n\nStore is in a challenging location: high football but numerous competitors with lower priced offerings within 5-minute walk.\n\nPricing confusion #1: banner advertised 10% cashback, but I didn‚Äôt get any cashback.\nPricing confusion #2: batch brew in store (chalkboard) was listed at 4.50/5.50 but the electronic board and online listed at 5.00/6.00.",

Super under-rated place for sure. (I do recommend trying them HOT to feel the ultimate MATCHA oomph üçµüçÉ).\n\nAlso, their new space looks amazing. It is spacious and comfortable. They are now open till late, as they serve cocktails and beers in the evening.\n\nImportantly, great service from Will and Megan as always!",

      "text": "Not a great first experience, probably will not return ever.\nStaff here are unnecessarily curt and rude, their attitude, chitchatting and lack of training really shows. Makes you feel like you owe them a living.\nThe signage for where to order is really unclear. Wouldn't it make more sense to put the cashier area nearest to the entrance? Or at least put a sign saying ORDER HERE. Instead of some vague, unclear sign saying order over there, followed by collect here. If you can put a sign saying collect here, you can put a sign saying order here.\nNo sleeves for hot drinks provided.\nThe quantity of the drink here is honestly little and so expensive, compared to say the cafe at Marina One or Huggs (which are miles better). The drink is also lacking in any flavour. There are better cafes with better service staff and better drinks elsewhere in the area. I can't understand why people patronise. Avoid.",
