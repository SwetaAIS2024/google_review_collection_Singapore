Ray Tan,4,Itâ€™s a chain roast meat stall. Probably nth to do with andy lau. Their charsiew is pretty gd and also reasonably priced. I ordered from them a couple of times before. A single portion charsiew+roast pork rice with egg is only $4.80. Damn..the price for the current state of economy is considered quite reasonable alr. I often takeaway 200gm of charsiew for my fam which costs $10. 1kg costs $45. They also have this Dangui roasted duck which iâ€™m tempted to try next. Itâ€™s something v quintessential msian. Dianxiaoer is known for it as well. But a whole duck here is only $45. Really not bad at all for a chain!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118226053308108066808/reviews
S W,5,"Bought char siew and roasted chicken rice. Looking at how char is thr char siew. Totally inedible. Threw all of them. Thin sliced chicken. Gave 3 stars for the polite staff, thats all. I would definitely ask for exchange if i was eating there. Waste of money",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102519844501473642211/reviews
daniel quek,1,"Ordered 1 duck rice and 1 chicken rice with egg. Paid $9.40 for it.

Got a shock when I opened it at home, just plain rice and sauce! NO CHICKEN AND EGG! First time such a thing happened in my life! Totally a scam shop. Beware!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116258809003413347094/reviews
Mr Wang Wang,3,"Expensive, asked for lean meat, they give fatty and lean.

Oby Ong,1,The staff attendant on 20 Feb ard 1:35am  was black face and rude just because he was cleaning up the stall. He impatiently shunned off customer in this appalling behavior.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116964649384045056310/reviews
