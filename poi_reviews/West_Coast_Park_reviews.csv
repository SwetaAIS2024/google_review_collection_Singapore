It’s a great location for family outings, gatherings with friends, or simply enjoying nature. On weekends, it can get quite busy with many small groups gathering for picnics, celebrations, or just relaxing under the trees. We recently visited for an Aluth Avurudu ceremony, and it was a memorable experience despite some unexpected weather.\n\nThe park has a calm and peaceful environment, filled with trees and birds, making it ideal for nature lovers. You can even see ships and boats out at sea, as one side of the park is right by the water. There’s also a small beach area, which adds to the charm and gives kids a chance to explore.\n\nThere are plenty of exercise areas and a large play area for children, so it’s definitely a child-friendly place. Many people also bring tents and camp overnight, which seems to be quite popular here. If you enjoy camping, this is a great spot to try it out—but one thing to keep in mind is the lack of sheltered areas. During our visit, it started raining heavily, and there was no proper cover for rain or thunder. That’s something that could definitely be improved for the safety and comfort of visitors.\n\nOne highlight is the large McDonald’s located in the park. It’s easily accessible, and a lot of visitors stop there to grab a bite, especially with kids.\n\nOverall, West Coast Park is a great place to relax, play, and enjoy the outdoors, but if you’re planning to stay long or camp, do keep an eye on the weather and prepare for rain. Still, it’s definitely a place worth visiting!', 'languageCode': 'en'}","{'text': 'West Coast Park is a huge and beautiful green space in Singapore that offers something for everyone.
