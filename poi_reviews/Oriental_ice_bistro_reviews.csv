Big Willie,5,"Not a very prominent place. However, the Bingsu tastes great. Not crowded at all. Maybe it is a weekday.

Would recommend others to coke for the desserts.

Atmosphere might not be that great but I will still be back to try their pizzas. Hopefully, it will be equally good ðŸŒŸ",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106109863968118682802/reviews
