Shuffling between two of the popular rides with extra long queues, we decided to head to the Jurassic Park Rapid Adventure, a water ride that takes us through a series of rapids with some thrilling drops and amazing animatronics.  After braving the queue We strapped ourselves in the round bumpy boat and cascaded down to the rapids that took us across some curious onlooking animatronic dinosaurs only to speed up and enter a tunnel which took us up a few level with raising water levels, to realize a T-rex waiting on top of the tunnel roaring, thrilling but expected.  There were designated seats which were marked that you will get wet and we steered clear off that, even though we had secured our valuables in a paid locker.  We mildly got wet and exited out of the ride thinking if it was worth the wait of more than an hour.  What was interesting was a set of blow drying chambers (refer to the picture) that will help you get dry within minutes, such a convenience after this water ride, so we headed that way only to realize the charge associated with it and we skipped.  Without much thought we did not want to waste more time so we queued up for the next ride, the Canopy Flyer, that was a hanging roller coaster that took us for a birdseye view of the Jurassic world, it was fun with a few drops and twists and turns, but again made us wonder was it worth all the wait of over 40 minutes.
