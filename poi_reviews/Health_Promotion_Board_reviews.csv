Angie Lee,2,"This place Wholesome cafe is always very humid, the fan for dining area not working. The 3 guys handling the cafe today are not good. Extra charged 20c for brown rice, end up no brown rice but no refund. Prices not reasonable.

People visiting this place got no choice but to dine at this bad cafe.

7-11 inside got better varieties but no seats.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109975262252256458626/reviews

Benjamin Lim,1,"I feel really sorry for the employees and public that eat here. The service is awful with a rude, Chinese lady that shouts orders and forgot to give me my siew mai.
When I asked, she said she had given 4 siew mai to someone and acted like I was lying. However once I saw the siew mai I wished it had gone to someone else! Just look at the colour and form.
My Mee Siam was tasteless and watered down with a layer of oil on top. Laksa and Mee Soto were edible.
The two fans on the wall are badly positioned and do nothing for the people sitting at the tables. Surely we can do better!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106803328820254331761/reviews
Backyard Xplorer,3,It next to singapore dental center. It easier to find parking here if you are visiting main sgh. At the lobby there a cafe kiosk call wholesome. The tea is ok but not the mee siam. Find the gravy too watery and not much taste.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102260626085916018032/reviews
Florence Lee,1,"Some of the nurses deployed to School Health Service dept are not well equipped to take on students with special needs at special education schools.

I told one of the nurses at the vaccine administering station that I will be back in 10 minutes to fetch my students back to their class while they were monitoring the students post-vaccination, but yet they told my students to ""go find your teacher"", resulting in a wild goose hunt around the school. How can nurses be entrusted with the students' health if they can't work with external stakeholders to ensure the students' basic safety?

Poorly trained staff, a lack of SOP and accountability in the School Health Service, Youth Preventive Services Division. Utterly disappointing.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114497413808403602053/reviews
