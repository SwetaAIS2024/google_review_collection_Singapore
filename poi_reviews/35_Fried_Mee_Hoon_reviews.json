Besides nasi lemak rice, they have fried bee hoon. I love their otak and yu liu (flat fish cake) and their sweet nasi lemak chilli. The chilli was so popular that they’ve started charging if you want more.",

Fried fish cake was also good.\n\nThe chilli pairs well with the noodles and ingredients.\n\nOrdered fried noodles + fried egg + fried luncheon meat + fried fish patty on 4 Nov 2024 for S$3.00. This is really VFM (value for money).",
