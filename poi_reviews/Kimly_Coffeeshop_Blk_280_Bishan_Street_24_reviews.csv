TTT,4,"I ordered the Assam fish tail and really enjoyed it. It had a nice sour and tangy kick, full of flavor. The fried chicken was crispy and paired perfectly with the sauce, which was delicious. The spinach with three eggs, however, was a bit too soupy for my taste.

Service was great! The three ladies taking my order were very patient and attentive.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117174446031825028588/reviews
Jimmy YEO,1,"Fish soup and porridge stall, one of the Atar stall among all and in any coffee shop. Fish soup is nice, but it's less Fish and it's Very expensive.  Less than 10 pieces and small pieces.  $15 plus $0.70 rice. In fact i ordered another type of rice, but I think the staff just repeated what she has to say of getting customers to order, and dun really listen to what we order. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Will NOT recommend it to come as it's Really expensive.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102792564288426657922/reviews

Norman Oh,1,Always no seats because 4 to 5 tables are used to store items displaced by the store owners. Is this even hygienic? It's like their permanent store room for food outside of their stores,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114820933557464357091/reviews

There is this existing noodle stall(by ding ji) aka ban mian(formerly used to sell yellow soup noodle and also mixed pork congee. BOTH ALSO NICE! Especially the yellow noodles soup reminds me of mum's old sch noodles, which unable to get it at any food stall in spore.  Visited regularly before and during covid period. But then 2.5yrs ago suddenly removed *Yellow noodles* instead replaced it with ""ban mian flour noodles*, Not good, lost it characteristic. Since then my family and i had stopped buying. Recently hubby try to buy the noodles, soup still ok *BUT Overall taste is lost..taste typical Cheena chinese ban mian, sigh!*
