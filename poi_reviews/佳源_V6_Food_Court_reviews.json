Blamed me saying that I never tell him I want it to be fully cooked.\n\nBought from Sin xiang kee teo Chew noodle",

Reserved a table on Friday for Mother‚Äôs Day 6.30pm reached before 6.30pm our table was taken by other people and then that table and our table ordered food around the same time. BUT their food came one by one while we waited for 1hr 30 mins + and there‚Äôs was no sign of food.. asked 3 times and told us was still cooking‚Ä¶ great ! And then the last time I asked they told me the same thing again and I said I don‚Äôt want it anymore.. they told me to wait a little longer ? That‚Äôs crazy‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt risk, go other place eat, waiting here drives you crazy :) Everyone else got their food except us.. will never support again",
