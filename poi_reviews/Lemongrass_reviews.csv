Ariane Lee,4,"Pad Thai is too dry..

Air conditioning seemed to be down, stuffy..

Sauces are great, especially the chilli sauce with lemongrass in it üòã. = unique.. üëç

Highly recommend the Royal Platter, with beef, fish, chicken, papaya salad, stir fried kai lan, and meatballs. Beefü•© is medium well, though dry but still tasty, especially with the sea salt sprinkled on it, as recommended by the staff.

Overall, great food at great prices.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117877079331541216890/reviews
fearrow,4,"Brought my family to Lemongrass Thai Restaurant in Serangoon. We ordered the 4-6 pax meal, and the portions were huge! Every dish was flavorful and cooked to perfection, with authentic Thai tastes that we all enjoyed.

The food was delicious overall, and the best part? The price was very reasonable, especially for the generous portions.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114871863174076338408/reviews
Nur Muhammad,5,"Value for Money hidden gem in Hougang. Thai halal food in Hougang Rivercourt.

They have budget friendly family platter as well as ala carte servings.

My personal favourite is the Garlic Lime Steamed Fish. It goes well with any accompaniments that you order.

For this visit, I tried the new ribeye fried rice. The flavour is more towards a western approach, with the steak being infused with truffle oil.

The kailan and kangkung is faultless. Well seasoned and not overcooked.

Had the clear tomyum soup as well. It's clean tasting, could do with a little more galsngal and lemongrass.

Overall shiok is experience. Consistently returning here for makan",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113491723560637434727/reviews
Clarence Ow,4,"Thai restaurant located within the HDB blocks. The shop is huge and can accommodate quite a number of people.

The sambal fried sea bass is great. You can happily enjoy the sambal without afraid that it could be too spicy. It goes well with the fish.

The spinach with fried bean curd is something quite rare in Thai cuisine and is good to have. However, the fried beancurd appears to be too bland. I would suggest sprinkle some salt on the beancurd before stir frying.

The Tom Yum soup came in metal pot, which is rather interesting. Tom Yum soup are always a comfortable dish in Thai cuisine.

Overall, the dished are cooked deliciously and it is considered cheap, on top of no GST and service charge. Will try their other dish next time.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112234615480628100933/reviews
Ray Asyara,4,"We called for bkgs being a Mothers' Day. However they said just come n walk in but whn we arrived they asked if we hd made prior bkg. Poor coordination !
Table too small to accomodate all the dishes tht we ordered. Partly the food were placed in BIG plates. So much so tht we have to share it on our individual eating plates first to remove thm.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114524150125093079300/reviews
