Yap Hoe BENG,5,"All the dessert is good. The ice kaching was great. We often try whenever we visit Adam’s desserts. The pretty lady is very friendly and she will give you the prefect dessert if you asked her - hot or cold.
Again come in for a hot Tao Suan. One of the best.
Feb 25, desserts again.

Sarah Yap,5,"Superior ice kachang! Up till now I thought all ice kachang were equal but no…
The shaving is finer, the ingredients are great quality and the flavouring is not too sweet. Will have it again when I am in the area.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110555926324846674548/reviews

Daniel Bok,5,"We had the Ching Teng both hot and cold. They were both good, exactly what you’d expect of the dessert. The only downside was I thought the portion is a tad too small for the price.

The shop owner is super friendly and doesn’t rush you to order. And they open till late!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114835379352368094009/reviews
Saifu Angto,5,"So far the best ice kachang I've had in Singapore.  It's traditional and very generous amount of shaved ice and toppings.  The ching teng and green bean sago are also amazing.

Great and fast service, and a very reasonable price!  It's been my goto place for nice cold desserts on a hot day, or after a walk at the Singapore Botanic garden.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews
