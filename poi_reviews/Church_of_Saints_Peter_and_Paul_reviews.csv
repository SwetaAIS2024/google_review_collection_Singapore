Herabelle Febhe Ceniza,5,"We attended the anticipated Mass, known as the Sunset Mass, at 5:30 PM. The lay ministers were incredibly kind and welcoming, especially toward my restless toddler, who was running around before the service began. The priest delivered a meaningful and heartfelt homily. Overall, the church had a warm and inviting atmosphere, making us feel truly welcome.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115947417288875391932/reviews
Edlyn Rina D'Souza,5,"One of the beautiful churches I hv seen
It's looks like a chapal small in size
But the design , architecture is so vintage
You can feel the presence of God in the church.
Not crowded during the weekdays
Definitely get to see lot of relics in the church of some of the saints",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118395035512205774003/reviews

Don Chan,5,"A beautiful Catholic church built in 1870 and recently renovated and refurbished, now with air-conditioning. It is easily accessible with the Bras Basah MRT station just a stone's throw away.
The altar is amazing to behold and a such a holy place to celebrate the Eucharist.
The Priests and Altar boys celebrated the Mass reverently and the choir sang with angelic voices, both in English and Latin hymns.
Abundant use of myrrh and frankincense helped to create a most serene and holistic ambience as we worshipped and lifted our prayers & petitions up to heaven.

Highly recommended to anyone who seeks peace, serenity and calm in their lives. Come and let Jesus share in your burdens and offer you rest, for his yoke is light.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117222767785140837652/reviews
