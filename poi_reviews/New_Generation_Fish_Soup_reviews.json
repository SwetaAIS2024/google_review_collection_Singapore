Can see this stall is a labour of love with its generous fillets of fresh batang bursting with notes of omega 3. Love the no msg broth with lots of coriander and spring onions. Very hardworking young boss who shuttles between this stall and his parents' cze char stall in the late afternoon. Support ‚≠êüí™ this stall is a gem.",
