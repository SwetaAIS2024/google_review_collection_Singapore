      "text": "After spending 6 long years(my Daughter as well as Parent witness her development & happenings around my daughter).\nThis is a VERY Good School.\nAs far as Educational Subjects concerns.\nI have met the English Teacher when my girl was in her first 3 years and still my girl will often mention her name(meaning this teacher has had a Very Positive impact on my girl).\n\nThe Principal - Mr.Dennis Yap.\nIs always seen appearing in the morning along the side entrance(most students & parents approaches from this side entrance's gate).\nMatter of fact,he silently created this opportunity to get himself \"Be Presence\" to the students as well as parents.\nI sometimes walk to him and give some of my feedbacks or simply a short chats with Mr.Dennis Yap. (A warm & friendly personality that I find him approachable,good listener & pleasant. Thank you Mr.Dennis Yap 🙇🙇😍😍).\n\nToday, 23Nov2022(Wed).\nMy girl, P6 PSLE RESULT is out.\nShe has An 【AL-11】.\nWe are very proud for her and her hard work.\nDefinitely very thankful for all the Great Efforts combined together from her TEACHERS OF PUNGGOL COVE PRI SCHOOL & THE LEADERSHIP OF PRINCIPAL.\nWELL DONE AND GOOD JOB.\n【This is the 2nd Graduate P6】\nAnd also the 2nd Batch(1st Batch/P6 was in Nov/2021) who experienced the new AL Scoring System for Secondary Posting】.\n\nHope some of these sharing would help others when deciding where to send your child to....
