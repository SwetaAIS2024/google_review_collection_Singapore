      "text": "As it was difficult to find Malay stalls in Ang Mo Kio, especially around my area at block 30*, I googled & found out about this Malay stall, Rosnah's Family Kitchen, at Blk 628. The reviews about this stall were quite good, hence I proceeded to try it out. Well, it does meet its reputation as an affordable & good Malay cuisine. It has quite a range of dishes that even look enticing. I ordered a plate of rice topped with chicken in spicy coconut gravy, sambal brinjal & fried egg that was quite cheap compared to some other stalls that I went to &, well, to put it simply, it was good & tasty, unsurprisingly! I would definitely come again & would recommend it to my relatives & friends. The service was outstanding, the servers were good, friendly & wasn't stingy with the servings. They even banter with their customers whenever they are not busy. I even took some pictures of them! I would recommend this stall to those who want to have their hungry stomach filled with sumptuous Malay dishes that are tasty & affordable üëçüëçüëç.",

      "text": "The Nasi Padang here is not bad and reasonably priced. I bought two sets of Nasi Padang with a total of 7 dishes (3 meat, 3 veggies, 1 fish cake) + another 2 fried chicken on the side for $20.50. This is considered quite reasonable for Nasi Padang today. In many other places, $10 will get you 1 meat and 2 veggies.\n\nThe dishes are on the saltier side though so be sparing with the sauce. I added too much gravy and it was pretty salty. Quite sure my BP went up after the meal üòÇ.\n\nThe queue here can get quite long during weekend lunch hours.\n\nOverall, an acceptable place for Nasi Padang.",
