To make things worse, the rice was served early, so by the time the rest of the food arrived, it was cold.\n\nAs for the food itself, it was pretty average. The only standout was the roasted chicken, which was well-seasoned and flavorful. The vegetables, on the other hand, were coarsely cut into large, uneven chunks, making them difficult to eat.
