Matt Williams,2,"I visited wanting to pick up some pseudoephedrine to help with a nasty cold. It took a long and frustrating conversation with the shopworker for me to eventually work out that she couldn't help with this. Despite superficially looking like a pharmacy, they don't actually have a pharmacist, so can't dispense pharmacist-only medicines (or presumably prescriptions either).

I don't really understand the point of the store. If you need a pharmacist, you have to go elsewhere. If you just need off-the-shelf products, you might as well just get them at a supermarket.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117090274321985497853/reviews
