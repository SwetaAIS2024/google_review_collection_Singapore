Sky 2796,5,"If you love Maggie, this is your place to go! They even have fried Maggie cubes which has a cheesy centre! Fish grilled to perfection and chicken cutlet is juicy and tender. The Mash Potatoes and Kani Salad definitely can compare with upscale restaurants.

Friendly staff with good food! Will definitely come back again!!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100916236961147621906/reviews
Chuen Cain Seow,5,"We ordered the signature chicken chop, wagyu beef and fish cutlet. The maggie + meat combo work better than I thought. The noodle is not too salty and goes well with the soft boiled egg. The meat are of good quality esp. wagyu is juicy. Overall, it's a nice experience, nostalgic maggie mee and eye opening one for young senior like me, ha!

The price is reasonable w/o gst and svc charge. Its value for money.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111682574299236357230/reviews
BL,4,"Had a delicious fish cutlet with buttered corn The portion was generous, and the fish meat was surprisingly moist. Their mala noodles were on point! Fragrant, flavorful, and surprisingly not oily. Paired perfectly with the fish cutlet!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116928376425844840146/reviews
KohEeBingVEVO,5,"Decided to head down and try this western out after seeing it online. Definitely underrated. Noodles zeng-ed up with their own recipe, not full of msg kind 😋👍🏼. Mushroom soup can be improved though, a little grainy. Chicken 🐔 was well cooked and their coleslaw was yummy! Unique and finely chopped. Will support again 😋",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101130699787589328918/reviews
Nicolene,5,"Tried out this new shop, portions were super worth it, price very affordable, and taste is 💯

Also tried the mi nuggets, very interesting idea and flavourful also. Will definitely be back to try out other things in the menu.

Plus points to friendly owners who seem to be very keen on taking feedback 👍",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111711089858146704264/reviews
