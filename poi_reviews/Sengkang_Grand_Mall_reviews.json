I tried few times eating at the so claimed ‘biggest hawker centre’ . But Each time I felt made the wrong choice. Outside weather already hot. Look forward to a cool mall but not in Sengkang Grand mall. It's hot with poor ventilation. I pity those stall holders and wonder how they deal the such condition daily.",
