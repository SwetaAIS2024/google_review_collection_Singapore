Flo Yeow,5,"This is a solid hangout spot, especially after work. The sports bar has sufficiently good food, and drinks are great prices. Relative to all the other bars around the island, this one works out well enough for me. We came especially for the 5 pints of Guinness stout, for $50. Great friendly ladies waiting tables. Awesome energy and vibes with the patrons that come here for darts, food, and beer towers.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Kg Tan,4,"Nice setup.  3 in 1 combo, darts, pool and ktv, what more can we ask for.

Food are decent.  Fried pork belly and fried mushroom are tasty.

Cheese nacho isn't impressive tho.  Nachos are too thin, not enough crunch.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101653866876726623281/reviews
Thao Dao,5,"Looks dark from the outside, expect even darker inside. But the place surprised me with enthusiastic singers in karaoke, and really good food - meat lover pizza recommended. Come there expect nothing and you will be pleasantly surprised.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107287172926608120005/reviews
