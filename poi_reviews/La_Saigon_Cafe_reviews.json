      "text": "La Saigon Cafe, right at 914 East Coast Road in Singapore, has the BEST Vietnamese food around! Their pho is out of this world.\n\nThe Beef Pho is the real star - it's got juicy ribeye steak, tasty beef balls, and tender beef tendon all simmered for hours in a rich, aromatic broth. The flavors are SO deep and beefy, it'll blow your mind!\n\nThis little cafe has a super cozy, welcoming vibe, with both indoor and outdoor seating. The staff are super friendly and make sure you have a great time.\n\nBut pho isn't the only thing on the menu! They've also got killer sourdough banh mi sandwiches and crazy good drinks like Egg Coffee with rose petals - it's sweet, creamy, and unlike anything you've tried before.\n\nIf you love authentic Vietnamese food, you HAVE to check out La Saigon Cafe. Trust me, it's worth the trip! Their pho is the best in the area, hands down.",

      "text": "Our first visit here as we googled for good food in the area and was drawn by the good reviews. Simple comfy and relaxing setting and good coffee. Prices are slightly higher than the usual Vietnamese restaurant or cafe we went too but it is definitely value for money. Food quality is really good and savoury, the crunchy pork pho with light herbal fragrance is my favourite for today.  One of the best Vietnamese cafe in town I have gone to so far. Will be back again",
