      "text": "Came after realising it has been pushed a lot lately on fb forums.\n\n1stly, owners are not really as hardworking as what their supporters claimed in prep work. They even save cost on things like vegetables, beansprouts. They do have spring onions but help yourselves. But this works out fine for me i dont like beansprouts anyway.\n\nThey have lard and they will give you a generous amount after noodle is served if you ask for it, already given when aunty prepares with cloth pegs mixing the concoction.\n\nSadly its very bland, i cannot figure out if this is supposed to be healthy or not. On one hand the noodle you can taste all the grease, and yet it tasted bland, even when i ask for extra spicy, i think they put some ketchup too but extremely minimal, vinegar as well not much can be tasted.\n\nThe interesting thing is they fry their fishballs, 4.50sgd is smallest portion and they give you 2 fried fishball and 1 boiled with a lump of mince pork which is basically tastess and some extremely tough loin meat which is sliced thinly together with some fishcake.\n\nOverall not the best, not worth your trip there but i am very sure for people who drove its very convenient as there are lots of parking everywhere in abundance. Just not even a 20mins wait in my case is this worth it.",

It was well a bit sweet, saltiness, soured and chillis flavoured, thumbs up. Fish balls are fresh. Soup was tasty. Downside, the sliced pork too hard for me to chew. $5 for the bowl is reasonable.",

The unique thing is the chilli he uses, very different from other noodle stores. Coupled with the pork lard that is generously sprinkled at the end, makes for a very satisfying bowl of noodles. Highly recommended!!",
