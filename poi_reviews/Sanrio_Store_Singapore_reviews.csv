Yellow Bazz,5,"Positive experience at this store for my latest purchase, will definitely return.  Promoter (a young guy) was very helpful and courteous which is not often seen these days.

Ashriel Olimpo,5,"Quite the assortment of adorable and authentic Sanrio merchandise here. From plushies, to stationery, cutlery and even beddings, apparel and gadgets. The store is within Takashimaya near the toys section and it's prominently decorated so you can't miss it.

Although it can be rather pricey, with a Hello Kitty Face notepad going for $12 and a Cinnamoroll plush the size of a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 costing $54, but it is genuine stuff so I won't be too critical about it.

There's something for everyone here whether it's for kids to grownups, boys to girls. If you fancy something Sanrio, come here and be delighted with the assortment of Sanrio merchandise, but just be prepared to pay for what you want.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114599374019206613249/reviews
jeffrey lee,1,"Items are sold 3 times more expensive than in Japan. Customer service is non-existent, either no responses from both emails and messaging platforms or rude and sarcastic remarks from staff. Please be prepared that business ethics is unavailable, even if you spent enormous amount or regular customer. Because terms and conditions would be changed without prior notice and staff expect you, as customer to instantly understand the explanation once only.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112797039842126565429/reviews
sharad chaturvedi,3,"The store is okay, pretty small  and is on the top floor of the mall as a part of a larger dept store.

My daughter was not pleased with the attitude of the customer service lady, whose responses sounded snappy perhaps out of stress and tiredness (unfortunate but not the way to release stress)

Things were priced on the higher side (as it is in brand stores) so only go if you are truly a huge fan.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117324608546599538950/reviews
