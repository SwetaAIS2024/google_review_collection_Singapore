      "text": "When I first sent my child here, there were too many students compared to the number of teachers\nSo when I inquired at the academy, they made excuses like the teacher was temporarily absent... I felt like children other than those in rhythmic gymnastics were being neglected.\n\nBecause there were too few teachers, while some kids were learning gymnastics, the rest seemed to be left to their own devices, playing elsewhere.\n\nDespite it being close to home, I had to eventually stop sending my child here because of these issues.\n\nAND, It's been two months since I stopped, but I still haven't received my deposit back\nThey impose fees immediately when a student pays tuition late, but this academy has been breaking promises and withholding my deposit for two months despite having the money to give back to me\nso Bad !!!",
