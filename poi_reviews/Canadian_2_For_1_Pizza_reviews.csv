Logan Chiam,3,Pizza Is Just Ok.  I donâ€™t think its worth the price.  The pizza is very doughy and not much cheese or toppings.  Taste is a bit bland too.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107382594263605332876/reviews
Ashish Kumar,1,"We ordered 1 $10 Margerreta Pizza which shows Cheese and Tomatoes but believe me that pizza doesn't have cheese at all and one super small piece of tomatoe. It was just the dough only nothing inside it.

Never recommend to others and don't want to order again from the same place.

Domino's $5 Pizza is much better than this Canadian Pizza.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114205684869518885591/reviews
Mrs V,1,"Visited the outlet in Galaxis in May 2022. Food taste was sub-standard, not quite worth the price for frozen food being reheated. Female Indian staff was using the video call option on her phone and talking while customers were waiting outside. She did not bother to stop the call even while handing the customer their food. Can tell they do not take pride in customer service.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108727023332373440163/reviews
