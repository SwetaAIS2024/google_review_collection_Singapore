Tim Chin,1,"Being busy cannot justify pure rudeness. Collecting my Shopee parcel, I'm also a customer. When my turn came after a long queue, I was turned away. All the other shops I have collected from, operates on a first come first serve basis. Rudeness cannot be justified as I asked politely.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114084377095914449125/reviews

Sam Sum,1,"I went to collect the Shopee parcel. There were some people paying for the purchase. I walked toward another lady looking for the parcel. The shop keeper told me I can not come here to collect immediately after received the message with a grumpy tone.
I did not demand to get it immediately. I did not say anything.
I waited for him to served all the customers. Then, he asked for the pin and told me again I cannot come immediately. I told him calmly I did not come immediately. This was already one hour after the message. I also told him the message did not stated that I had to wait for two hours after the message received. Then, he told me he didn't have to give me the parcel and he could asked me to go home to come again.
He showed bad attitude even for a customer who never complain or demand anything.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102804617414873026725/reviews
Dylan Phua,5,"To all here to collect your parcel, please be patient and allow the uncle/auntie to sort our their primary business (the shop, which earns them more) before they assist you with parcels. If you wish to get your parcel asap, you can consider avoiding after school hours (about 11am - 4pm), where the shop gets a lot of student customers, who even shoplift at times if they get impatient, forcing the shop owners to be vigilant. The other review are not wrong, but they do not show the full story. If being patient is too difficult for you, consider doorstep delivery.

Dinie,1,"Will not choose them for my shopee collection again. Shop was empty, approached the unapproachable shopkeeper and said ""hi, i want to collect my 2 items from shopee"" and his exact reply is, in the rudest tone with no eye contact ""you don't need to tell me you want to collect how many items, you just tell me your pin or phone number"". Nvm. I let you ""makan"" me there and then, but YOU don't need to tell me all that, YOU just need to ask me for my phone number or pin. You don't want to do this job, then remove yourself from the platform. Nobody forced you to sign up for this or maybe your life is too boring that you need this platform to scold people for your entertainment. ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113496265645393667540/reviews
