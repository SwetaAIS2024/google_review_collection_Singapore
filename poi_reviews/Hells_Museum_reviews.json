I took my time and read everything there, it took me a little under an hour. I think this is a must-do if you are visiting Singapore and want to know more about Taoist practices and beliefs. They have a little bit on other religions as well, but it mostly focuses on Taoism.",

      "text": "Hmm.. one have to be open on how religions come about to visit this place otherwise, you may not benefit from this. Probably will not sit well with the overly religious people. But it's insightful on what happens after death especially on the punishment received depending on what bad thing one did. Good place to teach children (would say above 6) to do good, be filal, be respectful to elders etc.. if not there will be punishment in the afterlife. Figures are quite scary/gory for young kids. If one doesn't believe in the afterlife etc, please do not waste your time visiting this place.\nThere are mosquitos at the outdoor area, that is the reason for drop of one star. And the turtle pond/wishing well is not maintained with lots of surplus of food floating in the water.",
