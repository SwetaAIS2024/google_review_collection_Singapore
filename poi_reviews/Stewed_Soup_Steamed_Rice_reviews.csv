Wei Ming Chen,4,"Been eating here for many times already. Most of their soups and steamed rice menus are delicious with rich flavour.

Opening day is uncertain and some menus run out quickly, therefore less choice during dinner.

Price have gone up since then",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101609798020277519000/reviews
Jodeci Fine,5,"One of few stalls open till evening here and with a huge variety of #herbalsoups with special ingredients, steamed rice and fish at great prices.

1. Old cucumber pork ribs soup $3.50
2. Salted veg duck soup $4.50
3. Snow pear, sea coconut pork ribs soup $4
4. Sichuan veg pork ribs soup $4
5. Meat patty steamed rice $3.80
6. 梅菜扣肉饭 $3.80
7. Steamed carp fish head with black bean sauce $14

Soups were perfectly steamed with super soft ingredients and very flavourful soups. Rice is also delicious mixed with tasty sauce and generous toppings. Fish is steamed to order, big piece, very fresh and full of tender flesh.

Great choice for rainy weather!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105546009118925874250/reviews
Lee Wayne,5,"Super value for money in today’s context where prices are high everywhere. Quality stewed boiled soup with generous ingredients for as low as 3.50 to 5+ per portion. Their steamed rice is also highly recommended! It’s 5 stars in terms of value and I strongly suggest you come down to sims vista market and try it. They open around 1.30pm and will close on Sunday. Usually from 1.30-2.30pm there will be queue and some items will run out after 3pm.

This time we ordered 2x stewed soup, steam egg, sliced fish and claypot chicken rice. Total cost 21+ for so many dishes we had. Their steamed egg is really delicious too :) I think there’s better claypot rice than what they have here but for this pricing it’s still ok.

When I come to hawker with lower spending, I don’t think atmosphere is an important criteria so my rating does not take into account of environment and ambience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100765138613488056874/reviews

Josh Lim,5,Came here for dinner a few times already and they are always very crowded. But they serve quite fast so it’s alright. I like their claypot rice! Tried a few soups and all very nice. Not expensive too!,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100606910212221946176/reviews
