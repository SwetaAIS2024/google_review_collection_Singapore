Sandy Shum,5,"We came here to celebrate our girl's 12th birthday and were given a lovely round table. Service was excellent, with a warm personal touch from the staff. The menu offers a unique selection, and the food was served quickly and tasted great. The ambience is pleasant, family-friendly, and pet-friendly too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106380917396877023232/reviews
KK Lee,5,"Brought our puppy to Surrey Hills at Vivo for lunch today. Such a lovely experience, the servers are very attentive and made sure the puppy and we are always comfortable, from offering puppy water and treats, possible chair for puppy to sit on and regularly checking in with us, impeccable service!! Needless to say, the food at Surrey Hills is always yummy and on-point, we thoroughly enjoyed every dish and desserts. We ordered the Bolognaise, roasted garlic miso butter caserresi, red wine wagyu beef cheek pizza, truffle fries and sticky date pudding. Thank you to the awesome crew, Fara, Taryn, Lai and chefs Shyen and Shannan!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100073052587241266789/reviews
Eunice Heng,5,"Visited this cafe few days ago and I am surprised at how delicious the food is! Some reviews says the Hokkien Mee pasta is hit or miss, but I decided to give it a try anyway and it was so good, the pork lard made the soup sauce extremely tasty and the prawns are huge. We also ordered Mentaiko Cream Pizza and Tater tots they were delicious too. My favourite is actually their dessert Sticky Date Pudding, it’s actually like a brownie topped with ice cream, glazed with salted caramel sauce, there’s some crunchy bits in the brownie I loved it! Vibe of the cafe was very safari themed with animatronics (might be a little scary of young children haha).

Tips: do make a reservation in advance to avoid long waiting for seats.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102014512063568982325/reviews
Jay Chong Yen Jye (iamJayChong),5,"Love the vibe. Australia inspired.

Some Australia imported grocery is bonus.

Food portion is rather bigger than usual, good.

2 mains order can get 50% special drinks, ask first.

Serving speed is very fast, keep up the good work!

Love it!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110879689491163143205/reviews
S. Ong,5,"Surrey Hills Grocer – VivoCity (Pet-Friendly) is a delightful gem we recently discovered. This pet-friendly café offers a warm and inviting atmosphere, serving a variety of sumptuous Western dishes including pizzas, pastas, and more. The crab pizza was especially flavourful, and the spaghetti was perfectly cooked. We also ordered the chicken meatballs for our fur babies, which they thoroughly enjoyed.

The service staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming, adding to the overall pleasant experience. The café’s interior is beautifully decorated with a forest-inspired theme, featuring tastefully curated elements such as kangaroo figurines and other wildlife motifs that evoke a charming “wild jungle” ambiance.

Located at VivoCity, Level 3 near Lobby L, Surrey Hills Grocer is a highly recommended destination for pet lovers looking for a unique and relaxing dining experience with their little ones. Perfect for casual gatherings or a leisurely day out.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112140550004098914754/reviews
