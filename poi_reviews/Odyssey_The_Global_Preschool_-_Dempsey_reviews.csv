Fiona W,5,"My son loves going to school every day! The environment is fantastic—there’s a small forest at the back, providing a spacious outdoor area where children can explore and engage in various outdoor activities. The school makes great use of this space, ensuring that kids have plenty of opportunities to learn and play outside.
One of the things that impressed me the most is the teachers. They are all wonderful and truly care about the children. Every teacher greets each student by name, which was astonishing to me. With so many children in the school, it’s amazing that every teacher remembers all their names! It really shows the warmth and dedication of the staff.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113267571544894471941/reviews
Pooja Kanabar-Shah,5,"When I first came to see the Dempsey campus I was in awe of the beauty of the school, from the surroundings to the clean classrooms to the facilities and most importantly the always smiling, friendly faces of the staff. My son is so happy here - he can’t wait to go to school in the morning and literally have to drag him home at the end of the day!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112220767538726633817/reviews
Jennifer Hung,5,"Our son loves it here. I am particular about the early years and I have personally found Odyssey Dempsey to be one of the most nurturing schools around. We love the forest space and the children have the opportunity for outdoor forest play daily which is an incredible and rare find in Singapore. The pedagogy is well structured and well rounded. It is fun and yet academically rigorous. The emphasis is on learning through play. The staff are well selected and this truly shows, from the way they interact with individual kids, to classroom control, conflict etc. The ratio of teachers to students is one of the lowest in SG. There are also tons of floater teachers around to help. Particular shout out to Wei Lao Shi, Miss Tiffany, Lan Lan Lao Shi and Miss Isabel.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103158097158846047498/reviews
Peter Choo,5,"Kid has been attending for a while. The campus is beautiful, there's a lot of outdoor play and such a wide range of activities (music, cooking, PE, etc) that I don't feel any need to arrange anything else and we just have relaxed evenings and weekends.

Teachers are great and I can see my kid is really comfortable with them, showing them her true mischievous self when she's normally very shy around unfamiliar adults. She's eating / drinking / napping / growing / developing very well and I really couldn't ask for much more.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115373760294190083313/reviews
