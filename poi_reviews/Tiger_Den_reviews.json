Service was prompt and food delivered to table quite quickly.\n\nThe food items here are relatively pricey but if you have some PP to burn at T4 and need a quick beer, why not? Tiger Den could be an option to chill before your flight.",

      "text": "Tiger Den is a new addition to Priority Pass members at Changi Airport Terminal 4. During our last flight out of Changi Airport Terminal 4, Tiger Den was not on the list of restaurants that Priority Pass guests could visit. There was only the option of Crystal Jade Go as well as Blossom Lounge ‚Äì the only actual Priority Pass lounge at T4. With the addition of Tiger Den, we were able to try out some offerings before visiting the other Priority Pass outlets at Changi Airport Terminal 4!\n\nTiger Den at Changi Airport Terminal 4 has a full bar at the front of its premise. There are dining seats for a full meal or seats by the bar if you‚Äôre here for their super chilled draught beer, wines or cocktails. Behind, you‚Äôll find the ‚ÄúSports Bar‚Äù where there are large screen TVs playing sports channels. A really casual and inviting vibe overall...\n\nFor the full review of our visit to Tiger Den T4, visit 2bearbear today!",

Had a half pint of Guinness (no complaints there), as well as fried squid. The fried squid was a little disappointing to be honest - although I had it \"free\", I would not pay its menu price of $15 as it's just a little soggy and greasy.\nOn 2nd visit: Had fish fingers which was better - freshly fried and piping hot.",
