Diana R,5,"Bought the MSW at $22/kg and it was very delicious! Creamy texture with perfect bittersweet taste. The service was also very good, the uncle replaced the initial durian he had opened as he felt it was not good enough.

Sandy,5,"This is the best Musang King restaurant I have ever tasted from a conscientious merchant
The boss opened the durian, but after seeing that the durian was wet, he threw it directly into the trash can. He opened the third durian in a row before finding a quality durian.
The boss said: He wonâ€™t sell bad durians. They care about quality.
Thank you uncle I will come back again",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100933377461119922611/reviews
