CS Pang,5,"On 02/5/25 , I accidentally left my passport at the store at Osaka (Japan).Immediately I contacted MFA in Singapore  at night for assistance as I am on medication for my illness and the medicines last only my departure date on 5/5/2025. Ms Sharon of MFA helped me to expedite my application of DOI and I managed to return home as schedule. Thanks and appreciate for her excellent work. Also the staff at Singapore mission in Osaka.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116577828746353216040/reviews
Diego Alpin,5,"Best consular service!
Google Maps leads to back gate, which is only accessible by staff. There is a grass patch leading you to main gate, 3 min walk. From the field, you can see a very big tree as photo shown. Donâ€™t need 20 mins walk like other review said. Can also ask the guard.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105653382880211853960/reviews
Shirley NKL,5,"Tight security. Lovely grounds. We needed to authenticate our documents. We drove there on two occasions and it was seamless. We brought along the government  documents to be authenticated  (originals & photocopies), got a visitor's pass from the guard house, took a queue ticket and waited for our number to be displayed. It was all over in ten minutes. Security is tight. Access is through a turnstile.

PS: Enter the MFA through Minden Road --> Sherwood Road. There is an open car park beside the gantry. Park there and take a one minute walk to the guardhouse. Bring along an identication document with your photo to exchange for a pass. The identication document will be returned to you once you give up your pass. Photography and videography are not allowed.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107527800723976080799/reviews
Inez Cahyani,3,"I was here for document legalisation which cost $10, payable with NETS. Self-service photocopy machine with clear instruction is available at 20 cents per page. The experience at MFA was fuss-free and pleasant, but Google Maps conveniently guided you to an entrance which is closed to public whereby the right entrance is easily half an hour away. The consular section has been moved to a new annex building from Mar 2019. Could we get it updated on Google Maps please?

To be on the safe side, would recommend checking their website for directions and requirements for document legalisation.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112651517202310505587/reviews
Amiroudine,1,"Google map guides you to back gate which is conveniently closed for pathetic public. Main entrance is 30mins long walk from back gate. MFA doesn't even bother to update map to accurately guide people. Security says everyday people voluntarily end up at back gate. MFA is joyfully sitting behind Americans & British backs, misguiding masses.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106216231577177043984/reviews
