Enjoying_ MeTime,2,"Aiks...shud hv check the review before buying.
Bought two croissants. Okie la..acceptable.

I also bought their butter cake, but the baker really needs to attend a course/change the ingredients. The butter cake lacked the typical buttery fragrance and instead had an eggy smell and taste. Its texture was more like pandan cake but dry, springy, and jiggly. I think this is the worst butter cake I've ever tasted.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110962377937366427471/reviews

Steph Loreto,5,"I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews for this place? My theory is that people only leave reviews to complain?

Anyway, had a great experience at this brand today at 16 March 2025. The young man at the counter was friendly and proactive at advising us how to get the best value from their ongoing promotions.

The quality of the viennoiserie is competitive and sold at a more acceptable price point compared to the nearest sit down cafe with similar items. My favorite items are the parmesan garlic croissant, lemon cream cheese croissant and the mini danish (raspberry, apple and peach).",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102589103729628519143/reviews
Chia Ong,5,"Im a bread lover and when I pass by this stall, cannot really resist to buy some specially with discounts on, it was very tempting to purchase.

Bought the 3 for 10 croissant and chose three different flavours. All three tastes good but my favorite is the tiramisu.

Better try and see what your favorite will beðŸ¤—",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107574641984115563459/reviews
