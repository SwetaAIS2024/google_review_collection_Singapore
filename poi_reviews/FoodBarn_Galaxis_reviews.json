      "text": "Even if this was a cafe and I got the meal for takeaway, I really cannot smooth over the sheer disappointment I had while struggling through the Signature Classic Barn Burger ($19.50+). My main gripe was that the bottom of the burger was completely soaked in grease! The base bread was all limp and soggy, and I couldn't get a bite in without the lettuce and patty all slipping out. - everything was just falling apart! And this was only about 5min after I collected the package and walked across the street to Timbre+ to have my meal. Simply terrible experience.",

We ordered two fish and chips, which came with generous portions of fillet, and the sauce was quite tasty. We also added 1 iced latte and 1 ice flat white, which were decent. The total bill for two came to $53.41.",

Churro fries came in a big portion and were value for money. Good place to have a quiet lunch on a weekend or a lunch meeting.",
