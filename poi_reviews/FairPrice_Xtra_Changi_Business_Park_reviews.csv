Shreyank Shah,5,"What a spacious FairPrice store is this! It offers good discounts on the grocery, juices, chocolates, vegetables, fruits and many things.
With Christmas coming in, they already had many things to sell at discounted prices.
Do not forget to buy FairPrice Guava Juice if you love to drink juices.
Also, it has direct connectivity with Expo MRT and that's the best thing I liked.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105493433777388644116/reviews
