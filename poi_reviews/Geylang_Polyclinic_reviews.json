I wonder why this government clinic dose not like others (like sing health ,it can take samples then send to large hospitals for exam). why here can not take samples then send to hospitals for exam? Every thing goes to kk ? Seriously?\nThis is the worst experience in government clinic.",

Doctors and nurses are all very nice.  Building is bright, clean and airy. Payment and booking of appointment is fuss free and can be done over the self service kiosks. Highly recommend. üòÉ",
