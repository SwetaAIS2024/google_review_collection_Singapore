Christie Ang,5,"We have a roach problem in our office in the past and engaged this company on a contract basis. The company is prompt in scheduling their visits (they don't just sit around and wait for you to request for a visit) and the staff are courteous when they come.

In the initial months of putting these yellow stuff in our office, we found many dead roaches in our office the next morning. This is our 3rd year renewing their services and we hardly ever find alive or dead roaches anymore.

Overall very satisfied with their services!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104649530033286535199/reviews
Hben yous,1,"Hello

If I could put a negative mark I would.
Bunch of scummers and non professionals.
I paid 192$ a guy came put 3 glue traps(worth 10 dollars in any mall)  and left, came back a week after and collected the money then left. My place is really small and they were not able to catch to rodent or to put some real efficient traps.
They refused to resend a guy. They refused any refund, they said I need to pay an yearly contract which basically means promotting scummers and incompetent people.

My advice if you have a rodent problem DO NOT CALL these guys. Believe me.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100260214102703804577/reviews
