The conductor (conductor Lim) being rude towards the students, attacking them using words… Despite the fact that there are many complains from parents, the school did not take any actions towards the conductor which was very disappointing… This conductor has affected many students’ mental health, causing them to be low self-esteem.",

When the student complained to a teacher about it, they made the students sitting nearby write a reflection about what happened and then put it under the rug. School took no follow-up action for the student, Mr Chang Wai San did not apologise, the HOD asked the female student to change class, female student did not change class, they continued to have him as the Chinese MTL teacher for another 1 year.",

Being brainwashed how \"God\" is great and how \"God\" is the only one who would put u in heaven. Very bad school. I saw muslims given the rights to stay in a room during chapel time but i was being DENIED when I ask to opt out, they said I was being rude and disrespectful, from then on, a few christian teachers judged me and treated me badly in school.",
