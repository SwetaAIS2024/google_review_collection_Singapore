Brandon Liew,5,"Traditional Chinese Medicine hall riding into the 21st century , updated to serve people of these times. Folksy friendly staff. Raw medicinal herbs are not pricey ( the ones that is prescribed by your Chinese Sin Seh ). Not sure about the rest though ( because I didn't buy them and compare them ) . Can pay with CDC vouchers too !",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105887214582604180127/reviews
