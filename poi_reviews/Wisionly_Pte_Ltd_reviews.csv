I I,1,"the person manning the store i think got attitude problem,

i understand there may be alot of people who may come and collect their parcel but i believe we all come at the timing the were chosen by the store.

so i dont think its really nice of you to be rolling your eyes or giving bad energy when people is coming to collect their item.

please be better. if you feel its too much to handle then stop being a collection point.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101235591192064562514/reviews
