Ryan Fernandez,4,"Tried the dry Wanton Mee here. It‚Äôs pretty good. The char siew slices are burnt crispy, thick and it has both meat and fat which melts in your mouth when you chew. The noodles is springy, you can also taste the dry prawns in the chili which is nice but not spicy. The wantons are delicious and you get about 4 pieces compared to most stalls where you only get 2. The soup also delicious with the taste of herbs. Good portion. Uncle one man show so sometimes got to wait a a bit long but good service.  The reason why I didn‚Äôt give the full 5 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è is because the pork lard tasted a bit funny and wasn‚Äôt crispy else it would have been puuuurfect üëå",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106982280176042399585/reviews
