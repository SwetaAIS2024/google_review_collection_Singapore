Mian Chen,5,"As one of the educators who helped build the infant care programme at Mosaic Preschool, this has been a deeply personal and meaningful journey. Together with my colleague, we poured our hearts into every detail—from designing the environment to crafting a curriculum filled with love, rhythm, and purpose.

We wanted this space to feel like a second home, not just for the babies, but also for the educators working here—to give them a sense of rhythm, ritual, and respect in their daily care. A beautiful, inviting environment makes all the difference when you spend 8 to 24 hours a day in it.

It’s been a privilege to grow this precious project from the ground up, and I’m truly proud of the care and community we’ve created for every child and teacher who joins us.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112194430366915302116/reviews

Bess Lam,5,"My little one has been with Mosaic infant care for almost 10 months now. I have had the privilege to witness how much she has grown into an active, curious, confident and loving toddler with strong passion for learning under the care and love of a team of professional and driven teachers. Her bonding with teachers has always warmed my heart and I am sure she has formed so many sweet memories of her days in school. Wouldn't give a second thought recommending Mosaic to other parents :)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114655109856397811981/reviews

Daniyar Kosmukhanbetov,5,"Definitely recommend any branch of Mosaic preschool. My son had attended Bukit Timah branch which, unfortunately, had to close because of the building demolition. Eunos branch offers bilingual education, lots of indoor/outdoor activities which help a child to grow healthy.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111469767033259796674/reviews
