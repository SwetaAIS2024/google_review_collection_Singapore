Dr. Ngâ€™s nurses Boon Leong, Sarah and Athena were sincerely caring towards my husband during every treatment session. Daphne and Shikin were friendly and helpful with admin matters. The other 3 haematologists involved in my husband's care: Dr. Lim Zi Yi, Dr. Lee Chun Tsu, and Dr. Joanne Lee, were also very professional and dedicated. Highly recommend this clinic for the consistently positive and supportive experience we received. Thank you to everyone at CFCH.",

He does not try to oversell or cross-sell medications like a lot of doctors here in Singapore do, and I appreciate his approach to treatment.\n\nShoutout to Shikin who is the most friendly and attentive medical staff I have encountered in the last 5 years in Singapore. She is excellent at all admin matters, warm hearted and really cares for the patients!",
