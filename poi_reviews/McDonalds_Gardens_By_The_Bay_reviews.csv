Calvin Duong (The Goods),5,"Located right at one of Singapore’s top attractions, this McDonald’s gets long lines — expected, since it’s the only one in the area. Still, it's worth the wait for a quick, satisfying bite. Outside, they serve a unique coconut ice cream that’s a refreshing treat in the heat.

I tried the Smoked BBQ Burger and the Buttermilk Chicken Sandwich — both were good, but the Buttermilk Chicken stood out with its crispy texture, purple cabbage crunch, and a juicy slice of pineapple that added a nice tropical twist.

Busy, but convenient — and with a few local surprises on the menu, it’s more than just your standard McDonald’s stop.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114931543808742088023/reviews

Kristine Constantino,3,Good location for the people that visit the Gardens by the bay. Probably short staff or just too many people inside when came in. Floor was dirty and some tables need to be cleaned. Coffee said $1 at the self order screen but more than $4 when paid at the counter.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108563331215204526359/reviews
Evelyn Tan,5,"I recently popped into this outlet for a quick coffee and bite, and while my initial attempt at self-ordering was unsuccessful as it does not allow app payment, and I had no cash or cards on hand, the experience turned out to be exceptionally positive thanks to the incredible service.
The outlet was bustling, but the manager on duty listened patiently to my predicament. I had a time-sensitive deal on my app and was worried about losing it.  I even nervously asked if they could hold my order while I dashed to retrieve my wallet.  Instead, he calmly explored alternative solutions, and thankfully, PayNow was an option! He efficiently processed my order over the counter, ensuring I secured my deal.
I was truly impressed by his professionalism and willingness to help.  He remained calm and composed despite the busy environment and went above and beyond to resolve my issue.  I was in a rush to leave and unfortunately forgot to ask his name, but I wanted to express my sincere gratitude for his outstanding customer service.  The food and coffee were a welcome treat, but the manager's kindness and problem-solving skills made this a truly memorable experience.  Highly recommend this outlet for their excellent service!""",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101928509139315000150/reviews
