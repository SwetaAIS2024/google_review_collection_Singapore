H H,5,"Ordering and collection was easy.  The pizza was great, it had a light chewy crust that went well with the cheese, bacon and the Rosemary and garlic flavoring.  Would have been better if there was more bacon.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101768467808021135025/reviews
Amanda Kwek,5,"Great pizzas, love the dough. Japanese pork was a little too oily for our liking but was also the tastiest. Easy order and pick up process!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100835226202530255827/reviews
Irene Ng,5,"First groupbuy with Thats My Pizza! Friendly team! We ordered total 23 pizzas.  The pizza has a delightful, stove-baked flavor with a slight charring on the edges, which adds to its deliciousness. Additionally, the ingredients used are fresh and flavorful. Overal is good. I love their Hand-stretched Applewood Bacon Bufala Pizza, kids love the hand-stretched Grandma's Curry Chicken.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110010410646046560171/reviews
LP Pua,4,"We ordered 3 pizzas online 1 week in advance and self-collected at an open space at a dead-end side road at Yio Chu Kang.

The pizzas were fresh and hot. Crust was chewy, and toppings were tasty. It's one of the better pizzas we have had.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Yola Gooi,5,"Although it was takeaway pizza, it sure tasted as good as when we first ate there at the Bukit timah market. The pizza is chewy yet tasty, we tried the Kurobuta pork- super yummy, kid’s’ favorite! And also classic Hawaiian- cant go wrong.
Thank you for bringing this delish pizza to our area!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117602059448876960750/reviews
