      "text": "Probably the worst outlet, defying the sole existence of a fast food. Obviously underhanded, with one employee managing the avalanche of order. Been waiting for 30mins - and my order is nowhere near ready to be served. Just spare yourself more time when you are buying from this outlet. For sure, that day of revisiting this outlet will never come.\n\nUpdate #1. After 35mins, the food was ready and grudgingly took the takeaways, at least I got the food, right? Nope, they missed out an order from my receipt - which I realized only when I reached home. I asked the staff if everything was in when they called my number, and she said yes. Scam much?",

      "text": "Amazing Crispy Chicken and Great Service!\n\nI recently visited Texas Chicken, and I was thoroughly impressed! The chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and packed with flavor. The biscuits were buttery and had just the right amount of sweetness, making them a perfect complement to the meal.\n\nThe service was quick, and the staff was friendly and accommodating. The restaurant was clean and had a welcoming atmosphere. I also loved their side options—especially the mashed potatoes and coleslaw.\n\nIf you're a fan of fried chicken, Texas Chicken is definitely worth a visit. Great food, good portions, and reasonable prices. Highly recommend!",
