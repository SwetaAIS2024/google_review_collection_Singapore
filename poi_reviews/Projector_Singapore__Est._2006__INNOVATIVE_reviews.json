Especially after care services, theyâ€™re prompt in responding to any inquiry and will do their best to solve the issue. I believe such commitment and high quality of service brings the customer experience to another level. Highly recommended.",

Really appreciate that he is knowledgeable about the product specifications, able to give the comparisons easily and gives great advice. If only more retail staff are like him! Bought the vFlip from him and tested it at home straight away. Still impressed with the quality for only $199!",
