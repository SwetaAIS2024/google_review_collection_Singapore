Margaret Ng,5,"My son has been attending English classes at RG Channel Future School since beginning of this year. He looks forward to his lesson every week and I have seen an improvement in his English grades. He also attended RG's June holiday programs where he got to illustrate and create his own story. He had a lot of fun and has requested to attend the upcoming Dec holiday program. :) I am very happy with what RG Channel Future School has offered, in terms of providing a very nurturing learning environment as well as the academic support provided to my son. I will highly recommend the school to other parents.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114203084931510384317/reviews
