Vin W,2,"The kway chap was below average. The soup was salty without much essence, and the duck drumstick I ordered lacked flavour. The chilli sauce was also much too sour for my liking. On the plus side, the service was prompt, though.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109263427873687540100/reviews
PENG HOCK NG,5,"Try duck rice today,order the $4.50 plate, and overall, the food is average because the sambal chill tastes a little bit salty, and rice doesn't taste like yam rice (I'm not sure is the rice suppose to yam rice or not)This is my personal opinion and others have theirs opinion. Lastly, the tray return station is located far away from the dining areas.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117353003223167072912/reviews

Alvin Li,3,"""Edible but not amazing""

I'm not qualified to comment on braised duck cuisines but my dad has this to say.

We tried dry duck noodles for dine in and ordered a takeaway home to let my dad try. Today he had the rice.

In his words, there is a missing essence of flavours. The rice is not fragrant, the soup is lacking the dong gui ingredient and the duck meat is on the dry side.

A little disclaimer that we are not familiar with the brand, but I want to do them justice by giving some suggestions to make the dish nicer. If it's a franchise, they could listen. But if it's a branch store, it's going to be harder to implement suggestions.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101636040394390892825/reviews
