The rice was fluffy and absorbed the savory juices beautifully. Definitely a must-try for anyone craving a hearty and flavorful meal. Great value for money too! Will be back for more soon.",

Point to what you want on the menu if you don't speak Chinese.  If you do, he didn't seem to mind us chatting to him about the history of his stall :)",
