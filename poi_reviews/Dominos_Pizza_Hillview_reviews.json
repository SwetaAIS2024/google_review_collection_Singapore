I had no option to even cancel the order on the website, the store never answered the phone. Only thing I could do is just waiting, reading reviews here and got angry..\nWhy do you run business like this? Pick up the phone or simple text for lateness would be fine.\nBy the way, our pizza was so cold that we had to heat up in the oven... I don't know how long those set on your counter until it got finally picked up..",

Pizza was prepared in an extremely shoddy manner, undersized(closer to 6\" personal than 9\" regular that I ordered) and odd shaped with toppings sparsely added and just thrown into the middle. Submitting feedback to Dominos via their website feedback was a waste of time.",

      "text": "Regretted trying the double cheeseburger pizza. Toppings are meagre - looks like they cut up one burger patty for a regular size pizza. And the stuffed crust has equally little burger patty filling if at all. Overall it feels like eating pizza dough with pickles & cheeseburger sauce. Crispy fries are soft . Such a let-down. I would have given zero stars for food if I could. Stick to regular flavours, people",
