mOOg,5,Been patronising this spot for years due to the chill atmosphere and comfortable vibes. The hotel is situated above and the rooms are known to be tiny. But the bar and restaurant is a great venue to have a bottle of wine or few pints of beer while enjoying the live band performance. Place is packed on Fridays and Saturdays though.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115699459446948488137/reviews
Ivan Tan (FireFox),4,Great place to chill out before 6pm if you are looking for cheap beer at S$6 per pint. Could be cheaper before 5pm. Live singing starts at 6.45pm. Cool chill out place for seniors. Filipino band [#15th group] belts out beautiful and nostalgic oldies.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117659783939101213413/reviews
Melissa Sunshine,2,"The rooms are tiny with only a plastic chair to sit in .  The picture of the lounge on the website page is not even real and completely false.  The staff told me it was an old picture and I mentioned that it is false advertisement.
There are no cushioned seats of any comfort.  Only high back metal chairs.  Music is loud and obnoxious.  Staff is not even friendly.  Location is good for Chinatown.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105996016551548279001/reviews
Justin,2,"I'm doing the review for the bar at ground level. The middle-aged male server was friendly, had eye contact, smiled, etc. The two foreign female workers were very rude. No eye contact at all, no 'here you go' when they serve drinks, they just put it on the table and quickly walked away. No 'thank you' or 'please come again' when I made payment as well. Doesn't made me feel welcomed at all.

What kind of customer service is this? Very rude and untrained. The management should really remind these 2 princesses that the basic rule of customer service is to not be rude. If I'm the boss here, I would have fired these 2 ladies. If they're not happy working there, they should not be working there and not show their attitude to their customers. I give credit where it's due and criticisms when it's deserved. I hope the management would do something about this.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113357534781981958391/reviews
Evanixxx,4,"The deluxe queen guestroom is great albeit the limited walking space. If you're concerned about the music from the wine bar below, don't worry as the music won't be able to reach the upper floors. As for the convenience of the location, food choices are abundant tho most would be Chinese-oriented. Now comes the part of service. If you're the type to expect prompt responses from the reception etc, perhaps you should seek other hotels.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115832272313316961011/reviews
