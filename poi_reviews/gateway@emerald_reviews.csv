Ashley Liew,5,"Orchard Gateway @ Emerald is conveniently located along Orchard Road, just beside The Centrepoint and opposite 313 Somerset. This makes it an excellent location in the heart of Singapore’s shopping belt. You can’t miss Foot Locker, their ground floor shop. Definitely worth a visit although not too big a mall!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
