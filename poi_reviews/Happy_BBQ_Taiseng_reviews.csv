Lay Ling Goh,5,"The pig stomach soup is really yummy. Generous portion of pig stomach and other ingredients. Highly recommended. The portion looks more  suitable for 3. The price is reasonable.

Most of the lok-lok sticks are between $1 to $3. Meal comes with free plate of fruits. The staff is also very nice. Refill of soup is free.

We were so full after the meal.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110401691868785566334/reviews
