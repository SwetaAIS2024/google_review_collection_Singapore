      "text": "Tucked away in retro Katong Shopping Centre, About Coffee Co. is a cozy, minimalist spot with warm vibes and friendly, knowledgeable staff. Great for specialty coffee lovers — the white (iced) was unique and full of flavor.\n\nThe café has a clean, Scandi-inspired look and a calm atmosphere, perfect for a quiet sit-down. Note: it’s cash or PayNow only, which might be inconvenient for some.\n\nTried the hot white too — decent latte art, but without ice it leaned towards a darker roast. Worth a visit, especially if you’re nearby for chicken rice, banana pie, or laksa.",

Some floral notes too\n\nWill be back to try some of the other beans.\n\nPlace has a nice ambience being a corner unit of level 2, full glass and overlooking shrubbery.",

Felt that the notes were more pronounced in the iced (+$1) version though.\n\nThe space is cozy & clean, nice vibes to sit and enjoy your coffee. Love that it’s at Katong mall bc you can eat the KTMW chicken rice, dona manis/ auntie peng banana pie, or 328 laksa nearby. Have been here twice and will be back!",
