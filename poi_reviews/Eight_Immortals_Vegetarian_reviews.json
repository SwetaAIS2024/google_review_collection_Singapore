      "text": "Probably my favourite place for mixed vegetables rice in Singapore. They have a large variety of vegetable dishes for those who do not fancy mock meats. Portions are generous and vegetables are firm and not limp and mushy like at some Chinese vegetarian stalls. I especially like that they have thick and crunchy soy bean sprouts, instead of the thinner mung bean sprouts typically found elsewhere. As with many vegetarian stalls nowadays, they serve brown rice as well as white rice. Their laksa is decent too, but I would not recommend their thunder tea rice. Service is friendly, and they remember their regular customers.",
