RCSC,5,"Wow didnt know the reviews are so bad. I ordered via deliveroo and all 5 dishes were very good. Fried rice was fried very well, grains are separated. Spring chicken also tasted very good. Pork chop slightly tough but still tasty. Love my mentaiko dory! Aglio olio also full of flavour. I will order from them again!!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101381356185028377091/reviews
Stacy Chung,1,"Have ordered the lamb chop many times before but today, the lamb chop left a waxy texture in my mouth. This lamb chop is spoiled already. Threw the whole thing away. Hope I don't get a tummyache. So disappointed because food is usually quite good.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114421905549340570092/reviews
Marcus Lim,2,"Order 1/2 dozen chicken wings and some other food. When it’s ready, was suspicious as usually the 1/2 dozen wings will come with a box the charge $0.30  but instead it’s in small paper bag. Check and found Only 4 wings instead of 6. Confronted the guy and he swiftly gave another 2 wings without asking or apologising.
Please check your orders before going away.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113984403791348641924/reviews
Zhu Alvin,3,"Fried rice quite nice as i dont find it very salty, but the chicken chop was small, about half the normal portion. The chicken wings were crispy and tender. Overall not bad, just that I will skip the fried rice.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110495662944295636591/reviews
