Kathy Teo,5,"I live across from this industrial food court and I WFH today. Drove to this food court to get my lunch.

Ordered from this YTF stall and felt the ingredients were really fresh. The chill and sweet sauce is nice and the standout was the meat ball and the bean curd stuff with meat.

Auntie was very friendly and called me ah girl. Ask me to come again and give feedback. Double thumbs up.

Ah girl will come again if I WFH as the YTF is really good.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118349573871145243330/reviews
Kah Kiat Dave Lim,5,"New stall selling Yong Tao foo. I tried it and the soup is very refreshing and the ingredients are very fresh.
The signature of the stall should be the owners hand made meat balls. Can’t find this anywhere else at other YTF stalls.

I will come here regularly for my YTF fix!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106901680962718110488/reviews
ALIGN PLUS PTE LTD Jeff Yip,5,"Okay, listen up, because this Briyani mutton rice deserves all the accolades! From the moment it arrived, the aroma alone was enough to make my mouth water. But the taste? Absolutely incredible. The rice was cooked to perfection – each grain separate and bursting with flavor. And the mutton? Oh my goodness, so tender and succulent, it practically melted in my mouth. You could tell the spices were expertly balanced, creating a rich and deeply satisfying dish. Honestly, this is hands down one of the best Briyani mutton rice I've ever had. If you're looking for a truly tasty and unforgettable meal, look no further!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106836244065617560268/reviews
Russ G,4,"Chanced upon this industrial park canteen and ventured in to look see for lunch.

Saw a muslim stall nasi padang called JWZ Muslim food and decided to try their mee soto. Broth could be further improved but not too salty which is good. Not too bad given its $3 and add on bagedil. Portion is generous likewise the shredded chicken.

Take away nasi padang includes their beef rendang, kangkong and thick sliced fried egg plus bagedil for $7. Beef is lean slightly on tough side but well seasoned on rempah. Fried egg portion is thick slice compared to some seen mediocre. Sambal belachan is sedap and am amazed by its spiciness.

Overall not too bad and price point for nasi padang affordable given its location hideout.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104674531685145405427/reviews
