Uncle Giovanni,5,"This is my second visit in 2 weeks. Discovered this gem unintentionally. Menu is reasonably priced. Food is delicious and portions are good.
Pomfret fish was meaty and well-cooked. Bean sprouts were fat and juicy with generous amount of salted fish. Nam Yu crispy pork was not dry and tasted good.
Do give this place a try.

Note: Thereâ€™s an opening special of $12 for the steamed pomfret.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114896567981758784008/reviews

Sean Goh,4,"This tze char stall is situated in a coffeeshop along frankel avenue. You defineitely cant miss the bright neonlight signboard as you drive pass by. If you are driving, parking could be an issue.

Staff were friendly, order were taken and food were served shortly after. Ordered their signature Nonya steam fish, sauce was great, unfortunately fish turn cold fast. The prawn rolls and stir fried royale chives were equally good as well.

Price was reasonable and menu is pretty extensive as well. Can consider coming back again.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
