Ha Thuy,5,"I’ve had a wonderful experience at this clinic throughout my pregnancy. The staff are professional, kind, and attentive. Motoko-sensei explains everything clearly and takes time to answer all my questions. Highly recommended for prenatal care.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106689076058588170962/reviews

Belle Belle,1,"Patience, Empathy, Professionalism are basic traits of a Specialist Doctor, yet non of these were shown. I’ve never come across such an Impatient, Rude, Insulting doctor. Being female doctor, there was also zero gentleness, scan was done so roughly, I cringed at her every movement, she also needed to put on and down her glasses, I wonder if she can really see clearly after all. Don’t be fooled by the Japanese name, thinking u are going to see a nice pleasant sweet female doctor, it’s NOT at all. Never judge a book by its cover, be very wise. I left feeling very insulted, traumatized and shocked by such behavior of a doctor.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116400394886436960587/reviews
Hayden Vine,1,Very poor emotional intelligence from a doctor. Would not recommend any prospective mothers to be treated by Dr.Motoko.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111268762588562161311/reviews
Cheryl Ng,5,"My little one was safely delivered by Dr. Motoko in March 2020. I really enjoyed the smooth and seamless appointments, the friendly and great service provided by the reception staff. I received very patient care advice when I collected my medication and when its my usual review. It's a mainly Japanese clientele clinic so the service is top-notch, very discreet and gentle. Compared to my first delivery at a public hospital, Dr. Motoko and her team of staff nurses shows extreme care and finesse when conducting the regular checks, so I was never in discomfort or pain. Will definitely be back (if I am lucky to have #3!)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101833902320555018701/reviews
