School updates are also very minimum",

      "text": "Posting this on our kids' last day here, and wishing we could bring the entire school with us.\n\nEver since walking past the preschool and deciding to enroll the kids here because we felt good vibes, then enrolling and being really thankful we chose right, and hearing great feedback from grandparents, we had every intention to keep the kids here until they had to attend primary school.\n\nUnfortunately, plans changed and we had to move. And initially we were (to be frank) a little worried that the kids would not get the same support. But instead, their teachers actively supported us, even to the point of looking for books that covered topics about moving and attending new schools.\n\nNever thought I would be so sad about having to leave a preschool, but we are. This is an incredible school with a selection of highly motivated, patient educators who are genuinely invested in the children.\n\nA huge thank you again to their teachers:\nGao Laoshi & Ms Nasha, Mr Evan, Ms Xinyi and Xin Xin Laoshi - thank you for being the reason Maya loves school and gets grumpy if we pick her up too early.\nIvy Laoshi, Ms Afiah, Ee Laoshi, Ms Nadya and Ms Yin-ning - the simple fact that Kai our COVID baby who cried so badly at first and blossomed into someone who runs right in and is now so well adjusted is testament to the incredible support offered to him.\nSpecial mention to Ms Chloe and Ms Syuhaidah as well, and everyone else who've supported their journey here. Your dedication has not gone unnoticed.",

From the looks of the learning and activity space it has, I would say it is ready to take alot of applications. Has a full size kitchen even to cater for kids meals during the day. Overall positive impression of the place, but suggest parents to visit during the day for a closer look and \"test the water\" with your child before deciding.",
