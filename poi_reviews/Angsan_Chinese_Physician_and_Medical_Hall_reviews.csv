Chen,5,"Was treated by Dr Angsan for over two decades ago.  My nose has been fine. Is currently looking at his clinic because another friend might need the service. Used to have bad sinus issues in the morning. My mum and brothers also had improvements. While the treatment is unorthodox, it is definitely non invasive. And yes, he does like to boast but he did deliver for us.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103775619792608415733/reviews

Worst still this physician always like to criticize western doctor and it's surgical method? Does he have all the advance diagnostic facilities like nasoendoscopy?Does he sterlize the equipment he used?
