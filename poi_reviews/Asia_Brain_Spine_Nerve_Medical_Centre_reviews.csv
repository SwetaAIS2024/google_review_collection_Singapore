Jeff Max,1,"Worst clinic I ever experienced

1. He asked me to do a MRI for leg pain and after MRI told me he only cure spine but not legs, which he could told me in the first place.ðŸ˜¤

2. More expensive: 250$ for 1st visit and 200$ for subsequent. And if you donâ€™t visit in a while, they consider you 1st visit again ðŸ™€

Avoid it and find a more professional clinic.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104993268944998037439/reviews
