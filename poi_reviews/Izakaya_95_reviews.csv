Elaine Liew,5,"Been here couple of times now, and still as good as the first time. Food standard is  always consistent.

My all time favorite is the garlic fried rice - portion is big , surume Ika - the skewer -! The skewers were cooked well and had a distinct smokey aroma perfectly .. Was Definitely deserving of its 5 star rating!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103024638793717810514/reviews
David Chee,4,"The waitress had a moody face but after a few orders in, her service became better. The food was well cooked and the seafood was quite fresh.

Better to drive or cycle there.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103141603760662465251/reviews
