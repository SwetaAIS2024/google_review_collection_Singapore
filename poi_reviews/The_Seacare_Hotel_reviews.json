      "text": "We stayed at the hotel for five nights. The location was convenient, close to Chinatown, and it was easy to find good lunch options nearby. However, our experience with the room service was disappointing. For the last three days, the TV was not working. On Sunday, no one came to collect the garbage. Additionally, the last three days, the hallways were flooded, and we had to walk through water, getting our shoes wet. The staff made a lot of noise using equipment to blow away the water, which disrupted our sleep. The security box did not work, the door lock was faulty, and staff members entered our room while we were showering.",

      "text": "The Chinese girl receptionist is rude, unfriendly and unprofessional during check in. During check in she did not greet the guests at all and she just directly said \" I need all your passport to check in\" instead of \"Hi Sir, may I have all your passport to check in.\" Afterthat, she even charged the wrong total amounts of the two rooms which we already booked. She did not even notice at the moment after we finished check in I myself have to reminded her the payment was wrong then she only noticed. Luckily she voided the payment and say sorry to us. However, during check out her attitude change a lot.\n\nAs I am also a hotel receptionist here are some suggestions to the property manager.\n1. Hotel industry is hospitality industry need the balance of work, politeness and empathy. Some foreign guests have to walk from the mrt station to your property it is very tired at the moment greeting is very important because the guests can feels warming, hospitable and friendly.\n2. Receptionist sometimes are under stress may made some mistakes but when guests asking you why it like this, a proper explanation to guests is important not just saying ooh nothing ah. Double check and provide a clear explanation to guests is important because the guests may feel abandoned.\n\nHowever the room is still acceptable and breakfast quite deliciousüëçüëçüëç",

No proper toiletries provided. Air con seems like not working as outside is colder than inside. Not sound proof. Very loud noises throughout sleep.\n\n100% will not recommend",
