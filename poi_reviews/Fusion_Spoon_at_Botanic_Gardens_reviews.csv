HF Lei,1,"Mee rebus $7.30 is just a full bowl of noodles with one egg, little bean sprouts and dried bean curd that’s all. The fried noodles taste slightly better. The only plus point is the cold Aircon that’s all.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116352348253561358266/reviews
KM Lim,4,Food price is ok for a place like botanical garden. Mee rebus portion was bigger than regular portion at hawker.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109843434516972964697/reviews

Mr Chris,1,"Came here thinking it was a child-friendly restaurant, especially since there’s a dedicated kids’ play area. The setup gave the impression that children could play and entertain themselves while adults enjoy their meal. But surprisingly, the staff came over to ask the kids to lower their voices—even though they weren’t being excessively loud, and the restaurant was far from full.

If you’re going to promote yourself as family-friendly, then commit to it fully. Don’t install a play area and then scold kids for using it. That’s just poor planning and sends a confusing message. Clearly not a welcoming place for families. Would not recommend this to anyone with children—and we definitely won’t be back.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111139927683621685776/reviews
Rene Thöne,5,"Surprisingly good! Looks and feels like a automate controlled fast food - maybe because it is a automate controlled fast food :-) You place your order on a screen, but you have also a big menu on the wall to prepare your order. Payment is only by card.
But the handled food (you take yourself at the Counter B, Counter A is for drinks & Beverages) is good! Tasty, good quality, nice arranged - and very affordable! You pay in average 10S$ for a good meal.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117995259412377164370/reviews
