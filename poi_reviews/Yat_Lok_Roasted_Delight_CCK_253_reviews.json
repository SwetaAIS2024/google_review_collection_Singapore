      "text": "Have been patronizing this stall for a year++ due to its good price and I like the soya sauce that goes well with the chicken and rice.  However, this is the last time I will be buying from this stall as the person mending the stall was unpleasant and rude to my mother and I with the request of having a packet of the soya sauce to go with my order of soya cause chicken. This isn't a first time order. In the past the person would give me packet to go along with it, without me asking. Every order that I buy from this stall was Half or a Whole Chicken. Today early afternoon, when asked to have the sauce to go with the chicken, the worker would rudely say in Chinese that he put already in the packet of chicken and when asked to have another packet he would say put is put already. The last few times, he regretfully give me a packet of sauce upon request as I had told him upon opening up the packet to show him it was dry as a bone. You may refer to the picture as attached(Second picture, tilted the packet all the waaaaaayyyyyyyyy to the side and that small amount of sauce w the amount of chicken is ridiculous) . You should probably not name your chicken dish with the word \"Soya Sauce' anymore. Owners, take note. Others, beware.  Service is so so bad that it spoils your mood. One less food stall to eat at my nearby place..",
