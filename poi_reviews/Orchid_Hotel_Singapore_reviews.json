      "text": "A Wonderful Stay at Orchid Hotel, Singapore\n\nI had an exceptional experience staying at the Orchid Hotel in Singapore. From the moment I arrived, the staff were warm, welcoming, and attentive to every detail. The check-in process was seamless, and I was immediately impressed by the cleanliness and modern design of the hotel.\n\nThe room was spacious, well-appointed, and equipped with everything needed for a comfortable stay. The bed was incredibly cozy, and the large windows offered stunning views of the city. The amenities, including the pool and fitness center, were top-notch and added to the overall experience.\n\nThe hotel’s location is another highlight. Being situated in the heart of Singapore, it was incredibly convenient to explore the city’s attractions, with public transport and dining options just a short walk away.\n\nWhat truly stood out to me was the exceptional service. The staff went above and beyond to ensure that my stay was enjoyable and memorable. Whether it was offering local recommendations or accommodating special requests, they handled everything with professionalism and a genuine smile.\n\nI highly recommend the Orchid Hotel to anyone visiting Singapore, whether for business or leisure. I look forward to returning in the future for another wonderful stay!",

Cannot use other electric gadgets for the same reason in the bathroom such as hair staightener etc. Hairdryer is a bit heavy, but fine.\n\n2. Food\nCould be great if we could bring out coffee from the restaurant. Like providing in a paid reusable cup or paper cup, and get refunded upon return.",
