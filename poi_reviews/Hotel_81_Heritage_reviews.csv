Ashlen Naiko,3,"Great value but comes at a price. Tiny room, No sofa bed as described, mattress on the floor; we had to ask them to change, bathroom tiny as well with shower not separate, no option to control Aircon; we got sick; then they turned it off where it got crazy hot….
Many more hotels around with a lot better quality for similar prices! Just location was good",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114781312151949411080/reviews

ni wayan enny Suastini,4,"The superior queen room is small, and the bathroom is small, too. But it is enough for two. The staff are helpful. The room has a window, but when you open the curtain you cannot see any views",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100432739083741830336/reviews

Martyn Henry,4,Quite a basic and budget option! Room was small with no window but the bed was surprisingly comfortable and the A/C worked well (despite having no control). The location is quite good as well being quite close to MRT Nicoll Highway station.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448981829292657129/reviews
