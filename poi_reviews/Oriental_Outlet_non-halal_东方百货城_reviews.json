      "text": "Huge outlet for non halal goods and other Chinese centric items. They also have a very large section of prayer items, oil and incense etc. They have a lot of dry goods and sauces. And they also have an enormous freezer section. But a lot of their pork products seem to be in bulk. For example, i could not buy some small pieces of pork ribs for soup... i needed to buy an entire rack that was massive and difficult to cut without a bandsaw. The staff also could not cut it for me. The staff however were really very nice. Language was a bit of a difficulty because they were foreign workers with very limited English and Malay. But they were very pleasant and smiley and really tried their best to be helpful.",
