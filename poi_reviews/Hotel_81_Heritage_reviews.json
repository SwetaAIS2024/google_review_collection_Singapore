Tiny room, No sofa bed as described, mattress on the floor; we had to ask them to change, bathroom tiny as well with shower not separate, no option to control Aircon; we got sick; then they turned it off where it got crazy hot….\nMany more hotels around with a lot better quality for similar prices! Just location was good",
