Open kitchen concept where you can watch the food before prepared right before your eyes. Pizza dough was the best I've eaten. Tomato sauce on pepperoni pizza was quite tart/sour. Trio of dips is decent. Child friendly and good service.",

Service was good.\n\nWe had pizza only, the dough was Excellent with generous toppings.\n\nDown side: the combination of toppings were odd, not traditional Italian or American pizza. And the overall was too watery, the center of my pizza was soaking wet.\n\nThey only offer overpriced organic sodas but  can still have free self-service water.\n\nMaybe I will come back and crave pizza dough. The sides, appetizers and desserts didn't sound appealing so we didn't order.",

Sides include truffle fries and fried chicken bites. Service can be slow at times when the place is packed but worth a revisit.",

After I asked the chef how to order, he finally took my order, despite the fact that he appeared to dislike being there.\n\nThe pie was chewier and rougher than I expected, not as delicate as I had hoped (if they intend a Neapolitan-style pizza). The cut into half of the proofed dough and appeared to be struggling to stretch the tough dough. Paid $35 and walked 10+ minutes from the bus stop for... a dissapointment.",
