Lintong Yan,5,Dr Loong is our family doctor. She is very patient and upfront. I am perplexed why there are negative comments on her. One thing that she probably failed the expectation to be the perfect doctor is her short clinic time. The clinic is not always open when we need it.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106466650942022768197/reviews
K A,1,"Only reason I attended this place is due to them being a panel doctor of my company. Definitely not attending this place again. The doctor Ashleigh was very rude, as though having an interrogation with me. The moment I entered she told me not to sit down and was asking questions while sounding unhappy, all the way I was standing with a chair right in front of me. Only bonus is Lady Staff at counter was kind and helped answer my questions about Panel insurance. Not such why such people even choose such a noble profession as a job. Probably when you're insured and pay nothing, you're treated differently. Avoid at all cost.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105594275925193240826/reviews

Jonathan Lim,5,"This medical practice is clean and modern. They use branded drugs and not generics, which impressed me. They are also proud to display the brand names!

Shaevah Pannir Selvan,5,"Dr Long’s dedication is truly impressive. She takes the time to listen to her patients' concerns and provides personalized treatment plans that address each patient's unique needs. I never felt rushed during my appointments, and I always left feeling confident in the care I received.

I’ve been to her clinic a couple of times. During each visit, she recommends ample rest and prescribes medication which helps to resolve the concerns I address. The medication she has given me thus far has been very effective.

I love how she dedicates time to check on her patients by making calls a day after our appointments to check on how we are doing. That’s 10/10 service for me.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114017114653738867584/reviews
