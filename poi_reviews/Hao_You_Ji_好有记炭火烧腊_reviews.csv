chu xuan,5,"Extremely delicious and succulent pork! 🐷😋

Their char siew 🍖 is so sweet and caramelized. very chewy and amazing. Their noodles are elastic and not too salty.

叉烧烧肉面 was originally $5 and now its $6.10 including takeaway. I think its still so worth with how much meat they give you!

The 3 malaysian men who own the stall are hardworking and have been cooking since 5-6 years ago :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114900991350615107188/reviews
Seanniebois Biggie,1,Small portion and very slow in service. Look at the photo can tell it's pathetic portion. This is from the Teck Whye branch. Do not patronize them.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108150212659844710063/reviews

Max Ong,2,"Felt that it’s overpriced over the roasted meat and Char siew at $10 for a small portion. The half duck at $23 seems fair .
Will update if it’s delicious .",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112366404782351507731/reviews
