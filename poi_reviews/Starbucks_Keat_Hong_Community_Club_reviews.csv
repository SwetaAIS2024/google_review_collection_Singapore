Dina S,5,Have been ordering from this outlet through grab in the mornings and I always look forward to receiving my drinks to see the lovely messages written on my cups. The team working there must really be in a good mood every day and I hope they know that their messages really brighten my day and help me be positive during the work day too. The drinks are also always well made and they pay attention to extra requests I’ve written down. Thank you for being my favourite part of the day!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105857802351862811877/reviews
Winnie Hong,1,"Order online, reach on time collection, but no one ask the order from me, I stand there no one coming asking. The customer order in the counter already collected , mine early then the walk in customers still cannot collect my drinks. I saw the drinks on the desk! And our frappuccino become diluted! On time reach there still need wait for another 15mins! Just can collect! I think the drinks already put on the table more than 20mins!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103500666452306851788/reviews
Siah Hx,2,"Mgmt, the place is packed with people (not customers) who hogs the seats whole day!! And Customers who wishes to patronised and have a seat is unable to do so!!! PLEASE do something about it to improve the issue at this outlet.

Kelly | Instant Hire,1,"Ordered a vanilla latte hoping for a rich coffee with vanilla taste, but what I got was mostly just sugar and milk. Tried a few times thinking it was a one-off — same result every time. Barely any coffee flavor. If you’re looking for a strong, bold latte, this isn’t the place. Not recommended.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103361654243254335446/reviews
Isabel Ho,5,"In this current age of complain culture, I hope this review can be a tiny bright spark. Visited the outlet today and was greeted by a kind caucasian staff who kindly passed some really cute stickers to my daughter. The female barista also offered my daughter a babycino of her own accord  topped with a butterfly chocolate swirl which was such a wonderful gesture. And lastly I observed great team work and support amongst all the staff and baristas which I don’t see in too many starbucks anymore due to high turnover or high turn around where regular staff get switched around. It was really an afternoon made great by what I witnessed and encountered and reminded me of the good days in my usual Starbucks outlet (not here) Keep up the great work team!!!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115853181199000378248/reviews
