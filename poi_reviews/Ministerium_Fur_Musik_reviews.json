Over the 11 years of piano lessons with her, she opened up my musical universe. I explored many different genres of music with her, such as classical, jazz, ragtime and movie soundtracks. I always looked forward to attending my weekly lessons with her because there was always something new and enjoyable to learn. I am truly grateful that I had her as my teacher.",
