A Lim,1,"Edited: You must really have some miscommunication among yourselves there, what are you even? Learners' Lodge or Kai Academy, both? Anyway, my child has to go somewhere else, no classes suitable there now.

From closing your branch near 6 avenue in bkt timah and now bishan.  my older son was affected and now the younger one. seems like you have issues dealing with your staff. communication is not clear too, say stopping operations, then teachers will continue but my son's teacher cannot.  you should have informed us earlier, you still made me pay for the head start.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102624810224229235633/reviews

jensen nehmiah,4,"Dear Mr Aw,

Due to my weakness in general paper I had trouble understanding the structure of the subject. I also disliked gp as i was always scoring quite low in it. Despite the short time that I have encountered with you, I have learnt that there is much more things that are interesting about gp. I also learnt to appreciate and like more of the subject. Although I am still improving and not at the required level yet, I hope i can fully grasp the skills you have taught me and apply them in the A levels, other than academics, I also saw and admired your passion in teaching general paper. Thank you so much for your guidance thus far wish you a happy Teachers day .""",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113955407290175770320/reviews
Tze Yng Lim,5,"Thank you for your guidance in a completely new subject, Economics. Everyone, myself included, started off confused and uncertain of the expectations of this new subject. Although we were taking a foreign subject at H2, Mr Lee helped us to gain confidence with each lesson. The lessons comprised of relevant examples and clear concepts that were explicitly emphasised by Mr Lee. The structure was very beneficial for me and I have gained knowledge beyond the Economics syllabus under Mr Leeâ€™s guidance.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101707174417896343207/reviews
