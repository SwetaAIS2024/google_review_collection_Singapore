Pearlyn GYT,5,"First time trying the BBQ items from Chun Man Yuan, but it will definitely not be the last! Everything was super yummy - from Black Pepper Prawns, Coffee Midwing, Marinated Chicken Wing, Otah as well as Pork and Mutton Satay. The marinades were done very well and price is reasonable for this amount of food. Satay gravy was delicious too!

Will definitely be recommending to my friends and family :)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105538956700519868571/reviews
CK Tan,4,"First time trying this BBQ caterer. Overall satisfied, value for money.  Some pointers to share.

1. Chicken Yakitori was the most popular amongst kids.  Satay was OK but meat size average. Pork chop was also thinly sliced.
2. Go for medium prawns. The smaller size really too small to handle.
3. Fried bee hoon is too oily.

Also do allow time to thaw the meat before guests arrive.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106584179712410759486/reviews
Winnie Li,3,Satay and cooked otah in banana leaf was good. Staff was friendly for pick up. But the prawn sticking to the shell. Stingray not really fresh. 虾婆 also not very nice.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116944603491276590248/reviews
Amos Yap,5,"We ordered bbq food from Chun man yuan bbq catering for 10 of us and the whole experience was smooth and fuss-free with delivery. Items worth recommending are honey chicken wings, satay (chicken, mutton, pork), cooked otah in banana leaf. The stingray, potato and sweet corn were slightly small so do consider ordering more for larger crowd. Hope to order next time:)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117222179440434666595/reviews
