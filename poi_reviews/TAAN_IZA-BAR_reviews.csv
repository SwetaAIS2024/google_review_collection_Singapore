Peter Chua,4,"They have two units with outdoor seating, and the interior is beautifully decorated. However, there is only one restroom available.

The omakase set of eight costs $26 and comes in generous portions. The Kyoho grape beer, priced at $10, has a fruity taste. A variety of other alcoholic beverages are available, including unique cocktails that seem popular among diners.

Pleasant music plays in the background, enhancing the dining experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117320083836989480538/reviews
Thomas Cheah,4,Not many tables available on weekday dinner. Scan QR for order online. Food takes very very very very very long to serve. Clams super good. Sake served in interesting cups. Pasta oily. Set of eight can skip. Should order the fire cocktail next time.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111579866316719212334/reviews
