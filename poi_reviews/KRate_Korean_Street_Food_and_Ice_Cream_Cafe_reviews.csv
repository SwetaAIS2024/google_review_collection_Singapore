Winnie Tan,1,Stated on webpage that they close at 9.30pm but was told at the shop they close at 9pm. Wanted to try the ice cream before buying but was told no trying. Hostile nd unwelcoming service w substandard ice cream. Might as well go burnt cones with better service or just go vending machine and be done. Waste of time n money.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108552586153126314011/reviews
QL Y,1,Would give 0 star if that's an option. Avoid at all cost. This place does not respect customer time. Ordered and waited 1 hour before cancelling my order. What a scam!,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112890619512990286131/reviews
