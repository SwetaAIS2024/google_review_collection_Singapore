Queue time was reasonable given that the uncle was managing everything alone plus there wasn't a cashless payment option. Opted for the $3 fishball noodle and the portion was decent and filling. You can ask for $2 portion which is hardly available anywhere else.",

      "text": "First time and last time visiting this store. The auntie there has attitude issues. I popped by at 11.30am just now, the store was empty af, I was hungry and decided not to queue for other more popular stores. I ordered their signature mee sua, and as you can see, it‚Äôs meatballs in the advertising picture. The lady threw two fishballs into the boiling pot and I was initially quite confused, but I didn‚Äôt say anything because I thought the meatball will be put in later. While she was packing my noodles, I asked her politely, ‚Äúauntie, ÊàëÁöÑ‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πàÊ≤°ÊúâËÇâÂúÜÂëÄÔºü‚Äù. She immediately outburst and started screaming ‚Äú‰Ω†‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πà‰∏çË¶ÅÊó©ËÆ≤ÔºüÔºüÔºÅÔºÅ‚Äù and continued shouting away blaming me why did I not tell her before ordering and the meatball is automatically ‚Äúreplaced‚Äù with fishballs if you didn‚Äôt say. A few onlookers from other stores were looking my way and I felt embarrassed. How am I supposed to know that you auto-swapped the meatballs to fishballs? It‚Äôs my first time buying?? If you‚Äôre automatic swapping meatballs to fishballs, shouldn‚Äôt you just change the advertising photo to fishballs instead? Instead of screaming at me for not knowing the rules as a first timer? And according to her words while she was speaking loudly to me, it‚Äôs not her first time screaming at customers for this, and I don‚Äôt know how many new customers never came back just because of this. Absolute horrendous. Such an incident really ruins the mood for me. To the boss of manyuan noodles reading this: there may be a reason why the fish soup store beside you always have endless queues and your store has none. I‚Äôm resting my case here. Just wanna let all those who are eating at their store for the first time to request for meatballs even before placing your order, if not what you get is fishball noodles in a poor portion and an angry lady blaming you for not telling her. Unless you are okay with spending more money just to get fishball noodles.",
