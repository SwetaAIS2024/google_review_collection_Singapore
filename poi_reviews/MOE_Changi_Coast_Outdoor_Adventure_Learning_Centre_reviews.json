      "text": "Overall experience was really good. The toilets were not THAT dirty, just a lot of wet sand on the floor which isn't too bothering unless you drop something on the floor (which would be very unpleasant)\nThe dorms are clean, except for a bit of sand at the entrance (there's sand everywhere in the campsite)\nThe campsite is quite confusing for the first few days and I got lost multiple times.\nAirplane noises were not too bad, just a few flyovers. Highly recommend bringing earplugs ESPECIALLY FOR LIGHT SLEEPERS\nSleeping in tents was ok, just a little stuffy and warm. Don't worry about wet clothes as there are wires outside the dorms to hang wet clothes. The food was quite bad but it should be bearable.",
