Hana Huan,5,"Doctor Kong is the ideal Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) doctor for me. She possesses extensive experience in TCM and holds a PhD from Nanjing University of TCM, showcasing her high level of qualification.

Since becoming acquainted with her, I have not sought treatment from any other TCM clinic. I trust her expertise to such an extent that I even bring my daughter to her when she falls ill.

Dr. Kong's kindness and knowledge are remarkable. She consistently strives to enhance her understanding of TCM, which further demonstrates her commitment to her profession.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104753854256417635943/reviews
