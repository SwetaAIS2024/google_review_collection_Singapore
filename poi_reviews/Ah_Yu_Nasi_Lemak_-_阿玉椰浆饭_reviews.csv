JJ Tan,1,"So they have this ‚Äúvalue‚Äù meal, at $4 chicken wing, an egg and rice.

So my order was noodles instead of rice, with additional sides of vegetables and the squid/sotong/fish cutlet whatever people call it, and this dish cost me $6.70

Unreasonably priced and the vegetables are in bad quality. Black spots on the leaves.

First and last time for me.

Suggestion: skip this stall. Even the cai png stall within the same coffeeshop with 2 meats and 2 vegs with rice cost me $5.40 only",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109217135678196962818/reviews
Z L,5,"‚ú®The economy noodles here are tasty and not too salty. The chilli that comes with has a nice spicy kick and it‚Äôs not too sweet. I‚Äôm not sure why the reviews are so low, but I frequent this place and the taste has been consistent.

I don‚Äôt frequently leave reviews but the bad reviews from the past don‚Äôt accurately reflect the quality of the food. Please give this stall a chance and be kind to hawkers.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103271416336421720209/reviews
Pet N,4,Ah Yu Nasi Lemak ÈòøÁéâÊ§∞ÊµÜÈ•≠ serves great economic beehoon-mee. Well cooked and not oily. But what‚Äôs really good is that white cabbage! Lots of wok hey. The other ingredients are pretty decent too at a good price.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111486356803983600718/reviews
Ben,4,"Both the nasi lemak and economy noodles taste good, and the batter on the chicken wing is really fragrant too!

To the people commenting on pricing:
Honestly, I think the pricing is more than fair. The inflation in Singapore for 2022-2023 has been crazy, and with GST increasing at the same time, it‚Äôs pretty amazing to still be able to get a proper meal for $3 in 2024.

Please be appreciative and understanding of our hawkers, it‚Äôs a dying trade üòî",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107486640658870736859/reviews
XFX,1,"After the recent fb saga, they still have the cheek to increased price AGAIN last month! This ECONOMICAL beehoon/noodle & fried stuffs shouldn‚Äôt be this kind of pricing so expensive! U think u selling Cai fan? Food is also always cold, oily & soggy. Better close down",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116355801426763116079/reviews
