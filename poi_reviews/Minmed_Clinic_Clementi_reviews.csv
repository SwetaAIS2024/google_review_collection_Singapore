RK Zhang,1,"Extremely terrible experience!! We visited this clinic at 10 am and were told the next turn was us. The waiting time should be HALF an hour, however in the end we had to wait for 3 hours. Really bad and totally spoiled our Saturday morning. We understood walk-in normally need to wait for longer but it makes no sense that let us wait for Three hours with the expectation of HALF an hour. The information from the reception is totally misleading and helpless. If you donâ€™t want to waste your time, please go to another place. I believe an arbitrary clinic can do much better than this one.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107854763720195521463/reviews
yan143 mas,1,"Had a bad experience today (20/11/24) with the 2 nurse both are so rude. I don't understand why doctor can keep stuff like them. I'm a regular customer bcz doctor are a nice person only problem is the stuff.

1) go counter got ignore
2) ask questions but got reply rudely
3) say 20min waiting time and I see only got two or three people but then they let appointment people in without informed us and we wait around 1 hour.
4) give medication like give (tissue packet) no plastic and act like plastic need to pay 5c.
Please doctor take notes and don't let your clinic have a bad name bcz of your rude stuff.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108664251301638783523/reviews
Corrine Tan,1,"My daughter, Esther Tan had booked health screening appointment at this clinic on 28 March, Friday at 10.30am.  She was being attended by Dr. Martus Lin, who had taken her blood pressure BUT without taking down her BP reading, isn't it so hilarious, just because he kept talking to my daughter as she had a very strong British accents, until the clinic front desk have to contact my daughter to take her own measurement, luckily I have the BP machine at home, if not, the front desk staff had requested my gal to travel down to this clinic again.

Is this how a professional Doctor should react to a patient especially when doing health screening?",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114605597708221616920/reviews
Huimin Kim,3,"Very odd. Reception rarely picks up calls, we tried reaching out to clinic on multiple occasions over several days, but no one pick up the phone. Management should look into this and correct it",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102223391355423739661/reviews
Yu Hsin Seah,1,"Worst health screening encounter I have ever had. Made an appointment and paid for a health screening more than 3 weeks ago. One day before appointment, received a whatsapp to say there was no doctor present on weekends (took 3 weeks to figure that out) and so had to rescheduled the appointment to the following Monday despite plans already made. Went ahead to take leave from work to make it for the 2:30pm appointment on Monday, only to receive another whatsapp 2 hours before the appoint to say they have no doctor on duty and to move to a different clinic (Jurong East / Holland Village / Redhill). Chose to move the appointment to Jurong East, and was told no more available appointment timing for health screening in Jurong East.  To Minmed, please have some respect for others' time.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106318503023766537808/reviews
