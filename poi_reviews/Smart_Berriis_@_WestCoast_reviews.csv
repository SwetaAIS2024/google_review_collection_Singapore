Shirley Goh,5,"Our youngest son joined the playgroup class in August 2024, and we could not be happier with his experience. Mrs. Fong, in particular, has been excellent. Her warmth and genuine love for children, and her extensive experience puts us completely at ease. We are also grateful for Ms. Elizabeth, who is also very caring and dedicated. As an educator myself, I deeply value their sacrifice, the long hours they put in, and the smiles they bring into the classroom. We are so thankful to have them guiding our youngest as he takes his first step in learning.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102861383330130887444/reviews
