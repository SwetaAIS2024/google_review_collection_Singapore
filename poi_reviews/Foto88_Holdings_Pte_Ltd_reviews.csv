Belle Mah,5,"I enjoyed working with the team for the convocation bears as well as the ordering of gown bags. I am impressed by the wide range of gifts Foto88 has to offer. Good service was rendered, especially when our timeline was tight and because factories in China were facing lockdowns and shipments were quite unstable; the team was quite reassuring and followed up promptly when there was an update. I will look for Daniel and Geok Eng for giftings in the future! Once again, I extend my appreciation to the team for the great follow ups.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110939123958865296939/reviews
