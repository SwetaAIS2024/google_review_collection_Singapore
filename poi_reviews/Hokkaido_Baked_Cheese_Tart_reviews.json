In the end all 3 of our tarts mixed together, all the liquid cheese inside leaked all over the box/container.     My point is, if customer choose not to buy 5+1.  Then they‚Äôll get crumbled cheese tart? As shop don have better way to package the cheese tart with lesser quantity like 3?",

      "text": "This was the first time I had the Hokkaido Baked Cheese Tarts, Original Flavored. If not for their 6th Anniversary 1 for 1 Promotion, I most probably will not have the opportunity to enjoy the tart. They were absolutely Scrumptious!!!! My strong yearning for the baked cheese tart started after I saw the creamy yummy cheese flowing out of the half-eaten tart by my colleague. When I bought a box of 6 baked cheese tarts, after treating my colleagues, I unwittingly devoured the remainder 3 cheese tarts in less than 5 mins, and I was in heaven! It was fabulous! As you can see from the photo, all the original flavored Hakkaido Baked Cheese Tarts were sold & gone, all boxed up waiting for their buyers to collect. Yum yum yumz!!! Will definitely come back again!!! üëèüëçüí™üòãü§ó",

Went for 1 each of chocolate, brownie, durian, blueberry, almond chocolate and salted caramel.\n\nCan store in the fridge for 3 days and reheat only for 20-30 seconds in the microwave before eating them.\n\nDurian is an all-time favourite followed by chocolate.",

      "text": "Had tried the cheese tarts from the same brand while in Japan and they were outstanding. However, what I was craving in this visit was the Hokkaido soft serve. I would say that I‚Äôm a bit disappointed and probably scarred for life after having the Cremia and Milkcream Hokkaido milk soft serve ice-cream in Japan. I‚Äôve been comparing all the places in Singapore to it and nothing even comes close. My search will continue in future because even this place doesn‚Äôt come anywhere close to it. I‚Äôll probably try out the cheese-tarts here but not the soft serve for sure.",
