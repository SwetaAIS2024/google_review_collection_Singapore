The meat were all tender and juicy. Specially love the roasted pork belly. There is outdoor seating so pets are welcomed",

      "text": "Had dinner at Georges @ Wild West, a chill spot with good food and casual vibes. Ordered the Half BBQ Baby Pork Ribs ($26.90) and Beer Battered Dory & Chips ($17.90).\n\nThe ribs were tender, slow-cooked for four hours, according to the staff. You can really taste the effort. The dory was nicely battered and crispy, and the fries were crispy, just how I like them.\n\nA nice touch, their salad greens are sourced from a local farm, which supports the community and adds a freshness you can taste. Itâ€™s these small details that make the meal feel more thoughtful.",

Nothing much to see.\nOrdered steak, carbonara, impossible burger, chicken chop etc. Portion is small. Taste wise average. Food took a while to serve. For 6pax, we spent about $270+.",

The milkshake served was way far off from what was shown in the menu. Can't get our refund and were given the excuses that the image was taken during the early development phase. We had no choice but to accept, tasted like vanilla milkshake with slight hint of salted caramel. Definitely not recommending anyone to visit for their food at this price point.",
