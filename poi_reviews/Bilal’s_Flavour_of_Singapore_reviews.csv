WJ Y,1,Really worst mee goreng ever had. Chicken mee goreng full of bone inside the Maggie. I waited 25 minutes for it and i saw with my own eyes they did not include the egg i ordered. I told them and the guy tried to argue with me till i showed him the receipt. No wonder there is no one eating there. Avoid this at all cost. All the 5 star review must be fake account. The food is really bad I wouldn‚Äôt even feed my dog with it. Look at photos for reference,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111362366829268925021/reviews
Meddie Tan,1,"this stall used to have good service and good food, not sure if they have change staff or boss, their service was very disappointing. order was taken 5mins ago and they forgot to make. (1 egg and 3 plain prata) when collecting the order, total amount was $5.60, given $10 and change returned was $4.10. reason given was not enough coins!!!! never mind, we asked for extra plate and curry, they just said don't have and served the next customer. how rude!!! 4 pieces of prata it's meant for sharing why can't give extra plate??? the prata was charred and tasted hard, curry was too spicy that it didn't taste like curry anymore. my friend ordered mee Goreng and was given maggie goreng. think we won't patronise this stall again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116879215984448163914/reviews
