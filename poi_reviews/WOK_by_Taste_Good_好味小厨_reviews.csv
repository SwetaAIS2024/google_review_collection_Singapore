Clo’s Laobu,4,"Food is above average. Ordered cereal chicken rice with egg and mee goreng. Recommend cereal chicken but not the mee goreng.
Mee goreng isn’t sweet, salty and spicy enough. Ended up I need to add in chilli sauce to boost up the taste. Total cost is $16.50 for 2 plates of rice.
Atmosphere is good as they have plenty of seats available during dinner time too.
This is location at level 1.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114142484779850595642/reviews
Ben Loy,4,"Spacious, and relatively affordable eatery compared to restaurants upstairs. Portion size is acceptable. There is a wide variety of mini wok style of food for a quick meal. Really liked it, will be back if in the area",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115067595425147527913/reviews
S M Hong,4,"Our ample visits to this DTE outlet

The lady cashier and the uncle server are very polite and friendly!!

We ordered a curry fish head ($28), broccoli with scallops ($22) and salted egg chicken ($17). All were scrumptious and flavourful.

However do come earlier (preferably) before 7.30pm), if you prefer soupy dishes as they are sold out pretty fast",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113450782485492001332/reviews
Patrick Lau,4,"Grab a table, secure a menu, decide what you want then place your order at the cashier.  After paying, grab your receipt and order sign and wait for your food at your table

Food quality wise: taste is close to Malaysia style zichar.  Portions are decent and we are pretty happy with what we had

Service is good and friendly

We would probably be back the next time but will leave special request with our order: less salt please",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106881591692184457438/reviews
Gladys,5,"Surprised to see an outlet here! Have been going to the Sim Lim one for many years. Price seems to be slightly pricier here but I got my food within 3-4 minutes on a weekend lunch time, very nice staff. Very hot, very delicious! Love the salted egg chicken!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118430873399253327796/reviews
