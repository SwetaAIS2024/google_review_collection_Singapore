Vasudhevan S,1,"I am shocked to see that a reputable company like Dassault is engaging thugs to threaten unrelated SMEs, in the name of copyright violation.

We are a company working with chemicals and has nothing to do with design softwares that Dassault owns.

We were surprised to see a legal notice from one of the lawyers in India demanding compensation for copyright violation. We explained them that we have no business to use such design software. Still the lawyer insisted that we are using the Solidworks software illegally.

I had a doubt whether any of the employees use the office laptop for private works illegally with Solidworks software and so asked the IT staff to check all the company laptops.

IT staff checked all laptops and confirmed that none of the company laptops contain the Solidworks software. The same was informed to the lawyer.

Still, the lawyer is constantly sending harassing emails demanding payment. It seems that the lawyers are engaged to be paid base on the number of demands they make.

I request Dassault Systemes to focus on illegal users of the software and block such use, instead of threatening unrelated SME wasting our precious time and energy.

Also, I await an apology from Dassault Systemes for the extortion attempts using third parties, in the name of the company.

In case of no postive action, we may have to lodge a police compliant in Singapore for the harassment and attempt for extortion.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113275505811176528433/reviews
