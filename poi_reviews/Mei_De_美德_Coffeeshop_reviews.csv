Jasper Teiw,1,"The mixed vegetable caifan stall's pricing is crazy. A portion of fried pork, which is full of fats, cost $3. This whole packet of rice cost $6.10 which was absurd in my opinion.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115866313306662601048/reviews

Richard Tan,5,"First visit and highly recommended by my sister in law. Newly renovated. Toilet modern and clean. Let's hope the public will use it responsibly.

This coffee shop is huge with many stalls. Good selection and good food.

The contractor engaged to cleans the tables do a good job. Unlike other hawker centres where the cleaners simply sweep the leftover food stuff on to the floor and do not clean the tables.

I hope the supervisor continue to motivate the staff to do well. Afterall, this is our country and we should be proud to keep everything and everywhere clean.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108098066731754425249/reviews
