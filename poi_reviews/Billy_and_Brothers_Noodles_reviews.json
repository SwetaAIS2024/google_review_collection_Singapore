      "text": "This noodle stall is primarily famous for their Sarawak üá≤üáæ Kolo Mee. Nested in the far east of Singapore, along Loyang Way, industrial park coffee shop, you will find Billy & Brothers Noodle stall.\n\nStaff : Really just one guys‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ The chef üßëüèæ‚Äçüç≥ himself takes the order, cooks and settle Grab delivery all by himself. He is polite and damn fast! A queue may form up but it will be cleared quickly.  He is pretty easy going and is happy to switch ‚Äúitem‚Äù if you don‚Äôt like or don‚Äôt eat them.\n\nFood : Good! The Sarawak Kolo Mee üçú is Springy (aka QQ) and authentic. The sauce that he use is just right and not too oily. When stirred with the noodles, it gives off a perfect texture. The Lor Mee on the other hand is just ‚Ä¶. Lor Mee at best. Nothing really special about it, does get clampy when it is cold. If you have only one shot at this stall, go for the Sarawak Kolo Mee $5.50.\n\nOverall a satisfying meal to have in a local coffee shop. The prices are very reasonable üìâ and good.\n\nPro Tip : Go early‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ lunch time can be very crowded, order a take away if you need and come back and get it later.",

      "text": "Ordered Sarawak Kolo Mee ($5.50); added 2 fuzhou meatballs for $1.50. Total price $7..\n\nNoodles cooked quite well, springy and absorbs the sauce too! Portion of minced meat is reasonable and tastes pretty alright; nothing too fancy, not the best kolo mee but tastes decent still. Overall portion for the noodles is reasonable for the price & ration of noodles to the sauce is just right. Would recommend if you‚Äôve never tried it before!",
