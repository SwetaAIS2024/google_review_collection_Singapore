Katherine N. Mendoza,5,"We had a great dinner experience here! food are great! we recommend the mains - Salmon and spring chicken. They both are really tasty and the natural spices complement the salmon or chicken.
Portion is large compared to other hotel fine dining restaurants.
Service is great as the staff are mostly friendly Filipino and very hospitable!
This restaurant deserves 5 stars!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102507829984676559623/reviews
Sharon B,2,"I was drawn by the positive reviews on Google and decided to try the afternoon tea set.

Despite the restaurant being way less than half full, the service was disorganised and notably slow. It was difficult to get the attention of the staff, and I waited 40 minutes for the afternoon tea set to be served — quite disappointing.

The only redeeming point was that the staff accommodated my request to replace one of the sweets with an alternative. However, the ladyfingers in the tiramisu were much too dry. While the rest of the food was generally enjoyable, the level of service falls short of expectations, especially for a restaurant located in the World’s Best Airport Hotel and Best Airport Hotel in Asia.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112395661529617800532/reviews
Yamin Thu,3,"The beef brisket pizza was good. The lobster pasta was aight, I don’t really like the basil taste. Steak was very pricey for what it’s worth. Dined with the eatigo 50% discount but not sure why the steak didn’t have any discount. The steak alone was $138 (extremely pricey)",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108257759113509819231/reviews
Sandiago Yung,5,"Service is good, the staffs are super friendly. The pizzas are delicious. lasagna is tasty! I love the bread too.
