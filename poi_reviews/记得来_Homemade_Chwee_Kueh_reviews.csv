LP Pua,4,"The stall sells traditional breakfast food. Service was slow because it was a one woman operation. The Chwee Kway and Chee Cheong Fun were standard and no frills type. The century egg porridge was the star of the breakfast. She added one whole century egg into a bowl, cut it up into small pieces, and then poured hot plain porridge into the bowl, followed by a few types of sauces and oil. It really lived up to its name, and it was one of the better century egg porridge we have had for a while.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
