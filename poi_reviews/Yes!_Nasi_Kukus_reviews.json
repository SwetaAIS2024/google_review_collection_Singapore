The drumstick skin is crispy & the meat is moist, but tasted very bland, totally no seasoning at all! The curry gravy is also not very tasty & lack of curry fragrance. Not what I've expected after reading the good reviews.",

Most of the time I would think that it will be hard to eat, but this doesn’t disappoint. As with the other menu option, prices are really good.",
