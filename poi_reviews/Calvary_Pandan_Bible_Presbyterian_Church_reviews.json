There is a strong vibe of superiority complex in this place of worship, as if they are the only few exclusive churches remaining that is chosen for salvation.\n\nIt seems that they believe that their faith surpass many other churches with pride, and they equate legalism to obedience, uncompromising and unwavering faith.",

I really like the singing time where my children learn many many songs. My children enjoyed going to school to learn. Reasonable amount of homework is given each week at k1 and k2 level. There are also after school enrichment activities like art, Chinese kidstart, abacus that you can consider signing your child up for.",
