Highly recommended too as itâ€™s open during Sunday morning, which some places we needed to see doctor on the weekend but most of the clinic is closed. Guess I have found my newly favorite clinic here! Thank you Dr Tan & team. ðŸ˜Š",

He shows concern, explains clearly the possible issues and shares the different medical interventions I can consider. My wife swears by the clinic and I have never thought much about it. But I do know now why. Kudos to Dr Tan and team! I guess I have found a new family doctor!",
