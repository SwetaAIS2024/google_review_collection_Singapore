      "text": "Recently media have covered about Forest city, so perhaps it‚Äôs also time to post this review. It‚Äôs been a while since I was at Forest city. This review finally got its way to contribution.\n\nDriving to Forest city is already quite a feat, being far from anyway except 2nd link, and if you recalled about the collapsed road, you will get a short glimpse of it when entering Forest city.\n\nAfter looking for a parking, walking to light bar was a little distance, recommended on another media review, we thought the place is worth visiting and it did not disappoint us to see the place and its environment. What‚Äôs is probably lacking is the food and the drinks are a little sweet, pretty similar to desserts.\n\nStaff service is a little lacking maybe because the staff didn‚Äôt really give any enthusiasm to having customers visiting the cafe, hopefully that they will improve as they work longer here. It would be good if they can show more interest in service.\n\nOwner of the cafe is there and was interested in knowing how we found them, I think this place deserves a chance and with a friendly boss what can go wrong?\n\nOh, watch out for crocodiles, please share if you really saw any. By the way, I feel the water level is so near to you, I wonder why the coastline has the feel that the sea is about to eat you up. ;)",
