Hrmgr,4,Near to the more famous Nasi Lemak stall but that queue was slow moving. This stall serves as tasty for Nasi Lemak and price is cheaper by comparison. Enjoy the food with lots of sambal provided.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews
Ridzuan Md Nazir,5,"Simple delicious and hi-quality home cooked food. You're gonna need extra helpings for their nasi lemak sambal. Oh don't forget to try their lontong too, it's filled to the brim with the usual goodies and rich gravy. It's Outstanding! üëçüëçüëç",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108433423139141447926/reviews
Victor Ng,4,"Longtong was fragrant with good balance of sweet and saltiness. The tau kwa and vegetables had enough time to soak up the goodness of the gravy.

Nasi padang also the bomb!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115343125507441223772/reviews
sunsik kim,5,"It was my first time trying nasi lemak, and it was a really pleasant experience. Rice with gentle coconut scent blended really well with red sambal sauce. Chicken was fried like pro, and other components of dish like fried anchovy and fish pudding also went well with the rice. Loved it!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103220092418809760543/reviews
T Tan,5,"Legit nasi padang. One look you know sure sedap.

Nasi Minyak looks abit ordinary but actually very tasty. Not oily. All dishes well done not too spicy or too oily.

Friendly and fun folks...",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105342097727930447553/reviews
