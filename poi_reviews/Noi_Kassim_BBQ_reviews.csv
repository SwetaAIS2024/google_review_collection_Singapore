Sam K,5,If must have been one of the best sambal sting ray and sotong I had in many many years. Highly recommended. First time I had cereal prawn and it was addictive. We will be back for more and highly recommended.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100680635125732126785/reviews
Amirul Afiq,2,"2.5/5: Salted Egg Chicken w rice
2.5/5: Cereal Chicken w rice

Observing the photos of others posting, the salted egg chicken looks like its cooked differently (no chili, no curry leaves). The sauce is also rather watery making this combination rather lacking in taste.

Cereal chicken too. It taste more like an ayam goreng than a cereal chicken. Could be cooked without the use of butter mix the cereal with chicken together.

I guess if you want to eat here, to be safe, get their seafood/bbq food (:",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113215091442406768793/reviews
Mohd Nazra Mohd Said,5,"Hands down one of the best places for BBQ seafood! The sambal stingray is top-tier, and the cereal prawn & salted egg sotong are both cooked to perfection, giving you a juicy, succulent and satisfying bite (not overcooked like other eateries). Try it for yourself; your tummy will thank you later!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112606335698965166530/reviews
Wing Seng Chan,4,Ordered the beef fried rice. The fried rice is on the wetter side. Less oily and salty. Although the overall taste is blend but I can feel they are cooking this from a healthier approach.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105552990408975757039/reviews
Nurul Afifah,5,"Ordered the barbeque set with Stingray which comes with rice topped with a fried egg. It costs $7 and you can even make payment via DBS PayLah.

The taste was great and the portion size was bigger than I expected.

Would definitely come back here again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100696263247067775374/reviews
