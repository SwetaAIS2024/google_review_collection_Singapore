Darius Teo,5,"We enjoyed the food here in general, including the dessert. Had the Whole snapper which was quite well cooked for most part except for certain portions which were just a tad bit overcooked; The sauce that went with it was nice as well.

Beef was cooked to medium rare; Generally nice and juicy. Service was great and food didn‚Äôt take too long to come. Wouldn‚Äôt mind coming back here because of the ambience and the pretty good tasting grilled meats.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100762480199192629956/reviews
jacelyn tan,5,"The 5 course set lunch is very worth it. The crispy see bass and pandan creme br√ªl√©e are exceptionally good. The medium steak with fries also very good. The ambience is nice and quiet with view of the yacht outside.
The service staff Rocky is very attentive and polite.
Highly recommended.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116259366725941198324/reviews

catherine leung,4,"Overview: Grill restaurant serving steaks, seafood and other western mains located at Keppel Bay with both indoor and outdoor seating overlooking the harbour.

Pros‚úÖ: Lunch set menu is good value for money; 2-courses for $28 and 3-courses for $32. Service was also great by our server Rocky. Great ambience and location. Offered free bread at the beginning which was great added value and desserts stood out for me and the sea bass main.

Cons‚ùå: A-la-carte menu is much more expensive and i‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs not worth the price so highly recommend going for the lunch menu instead. The seafood pasta also was not the best as the tomato sauce didn‚Äôt seem cooked from scratch from fresh tomatoes and seafood didn‚Äôt seem that fresh and the dish was a bit watery in general.
