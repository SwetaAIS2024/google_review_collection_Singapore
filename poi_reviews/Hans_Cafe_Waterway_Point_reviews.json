      "text": "An okay place to have a fuss free meal. Standards do vary wildly on different days, what you are essentially paying for is western food and local delights in a slightly more comfortable environment than hawker centres. Sweet and sour fish is soggy dory and bad on any day. Fish and chips, Hong Kong noodles, scrambled eggs and seafood horfun can be quite good depending I guess on the day or chef. The horfun is the most consistent of the lot followed by the breakfast set. The hk noodles can taste very bland and oily and sometimes the fried eggs in the sandwiches are completely overcooked. The sausage in the breakfast set seemed to have a weird gingerly note since a few years back. Standards have not been improving but the prices have been steadily rising for years.",

The staffs were friendly and polite though. It as crowded when we came and we waited for 10 mins for a table hence would advise to avoid lunch period if you are rushing for time",
