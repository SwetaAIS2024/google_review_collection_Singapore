Room was very comfortable and clean as the staff cleans it after every session. Room was sound proof as we wonâ€™t disturb by the room next door.\nLove the big tv and sound system, which allowed us to enjoy the movies like we are in the cinema.\nDownside was that the wifi connection was pretty bad due to the rain and the amount of people in the vicinity. But with the help of the staff, it was solved to a certain extent.\n\nAnyways,\nWill come back again! Great service & great place to chill and relax :)",
