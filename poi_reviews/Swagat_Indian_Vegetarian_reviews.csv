Indian vegetarian stall with a friendly male and lady boss

Tried it 1st time a few weeks back and was served by the friendly male boss... patiently explained some of the dishes I wanted to order and also recommend alternative dishes to try

Masala Dosa... the 1st dish was prepared with masala potato that seem to be have pre-fried with onion oil before being wrapled in Dosa... best I ever had
Onion tomato uttapum... interesting pizza like dish
Samosa... additive fried potato triangular curry puff

Anikaz Travel,5,"The food is scrumptious and mouth watering. They have exclusive deals such as their buffets and discounts. Their food is authentic Karnataka cuisine especially coastal Karnataka. They change their menus every Saturday and their food is fresh and hot.It is also a pure vegetarian restaurant.
I recommend the methi parata and paneer.
They also do deliveries.

I recommend the amazing rava masala dosa. It was heavenly and I absolutely enjoyed its pairing with madhur vada which is a flat vada that is filled with flavour. So decadent and rich absolutely divine. The vada Pav is beautifully prepared with chutney of various flavours and a melody of the potatoes as it melts into your mouth- just like in Mumbai!!
Overall, an amazing place which I definitely recommend.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100371975357068365869/reviews
