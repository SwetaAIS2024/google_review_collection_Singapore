      "text": "Better do not enrol your kids into this cc, the quality of food given and caregive totally not up to standards. If a kid were to fall, no records were to be written or taken note, instead the cc calls to ask you. And at ifc,same type of porridge were given every single day without fail, fish porridge. If your kid were to vomit, they sometimes do not know at all. Most importantly,with HFMD, they do not make official statement ,and what procedures they are gonna do. Instead the principal just whatsapp to inform thats all.",

      "text": "Such childcare, with no activities given not up to date software unlike other childcare wheres every week updates of kids activities. Or even upcoming mother days activities also not teached to the kids. Like simple drawing or photo taking or anything else. Yet school fees were higher then others care centre, uniform also so much higher then other care centre. Even way before in the infant-care when wanna pick up my kid even can see the teacher sleep while sitting down. ?",
