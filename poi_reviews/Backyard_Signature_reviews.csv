Paul Toh,4,"Backyard griller serves up a decent western fare. Honestly, I think they could be one of the best in Punggol. Full disclaimer: I have no shares or interest in the company.
The chicken cutlet is big and juicy, the sides of onion rings and coleslaw are well prepared. I think they could be the only western food offering decent choices of sides within 500m of Punggol central.
The carbonara and salmon is generous. Salmon is thick and juicy.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110110584107240453374/reviews
Mikail Yah,1,"Used to be decent but recently their portion getting smaller.

Also the guy serving at the counter is rude.

Also ordered a pork chop but was served a chicken chop.

Seriously will never patronise this stall even if it‚Äôs the last western food stall in Punggol.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114771121650386125948/reviews
GAO TIFFANY,1,"We stay nearby and being a regular customer. The food was delicious and big portion when the stall just got renovated last year.
The standard has dropped dramatically for recent visits. I didn‚Äôt expect the pork rib looks in this way, appetite lose instantly. With restaurant price but not even hawker standard now. So disappointed!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117672147277944200297/reviews
Isaac L,5,"Why all the bad reviews?? Luckily, most of them are from a year ago. I have to say, the steak I ordered was cooked perfectly medium rare, and let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîit‚Äôs RARELY done right at hawker centers. This time, the chef absolutely nailed it! I was supposed to enjoy the steak myself, but my daughter loved it so much she ended up eating most of it (and this is already after her lunch) The coleslaw was also really good‚Äîfresh and tasty. For the price and the quality, this place is a gem. You‚Äôve definitely won over TWO new customers (yes, you have to count my daughter too!). We‚Äôll be back for sure!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103715143213981871749/reviews
Boon Leong,5,"Stall located at the corner of the coffeeshop.
Not prominent enough to attract attention.
Served one of the best pasta around
Truffles mushroom üçÑ soup is a must to try for those who like truffle favor.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118439101019407877742/reviews
