The café has a warm and cozy feel with lovely decoration. It is located in Carlton Hotel, which is very convenient. A great place to relax and enjoy some quiet time.",

      "text": "Nice hotel ambience but service lacks smile and quite devoid of the essence of hospitality. Lone front staff is efficient but offers no smile throughout order taking and food serving. Coffee is good and puff is good. A pity…the dining experience feels like a transaction, which is nothing wrong but being a cafe in a hotel, I suppose it will be nice to dine and feel like it’s not a food court experience.",

      "text": "We were given a complimentary afternoon tea set from Tuxedo during our stay at Carlton Hotel. Though a small quiet cafe tucked at one corner of the hotel lobby, it serves good pastries. The chocolate cake and the signature chicken pie surpassed our expectation. The cake is moist and not cloyingly sweet; the chocolate layer has a tint of orange flavour and melts in your mouth. The chicken pie is original in taste with lots of chicken chunks and vegetables, full flavour yet not overly rich. The kids couldn't get enough of them though they just had their lunch not long before. We will certainly be back to get more!",

When the cake came, the message was wrong. A word was missed out. i had to wait for the mazipan to be rewritten. I asked to check to make sure that i got the correct cake. The counter staff opened one corner to show me the red colour. i thot ok, correct cake. When i got home, and open up the box fully there was a crack on the edge of the cake. White shows through the red of the cake.",

It would have been great if only service personnel are more attentive.\n\nLong story short, it’s a simple careless service whom the personnel are more involved with each other and forgot an order to be served.\n\nIt was not a busy period - 3 tables plus us, and with 2 service personnel, it makes it more inappropriate why they forgot an order immediately after it was placed.\n\nA very casual wave us over and “pls choose a cake as an apologies and your orders was served to another (phantom?) table by mistake)” explanation just doesn’t cut the cake.\n\nI would appreciate a more attentive and diligent personality without the cake.\n\nWe didn’t take the cake in the end.",
