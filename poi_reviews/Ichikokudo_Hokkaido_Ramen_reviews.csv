He brought our food out quickly and the meals were nicely cooked.
Hot and tasty.

Ashley Liew,5,Our first time here couple nights ago for my family. Fortunately able to get a seat here. The kids meal ramen was great for our boy. The ramen was also unique for adults. The salmon don was lacking in salmon. Service was quite okay. We overall enjoyed ourselves here. Thank you! üôèüèª,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
Kartika Pratiwi,5,"Such a great taste of ramen. We have ordered Ichikokudo Ramen with extra rich to experience the creamy ramen. We love it, and sure will come back here in the next visit.

Nurrusydiah Abdul Rahim,5,"Actually have went here several times. Decided to try the sapporo miso beef ramen for the first time. The beef portion is generous and the soup is so creamy but kinda salty. But no worries, I'm a salty tooth so I can take it. And that is my personal reference. Lol. Wish that the salt intake could be lesser so people can enjoy more of the taste. Apart from that, the service was good, thanks to Rashid and the team. Kuddos! üôÇ",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102071746346957101626/reviews
Albert Le,3,"Fairly ordinary Japanese ramen house. This particular location is in Terminal 3 of Changi Airport.  The food was ok, nothing special but sufficient to satisfy a hungry appetite.  The ordering process was unnecessarily cumbersome. Staff were too busy and difficult to get their attention.  Hopefully, other locations offer better dining experience for customers.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112791464418136875741/reviews
