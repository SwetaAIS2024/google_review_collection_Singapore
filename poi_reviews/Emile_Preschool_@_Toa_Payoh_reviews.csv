YW TaY,5,"We found Emile Pre-school after shifting into the neighborhood. The founder/owner and principal are academics from local Uni and designed their own curriculums. This branch is newly setup so it is very clean and the owner emphasize on quality organic food is a plus. Teachers are very patience and  passionate with kids. My girl adapted quickly, love the classes and the food!
Highly recommended for parents to consider in the area.....",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105025991155557920141/reviews
Jermaine Wong,5,"After visiting several preschools, I chose Emile Preschool for my daughter because of its holistic, inquiry-based curriculum, which includes enriching activities like speech and drama, STEM, and calligraphy. The environment is bright, clean, and well-organized—better than some branded preschools I visited. The teachers and staff are warm and pleasant too.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114985499035371404737/reviews
Kelvin Leung,5,"We found Emile when doing a search for preschools. On visiting, we were impressed by the environment, facilities and most importantly, the faculty are really passionate and friendly towards the children. Onboarding process is seamless and unlike some other preschools, there is very good cross communication between parents and staff.

We would highly recommend Emile to anyone looking for a warm and competent preschool!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101454725977407336363/reviews
Edmund Koh,5,"Since we are moving, we had to look for a new preschool for our little one. We visited a number around the area and were quite impressed with Emile Preschool and their staff.

It's the end of day one and my little one seems to be very happy with the teachers and friends! I am confident it will remain this way!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110827601695954047500/reviews
