Shaolin Leong,5,"My photo will explain everything.......just look at the queue!!!
Run by Mr Choi & wife from HK now a citizen,
Stalls is open 358 days (except the market washing days every 3 mths & CNY )rain or shine .
Hardworking & chatty but not during rush hour ! 🤣 Rich thick coffee & tea at $1.30 is what I enjoyed . As Mr Choi is from Hong Kong their鸳鸯 is good too !  Lemon tea & sugar cane with lemon is nice & freshing too ! No price increase from them , trying hard to keep things affordable as there lots of retirees and old people living in this area.I am one of them staying in this area for 40 years.
Come & try it , if you are in the neighborhood.
As 2 coffee a day keeps the doctor away !
Mr Choi is always funny & entertaining  !!! He hires senior citizens to help out at his stores. So exercise understanding & patience especially during lunch time.As it works for some not for others .
Stall opens at 8:30am daily for business.
Longest queue in the market besides the wanton noodles stall ! Look at the photo attached.

Read some of his reviews earlier don't think they are fair ! Not taking sides but Communication is always 2 ways ..........some reviewers said not worth the price ....but they are already the cheapest coffee stall in the market  .
Some said poor service .......there is a sign written at their stall that says self service ! 🤣

Be clear in your order be it take away or consume there especially during peak hour.
And don't give people 10x5 cents coins lah !
Aging population my friends both local & foreigners so be patient when dealing with the seniors !

You go YaKun pay $7 for toast eggs & coffee also self service lah ! Kpkb for what ? Not your cup of tea drink once & that's it !
当你觉得全世界都不妥的话!
那问题一定是你而不是全世界 !

Tarun,1,Double the price! Bought sugarcane juice with sour plum from this store at double the price as compared to one right opposite. Worse was that it was diluted!! Avoid!!,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106619328031930619313/reviews
ray chong,1,"The food is definitely not worth the value that I paid for. I ordered a standard breakfast set which consists of a drink, butter toast and soft-boiled eggs. When I cracked the egg, I realised that it was overcooked for way to long and it was already hard boiled. I showed the owner the state of the egg and kindly requested if I could change it. Instead of apologising for his mistake of leaving the egg in the water too long, he hid behind his lie saying that’s how he normally cooks it. He was actually having a set of soft boiled eggs in front of me. Definitely DO NOT BUY FROM this stall.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107926741278506435106/reviews
