Place was cosy, but the ventilation was quite bad at the dinning area.\n\nMee Hoon Kueh - 4.5/5 (Well executed dish, got to try this)\n\nCurry chicken set - 4/5 (Nice and decent taste, but the presentation was off)\n\nNasi lemak set - 3/5 (Wrong choice of rice used. Sides dishes look very normal)\n\nGrilled Squid - 4/5 (Have the char taste which I like, but why so watery cos it supposed to be \"Grilled\")",

You have to try it to know!\n\nThe fish and chips are nice! They donâ€™t use tasteless dolly fish, and you can really taste the difference. The pizza is delicious too! Everything is a must-try!\nçŽ‹æ˜±æ¸…& his wife are very friendly :)",

Excellent service, had a nice chat with the owner. A few of their specialty is cooked from scratch so expect longer waiting time. If you are there for the first time you will be briefed.
