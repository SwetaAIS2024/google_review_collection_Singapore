Carol C,2,"I joined a 3-day videography course starting today and was quite shocked by the setup. The course is conducted right at the main entrance of the school, where the reception area is busy with people registering, talking, and constantly walking in and out. There’s also a lot of movement with people getting coffee or going to the restroom, which is very distracting.

While the trainer is excellent and highly skilled, the arrangement is very disappointing. Without a proper classroom, it’s challenging to stay focused and fully concentrate on the course. I hope the management can improve the learning environment for future participants.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114255621193174943392/reviews

Arfian,5,"Attended a 2 days Sound Mixing course, it was an amazing 2 days filled with fun knowledge. Trainer Zulhilmi was awesome, making the class fun, entertaining and engaging.

Kudos to the team at Hustle Singapore for making it a wonderful experience from the registration process right up to the end of the course!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103438487185675664683/reviews
Noor Irwan Rashid,5,"I really enjoyed this course—perfectly paced over three Sundays, it offered a great balance of theory and hands-on practice. Jason Wong was a knowledgeable and engaging trainer who explained complex editing techniques in a clear, beginner-friendly way. His real-world tips on shooting with mobile devices were especially useful. I’m walking away feeling much more confident about creating quality video content. A bit more time for practice during the sessions would have made it a 6 star experience!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107929542597563579543/reviews
Shereen Tan,5,"I had a wonderful experience at the learning center! The facilities were top-notch, the staff was incredibly friendly, and the environment was so clean and inviting. Our trainer Ms Alce ( AI Graphic Design) was truly exceptional – knowledgeable, patient, helpful and a great communicator. Their time management skills were also impressive! I'm so glad I chose this center for my learning journey.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114078882574799038288/reviews
