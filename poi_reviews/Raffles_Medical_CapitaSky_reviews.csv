soleha nisaa,5,"all good. i went here for renewal employment pass medical checkup.

reach there 8.30am for registration, xray, blood test and doctor consultation. surprisingly it only took 40 min to complete everything including waiting time. (managed to complete everything around 9.10am)

Doctor and all staff really nice. they communicate in good manners.

cons: i prefer them to call our number instead of our name one by one.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111425319091781237620/reviews
Yuki Han,5,"Got my pre-employment medical check-up done here. Super efficient, kind nurses & doctors! üòä Everything done within an hour. Great job Raffles Medical! üëçüèº",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103912243373009967870/reviews
S.L.,5,"For Pre Employment Health Check:

I was afraid that it'll take hours according to all the reviews, but that was not the case at this clinic. Everything was done speedily, appointment at 10am, out by 10:27am on a Monday morning. Had to do an x-ray and urine test and usual checks. Kudos to the reception who seemed busy but were polite and clear, and Dr Foo who was personable and quick. Minimal waiting, was shuffled between checks quick.

Few people waiting, but it seemed that things moved really quickly for them as well. Fuss-free. Hope this balances out the other bad ratings from the past - things seem to have changed.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106010555680571726169/reviews
Asri Bamadhaj,1,"Was just there and the reviews about waiting time are true. I arrived at around 8:45 with 2-3 people in front of me. And there‚Äôs only 1 doctor. But waited for an hour and still didn‚Äôt get to see the doctor. While I saw others that arrived after me, get to consult the doctor.

Granted that it might be for other purposes, but it‚Äôs ridiculous to be waiting for an hour when you walk into an almost empty clinic.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110714717576602287530/reviews
