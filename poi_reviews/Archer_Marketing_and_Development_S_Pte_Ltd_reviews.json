      "text": "Authentic printing services from Canon are getting expensive, especially color printing hence we switched to this budget printing company. I thought I could last out the contract period but alas, not this company. From the start when the salesperson sold us a \"brand new\" model Canon machine and claimed we can check online that it is indeed brand new, I realized the printing quality when printing small words, the clarity is already way worse than my 5 year old Canon machine from Canon. The machine came to a grinding halt within 3 months after countless servicing and very high percentage of unusable copies printed, and the salesperson said it's beyond repair, and sometimes canon machines are just like that, and there is nothing we can do, but they can give me 'new' and very good xerox machine at the same price (the canon machine is more than 10k). We accepted due to the fact we had only that machine and we needed to continue our operation. Being not very experienced in business, I always took the hire purchase option, but in fact, old machines without support and usage are pretty worthless. Due to the constant breakdown of the xerox machine, they offered to give me another 'very good' machine, to use as backup. We have no more space so out of good will, I gave them my old canon machine, which I would say work 10x better than any of their old on-the-verge-of-collapsing 'brand new' machine. The second machine gave a heavily burnt smell, and after a bit of usage became completely unusable. To continue our operation, we had to get the service personnel to come down twice a week, and printed a lot of unusable copies, until finally, We decided the cost to our admin personnel calling their unresponsive support team to come down to service, and the time spent waiting(could be up to a week), and the faulty copies made, are a bit too much for us to bear. When I told the company I wish to terminate in advance, they asked me to pay severance cost. I have reasons to believe, I am not the only victim, since I have a bit of time, I will report them to consumer organization and small sums tribunal, for fraud, to do justice to the scam and the rubbish machine and services they have delivered. For those who are considering using their service, I wish you good luck. There are plenty of options in the market. This is the one company I would testify against.",
