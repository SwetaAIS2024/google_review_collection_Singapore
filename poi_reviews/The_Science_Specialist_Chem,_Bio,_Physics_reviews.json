      "text": "Mr Royston is the best tutor that I ever had. Before Mr Royston taught me I used to do terribly for both my Pure Physics and Chemistry Exams. (Around C6 - E8 Range) In fact, I hated chemistry and physics. However, when Mr Royston started teaching me I started enjoying physics and chemistry and my grades started to improve. In just a short period of time I managed to score B3 for both my O-Level Pure Science exams. (Mr Royston not only makes lessons fun and engaging, he has many techniques to help improve students learning) Other than the many techniques that helped improved my learning and understanding of the subject. He also imparted me methods to help me memorise. As a student who hates to memorise, I am always unable to memorise. However, using the methods that Mr Royston taught me I started being able to memorise things that I need.",

Mr Royston‚Äôs teaching techniques as well as cheerful personality make my son pay attention and remember the concepts he learns during the tuition session.\nMy son scored an A2 for his science chemistry component for his secondary three end of year exams and overall he scored an A1 for his combined science (phy/chem).\nWe appreciate Mr Royston‚Äôs dedicated and committee teaching approach and his ability to connect with students.",

He was also extremely well detailed and taught her key phrases and words when tackling specific questions for Biology! I‚Äôd say that it was more than delightful having Mr Roy as her Biology tutor and it has even been evident in her improved grades!",
