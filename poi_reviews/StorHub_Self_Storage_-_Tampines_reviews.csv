Nizam M.,5,"Very strongly recommended to take up the service and storage here. Thanks to both Sharon and Denise whom had assisted me in taking up a storage and even assisted along the way in downsizing from a larger sqft to a smaller unit.

Sky,5,"First time using self storage service and I must say Iâ€™m really impressed with the fuss free service provided.
Few important info for newbies:
(1) Can buy free carton box there (S/M/L)
(2) No transport/moving services
(3) 24/7 accessible
(4) Bring your own padlock
(5) Can self view the storage room onsite
(6) Have trolleys to borrow to use onsite

If you are moving boxes yourself , it is strongly recommended to buy medium boxes as big boxes are generally too heavy  for yourself to move unless the items are light. You can drive to their loading/unloading bay and unload using their trolleys and access to their lift via access code given to you. On the appropriate floors, you just need to find the room you rented and move all items yourself. The service staff mentioned customers can borrow ladders but I see none there. Will be good to place it at a common area at each floor for customers to borrow . Hope this info helps those renting self storage for the first time .",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100770304576606473090/reviews
