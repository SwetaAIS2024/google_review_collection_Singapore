There are not only amazing flowers but are arranged in beautiful pots or around some deco! The place is smaller than the other domes but there are so many flowers in such a small space you can easily spend hours in it. Not to mention there are waterfalls where waterfalls with patterns, photo locations to take photos.",

The blooms attract butterflies and visitors will be able to spot these and other insects fluttering amongst the plants in the day. An ideal spot for night time visits as many of the plants give off their scents in the evenings.",
