K K,4,"Good place to go for lunch if you are in Hive. And easy to grab good iced coffee.
This is by t the best place for coffee but it is cheaper than other places. So that it is a good place to have a coffee and other drinks.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104914297861576464336/reviews
Yang,3,"Carbonara $5.50
Just order this
Creamy and tasty
Got ham and mushroom.

Tom Yum Pasta($5.50)
Once again, a recommendation by NTU that did NOT meet my tastisfying foodventure.ðŸ˜•
Al dente spaghetti with 3 bouncy prawn, 3 clams & 3 soft chewy sotong ring. Everything is fine, the spiciness level is appropriate, the Tom Yum flavour is barely acceptable and a tad bit salty. But I feel it lacks some authenticness in it.

Hazelnut $4.50
Strong coffee taste with smooth milk and Hazelnut syrup.

Place is halal, so is safe for Muslims.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103078870952547064508/reviews
Cherilyn Lee,3,"paid 7.50. ordered grilled chicken but chicken was really dry even with the sauce :/

Trevor Yap,3,"The timing for food is very random. During off semester time, the chef suddenly were not around.
But I do like their aglio olio with grilled chicken but today it seem like they increase the price.
I do have friends of coop, but many time the cashier have no idea about the set meal and friend of coop can be used together hence charging me more than it should be.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114941079646224871877/reviews
W Beh,2,"Food is good but selection always changes without any notice. Was expecting to grab pasta on many occasions and made my way down to the cafe, only to find out that they are not open or don't serve mains. They do have social media but rarely updates, then what is the point? Prices of mains were also raised by $1 with effect from last month.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109361781080711520673/reviews
