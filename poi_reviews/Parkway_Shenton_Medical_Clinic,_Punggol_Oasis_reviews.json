      "text": "Very bad experience with Parkway Shenton. Would have given 0 starts if possible. Came for a health screening and was told by the call centre that fasting is not required. They even sent an email saying this is a non-fast health check.\n\nCame down on for the check and waited 45 minutes to see the doctor. When it’s finally my turn, the doctor didn’t know what health check to do for me. He claimed that he only knows how to see cough/cold/runny nose patients and sent me out to wait even longer.\n\nThe second doctor saw me and told me they couldn’t check for me cause I didn’t fast (based on the advice of parkway Shenton call centre with multiple confirmations through call and email). Now they cancelled my entire appointment and wouldn’t reschedule for me cause they claimed that they cannot schedule appointments.\n\nPlease avoid this place for health checks at all cost.",

      "text": "Bad experience with Dr Ali Saheb Kashaf. Waited for 2hour just for a brief consultation of 1min. Told him that my children are down with influenza B and i am having similar symptoms. He just brush me off said rest 1-2 days and take normal medicine. Didnt even perform swab test or issue tamiflu. I was still feeling very unwell and high fever on the 3rd day.\n\n2nd consultation with Dr Michelle Nah is good. She is very patient and perform all required checks and issue relevant medicine for influenza B. It helps to ease my symptom quickly. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "On 27/12 I called Parkway Shenton Oasis branch to ask whether they got provide full medical check up for helper work permit application, they said yes without any further explanation so I thought full medical check up for work permit should be included every items in the MOM form as I did bring my previous helper to other clinic in Aug 2024 to do full medical check up and it cost total of $60. In fact, parkway Shenton charged me $81+ without chest x-ray. The staff did not share with me that your parkway Shenton don’t have chest x-ray machine and I need to go to other hospital to do. When the staff advice me to go up level 2 to do chest x-ray, she also never shared with me the name of the place I should go to, she just said that go up level 2, opposite Starbuck got a walkway there then can see already but in fact, there are 2 different clinic within the walkway.\nAnother reason make me felt disappointed is that yesterday staff told me that after the chest x-ray, 1 hour come back to collect the result but in fact, when I come to collect then another staff told me must wait for 3 days or when I receive a sms from parkway Shenton to collect the result then can come to collect. I felt like the staff did not do their good job of clear explanation.",

      "text": "My father visited the clinic and was seen by Dr Priyankan. He went for two issues:\n\n1. My dad has been taking Cetirizine for his rashes. Dr didn't check my dad's conditions or anything, just looked at the system that my dad had been prescribed the med from this clinic before, and prescribed to him.\n\n2. My dad went to see doctor this time for severe headache, and he has a history of middle ear infection and is familiar with the pain. When he asked Dr Priyankan for AMOXICILLINE, which he had been taking for the infection, Dr said\n\"I will only give you med if you had taken it from our clinic in the past\".\nMy dad hadn't taken from this clinic unfortunately, but he was hospitalised for it before and Dr asked my dad to show his previous hospital/GP prescriptions, in order to prescribe him from this clinic. (unfortunately my dad didnt bring the past 10 years of medical history when he visits a GP downstairs).\n\nHe then offered another type of medication, which my dad accepted, but when he went to the registration counter to collect the meds, registration said THE DR DID NOT PRESCRIBE IT.\n\nMy dad went back in again, and Dr Priyankan then looked into the ear this time\n(NOTE: middle ear infection is very hard to be diagnosed with a visual check. Again, our family is very experienced with this illness).\n\nHe said \"I can't see infection, I don't know what your headache is caused by, but I'm the doctor, and I say you can't have the med.\"\n\nSo. Dr Priyankan--you don't have the ability to diagnose and you only prescribe meds based on whether the patient has taken the same meds from your clinic in the past?\n\nI checked chatgpt on how to diagnose middle ear infection--it said that this is difficult to be diagnosed with visual check, and very important for GP to ASK FOR PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, which my dad has shared with you!",
