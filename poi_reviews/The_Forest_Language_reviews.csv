Choon Seng Lee,5,This is my first time attending such a session.  I felt so refreshed and so much calmer. Didn't know that the Forest is so powerful. Thanks so much to our Forest Therapy guideï¼ŒJohn who is so suave with his use of words and language to help us connect with nature. I strongly recommend The Forest Language for your next forest bathing experience. They have priced it so affordable @ $50.00 per person compared with others.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106534163164959901942/reviews
