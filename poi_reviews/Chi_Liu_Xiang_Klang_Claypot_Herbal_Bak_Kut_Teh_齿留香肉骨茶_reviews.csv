Keith Er,1,"I gave 1 star food due to the 5 star friendly service from the china lady manning the stall. She‚Äôs friendly and kind enough to bring me the food.

But back to the brutal honest feedbacks.
Now I double and triple confirmed what the earlier one star reviews to this stall is true and honest.

1. Over priced with the $2 Tao Kee Skins. Maybe a good 5-8 pieces and $2 Whammy!!!

2. Ordered their pork offals mixed soup. Scraps only scraps, I from pork livers to lean pork pieces, none came in a decent cut sized. At the $7.80 or something, it‚Äôs hugely overpriced than the famous Áå™ÊùÇÊ±§ down at downtown area.

This is a neighbourhood coffeeshop and stalls, your pricing is as good as a town area food prices.

Thanks for the first try and last",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101648258475493647941/reviews
KKT,4,"Tried stew pork tendon, tasted like fish maw tendon üòÜ.
Generally beef tendon should taste better I think.
Soup is strong with herbal fragrance, but somehow abit added sweet and salty making the soup bolder (I think less sweet salty to taste original herbal would be better). I like the self take garlic added with chilie padi and soya sauce, it goes well with my rice I can eat just that.

Staff friendly and informed can ask for more soup if I want.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399770588752359508/reviews
Larktiss,4,"Dinner at Chi Liu Xiang herbal bak kut teh offered a decently good soup (refillable) with tender meat and a generous amount of ingredients.  The pork intestines were well-cooked, and the pig's organ soup, while filled with ingredients, lacked a bit of oomph in the flavor department.  The add-ons of enoki mushrooms and rice complemented the meal.  The total cost came to $30.80.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108335162839219606692/reviews

Cornelius Yeo,1,"CNY surcharge $3 per dish? Absolutely ridiculous, dare to charge better deliver. Ordered food at 7:05pm but dish was promised 30mins, end up 1 hour later chef still preparing the food. After the boss chase the chef, he threw all the orders on the floor and stop cooking. Unreal.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102866429479795777424/reviews
