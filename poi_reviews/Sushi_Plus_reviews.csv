Zatarie Hoe,4,Service and atmosphere was good. -1 star because the yuzu cheesecake came out completely frozen. Can‚Äôt even cut through it. Clarified with the staff and was told it was purposely serve frozen because they don‚Äôt want it to melt on the way out but this is ridiculous. Still have an overall 4 star because this is a sushi restaurant and their sushi + mentaiko fries was amazing.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115063186209477778569/reviews

Keng Cheong Tan,4,Wide variety of sushi and cooked food (grilled and fried) to choose from. Quality of the fresh fish especially the tuna üç£ can be a little stale though overall the food is acceptable. Place can be very busy at meal times. Offers both counter and table seats to choose from. The two of us really had a feast thus the cost of the meal is high. Otherwise $20-30 per pax is doable.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102762619432424724330/reviews
Win Ma Ma (Emma),5,"Sushi Buffet (All you can eat promotion 26.90$+++ per pax) was such a wonderful experience where I could have my favourite sushi items as much as I can. Me and my partner could devour a huge number of plates which were quite fresh and delicious. The conveyor belt never went empty. The only thing that we had to wait was strawberry mochi because I think it was the favourite dessert for most of the customer and kitchen staffs were a bit delay in topping up the mochi on belt.
I love Mango cheesecake, caramel pudding were included in the buffet spread which are quite good in quality and taste.
Appreciate the prompt delivery of ordered items and clearing the plates.
Overall it was a genuinely great and worthy experience of sushi buffet.
It will be great that the buffet system will be available as an ongoing basic. Looking forward to buffet system for sure.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114367171689028476772/reviews
