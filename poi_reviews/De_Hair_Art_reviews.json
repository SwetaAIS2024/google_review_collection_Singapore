Then a friend recommended this place, and after trying it, my hair is in fantastic condition. Not only is his rebonding great, but his haircutting skills are also amazing. Iâ€™ve been coming here for around 7-8 years, and now my daughter comes here too for her haircuts. Totally worth the money!",

They even have a hot towel to pat down your neck after they rinse your hair. Great service, highly recommend and will definitely be my go to for hair cuts.",
