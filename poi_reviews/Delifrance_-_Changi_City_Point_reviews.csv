CyExL 陈盈璇 Cel Tan,5,"The pastries and tarts are still as amazing as I remember from my childhood (have been eating Delifrance pastries since I was a small kid). The pasta options are delicious and the soup of the day with the soup set (pumpkin soup) wowed me. The staff at this outlet are really warm and friendly as well, being patient to accomodate our requests with a smile. I love the modern European ambience of the place as well. Overall a great dining experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105457435107699007738/reviews
Mystery Shopper,1,"I repeatedly told the cashier that I am ordering a KIDS PASTA without chilli (I requested tomato base) for takeaway. I repeatedly told them it was for kids.
I don't mind the waiting time of 20 mins. But after waiting for so long, they still get my order wrong. I found out when I reached home.
I tried calling the branch phone number for resolution. Forever no one is manning the phone.
