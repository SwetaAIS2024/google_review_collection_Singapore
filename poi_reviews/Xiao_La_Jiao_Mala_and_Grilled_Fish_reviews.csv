"Alvina, Si Ying Ong",2,"Took 6-7 questions to find out whether the mala base is vegetarian or not even though i was asking Chinese to the stallholders who’s probably from China.

Decided to buy and asked how many people were in front of me - got 3-4 as an answer. But I waited for 20 mins, and I saw at least 5 dining in customers collected plus other grab food delivery orders.

Turns out my mala costed $17… It’s literally the same price as ordering the same things from Zhang Liang or Yang Guo Fu who are known for being expensive. Won’t patronise this stall again because of the price and not very nice service.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114356599632959873772/reviews
Xavier Tan,1,"Used to patronize this stall often but standard kept dropping, portion became smaller and worst still, got multiple strands hair found inside the tomato grilled fish today. Showed to the staff and the female staff was unapologetic and nothing was done. Will not patronize again.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106885978605096751111/reviews
Rong Xian Lau,3,"Standard variety of mala dishes
- nothing really stands out.

Food was so so
- meat was tough and tasteless
- seems like the dish was cooked together quickly

Service was decent, server was friendly
