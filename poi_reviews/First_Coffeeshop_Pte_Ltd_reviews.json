      "text": "This is a hidden gem coffeeshop that offers nice food üòçüòç I am recommending this western food stall has good variety of western food that has an old school taste and vibe to it. One thing stands out is their coleslaw. Can see their coleslaw are handmade in-house. I like it. Their Fish and Chips are crispy and portion are big. I can say that it is fresh too. For their beef steak, I think because they need to keep it longer, it is chewy and soft. Perhaps too much tenderizer? Can't complain much for the friendly wallet price.\n\nTheir French Fries are crispy and it is not those wavy types. Lastly their bread are fried. This is something I would love to indulge once in a while. Cut the bread in half and stuff the coleslaw in. Yummy.\n\nI would be back definitely to try other western food on the menu. Thank you for the food experience! Do support these hawkers!",

      "text": "The coffeeshop caters primarily to smokers and beer drinkers. It is also very difficult to find a seat as most of them just sit there for long hours.\n\nThe place is filled with the smell of smoke and loud conversations from uncles who often continue drinking and talking loudly well past 10:30 PM.\n\nDespite numerous complaints from local residents, no action has been taken to address the issues. It‚Äôs best to avoid this coffeeshop altogether.\n\nHope the relevant authorities can do something to improve the situation!",
