Pee WhyPee,4,"Ordered french toast, half boiled egg, beancurd pudding and curry mee. Curry mee is good with generous amount of tender chicken albeit abit pricy (similar to those in shopping mall cafe). There are small pcs of chilli paddy inside the curry so remove it if can't take it too spicy. Photo shown is half eaten. French toast is rather small pc for the price and taste so so.

Halal certified. Aircon place with plenty of parking space nearby. Good option to have in a neighbourhood to escape the heat when hungry. As others said, the femalr service crew service was very good and pleasant.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102862371074905401674/reviews
