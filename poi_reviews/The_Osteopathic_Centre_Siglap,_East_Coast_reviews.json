      "text": "[NOT A PAID REVIEW]\nI had a slip disc last year, which led me to seek chiropractic care. Unfortunately, I experienced a distressing incident that left me unable to move my limbs for two days and resulted in a five-day hospital stay. It was an incredibly challenging time, and the pain became unbearable.\n\nFeeling desperate, I even contemplated undergoing surgery, despite the risks (partial stroke or vegetate) involved. However, a kind-hearted individual suggested that I try osteopathic treatment as an alternative. Initially, I was hesitant and skeptical, but I decided to give it a chance. And I am so grateful that I did!\n\nFrom the very first session with Iqra, I noticed a significant improvement in my nerve issues. The numbness that had plagued me for so long began to fade away. It was a relief beyond words to experience such positive changes after just one session.\n\nAs the days went by, I continued to get better, and I no longer need frequent massages every week. The osteopathic treatment has truly made a HUGE difference in my overall well-being.\n\nI want to express my deepest gratitude to Iqra and the osteopathic approach for providing me with the relief and healing I desperately needed. It has been a life-changing experience, and I highly recommend their services to anyone seeking an alternative and effective solution for their nerve issues or musculoskeletal concerns.\n\nThank you, Iqra, for helping me regain my mobility and improving my quality of life. ü§çü•π",
