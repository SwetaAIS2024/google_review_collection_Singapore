vignesh arjunan,5,"I'm thoroughly impressed with AFTJ Gym! The facilities are conducive to a great workout experience. To take it to the next level, I'd suggest adding more equipment and a digital clock for tracking rest time.

However, the true gems of AFTJ are the staff, particularly Watie and Herzy. They go above and beyond their duties, making every member feel valued. Watie's exceptional maintenance efforts ensure the equipment is always in top condition, and her organized activities foster a sense of community. Herzy's expertise as a trainer is unmatched, and his willingness to correct techniques and provide guidance to all members, not just his clients, is truly commendable. His jovial nature makes every interaction a pleasure.

Watie and Herzy form an incredible team, and their dedication has created a supportive and motivating environment. Kudos to the entire AFTJ team! We appreciate you, Watie and Herzy - keep up the fantastic work!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112157092016813248269/reviews
Von Frusternberg,5,"Training with Herzy has been one of the best decisions Iâ€™ve made for my fitness journey. His expertise, energy, and personalized approach are unmatched! From the very first session, he took the time to understand my goals, strengths, and areas for improvement, crafting workouts that are both effective and engaging.

Herzyâ€™s attention to detailâ€”especially when it comes to proper formâ€”has helped me avoid injuries and see real progress. He knows exactly how to push me just enough to challenge my limits while keeping the sessions fun and motivating. Plus, his positivity and encouragement make even the toughest workouts enjoyable!

Thanks to Herzy, Iâ€™ve not only gotten stronger and fitter but also gained confidence in and out of the gym. Whether youâ€™re a beginner or looking to level up, Herzy will tailor the experience to *you*. Highly recommend training with himâ€”heâ€™s the best!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101917795995295802789/reviews

Nuraidah Nawawi,5,"Have been a member with Taman Jurong for over a year. Gym is clean and well-equipped.
Special thanks to Herzey, my personal trainer. He draws a deep technical knowledge of the body.  He often coaches different technique of movement focusing more to strengthen and ease my neck, shoulder and back ache.  He is very sincere in his coaching.  Even when I am not in my session, he is very approachable and helpful.
Anyone looking for a professional, dedicated and knowledgeable trainer, I recommend you Coach Herzy!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109223476139611177730/reviews
