From the very first consultation, they made everything clear and explained the whole treatment plan in a way I could easily understand. The staff were always friendly and professional, and the appointments ran on time most of the time, which I really appreciated.\n\nThroughout the process, they were gentle, answered all my questions, and made adjustments with care. The clinic was always clean, and I felt safe and comfortable at every visit. Now that my braces are off, I’m super happy with the results, it was totally worth it.",

      "text": "I want to express my gratitude to Meiplus Dental at Marine Parade for their outstanding service. In November 2024, I underwent three extractions and two implants, and Dr. James and his team were incredible. The procedure was painless, handled with great professionalism, and every detail was well taken care of. Even though my treatment extended 45 minutes beyond their working hours, their patience and commitment to my needs never wavered. Thank you, Meiplus staff, for going above and beyond. Kudos to your excellent work! - J. Tan",

      "text": "I recently visited Meiplus Dentalcare and had a really pleasant experience! Dr Emma performed my scaling and polishing, and fillings. Throughout the procedure, she would constantly check in on me to make sure i am not feeling any pain / sensitivity. She would also explain the process to me such as taking before and after photos of my fillings. I also did an xray for my wisdom tooth, process was very fast and smooth!",

He’s always been so professional yet warm, making every visit comfortable and stress-free. You can tell he genuinely cares about his patients, always taking the time to explain treatments and ensure you’re at ease. His new clinic is modern and welcoming, a perfect reflection of his dedication to providing the best care possible. If you’re looking for a reliable and caring dentist, I can’t recommend Dr. James enough!",
