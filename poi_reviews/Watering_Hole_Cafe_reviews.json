The serving stuff were friendly with a pretty smiling face on her face.  I ordered a club sandwich. It was tasty but personally I like my bread toasted. It will be more crunchy if so.",

The juice are cardbox quality with ice (you can see it from the the menu, a Coke is healthier than a juice). 10min to serve it.\n\nAll food is heated from frozen packages. Tables and floor ain't kept very clean,\nThe only serving grace is there is air-conditioning.",

My family and I were glad to stop there towards the end of our visit to grab a bite and enjoy the aircon.\nFoodwise, the quality was also very good. We ordered buffalo wings, and shared the club sandwich, panini sandwich and lasagna. All these were tasty and the portion sizes were just right for my family.\n\nWe also found out that Mandai Park has just debuted Owa Coffee, which is produced as part of a Coffee & Primate conservation project supported by Wildlife Reserves Singapore in Java, Indonesia. We were glad to sample the long black. It was rich and smooth. Highly recommended.\n\nOne more comment, Iâ€™d like to suggest that the menu selection could be improved by offering a greater variety of items to cater to the diverse visitors to the Mandai Attraction.\n\nOverall, a very nice spot to chill. We even saw the tapir whose enclosure is located right next to the cafe ðŸ˜„.",
