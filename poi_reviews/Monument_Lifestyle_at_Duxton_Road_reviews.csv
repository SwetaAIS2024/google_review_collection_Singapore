Stefan Ladwig,5,"Loved the place. Found this when I was talking a walk back to the Carlton City hotel. It's a cozy little place on Duxton Road which barely fits more than 10 people but it's totally worth the visit. The young bar lady was very nice and eager to help, coffee and cake was delicious. The place also offers (limited) outside seating. Come here if you want to stear clear from the large coffee chains and love local flavour. Will be looking forward to coming back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110603128227701098575/reviews
shann,5,"A cafÃ© with sooo much hidden personality behind their curtains, Monument was a surpisingly great hit on a Sunday afternoon. Wishing they had more food options, but I had their piccolo and sesame bagel with garlic chilli cream cheese, and both hits the mark! their cool-meets-quirky indie vibe was outstanding, and I'll definitely be back for more chill days.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116033941929694841533/reviews
Wendy Tan,4,Small cafe with more seating at back area but not many people know about it. Service was good. Picolo was good. Cheddar cheese bagel with garlic herb cream cheese with a small fee. Bagel was good but a bit oily maybe due to cheese. Cream cheese taste mild.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115683436189954979801/reviews
Cindy DeDianous,4,"Cute cafe! Ample seating, good WiFi, and never crowded on weekdays. Iced latte has great flavor, but hot latte tasted a bit too watery.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104600019833559755484/reviews
