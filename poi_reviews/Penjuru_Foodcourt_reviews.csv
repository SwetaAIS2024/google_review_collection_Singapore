Rui,5,"This place is always the hidden jem for those who know.

We followed the lights and found another sparkly paradise... so we decided to order a little bit of everything and everything taste good... will return to try a little of everything again.

I must say one of the best value places Iâ€™ve gone to. Food quality is also outstanding especially the western food and the soup.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101693177281044001072/reviews
Wei Tan,5,"Came at lunch time to try the herbal soup and ended up getting the fried horfun. But what luck! The fried horfun was sooo good - amazing flavours and texture with a lingering wok hei with every bite. It was good to the very last bite. At $5.50, the portion was good for two if you're not a big eater. So satisfying that I'm definitely coming back for more.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113727367121706943852/reviews

Melvin,4,Was recommended the soup at this coffeeshop which is probably only known to residents and those working in the nearby industrial area. Clean and well-ventilated with a good selection of food. The soup was good and quite similar to Ah Er. Also tried the China food stall which offers a spread of ready to eat dishes and cook to order food. Filled with beer drinkers at night. Staff are quick to clean tables.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109005131907948539207/reviews
