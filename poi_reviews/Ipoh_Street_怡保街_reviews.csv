Ho Kai Cheng,5,"Pork lard is very fresh. Soup is very flavourful. I drank till the last drop. Pork slices are marinated and not overly salty.

Sauce on rice with pork lard is matched make in heaven.

Boss is very friendly.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100601386379483514751/reviews
Kia Guan Ng,5,"This Ipoh pork noodles is awesome with such generous amount of ingredients for $5. The ingredients include slices of liver, minced meat, sliced pork, pork balls and vegetables. They also added çŒªæ²¹æ¸£for added fragrance but no everyone enjoys this stuff.  I can say you donâ€™t get this amount of ingredients from any minced pork noodles stall. Thereâ€™s a dry version at $5.50, if you prefer.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108972979221461010763/reviews
Unusual Similar,5,"Been patronising this stall for quite some time; visited on a Friday evening and the queue was very manageable.

Extremely al dente noodles - springy and delectable. Char siew on the thicker side with some fats.

An AFI would be to cook the pork lards bits in-house, rather than using the readymade ones.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117796828447109273477/reviews
Jeremy Ho,5,"My first time here and tried their wanton noodle.
Noodle was perfectly cooked, has the Q Q feel ðŸ˜Š
In my opinion , this coffeeshop can only depend on them to bring in crowds. Hopefully they find a better location and Iâ€™m very sure they will do very well.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110275270500014613437/reviews
Richard Pang,5,All the 9 dishes offered here are unique in taste and flavor. Hard to find elsewhere in Singapore. Attribute the excellent taste to the chefâ€™s personal concoction. Must eat here often. Now this is my 2nd time having this Mala wanton noodle.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111473135578171464324/reviews
