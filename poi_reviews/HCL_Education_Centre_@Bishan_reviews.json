She even went to extra mile when my son missed 1 lesson and couldn't do makeup lesson in time. She would offer an extra 10minutes to go through the lesson work he had missed. My son could understand her teaching very well. Weekly updates of what is being taught in class are helpful and helped in home reinforcement. Âä†Ê≤πÂ∏∏ËÄÅÂ∏àÔºÅ",
