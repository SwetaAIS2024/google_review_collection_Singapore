Jonathan Chew,4,"Decent coffee, with slightly lower than typical prices. I personally had the strawberry matcha, which didn't quite do it for me - a strange mix that didn't end up with either tasting strongly nor each complementing the other. I believe the standard and safer orders would do better.

The wait time was significant on a Saturday afternoon, likely due to the many patrons at the post-lunch hour. Might take 15-25 minutes for the drinks to be served.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106144108752002112533/reviews

ROK,5,"Visited this cozy coffee nook ran by Joshua, Amanda, and of course, my favourite‚Ä¶ JX. Good coffee, good vibes, serves the community, always busy but never too long a wait. Can use CDC voucher too for those of you coupon clippers. Get your coffee fix then pop by opposite for good cheap hawker food. Amazing place and wish there were more outlets like this in the heartlands!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104657335685167069659/reviews
Nurulfatika Baharom,5,"This was my second time getting the strawberry matcha, and it's my favorite! It has the perfect balance of creaminess. The white chocolate latte was just as great‚Äîsmooth and not too sweet. Highly recommend both! Plus, the staff are super friendly! üòá",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110312376745796497369/reviews
