Jackson Tan (Jackthehunter),4,I ranked this second to my favourite EC Lagoon as much lesser shops and seatings. Food wise quite standard as to what people usually eat when coming to these places.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110191915028815430983/reviews
Stan Lee,5,"Chomp Chomp Food Centre, nestled in the heart of Serangoon Garden, is one of Singapore’s most iconic hawker centers, celebrated for its vibrant atmosphere and an array of mouthwatering local dishes. Open from evening till late night, it transforms into a bustling hub of activity, drawing both locals and tourists alike. The center is famous for its sambal stingray, a spicy and smoky grilled delicacy served on banana leaves, and its succulent satay skewers, perfectly charred and paired with rich peanut sauce. Other must-tries include the flavorful Hokkien mee, fragrant fried carrot cake, and juicy BBQ chicken wings that keep patrons coming back for more.

The lively ambiance, with the sizzle of grills and the aroma of spices wafting through the air, adds to the charm of this culinary hotspot. Diners can also cool down with refreshing drinks like sugarcane juice or indulge in classic desserts like ice kacang. Despite its popularity, the food remains affordable, making it a favorite for families and friends to gather and enjoy a hearty meal. Chomp Chomp Food Centre is more than just a place to eat—it’s a cultural experience that captures the essence of Singapore’s hawker heritage, offering a taste of the nation’s rich culinary traditions in every bite.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116229477112147925508/reviews
