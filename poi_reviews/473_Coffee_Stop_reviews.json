Not only the staff are rude, they argued with customers about their \"wrong orders\", when the actual fact is that they did the drinks wrongly.\n\nThe smoking corner is exposed, so when there is breeze, even if you sit inside, you will be getting second hand smoking.\n\nThe food is good - I will be taking away the food rather than having it there next time. Of course, wont be buying the \"wrong drinks\" anymore.",
