Dave Lem,5,"I was looking forward to trying the dim sum, but the stall wasnâ€™t open today. While exploring the coffee shop, the Hong Kong Roasted Meat & Noodle stall caught my eye, so I decided to give it a try. It turned out to be both affordable and delicious. The roasted duck, roasted chicken, and barbecued pork were all flavorful and cooked to perfection.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108502377081354846501/reviews

Low Zhen Hui Jeremy,5,"Pretty hard to find the place ðŸ¥² go to level 5 to park in white lots then take a lift up!

Was there pretty late and only have Tse Char, Viet, and Thai food to choose from.

Decided on the Viet food and was not disappointed! The food portions are generous and the food taste good! Taste clean but very flavorful! Worth the drive and wait! Recommend for everyone to give it a try! The Rice Vermicelli inside is very good!

Will come back to try the Tze Char, Dim Sum, and Roast Meat!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114814366031334046164/reviews
stormy stormy,4,"Food court located at 9th floor. Went there for dinner. Environment is a bit of rundown, with noisy burner sound from the wok and cooking sound. Only beverage stall and Chinese zhichar opened at dinner time. Price was same as other zhichar, but the serving portion definitely is bigger. Food taste better than most of other zhichar stall elsewhere.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107937713344750092427/reviews
Alvin Terence,4,"The milk peng (ice milo with milk) is indeed on point with its golden ratio. The uncle even prides himself and has even asked for feedback if itâ€™s good.

The tze char (Chinese home-cooked food mini restaurant) serves really good fresh food and at an affordable rate. Most of their patrons are mainly office staff.

When the sunsets and once everyone has left for home, a new dawn arrives. Groups of beer enthusiast mainly male in their 50s will gather for their food, drinks, and some open mic karaoke. Itâ€™s quite a lively culture and delightful to observe how merry they are.

My observation and photos in the 2019.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112360951278222659719/reviews
