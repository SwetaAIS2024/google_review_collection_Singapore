Andre Tan,5,"Recently visited Chengdu Bowl for dinner with my family. Had some of their new menu items like Spicy Chicken with Cheese Rice Cake and Spicy Fish Fillet with Tofu in Chilli!

Overall this was a great dinner! Spicy and bold flavours from their Sichuan dishes. Highly recommended for friends and family.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110368295131978424752/reviews

YH - foodlesstravelled,5,"Enjoyed their affordable Chinese-style dishes!

Sichuan Green Pepper Fish (S$27.80) - I enjoyed this, the dory fish was tender and delicious with the green pepper sauce (which wasn‚Äôt too spicy). I especially liked the bean sprouts and yuba for some vegetables with the dish, there were also enoki mushrooms.

Juewei Spicy Hotpot with Mixed Vegetables (S$27.80) - we also enjoyed this, which wasn‚Äôt too spicy. Other than the beef omasum (which 2 of us don‚Äôt eat), this dish also had lotus root, yuba, potato noodles, potato, enoki mushrooms and peanuts. A nice dish for those who enjoy Sichuan flavours!

Fragrant Sesame Oil Chicken Claypot (S$19.80) - a nice classic dish for those who enjoy È∫ªÊ≤πÈ∏°, this came with plenty of chicken pieces and a nice sesame oil sauce. A good option for those who prefer a non-spicy dish.

Sichuan-Style Beef Claypot (S$23.80) - came with a generous serving of beef chunks and potatoes, this was a bit spicy but also a nice dish for sharing with the table. The Sichuan sauce was flavourful and the beef chunks were tender.

Traditional Curry Chicken Claypot (S$19.80) - a nice curry dish with plenty of chicken chunks, as well as potato. Not overly spicy and good for those who like curry.

Tomato Beef Brisket Claypot (S$23.80) - a good non-spicy option for those who can‚Äôt take chilli, this had a nice tomato broth and came with plenty of beef chunks and tomato chunks. Enjoyed this as well!

Pork Intestines with Tofu and Sichuan Pickles Claypot (S$22.80) - enjoyed this dish with the flavourful intestines and tofu, although it was quite spicy.

Pan Fried Golden Tofu Cubes (S$10.80) - recommended by their staff, this was really addictive and we downed all of it! Also topped with sesame and served with Thai chilli sauce, this is a nice vegetarian option for sharing with your friends.

Honey Yuzu Tea (S$3.80) - it was sweet and refreshing to have with the meal!
