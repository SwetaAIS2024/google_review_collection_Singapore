      "text": "This florist showed the best combination of online shopping and bespoke / personalised experience.\n\nI got to find out on one evening that it was someone‚Äôs special birthday and then I decided to send the flower the next day.\n\nI contacted various online florists but did not receive response Nor positive response that they could deliver on the same day as it was very last minute.  For this place, the experience was different from others in the following aspects:\n\n1) Leon called right away\n2) I asked for a quicker payment option and he whatsapped me the link instead of asking me to go back to his web site\n3) after I paid, I asked Leon whether I could make modification of my order as I had a bit of concern in view of the recipient‚Äôs preference.  He was happily helping with changing bouquet details while making recommendations addressing my concerns\n4) all in all; the charges for the modification was very reasonable\n\nIn conclusion, I had fantastic experience due to efficient online experience where I could know what I was getting, which got enhanced by bespoke / efficient personalised service provided by Leon.  The flowers bouquet put together was very beautiful and and the delivery service was good too.  Thanks very much Leon!",
