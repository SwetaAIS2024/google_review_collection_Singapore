He made me feel comfortable and right at ease from the very beginning. He was very accomodating to all my needs! Bathrooms get cleaned regularly. Will definitely stay here again. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "First, I would rate it excellently on staff and service.  BUT the solo room is not, to me, cheap and too many corners are cut.  The excellent bathrooms are shared but you only get one towel, in your room.  So if you go to the loo you'd better take your towel because there are no paper towels.  There are no boxes of tissues in loos or rooms.  There is only the horrible liquid soap in the shower and nothing to distribute it over your post-flight body. There are the most rudimentary coffee make faculties in the room ( kettle filled in the bathroom) with creamer that is completely substandard.  BUT there should be a sign over the 'coffee' unit which states \"Don't even think of it\" because there is good free coffee in the lounge.  I did not use some other free facilities such as the pool.",

These people, with such mastery of hospitality, wanted over US$ 400 for a cut-rate room.\n\nWe were also told to leave if we did not immediately book with them.\n\nThis is not a hotel.\n\nThis is a tourist trap.\n\nGet into the city and book at the Hilton.  The staff is more of the hospitality industry and they run a quality hotel.",

Unfortunately, our bathroom had mould on the roof & was showing some wear & tear. A meal was included- food was very fresh & flavourful. However, the meal system was not explained on check-in. Like most transit hotels, it was expensive but saved our sanity after a long flight. Staff were very friendly.",
