Won Soon Lau,4,"Was wondering why my chair is rocking. The  drain hole cover is detached. Not that I worried about falling inside. Rather I gotta keep any eye on any crawling creatures coming out from it, while having a coffee with my friend. Pls get it fix.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109947957326052400570/reviews
Min Lin,2,"Have to say that the coffee taste is yuck, since when Starbucks employees can only make overheated milk poured into espresso.

Try the huggs next building, they have the professional barista.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104225766847179892334/reviews
YP N,1,"Service is not good. Ordered takeaway but didn't mention that the bag cost an extra 10c. Once I got the order, I had to go back to make another payment for the bag... seems like they are trying to meet some KPI.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104015101982023228250/reviews
Jason,1,"It took nearly 10 minutes to get a brewed coffee. I order brewed coffee for speed. They did not let me know a new pot had to be brewed. Every other Starbucks I've gotten my brewed coffee right after paying. I waited around for 5 minutes only to ask what was going on. They said it would be 5 minutes to brew.

Poor service.

There are multiple coffee pots for a reason. And it's not for different blends. Every Starbucks usually only has one blend available at a time.

There is another coffee shop directly across that I would recommend instead.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101747159721545619678/reviews
BC Chen,5,"Excellent service recovery. Baristas are quick witted and has a personal touch. Always happy to be here.

However, will spot majority of the seats are being occupied by students doing their revision. Best of luck looking for a seat here!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101545649864143392860/reviews
