Chathu Kularathna,3,"This is for Granduer park condo, not for the preschool

Lived in this place for 6 months. Only good point about this is it’s close to MRT and bus stop.

No supermarket nearby, you can go to Fairprice inside the wet market nearby, but it’s smaller and crowded always. You will either need to go Bedok or Simei or order online.

Condo facilities get easily broken down. Even though this is very new development, things are broken in facilities. Ex: steps in the reading room of Garden on top of carpark, stairs to dining areas near cascade fall. Have seen them removing and adding tiles to the ramp in side gate near shophouse like 3 times within our stay. Random fire alarm triggerings at nights (not tests)

Stupid design in Side gate near intersection. You will definitely get wet even with the ‘promoted’ shelter path.
Disability pathway to side gate is incorrectly labeled in my opinion as if you go pointed way, there’s stairs to road. No ramp.

Water get leaked to corridors when raining, I’ve seen mini ponds near doors of our neighbors.

Apartments are small. I’ve lived in one bedder + study, but study is just a joke. Bathroom is bigger but what’s the point of having a big bathroom if you don’t have space in living areas. Washing machine is placed in most absurd way where you have to either chose to have small sofa or remove the door to washing machine area.

Storage spaces are very limited and small. I had to buy extra cabinet to keep kitchen items. Granite kitchen top and bathroom top gets scratched easily even from plastic. I assume it’s some cheap brand as granite shouldn’t scratch that easily. Normal tile on the floor is rough like it’s more like some outdoor tile. I got calluses on foot. My pets nails also didn’t grow. Some of my friends had to wear shoes inside since the tile is rough. My neighbor had uneven tiles.

Rent prices are exorbitant. Doesn’t justify that much for tiny apartments.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102472289802281998156/reviews

Iris Carla De Jesus,5,"I don't regret transfering my child from her first school and sending her here instead. Teachers are diverse, caring, nurturing and attentive. My child's confidence has grown significantly and she enjoys being in school. She doesn't even want to go home sometimes. The teachers are really creative in crafting their lessons and they really put in so much effort. Lots of learning and playing!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106040606039022939975/reviews
Dmitrii Sokolov,5,"My son has been attending this preschool since its opening and has enjoyed the experience.  It's a wonderful place, teachers are welcoming and polite, and always happy to see him and keep him engaged the entire time. He has learned a lot, picked up elementary English, and developed the most essential skills. We, as parents, always receive timely feedback about everything that is going on. Especially happy to receive a weekly photo collage, where we can see how happy kids are during the classes and playing with one another. Besides that, we have regular conversations with teachers about the strengths and weaknesses of our son and recommendations regarding how to work on them, so we can focus on problematic areas and proactively react.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104865375052331556171/reviews
