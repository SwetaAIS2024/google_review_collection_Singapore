      "text": "We visited P.S. Cafe at MBS to celebrate Christmas early after a lovely time at Winter Wonderland, and it was a great choice to celebrate the festive occasion. Thankfully, we had called ahead for a reservation, as the restaurant was packed.\n\nThe pasta dishes we ordered were decent, with generous portions that were perfect for sharing. However, the highlight of our meal was undoubtedly the truffle fries‚Äîsimply delicious and worth every bite!\n\nThe service was alright. Nothing much to say about. The overall experience was enjoyable, and we left feeling satisfied.",

Also ordered junior spaghetti bolognese for my daughter.\n\nTruffle fries - great starter to share, with fragrant truffle oil and shoestring cheese\nKing prawn aglio olio - pasta was cooked well, herbs are fragrant, the toasted breadcrumbs gave nice texture\nSticky bbq ribs - finger licking good!\nSpaghetti bolognese - well balanced bolognese sauce, can taste the meat and not too sour unlike some other places\n\nThe dining place has nice atmosphere.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Hergesh for the great service :)",

The fish was moist and spicy but could use more salt - I usually like things less salty so was surprised.\n\nRoast chicken - 3.5 stars\n\nRed velvet cake ($16) - 4.5 stars\nWas sceptical when I heard they stopped making their cakes in house 4-5 years ago, and get their cakes delivered from a central kitchen every week but this was moist, had good chocolate flavour and wasn't too sweet. I'm a fan! It's definitely pricey though.",

The environment is beautifully designed and kids friendly, perfect for a family outing. The service is prompt, and the staff are attentive, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable meal.\n\nWe tried the roast crispy chicken, which was tender, juicy, and flavorful, paired perfectly with a rich garlic bread sauce. The French toast was a standout‚Äîsoft and fluffy with a caramelized exterior, complemented by a sweet caramel sauce. For our little one, we ordered the kids' cheeseburger meal, which came with a generous serving of fries. The burger was well-prepared, with a juicy Angus patty and melted cheddar cheese.\n\nOverall, the combination of delicious food, great service, and a serene environment makes PS.Cafe a must-visit at Marina Bay Sands.",
