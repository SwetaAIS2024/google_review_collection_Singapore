      "text": "This 24-hour McDonald's, like many others, suffers from a slightly grimy atmosphere despite it being clean. Located on the ground floor of an older HDB block, it caters primarily to the immediate neighborhood. While convenient to Braddell MRT, its overall ambiance leaves something to be desired. Given the choice, I'd opt for a McDonald's located at Toa Payoh hub.",

I’ve not tried the nuggets in a while but my memory of the curry McNuggets was a crispy thin crust and succulent chicken meat inside. It’s a far cry from what it used to be, and quite inedible.",
