Aviel,5,Hidden gem! One of the best chicken chop I had! Will bring family over soon. Thank you for choosing quality chicken. The pepper sauce brings out the flavour of the fresh chicken. The skin with the right amount of fats. Thank you for your effort boss. See you guys soon üëçüèº,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114287483595798856132/reviews
