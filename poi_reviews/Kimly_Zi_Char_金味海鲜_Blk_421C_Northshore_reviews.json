      "text": "Attracted by the $18 promotion for the Assam Fish Head, we decided to try it. We also ordered 2 bowls of rice and a plate of French Beans. After seeing the miserable portion of the $8 French Beans, we wondered if it would be more economical to order a similar plate of French Beans from the Cai-Fan stall beside it. The rice and French beans were served quickly but the fish head did not come until a good 15 minutes later (and this was after we had to go to the counter to intercept the fish head because they were serving to customers who had ordered later than us). By then, the rice and French beans were cold. The rice was lumpy and impossible to eat without pouring the assam over it. And the fish was not hot. We had to soak it in the Assam sauce, the only hot food on the table by then, to warm it. Overall, we did not enjoy the meal.",
