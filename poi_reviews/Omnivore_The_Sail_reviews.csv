Elaine Neo (Ê¢ÅÈõÅÂ©∑),5,"My weekly staple (and totally underrated). I go to Omnivore 3x a week, and honestly, I still look forward to every bowl and think it‚Äôs the best salad protein bowl in üá∏üá¨. The low ratings really don‚Äôt reflect the quality and consistency of this place - it deserves way more love.

For $12.90, you get a super fresh, generous salad bowl. My go-tos are the tuna tartare and the duck as protein - both are excellent. Their pickled tomatoes are another standout - bright, tangy, and they make everything else pop.

The ingredients and balance of flavour make it one of the most solid options for clean eating. Highly recommend!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101260680686655265157/reviews
Shin Lee,1,"COULD HAVE GOTTEN FOOD POISONING BUT ITS ONLY BEEN 2HR SINCE I ATE THE MEAL SO LETS SEE üôà Big fan for many years, however with the new menu update, one big part of the sous vide chicken was not cooked through ( I chewed through it hence the photo looks like that) and the prawns were not cleaned properly. Unfortunately they don't have any contact email, website or social for me to feedback and this is the only platform.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108167697159717037881/reviews
XY C,5,"Ordered the most basic bowl for SGD10.90 and I had to split it up into 2 portions as it was too much for me. For a basic bowl (cheapest price point), the amount of proteins given here are in abundance as I had tofu, chickpeas, egg whites together with sweet potatoes, tomatoes and cranberries with honey mustard sauce. Value for money compared to other healthy bowl places that give more carbs than proteins and yet charge more.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102084721777077961598/reviews
Leon Ho,1,"I mean... need i say more. Top up $3 for the salmon and look at how kind of salmon I got from them. At this point, is it still worth buying from them?",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113593936357562901586/reviews
