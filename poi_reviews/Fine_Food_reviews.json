      "text": "The main food court in the South Spine is a popular spot for students from SPMS, EEE, WKW, and NBS. It gets extremely crowded during lunch hours, making it difficult to find a seat, even in the outdoor area.\n\nPrices have increased recently, making this one of the more expensive food courts on campus, comparable to NS Koufu. The duck rice stall is easily the most popular, and the cai fan stall always has a long queue—people complain about the price but still buy it anyway. I haven’t tried it myself, so I can’t comment on the taste.\n\nThe Korean and Japanese stalls offer decent food at relatively affordable prices for their category. The mentaiko from the Japanese stall has a distinct burnt mentaiko flavor, which is a nice touch. The yong tau foo stall is a good option for those looking for something healthier.\n\nI haven’t visited the Taiwanese stall in a while due to price increases, but I remember ordering their fried steak before. Recently, I tried the ban mian stall on level 2 and found it disappointing—it was pricey, and the soup tasted overly sour.",

      "text": "This reveiw is specifically for the economical rice store. They have quite a large number of \"premium\" dishes (labeled) as compared to the normal priced ones. Thus if you go for their normal dishes only there is less variety. Of course, it gets expensive if you get their premium dishes.\n\nThis is rather acceptable, IF they give a reasonable quantity. But no, the meat quantity they serve is very meagre, think about 5 small slices of sliced pork or chicken. This is irregardless of who is scooping the dishes.\n\nThe other stores seem ok. Shoutout to the duck rice store, not bad.",

      "text": "Yong Tau Foo stall offers a decent selection of dishes, and there wasn’t much of a queue during Open House. Portion is decent as well.\n\nPrice is surprisingly comparable to those outside of the campus, but I guess it could be due to inflation.\n\nLady boss manning the stall served it without soup by default, where the soup is served in a much smaller bowl separately. It’s an interesting practice because I haven’t encountered this before - perhaps it’s a cost-cutting measure to save cost on the soup haha.\n\nPlus point is that it tastes plain, which is great for me!",
