I even walked to the back door and the lights are still on and aircon is on..... i wonder what is happening to a clinic that should be operating to serve the public but could not bother to even pick up ur call.",

Super unprofessional as nurse didn’t even let me into the clinic when I am tested negative for Covid and have a slight cough. Dr was even worst. He was a young man who also didn’t allow me into the clinic. The worst thing: he only allowed me consult him OUTSIDE THE TOLIET. What kind of a stupid SOP is this????? Not even 3.0 stars worth. -100 rating is deserved",

She then ask if im able to wait for 2 hours, whereby there are zero patients within. I said yes. She then said the whole bill will definitely be more than $100+, i said ok. She then ask me not to come in by front door later, to only come in by the back door. I said ok. She said nothing and turned away. I went to the next clinic, i was attended like any flu patients and with respect like usual. Guess i need to report this to the medical board.",
