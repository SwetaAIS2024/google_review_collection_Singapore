Timothy Low,4,"Wallet-friendly wonton noodles along Joo Chiat road when compared to the other eateries.

Noodles are springy and neutral in taste for the sauce to give the flavour. Nothing to shout about the char siew and wantons (normal/fried).

However, do note that the red chilli packs a punch and definitely not suitable for your average ang-mo!

I ordered the smallest $5.00 portion and a plate of $2.50 fried wontons.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100257004218618252802/reviews
Jeff,1,"Over priced noodles.
Ordered the beef noodles and the beef was dry and quite tough for braised beef.

The chili wanton was really mediocre. Wanton skin was super thick. Can tell that the wanton was precooked and left there before itâ€™s reheated to be served.

Veggies were also pre cooked and over cooked before serving.

CharSiew was also dry and tough. The noodles were decently cooked but nothing spectacular about it. Not sure what the hype of this place is about too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101763540896756605183/reviews
Paul Ling,5,"First time here for a meal as my family was  visiting a cat cafe across the road after that. We had their wanton mee. It tasted similar to what I had at the Tembeling area (Fei Fei wanton mee). Even the chilli and the soup was similar in taste too! But nonetheless the food was good. We also ordered their carrot cake, chicken cutlet noodles. All very good. Will want to come back again after that if I am around the area.
Atmosphere was pretty great just that their fan was quite strong. Else the noodles will have been piping hot. But I like their food most importantly!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103350512180306505456/reviews

Hello Moto,4,"Very decent bowl of Wanton Mee and love their carrot cake which is soft and good tasting. The noodles are tangy and Q with texture and would be better if the sauce has more depth and layering.

Price point is reasonable and with good portioning. Highly recommended.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109623976052630388172/reviews
