LP Pua,5,"My favourite Mee Siam used to be from a Malay stall in Hougang, but they stopped selling it one day. Today, I discovered a new favourite at this Chinese stall specializing in Mee Siam and Mee Rebus. The Mee Siam had a very authentic taste. However, one downside was the portion size, which felt small for the $3.50 price.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
EatSleepChyll L,3,"Long queue at this stall but moves fast.

Mee Rebus: personally I feel it would have been better if the gravy is slightly sweet so that when you squeezed in the kalamansi it will give a sweet-tangy taste.

Mee Siam: the gravy is light and fragrant but it still lacks the umami taste. And I prefer the bee hoon not bitsy type but in long strands.

I ordered both large plates but the amount given seems to be a small size rather. I can only imagine what their small size is like.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112218025624285073381/reviews
金Ck,4,"Sunday brunch @AMK's mee siam.  Usual queue of about 15mins.

When reached my turn, was told no more MS! Only M Rebus avail. What a bummer!

But young boss told me will make a small batch for remaining clients and come back 15mins.

Great service I feel.

Taste of MS still as lovely as ever,  but the last plate could be a bit cold and diluted.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104171930877403569620/reviews
biyan tt,5,"Simple menu, resulting in low prices and fast service.

Choose mee siam or mee rebus, and either large ($3.50) or small ($3). That’s it.

The rice noodle in mee siam is soft, and chewy. Good that it does not get too soft. The soup base is a sour and spicy, a typical taste for mee siam. Overall, good value for this plate of mee siam.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114841925621549096306/reviews
Marcus Khoo,5,"One of the best Mee Siam and Mee Rebus I’ve eaten in a long time. Good-sized portion for $3.50. Garnished with lime, homemade chilli paste and fragrant fried shrimp (hae bee). Yumz!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118261658639695766099/reviews
