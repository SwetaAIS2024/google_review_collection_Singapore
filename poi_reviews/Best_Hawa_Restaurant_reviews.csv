웬케빈,4,Hawa Restaurant on Onan Road is a MUST-TRY! Their chicken rice and sambal fried rice are TO DIE FOR! Get there or simply order online!,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107458777477246149283/reviews
Ima Ima,4,Food is good. Loved the chicken rice and its chilli. Somehow have the old days flavors. But service is lacking so much. Order taker doesn't listen to what I'm ordering and i have to repeat myself so many times. Owner should work on improving on this cos this is a hidden gem.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111221611416017238674/reviews
Hiddy Alf,1,Waited for nearly 2 hrs for my food to reach me. And it tasted bland. Only 1 prawn & small tiny chicken for my Mee Hong Kong. Worst my partner received a cold Mee Hong Kong. Lastly black pepper chicken rice doesn't even taste like black pepper sauce. Kindly improve on this. My first visit & probably will be my last. :( Unless they improve on it.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104364861939661971212/reviews

You-ting Jhang,1,"It took them 1.5 hours to deliver my order, and I received the worst roasted chicken rice ever. The roasted chicken is more like fried chicken, and it's terribly dry.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102598872743419781309/reviews
