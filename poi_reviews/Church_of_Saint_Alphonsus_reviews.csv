Savio D'Souza,5,"I attended Palm Sunday mass here. I had a beautiful experience. The ushers do a fantastic job. Kudos to the Ushers, Eucharistic ministers and altar service boys.

The mass was very well organised.
The congregation was seen taking part in the Eucharistic celebration enthusiastically.

I was moved by the devotion of the parishioners who turned up in very large numbers.

If you are looking to attend mass please be there at this church at least half an hour before mass begins, since it fills up pretty quick!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116410144810410942051/reviews
Wen Dee,5,"Signed up for the tour of Novena Church. Thank you Rose for helping to arrange the tour. The tour was amazing! I got to learn so much about the history and present moments of the church. The volunteer guide (Jose) was incredible - he made the tour interesting and engaging. Truly learned lots today! This church is beautiful and peaceful. Don’t hesitate to visit. Do email them for the tour! If you are lucky, you’ll get Jose as your guide!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108895691353121915191/reviews
Ashley Liew,5,"Beautiful Catholic Church that is a hallmark of Thomson Road and the Novena area. It is absolutely beautiful from the outside and all the more inside. It offers a place of sanctuary, reflection, and contemplation, even for non-Christians. It definitely can get very busy during Mass timings on the weekend, so be prepared to go early. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
Adrian Rodrigues,5,"A beautiful church to come and visit either to attend the service or just quietly pray.
If you are planning to attend the Sunday Morning service it is advisable to come in 20-30mins early if you want a seat somewhere at the front.
The church fills up very fast but there are ushers who will guide you to vacant seats.
They have beautiful arches and high ceilings.
Parking is also available in the basement.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112071771584127830520/reviews
