Agil Arfan,1,"My second time purchasing here. Horrible and untrustworthy shop. I told them the first time I bought durian they sold me durian that is not ripe enough. Now second time also same

The gentlemen was rude and the old lady was also ignorant.

Atar Patar,1,If you want to get cheated please visit this fruit shop in Simei. Before buying the tangerine I asked is sweet or not and they told very sweet. They did not honour the price displayed first when showed their display they obliged. But after buying it was horribly sour as hell and asked them to return it. To that they joke telling put sugar and eat. A complete unprofessional shop I would recommend to avoid.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116832259720814826609/reviews
Alvin Lam,1,today at around 3.30pm saw they came in new batch of durian. i ask the uncle is this Red prawn durian he said yes now selling at $15 per kg they choose 1 at $38 for that durian. when opening i told the uncle looks abit unripe he told me durian very fresh its fine and the color looks odd to me it was yellowish pale. After bringing back my wife told me this was not red prawn it was 101 durian. I felt cheated and the durian was slightly unripe. lesson learn will never come back to support this stall anymore.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115681492459686878124/reviews
