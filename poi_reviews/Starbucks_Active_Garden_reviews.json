Unfortunately the outdoor area was invaded by birds hunting for food and they would aggressively snatch your food the moment you stepped out from the aircon to the outdoor area. The service staff shared that they had written to the management several times but no help was given to them.  Birds were seen on tables, signages and bins posing hygiene issues.",
