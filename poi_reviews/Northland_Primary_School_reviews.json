We keep getting targetted by her but towards the Chinese, she very good. Rarely scold them. She also like to take sides. If u ever encounter my teacher, just know u need to study extra harder. Her teaching just not teachinging. But other than that, it's a VERY good school. I recommend all parents to enrol their kid here.",
