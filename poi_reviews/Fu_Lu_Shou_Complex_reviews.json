      "text": "A place where seniors like to shop for traditional festive dried n preserve food , which is on the ground floor. There is also a hidden gem food court that has yummy hot steam hand made dim sum, my fave crunchy roast pork n burnt char siew rice / noodles and the vegetarian galore dishes for vegans just to name a few. On the upper floors, one can find Chinese treasures of jadite n crystals. It also houses Thailand famous 4 Face Buddha on the first floor , where a monk offers daily blessings to worshippers. This place is an eye opener for those looking to discover something different, as many of the other stalls around building offer unusual products n services. Old charm days are what attract folks back here to hang out over cuppa of strong sweet local coffee n the toasted egg jam bread . Nostalgic n comfort food .",
