BanuPriya Moorthy,4,"I had the pleasure of dining at Kaveri Vegetarian Restaurant at Singapore’s T3 airport, and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the masala dosa, initially expecting it to be bland, as airport food often tends to be. However, when it arrived, I was blown away by the incredible taste! The dosa was crispy, perfectly spiced, and had a rich flavor that I didn’t anticipate. The price was very reasonable for the quality, making it a worthwhile choice.

If you’re a fan of South Indian cuisine or simply looking for a flavorful meal while waiting at the airport, I highly recommend Kaveri Vegetarian Restaurant. It’s a great spot to indulge in delicious food without compromising on taste or value.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101361947728913513264/reviews
Pavethira SN,5,Placed inside a busy and congested food court. Inspite of pure vegetarian food sharing tables with non-vegetarians was a bad experience for kids. But can’t help in countries like Singapore. Food was very good and hygienically made by a helpful staff.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110456655737767856951/reviews
Arundhati Kalamkar-Mhalgi,4,"Nice quiet simplistic restaurant on level 3 of Singapore Changi Airport Terminal 2, to relax with a masala tea or coffee after a long flight during your stop over. South Indian food variety is good and home style.
Onion Uttapam and Sambar were tasty.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101726175003100155106/reviews
Viraj Gada,5,Great option to have Veg Jain food in Terminal 3 of Changi Airport. They also accept Priority Pass and offer 1 Food item and Beverage against it. They have a special separate Jain menu. The food and the beverages were great. The seating is a part of the common food court only.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108306761161653365460/reviews
supria ingole,3,"Had food here while coming back from Singapore. It's a decent Indian vegetarian restaurant. You get north Indian thali as well as some south Indian dishes here. I ordered a combo meal which consisted of masala dosa, idali, wada, sambar, chutney, gulab jamun and a choice of drink from lassi/masala chai. The food tasted average but good.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114630409240959361020/reviews
