CCS,2,"They did an upgrade just before the Covid came. They expanded their merchandises - by  dumping them outside along the walkway outside!

Business may be better but the poor cashiers are still two per shift. Really? Maybe a few more cashier points or one on the outside?

Sigh. No wonder tge staff always looked so hassled and haggard. In fact, they hardly had time to even do upselling or suggested offsetting my Fairprice points. Other reviews may say otherwise but no one ever mentioned the rewards.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews

K a l 1 S S,3,"Review September 2023
NTUC Smart Choice bread 🍞 is an essential daily item for the only outlet around the area which caters to the nearby dormitories of foreign workers on the off days . These 🍞 bread gets all sold out & unavailable for the local residents. Despite informing Fairprice the situation still offern persist .
This outlet is small yet it's space is used with non fast selling items laid everywhere.

Review: 1st June 2023
All its employees are polite and helpful.
I've been visiting other supermarkets too but never seen any compared to Mdm  Poh Siew Lan who will go through all the proper processes when as a cashier by reminding 🤔 of your discount cards 😉 & special offers . Obviously thanking every customer 🙄 too. Its Amazing 👏 😍 🙌 ❤

Review  7 June 2022 :
Frozen fillet fish stacked up with tagged stating SPECIAL @$4.95 YET charged at $7.45 .
Will wait for their excuses as usual.  As though its customers are always at fault.

Renovation begins on the 15th April. Hopefully with much improvement .
Simple wrapped Food items to be stored inside away from Rodents.  Freezers to be on the out side . Price tags to be bigger and clearer for the aged seniors.
. A  Payment counter  may be set outside too  to avoid crowding inside .",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100679182423591505301/reviews

In Chinese we said: 麻雀虽小 ，五脏俱全。The products assortment in the store are all your daily necessities. Stocks level on display are fully packed.

👍 👍to all the services staffs here.

Most importantly, the long service staffs here are very friendly, always reminding customers at the check out counter like: member cards, senior citizens discount matter, special promotions items etc",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104017026296774707444/reviews
