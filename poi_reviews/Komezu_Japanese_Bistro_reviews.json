When you are able to see rice exposed on a chirashi, you know you aren't having a good time. Not worth the price, even though it's not as expensive, i ordered the upsize which evens out the price range and yet it didn't deliver.\n\nThe Tom Yam noodles were OK. The herbal soup noodles had a weird taste.",

      "text": "Nice fusion restaurant with a wide range of Japanese and Thai food!\n\nPoke tastes good! I had their yuzu citrus poke which was enjoyable! Fresh chewy salmon, japanese rice, refreshing cucumbers and yuzu citrus for me!\n\nI like their mini bowls selection, $2 for crispy pork skin which was so crunchy, $1.40 for their boat noodles which was okok. The mini pork dry noodles were al-dente and the soup was more herbal so I didnt quite enjoy it. But the mini pork soup tastes good!\n\nThey forgot our mini pork dry, but we informed them and the staff was really quick and nice!\n\nI find some of their dishes too expensive. $18 for a meagre plate of crispy pork belly, plus GST and service charge will being you to $20. Other restaurants will be more worthwhile. But their poke bowls were quite nice! They also have frequent promotions like 1-for-1 orange highballs for $22+!\n\nWe also had a plate of middle wings for $1! Limited time offer. Super crispy and juicy, with lemongrass thai chilli that tastes so good!",

Though I wished they had more sashimis In then. Tonkotsu ramen pork broth was so good too. We finished all the soup! Maki freshly made, my boy love it! Cosy place in the west.",

Especially the salmon mentaiko as it literary melted in my mouth. Price is reasonable. Service is excellent and the environment is very comfy too! Will definitely be back ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°",
