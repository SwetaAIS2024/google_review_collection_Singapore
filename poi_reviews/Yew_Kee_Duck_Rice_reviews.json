Why would a duck rice stall not serve me duck meat but fatty meat that had been processed from the factory? I will definitely not visit this stall again, unless I want my teeth to fall off from chewing on the stone-like meat.",

The yam rice and sauce are the star of the duck rice dish, it‚Äôs arguably the most flavourful rice and sauce I‚Äôve ever tasted. ü§Ø Braised duck is of decent toughness, which I like. This deserves a 5/5 because it‚Äôs seriously so underrated in my opinion, I don‚Äôt understand why people aren‚Äôt promoting about this stall. Amidst all the duck rice stalls available in the West, this is one stall you should not miss if you love a superb sauce and yam rice in your meal üëçüèº",

Roasted chicken and braised meat were dry. Thought of having the leftovers (without sauce) for a meal the next day but all had a sour smell. The meat (not even warm) was all in a bag when I arrived to collect. My first and last time purchasing from them. Cost me $75. Do reconsider before you place an order.",
