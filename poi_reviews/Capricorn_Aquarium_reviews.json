      "text": "I have many bad experiences with buying plants online, but I decided to give Capricorn Aquarium a try and I’m glad I took that decision.\n\nPlacing order around 10AM, received a prompt reply and gotten the plants around 6pm. This is really fast and efficient.\n\nThe plants came fresh and in premium health. No signs of melting or rots.\n\nThe shop actually took the troubles to ask if I have fishes or shrimps (which I have), suggested that I quarantine the plants before adding to my riparium. That’s really good customer service, showing care and passion if this hobby. Thanks!\n\nI’m glad I found this vendor who really cares. I look forward to more purchases from them to help in my future projects.",
