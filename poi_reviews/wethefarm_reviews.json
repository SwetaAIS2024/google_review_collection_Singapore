It was raining and we do indoor activities like soil mix, preparing materials for composting. Love the whole set up concept and altruistic purpose of educating, having a farm to kitchen concept and passion for composting.  Do come volunteer and learn from them- the 3 musketeers who founded this rooftop farm.üë®‚Äçüåæüë®‚Äçüåæüë®‚Äçüåæ\n4 March 2022",
