Aipoh Loo,5,Went there on 13 Dec to celebrate my father‚Äôs birthday. He brought us there about 10 years ago and he really enjoyed the crab so we decided to bring him back. Food is still as nice as I remembered it to be especially the claypot crab beehoon! Staffs are really friendly and recommended us a few dishes when we don‚Äôt know what to order. They also checked if we would like to keep the cake in  fridge once they saw it before we even asked! There‚Äôs free dessert for us too (I think cause it‚Äôs a birthday celebration). Will be going back soon for CNY dinner!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109385469998788527845/reviews
mc,4,"Authentic zichar experience with some standout dishes! The salted egg pork ribs were excellent, and the bee hoon was truly amazing. The Mongolian chicken was the star‚Äîabsolutely delicious! The tofu, however, was underwhelming. Overall, a great place that I‚Äôd definitely recommend.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104310633564986621778/reviews
HEATHER N.,5,"Super awesome place for crab bee hoon soup! Very fresh, very delicious. They know how to cook their crabs.

I fell in love with their salted egg french beans. Oh my god, the beans are so sweet which contrasts with the salted egg sauce, amazing dish.

They do their fried rice well as well but inconsistency is the problem. First time I went to this restaurant, the fried rice was very aromatic with lots and lots of wok hei. This time, no wok hei at all üòî

The tofu dish was okay. Not something I would order again though.

Note that their dishes are quite big. So be careful when you order!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103129357110058364695/reviews

Kathleen Lok,4,"‰∏ÄÂìÅÈîÖ was the dishes I liked the most, it's delicious and very worth it for $30. Their crabs were huge! We can't finish it. Black pepper crab was better than chili crab.
Their jade tofu with salted egg sauce was good too!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112424261718548135339/reviews
