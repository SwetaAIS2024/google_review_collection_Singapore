      "text": "It‚Äôs a heartland cafe experience. As such, it‚Äôs not right to compare against fancier and more expensive cafes in town or in affluent neighborhoods. At the wallet friendly price points, the food, ambience and service is pretty good. I would only say that the fried chicken and waffles could be seasoned a tad more - whether with salt or garlic powder or paprika.",

      "text": "[SOD Cafe]\nüåü 9/10\nüìç Ci Yuan CC\nüí∞ Expected damage $15-$25\n\nValue for money and no service charge. This place has been around for a long time and their serving is huge for their prices. My personal recommendation is their mentaiko pasta with the fried chicken. The sauce makes the pasta very savoury which goes well with the crispy chicken. Wanted to try their soft shell crab mentaiko pasta but they only serve it at the upper thompson branch.\n\nThe mentaiko Mac N' Cheese is very decadent due to the heaping amount of cheese which caters to many young cheese lovers. Fried chicken and waffle was good and a go-to for those craving a sweet and savoury meal once in a while.\n\nThe dessert - devils chocolate cake, is the icing on the cake as it was so thick and sinful. When paired with the ice cream, you are guaranteed to be seeing a doctor soon which is the job of a good dessert. Definitely recommend this place üëç",
