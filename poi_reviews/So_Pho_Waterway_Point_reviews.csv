Ezekiel Chan,4,"Decent lunch, ordered the buddy set for around $32++.

Got the beef slices and balls pho, summer rolls, Vietnamese fried rice (beef). Pho broth was flavourful, but a tad too spicy for me. Fried rice was fragrant, with a generous serving of beef. Summer rolls were great too.

Staff forgot our drink, but were prompt when reminded. Service was very fast. Not too crowded, overall pleasant dining atmosphere.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115327078356474237047/reviews
Kai,4,"Service can be better from certain members on the team.

The pho arrived less than 10mins after ordering but the Bhan Mi took 30mins to arrive. By that time, the pho was finished. ðŸ«

N. Gan,4,"Katrina Group Ltd is offering a $10 voucher for every $60 spent (before service charge) using a DBS card. Since I had a voucher from my previous visit, we decided to try Vietnamese cuisine at So Pho. We ordered a variety of dishes, avoiding fried options. The food was tasty and, most importantly, not overly salty, leaving no aftertaste of thirst.

Although ordering was done via QR code, we noticed that the servers were attentive and ready to assist whenever we needed clarifications. The service was excellent, and the clean dining environment added to the experience. Highly recommended!

With our DBS card payment, we received another $10 voucher for our next visit. As a Katrina Group Ltd member, we also earned points equivalent to our spending, in addition to the voucher.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111536004756755931697/reviews
Nana Erlyna,5,"I had such a wonderful dining experience at So Pho Waterway Point! The food was absolutely delicious - fresh, flavourful, and definitely one of the best meals Iâ€™ve had in a long time. What made it even better was the exceptional service. In a time where self-service seems to be the norm everywhere, itâ€™s rare (and refreshing!) to receive such attentive and warm service. The staff were friendly, efficient, and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Thank you for making our meal so enjoyable - weâ€™ll definitely be back!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102043508030010081223/reviews
