      "text": "I visited this workshop last Friday, January 10th, to address issues with my Toyota Sienta's air conditioning, specifically hot air blowing. Unfortunately, they were unable to pinpoint the root cause of the problem. Due to the late hour and heavy rain, I decided to seek assistance from another workshop.\n\nTo my dismay, the second workshop quickly identified the issue and found dislodged hot and cold vent gear mechanism has dislodged. This required disassembly and an additional cost of $300 to rectify.\n\nI returned to the original workshop on 16 Jan 2025 to express my disappointment with their initial diagnosis. However, my concerns were dismissed, and boss, Mary, argued that their initial checks were standard procedure and that my expectations were unreasonable.\n\nI am extremely dissatisfied with the level of service and the apparent incompetence of the technicians at this workshop. I will not be returning for future services and strongly advise others to exercise caution when considering their services",
