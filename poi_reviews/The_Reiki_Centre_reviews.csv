Shee Li Kuang,5,"I’ve been a student of Elaine Hamilton Grundy for close to 10 years now, I must say. Through these years, I have benefited immensely from her wisdom and insights, be it spiritual, mental and life in general. Elaine injects huge doses of reality and not one to let you off into the ethers ungrounded. Yet, she does so with humor that makes time with her enjoyable.

Even though Elaine is now based in the UK, I still find that her nuggets of wisdom relevant and aligned with passage of time. As she evolves her beliefs, she extends her invitation for us to join her, but never with force.

Her teaching of Reiki is fundamentally not just about Reiki as a universal life force; it also nudges us to challenge our belief systems, to broaden our perspective, because at the end of the day, we don’t know anything at all.

Thank you, Elaine, for being the beacon of light for so many of us!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109503609566841488783/reviews

KAKOLI DAS,5,"I have done all the three levels of Reiki with Elaine Grundy and I cannot say how much blessed I feel to have her as my Master teacher.  I have evolved as a person under her teachings and she is the best:). Another good thing is that the connection with Elaine and the Reiki community  continues life long through the beautiful Container she has created where we meet on a weekly basis for meditation and sharing.
The location is convenient with lovely eateries around. Wish the recent level 3 course that I attended lasted more than 3 days.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109162525529036076337/reviews
Samantha Colbert,5,"Elaine is an masterful teacher. She guides you through the theory and practice of Reiki in an incredibly open, welcoming and supported way while giving you a gift that expands your personal toolkit in a big way. Her decades of experience is so evident and her authenticity is humbling. I highly recommend Elaine and learning more about Reiki.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103773904765982174297/reviews
Priya Kothari,5,"Just finished a Level 3 class with Elaine Grundy. Elaine is a wonderful teacher who explains things very clearly. Her class is dynamic and fun filled. But mostly I appreciate that Elaine has been able to recognize that like everything else, Reiki and its practice is also evolving, and she is very open to new concepts and thoughts (with proper experimentation of course). No judgement of any sort from her or sense that if you don’t do things a certain way you’re doing it wrong. I highly recommend Elaine for anyone looking to learn Reiki.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108735423139121820269/reviews
