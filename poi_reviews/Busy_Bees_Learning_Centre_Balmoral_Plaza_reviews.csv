siew may Wong,5,"It’s quite good environment and help me to improve my studies:)
The question that they go through and the “popular” qns type,the qns may come out in the exams frequently as well(:
Each lessons focus on 3 main theme and it helps students break down the concepts better.The resources they gave for oral notes and compo writing are very useful to improve on oral or on compo.
The prelim topic was about environment and my teacher went through it and the questions that might be tested and the questions that my teacher taught me(for Chinese oral there is 6 questions) and really ALL 6 questions were taught and I was able to answer them confidently.
Overall,Busy bee Learning Centre has an engaging and enjoyable environment for both teachers and students!!!
Highly recommended!!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117603536255729021014/reviews
