His extensive experience and unique teaching style made the sessions both insightful and inspiring. Ashe doesn’t follow the conventional teaching methods, but instead offers a fresh perspective on DJ-ing that truly enhances the learning experience. There’s so much to gain from his deep understanding of the craft, and his approach is genuinely one-of-a-kind.\n\nIf you’re someone who wants to truly grasp what DJ-ing is all about, I highly recommend taking this course. It offers a unique, invaluable experience, and the instructor is truly a gem in the DJ community!",

      "text": "Super patient instructions who clearly practice what they preach. Other DJ schools only teach you how to prepare/mix stuff that everyone else wants to listen to (as if nightlife can only be enjoyed in one way zz). Here thet actually encourage you to explore music genres that you are personally interested in. I really enjoyed my private lessons with Ashe who is really passionate about the art of DJ-ing & the scene in general. He went out of his way to explain a lot of things, bring me up to date with the history of the scene and introduced me to some of his DJ friends (sorry man never heard of any of them lol). All this on top of the rock solid beginner friendly curriculum that is based on all his years in the craft.\n\nWhile i eventually realized DJ-ing isn't for me (because i much rather be balling with my DOM & Belvedere while ogling at the hot female DJs), I would definitely highly recommend taking their courses, even if you are tone deaf or beatless, these guys will whip you into shape!",
