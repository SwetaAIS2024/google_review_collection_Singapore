Peel The Avocado,1,"staff by the name of chee siong always refuse to provide change for cash and insists on exact change or pay by card.

as a well known supermarket, the managers are supposed to be responsible for having sufficient change for customers.

how can you be this selfish and not provide for your customers? what about tourists that dont have card and can only rely on cash? are you going to deny them of their purchase as well?

pls do something about this la if you dont like ur job then change. every single day, month, year no change then…?????",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111924372408594956078/reviews
Djoeis Shi,4,"This is a store replacing the former Giant hypermart. It only occupies about a third of the old supermarket.
It is a smaller Cold Storage with pasta, salad, roasted meat, and sushi counters.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111128052716293687431/reviews
YEE TAO,1,"Feedback on unhelpful service at Suntec City Branch
I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the level of service I received at your Suntec city branch on 19.12.2024 @10.10am. We are attempting to use Suntec City Vouchers at the self-service kiosk. As we were unfamiliar with the process, we approached a staff member for assistance -a Chinese Aunty stationed near the self-service kiosks. However, we were met with a disappointing response. That Cold Storage Chinese Aunty refused to assist us, claiming that it was ""too troublesome and we as a customer by right should know how to redeem the voucher at the self-service kiosk"", without making any attempt to guide or help us. This experience was both frustrating and disheartening. As customers, we rely on staff for support, particularly when navigating unfamiliar processes. Being dismissed in this manner is far from the standard of service we expect from a reputable brand like Cold Storage!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111131752776956345371/reviews
Kien Boon Teo,1,"Very poor customer service. Queued to buy vouchers and had to wait for another staff to prepare vouchers physically, which is fine. But when the vouchers came, I was asked to re-queue and go behind everyone else! ???? Very illogical!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100658620372293003643/reviews
