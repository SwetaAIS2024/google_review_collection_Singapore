      "text": "I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the teachers at LFP 460. Making the decision to transfer my child, who is currently in K2 was not an easy one. Initially, I was quite skeptical and hesitant, as I was worried about how well he would adapt to a new environment, new teachers, and new classmates. However, looking back now, I can confidently say that it was one of the best decisions I have made for his education and overall development.\n\nSince joining LFP 460, I have noticed remarkable improvements in his learning progress, as well as a boost in his confidence and positive energy. The dedication and support from his K2 teachers, Teacher Aubrey and Li Xue Loashi, have played a notable role in helping him settle in comfortably and positively in his new school. Their patience, encouragement, and commitment have made a huge difference in his journey.\n\nI would also like to extend my sincere appreciation to the center principal, Ms Sandra for the support and guidance throughout this transition. Knowing that my child is in a warm, caring, and enriching learning environment gives me great peace of mind.",
