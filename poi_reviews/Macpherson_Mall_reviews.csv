Mr Wang Wang,1,"This mall is a complete disappointment. It’s hard to tell whether it’s a shopping mall or a ghost town. As you can see from my attached photos and video, there are barely any open stores, and many of the listed ones seem nonexistent.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100792947771991544056/reviews
Red Lyon,5,"Not very crowded. Great place to just relax, have a meal, shop a little and then get back to your hotel.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110874686143194049172/reviews
Ken Loy,3,"This mall is a rebuilt version of the original Great Eastern Hotel which was at the same location for many years.

After redevelopment, it became a mall with lots of hope. Units were sold to individual buyers and the take up was good.

I remember one anchor tenant was a supermarket Ntuc Fairprice. The other is ibis hotel. The supermarket is gone though.

But the rest of the mall is sparsely tenanted. It's still the same after so many years. Hardly anything there except for some pubs.

Think the rent must be very high perhaps coz the units were sold at very high price.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112924617196913570011/reviews
The Travel Hunter,3,"MacPherson Mall is a small shopping center in Singapore with a mix of shops, food outlets, and services. Visitors appreciate its convenient location near Mattar MRT, ample parking, and air-conditioned environment, making it a pleasant escape from the heat. Some food establishments, like Le ‘Tart, receive praise for their offerings, though the mall’s overall dining options are limited. Many units remain unoccupied, which affects the mall’s vibrancy. Despite its quieter atmosphere, it serves as a local spot for essentials and casual dining. The mall has potential for improvement as new tenants join .",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112702441126152817912/reviews
Devaraj V,1,"Horribly maintained building. The MCST ought to be fined and fired.

Looks like a place where businesses go to end their cycle to me. Foot traffic is minimal. Everywhere you turn its empty units or business that look like theyve shut down.

Rent here is cheap cos the building looks like it was used as a red light district. Dingy atmosphere, stale cigarette smelling air, toilets smell like urine, glass windows caked with dust.

Go here if you want to appreciate what little good you have in your life. Going here made me appreciate my life a whole lot more.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114063152934910127115/reviews
