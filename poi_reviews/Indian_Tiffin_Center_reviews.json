My conclusion is that it is one of the best Dosai I have had so far (how I assess whether it is to my likely is by going for the plain version the first time). I asked for the Dosai to be more crispy and the stallholder was very kind to agree to immediately. Thanks for being customer oriented. I will definitely come back for other items.\n\nPS: The dosai pairs wonderfully with a cup of Ginger O from the stall beside.",
