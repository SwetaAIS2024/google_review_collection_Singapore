      "text": "140325 went in for URTI symptoms, told the male attending doctor i was feeling feverish and other symptoms. Did not even take my temperature, upon checking my throat (which was already inflammed as i had trouble speaking, eating and drinking), response was \"oh it looks okay\". Checked my breathing (i already had phelgm), \"breathing sounds good\". Proceeds to tell me \"oh its most likely just a flu\".\n\nRequested for anti inflammatory medication along side with the other prescribed meds (not sure based on his diagnosis why there's no antibiotics given my symptoms???), been taking it for the past 4 days consistently, lets just put it that there was no effect. If anything my throat worsened and decided to visit another GP today.\n\nFor a $77 consultation and medication fees, its not about the amount spent but the service provided by doctor when it comes to care for patients and the effectiveness of prescribed medication.",
