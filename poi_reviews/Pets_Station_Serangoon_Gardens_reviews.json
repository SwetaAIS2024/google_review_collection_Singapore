      "text": "UNETHICAL BREEDING:\nWe bought Clover, our Old English Sheepdog, from Pet Station back in 2021. She was just admitted today for emergency surgery for a ruptured lens capsule in her eye due to cataracts.\n\nShe is only 4yo. The surgery will cost $13,000 & we are not sure that it can even save her vision.\n\nThe eye specialist has confirmed that this is a HEREDITARY ISSUE. Both eyes have cataracts, just that the right one has progressed more quickly. She is not diabetic & as such, cataracts should NOT be something such a young dog should be suffering from.\n\nThis hereditary issue is IN ADDITION to the hip dysplasia issue which we discovered when we bought her. We brought her to a vet for a post-purchase checkup & were dismayed at the diagnosis. We even brought her to 2 more vets who confirmed the same. We highlighted it to Pet Station but because we love her, we decided to keep her despite her ‚Äúdefect‚Äù. To prevent the hip dysplasia from worsening, we bring Clover for regular hydrotherapy.\n\nThese 2 issues are clearly cases of UNETHICAL BREEDING on the part of their breeder in Hong Kong where Clover came from & I am not sure if Pet Station is vetting their suppliers carefully enough. At the end of the day,  it is the poor dog who suffers & the owner‚Äôs heart breaks, while your pockets are full $$$. I am upset that they have NOT been stringent in checking the breeders they import their puppies from & only think about profit.\n\nSo, buyers, please beware!!!!",
