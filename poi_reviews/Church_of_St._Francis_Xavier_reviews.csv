Savio D'Souza,5,"I visited this church on Maundy Thursday. I also attended the Easter vigil mass in 2025.
I was deeply moved by the faith, devotion and community spirit of the parishioners here.

The choir and the order of mass felt Divine.
I loved the parish priest and I look forward to attending mass here.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116410144810410942051/reviews
Johann DG,5,"I recently visited the Church of Saint Francis Xavier in Serangoon Gardens, and it was a truly enriching experience. The church’s architecture is both quaint and beautiful, creating a serene atmosphere that invites reflection. The Sunday Mass was particularly uplifting, thanks to the choir’s harmonious singing that filled the space with a sense of peace and devotion. After the service, I enjoyed a delightful breakfast offered on the premises, providing a warm opportunity to connect with fellow parishioners. The church is conveniently located near Serangoon Gardens and the popular Chomp Chomp Food Centre, making it easily accessible. Given its welcoming environment and inspiring sermons, it’s no surprise that the church attracts a considerable congregation. I highly recommend attending a service here to experience the community’s warmth and the church’s spiritual ambiance.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114702046352845681030/reviews
Bernard Kong Yoon Leng,4,"I maybe a little bias as this is my Parish church. I was married, baptised, including my children in this church. It is a rare 999 year leasehold property owned by the Archdiocese of Singapore that has been majestically transformed over the years from a little church to what it is today. Worth a visit.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110737515337335864069/reviews
jimmy lee,4,"Built in 1959, this is a beautiful Roman Catholic Church that is located at Chartwell Drive. The aircon is cool and comfortable providing a cosy ambience and there are many seats available. However, it's location is not so easily accessible by public transport. It seems that only one bus service 317 goes there.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110518855728692358654/reviews
Chris K,5,"First time there after their renovation. So much has changed. The columbarium is now brighter. The cupola is gone and Lady of Grace now has her own grotto. There seemed to have more space for fellowship.

There's even spaces for funeral parlor. The Adoration room (Mount Tabor) is so quiet and peaceful.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117034569835891404105/reviews
