      "text": "Queue is always seen at the stall, many of my colleagues have mentioned that their vegetarian food was nice. Finally had a chance to check them out.\n\nI have ordered a packet of fried Bee Hoon with curry vegetables including tau pok, vegetarian char siew & goose and etc. Look at how generous the portion was given to me by the kind uncle, and it only cost me about $3.50. The ingredients have fully covered my bee hoon underneath.\n\nI love their curry vegetables, curry was light and yet flavourful, especially when you bite on the tau pok, the gravy oozed in your mouth. Other ingredients were great as well.\n\nBesides that they have other dishes too, will come back to try them soon~",
