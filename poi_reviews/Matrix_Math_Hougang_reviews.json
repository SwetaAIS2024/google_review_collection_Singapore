Teacher Chloe connects well with the students and helps to build my child's confidence in Math. Previously, Math was her least favourite subject but since attending lessons at Matrix Math with Tr Chloe, it's now her favourite subject! Thanks Matrix Math and Tr Chloe, for helping to build a strong foundation as we navigate primary school Math!",
