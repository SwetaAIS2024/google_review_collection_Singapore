After 17 years searching for the perfect environment that is ideal for teachers, staff, children, and families that the school supports, I find that this is the best school for all children. The younger ones are given time and space to grow. The older ones show the true outcomes of inclusive education - empathetic, socially aware, intelligent, outspoken, ‚Ä¶ Inclusivity means something that the staff and leaders take seriously and hold deeply in their hearts. Teachers are passionate, tender, energetic, kind, loving, professional, caring, supportive, understanding, ... I would want my child to be raised here.",
