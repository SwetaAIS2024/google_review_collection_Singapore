Also, you will get your deposit more 29 days which differ to the statement on the website. Even though you remind the management so many times, they will ignore you and give so many reasons to delay the payment of your deposit. Lastly, the location is far from public transport, only one bus pass this residence area. Please consider all these things before you book.",
