Kee Siok San (Sue),5,"Have been a customer with SKN for many years.

I have been undergoing laser treatment with Dr Wong for the past year or so. My skin has improved, pores are smaller and the scars are less deep.
My family members can see the difference as well.

I have oily skin and skin clogs easily. Liz, who is my therapist, is patient and very through with facial extraction. She is friendly, professional and service oriented.

I have been lucky to benefit from their expertise. Their service and results have been excellent and I would happily recommend their service",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116057274431121819812/reviews
