rainabelle ho,5,Came here for their free 1 hour Mother's Day promo and really appreciate their nice gesture to waive the compulsory drink order. Very grand looking and pretty lightings. The small room is very spacious!,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104804631437969632221/reviews
Han Khng,3,"went on Monday, 12 August. i think all was good until the Soju tower came to the room. To be honest, really quite disappointing. firstly, it didn‚Äôt taste like it was alcoholic. it was more like yakult. felt no kick at all even at the end. secondly, the tower was at least 50% ice. 2 litres? didn‚Äôt look like it. After 2 hours, the ice was still almost at 30%. I would‚Äôve thought the ice would be separated from the beverage so that it wouldn‚Äôt dilute it. When i asked the staff about it, he says it‚Äôs not supposed to be separated. i felt scammed.

that said, the food was not bad. the sound system was good. i really hated the damn lights though. I switch it off, but after EVERY SINGLE SONG, at the NEXT SONG it COMES BACK ON! Please programme it such that it doesn‚Äôt come back on each time. It is really very frustrating and annoying!

Yvontz Tan,4,Great sound system in the Hall area with a really big giant screen. Haven't tried singing in the rooms yet though. Western food with some bar bites and skewers which is good enough for a KTV. Tried their skewersüç¢...
