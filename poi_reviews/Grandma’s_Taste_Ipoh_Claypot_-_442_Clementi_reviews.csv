Vincent Khoo,3,"Found a tasty Malaysia style claypot dish here. Tried their green mustard, prawn, pork and tofu. The portion is good, and the price is acceptable. Taste is good, especially the green mustard, although I prefer it to be less spicy and more sour. The prawn claypot comes with 5 bigprawnsn but soup a bit bland, but still acceptable. The shabu pork is the best among the dishes. All below $10 per  claypot. Will try again if nearby next time.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109845981260181580873/reviews
wen,4,Tried at their stall and gotten my food after 10mins. The soup was very hot so have to drink carefully. The rice was not well cooked so had to put soup onto the rice and drink and eat. The clams felt fresh but the soup was only clams.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105782342636269836215/reviews
Dan Teo,1,worse experience with food delivery. Pig stomach chicken soup came literally with almost zero soup! How astrocious is that! Sesame chicken came with 2 small piece of chicken meat. Avoid this place at all costs!,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102727173111371673871/reviews
Canan Üstündağ Ayçiçek,5,"We had Sesame oil chicken Claypot and a crispy platter, so rich in taste and filling for two persons. The owner of the place was very helpful in deciding what to eat. Actually we were looking for another claypot place with Michelin but it was closed at that time. In the end we were so happy with the food here in grandma’s, probably the other place wouldn’t be any better than this.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111754333593907578342/reviews
Wahca,5,"Food here is reminiscent of what we used to eat back in Ipoh, so it is pretty authentic.

Ordered the claypot pork belly w salted fish, claypot Eggplant with minced meat and deep-fried meatballs. Biss gave us a complimentary bowl of cool cut cucumber salad which was refreshing...thank you!

Definitely value for your buck with quality taste. We love the meatballs by the way...our 3rd time ordering it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108417376738645658490/reviews
