But for this, I would need to shout out to ÈªÑËÄÅÂ∏à and say a big thank you for her patience and dedication in chinese teaching.\n\nMy daughter just gotten her PSLE 2024 result. She scored AL3 for ÊôÆÂçé and Merit for È´òÂçé. From a AL 6 or 7 to a AL3 merit, I think that is a great improvement!! From someone that cannot conversed properly in Chinese till able to speak fluently. Don't think this will happen if not for ÈªÑËÄÅÂ∏à dedication and teaching.\n\nIn my daughter owns words: ÈªÑËÄÅÂ∏à is patience, interesting, most importantly don't make her hate Chinese and always encourages her to improve.\n\nAs my daughter move to her next phrase of education journey, I would like to thank ÈªÑËÄÅÂ∏à for all her great works done!!
