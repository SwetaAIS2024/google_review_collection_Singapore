Lynn,5,"I did my nails at Peony Tokyo for the first time and loved it. The salon is clean and its nail equipment is new. I felt good doing my services here and was very comfortable with my therapist Alice. Will surely visit again! Thumbs up 👍🏻

Back for the second time and this time round with the most friendly therapist Meiting. She is so attentive to details and made the whole experience 10/10. Highly recommended as she did such a great job! 👍🏻👍🏻",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112312690673131679884/reviews

Patsy Mok,5,I have been coming to Peony for my lashes and nails for a quite some time. The salon itself is very clean and the ladies who work there are often very nice. I always get compliments on our natural and beautiful my lashes are. The nails designs are also wonderful.

Zoe Yang,5,"Chance upon this place on Google, always trying new places for my eyelash, wanted a kinda natural finish but dolly enough thus i tried their classic single lash, the results were superb, after a few days of washing and removing make ups, the eyelash are still in tack. Some eyelash extensions fall off easily, for peony Tokyo it doesn’t seems the case. Very happy with the service, due to lack of time I didn’t try the 3D-5D eyelash extensions which are their signature, will definitely give it a try after my trip. Lastly, did i mention their first time trial price is very very friendly for the wallet.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114939112150789264853/reviews
Mariko,5,I used to do single lashes only as I prefer natural finish but tried their 3D lashes and it changed my whole experience with lash extensions and can’t go back to single lashes anymore... It is soft with volume but still looks natural. I also love the fact that their lashes stay long. Thank you!,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104161685772896096194/reviews
