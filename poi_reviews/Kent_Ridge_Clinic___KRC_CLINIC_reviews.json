      "text": "I'm extremely grateful for the exceptional care I received from Dr Davinder Singh at Kent Ridge Clinic for my paronychia (skin infection around the nail). His hands-on technique in removing the pus from my infected finger was outstanding, and his professionalism throughout the treatment was impressive.\n\nDr Davinder Singh has provided clear explanations of the medical terms and guidance on using fusidic acid cream and prescribed antibiotics to ensure a smooth recovery. I also appreciated his prompt attention and medical advice during my follow-up consultations, where he prescribed a gentriderm cream to further aid my healing.\n\nThe administrative staff at Kent Ridge Clinic are equally impressive, demonstrating exceptional service orientation and patiently answering my queries.\n\nThank you, Dr Davinder Singh, for your kindness, expertise, and professionalism. I highly recommend him to anyone seeking excellent medical care and services available at Kent Ridge Clinic.",

      "text": "Dr Darvinder Singh and his Nurse (had not gotten her name) are one of the best and experienced medical care professionals that I have met. I have gotten a skin abscess which caused pain for about 1 week. Was thankful that I was seen by Dr Singh and he done minor surgery on my skin abscess quickly. My condition improved greatly for the past 3 - 4 weeks under his care. He even checked on me over weekend (critical period) to ensure my condition has not worsen after the minor surgery. I was able to avoid hospitalization and able to recover over home care. His Nurse had also cleaned my wound and ensured no infection. She had also instructed her relief Nurse when she was out on her PTO to ensure my wound was treated well. A big Thank You to both of them for treating me and getting me on track to speedy recovery.",

Either they don’t bother to update their operating hours, or someone is slacking. Either way, I called the clinic and no one answered either. Could have saved me the trouble to get here. I would have gotten here earlier if I could.",
