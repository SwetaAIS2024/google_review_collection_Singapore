      "text": "Among several naval gun emplacements at the Labrador Hill, this  is the only one that receives some preservations, using one of the exact gun barrels and spares of the original guns. This one is a medium calibre gun (6-inch gun) which was one of the most common for the anti-ship defense system prior and during World War 2. Some mannequins of the gun crews, as well as artillery shells, are also in display, although the maintenance could've been better (someone broke one of the gun crew's limbs).\n\nLarger and more potent guns used to exist and installed in the area, such as the 9.2 inch and the mammoth battleship calibre guns of 15 inch (whose shells were as tall as a fully grown male) installed throughout the southern coast of Singapore, albeit AFAIK none remains here.\n\nEdit: a couple of 9.2 inch guns are preserved and in display in Fort Siloso, right across the strait.",

      "text": "Explored Gun Emplacement IV at Labrador Park today, a powerful reminder of Singapore’s wartime history. Once a coastal defense post guarding the entrance to Keppel Harbour, this site played a crucial role during WWII.\n\nWalking through the preserved bunkers and peering over the fortifications, I could almost feel the echoes of the past. It’s fascinating how this place holds stories of bravery and strategic defense.\n\nSurrounded by lush greenery and scenic trails, Labrador Park beautifully preserves history amidst nature’s tranquility. Definitely a must-visit for history enthusiasts and nature lovers alike!",

Grateful that some places like this preserved for younger generations to learn about our history.\nVery informative and enriching for young ones. But do remember to spray on mosquito repellent as there's alot of mosquito and bugs. But if you are fine with it, it's Nature we are saying :)\n\nHave fun!",

Nice to see how silly the plans for Singapore were, especially when faced with the 2nd World War, so that we can all learn something intelligent for the future.",
