Jerald Lim,4,"Here for Kim Heng Roast but could not help noticing a queue forming at Á¶è stall selling Hokkien Mee/ Carrot Cake/ Char Kway Teow. Ordered a $3 white carrot egg with additional egg ($0.50). Nice and crispy, not oily, less salty than many others. Fried oyster is also good.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101913444524439383194/reviews

Freddy Teo,1,"Nothing much to describe much about this place, shops floorings are extremely dirty and untidy as I saw rats twice as I visited last month , one was crawling outside the staircase near bus stop entrance/exit and once was practically inside those store,quite a crowded area during meal time and wish authorities would step up to check the hygiene of this coffee shop that health shouldn't be compromised. Car park are always full during meal hours that Red lots that are supposed to reserved for residents are all taken up and on the side roads you can see there's always lorries and trucks parking along those single continuous white line lane (two way traffic)(doing loading/unloading of goods)its just choatic as authority has not done due diligence of checking on this road users causing traffic jammed and japodises pedestrians and residents safety as a matter of fact, so do consider carefully b4 you heading to this place especially weekends.

Food here is the laksa @ Wen Ji  Noodle Fish Ball Mee Store is delicious but prices had increased as norm due to inflationed over this period of time,the chee chong fun store was nice, old uncle store owner is friendly and coffee here are authenthic as well and roti plata was fine for me.

If you are asking about recommendations here? answer is No No.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108992740627261982935/reviews
