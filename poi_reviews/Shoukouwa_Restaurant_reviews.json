Each sushi was sliced perfectly and had amazing melt-in-your-mouth feeling.\n\nFront of the house gave very clear explanation of how each fish is sliced, marinated, seared, etc.\n\nHowever, since I went for 6pm service, the pacing felt a little fast since they had to clear the table for the second seating.",

      "text": "High-quality ingredients and expert execution! Each dish showcased unique and fresh ingredients, many of which were sourced daily from Japan. A standout was the shiro amadai, which we had not encountered elsewhere; its delicate flavor and texture was remarkable. Overall, we highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to indulge in an omakase.\n\nNote: the head chef faced an emergency and needed to start service 30 minutes later than scheduled. The restaurant notified us around 12:15 PM, rescheduling our reservation from 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM. While it was surprising to experience this at a Michelin-starred establishment, we understand that emergencies happen.",

Since my first visit, I have always been impressed with the quality of service and especially the top grade tuna and abalone quality. These food items cannot be bought with money alone but with internal recognition and checks of reputation in Japan.\n\nI fell in love with the place so much that there was a period I patronised the restaurant at least twice a week.\n\nThank you so much Chef Nishida, Desmond and team for making every visit a memorable and special occasion ❤️.",
