May May,3,Lovely location with aircon seating. Stall holders are friendly and wear masks. üëçüèª Price on the higher side but can understand because of location. Nice noodles but a pity that the fishballs were wayy too salty for my taste. Hope they have a less salty version if I ever try again.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110939509833409809547/reviews
Gargleblaster,4,The set I ordered was so huge I thought they wrongly gave me a double serving. Ordered the dried scallop mee sua and the liver soup. It‚Äôs expensive but they are very generous. I couldn‚Äôt finish it in the end. But a decent meal. Not bad.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106969202599971461073/reviews
Gabe,3,"Managing a food & beverage business is very tough, and I hope all the best and success for the owners and operators.

However, at its price point of ~6 SGD per bowl of noodles, and proximity to competitors with lower prices, bigger servings and potentially tastier cooking at Ghim Moh hawker center stalls - the food was alright.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112998090134491109770/reviews
Denise Lim,2,Really poor quality food - whilst I like the lady I think she unfortunately just doesn‚Äôt cook nor season the meepok well and can‚Äôt get the soup right either‚Ä¶ adding 1 star for fishballs that weren‚Äôt spoilt. At $8 (added $1.50 minced pork) it‚Äôs really bad value,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109726526238619316474/reviews
Samuel Lam,5,Specialityis M4. Dry mee Sua and goes well with the liver/lean pork soup. Super! The liver is very fresh and the soup was served nice and hot. Delicious.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103278705053675847980/reviews
