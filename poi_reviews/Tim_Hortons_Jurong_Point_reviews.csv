Jay Dass,1,"Not a place where everyone could go at anytime and feel at home anymore!
It's feels like a workspace, library and no space for individuals and family to chill..
It's a student lounge for students to do thier group assignments and workpeople to hog the entire space for all day long.
I am very disappointed with the experience.  Hope the management could put a time limit like Starbucks or stop students from using the space and be mindful for others too. Be gracious  society not a selfish one. Thank youüôèüèΩ",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107532293309490591850/reviews
Brian Claus,4,"Good vibes, pleasant place to hang out. Stop here regularly when I am not put off by the price (and small double double is still 1.70 back home). Go to sandwich is pesto chicken, though this time it seemed a bit light on the chicken.

Highly recommend the double double (with skim mill for the weight conscious, traditionally this is served with cream).

The coffee won't impress the connossoirs, but it's the taste I grew up with and nice to see they haven't tried to 'elevate it'.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100194968913569891982/reviews
Annamaz S,5,Ordered maple cinnamon latte and donut. Drink is nice but donut not worth for the money. Again tried their latte today the taste remains same. Also tried the Triple Cheese Toast was so TASTY. Only little expensive üòÅ,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104410461194674980670/reviews
