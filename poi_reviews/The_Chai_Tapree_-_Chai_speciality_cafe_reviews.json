Perfect.\nThe Matcha Mango Lassi was refreshingly different too.\nSuper convenient location right next to Simei MRT and the Indian supermarket. Great for a quick meal or chai stop. Bonus: the food isn‚Äôt too spicy, so it‚Äôs kid-friendly.\nDon‚Äôt miss the Indian sweets and pulav ‚Äî and their chai game is strong (pink chai was my fav!).",

As a dosa lover, the Matcha Dosa was a pleasant surprise ‚Äî crispy, flavorful, with that subtle matcha twist. The Matcha Mango Lassi? So refreshing.The Pani Puri setup was super fun with the auto-dispensing machine.\n\nTheir chai game is next level ‚Äî from Pink Chai to Cardamom Masala Chai, everything‚Äôs brewed to perfection (not overly sweet, which I appreciate). Also loved the Sev Puri and the variety of Indian sweets.\n\nLocated right next to Simei MRT and the Indian supermarket, it‚Äôs perfect for a quick snack, casual hangout, or proper tea stop. Kid-friendly, vegetarian-friendly, and honestly just wholesome vibes all around. Service is warm, and the owner‚Äôs passion really shines through.",
