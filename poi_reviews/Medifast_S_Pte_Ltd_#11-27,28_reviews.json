The whole experience was pain free and he was very very pro. The team made sure I could lie down and checked on me.\n\nReally appreciate this experience! Thank you.",

However, surprising enough, the doctor and senior technician were in a big hurry for some reasons. The doctor and the technician, Rudy, were behaving in such a way that they would miss their flight if they would give me one more extra minute by talking or allowing me time to follow their instructions more peacefully. Note that there was just one person waiting after me. The technician, Rudy, was the most rude staff member that I have seen in Singapore clinics.\n\nUnless forced to, I would not recommend anyone visit this clinic.",

If the staff doesn't have time to even listen to the questions, we shall also ask ourselves whether the clinic is worth of our time as well.",
