M Hu,5,"Ordered egg prata and kosong prata from the Indian stall. The patron very friendly and all smiles and even ask what type curry I want (fish, chicken or mutton) and he recommended mutton curry. Very nice and the price is still very affordable. The curry is very flavourful and spicy which is what I like, the pratas are also very nice and freshly made. Opens early for breakfast.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105194999046987513257/reviews
Aatiqa Mohamed Ismail,5,"I absolutely enjoyed the mee goreng from King Omar prata hut! Delicious! I had no idea that such delicious Indian food can be found in Hougang!

Dansen Low,1,"Worst fishball noodle ever. They stick up a $3.50 price with the word 鱼圆面. I ordered exactly this, but when I make payment, the auntie said it's $4.50. Mentioned that the $3.50 is kids meal. Can't find any such wordings on the price tag though.
Didn't want to quibble over $1. But noodle is bland too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112898009303935002121/reviews

The tea and coffee is much better here then most coffeeshop. As usual, the 2 famous stall here, hougang oysyer and tian sin vegetarian always has a queue, with the vegetarian stall having the queue long and out of the coffeeshop when it is 1st and 15th of the lunar month

Like a mini beer joints from late afternoon with most of the outer tables reserved. Can see 4 to 5 beers ladies promoting their beer brand. Not so great for customers who are there for food cause usually not many tables available as mostly taken up or reserved for beer drinkers and they can hogged the tables for hours

The noodle stall at the corner same row as the drink counter, the lady is friendly. Noodle not too bad",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102260626085916018032/reviews
R,1,Please never patronise this shop. Food is below average and the dishes are salty. Probably the pathetic small serving is the saving grace for the bad food. Price is extremely high. $5.80 for this 'economic' rice at the heartland area.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101187717960139599104/reviews
