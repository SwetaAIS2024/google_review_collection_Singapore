      "text": "North Vista is a school with very nurturing teachers and school leaders. My son is a student in this school and has thrived well since entering the school. Teachers will spend time after school to coach students. My son often told me he could walk into an after school tutorial class to consult teachers. Mr Yap, the principal, will always show his support for the students in the various competitions and SYFs they participated in. The whole school was cheering for the netball and basketball team during their championship games. My son was surprised to see Mr Yap at one of his training sessions and he was appreciative of the support. It is a neighborhood school but Mr Yap and the teachers truly wants every Vistarian to shine.",
