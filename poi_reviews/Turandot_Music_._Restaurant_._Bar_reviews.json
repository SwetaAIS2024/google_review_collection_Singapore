The band do their best to keep the guest engaged !!\n\nService is very good and attentive. Wish there were more options for sharing plates but there is choice of both western and Sichuan food.",

      "text": "While the live band and ambiance at Turandot were decent, I found the overall dining experience underwhelming. The food, priced at a premium, failed to meet expectations in terms of quality and taste. The dishes lacked the finesse and freshness that one would anticipate at such a venue. The live band added a pleasant touch to the atmosphere, but unfortunately, it wasn't enough to compensate for the lackluster culinary experience. If you're seeking a place primarily for good food, you might want to explore other options before settling here.",

Must try the spicy otah pizza. Very interesting and delicious. Bbq skewers were yummy too! Happy hour starts 4pm to 8pm. $58 to $78 for 1 3L tower. Not so crowded on a Wednesday night.",
