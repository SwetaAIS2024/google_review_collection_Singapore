      "text": "I recently had a colonoscopy with Surgicare and I’m very pleased with the experience. From the moment I walked in, the staff was professional, kind, and reassuring. The clinic was clean, well-organised, and maintained a comfortable environment.\n\nDr. Tan and the team took the time to explain the procedure thoroughly, making sure I felt at ease. The sedation process was smooth, and I barely felt anything during the procedure. Afterward, the nurses provided clear post-care instructions and ensured I was comfortable before leaving.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Surgicare for anyone needing a colonoscopy or other medical procedures. Their professionalism, efficiency, and patient-centered approach truly stand out.\n\nThank you to the entire team for the excellent care!",

      "text": "I was in China for biz travel and developed a severe tummy pain. I went to China ER and early diagnosis was that i had a gall bladder full of stones and bile duct was infected. I was developing jaundice, fever and etc. My husband contacted Dr Tan's clinic and shared my bloodtest results and scan. Dr Tan was very responsive gave good advice. I endured the pain and took a flight home to Singapore and went immediately to Dr Tan clinic. By then he had already processed my information, ordered a few more detailed test and was able to accurately diagnose and decisively advise on next steps. I had ERCP on the same day and gallbladder removal on the next (even though it was a weekend). The nurses esp Doris from the clinic was so responsive and helpful, arrange for everything and ensure i dont have to worry about other backend. Dr Tan was decisive, professional, experienced and ensure every step is well informed and discussed any of my concerns patiently and honestly. I am so so so thankful for Dr Tan saving my life swiftly and being very gentle and approachable throughout the process. Thank you Dr Tan and your team for being such bar raising medical professionals!!!!",
