Yellow Bear,5,"Nice place to have a stroll. The rain water collected in this pond will be pumped to Upper Seletar Reservoir eventually. Please keep our waters clean, do not throw anything into the pond.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489311735261065689/reviews
Forest BK,5,"üåßÔ∏èPang Sua Pond is among the 16 stormwater collection ponds built to collect surface runoff rainwater from the surrounding to prevent flooding during heavy downpour.
üíßThe water at Pang Sua Pond will eventually be pumped into Upper Seletar Reservoir for treatment.
Fun fact
üí¢Pang Sua means ""weighing sand""
in Hokkien dialect.
The name is derived from the practice of weighing sand in the area in the past (early 1900s).
Local enforcement authority would escort lorries suspected of over carrying sands to Pang Sua for weighing to acertain it's stipulated carrying weight.
üí¢Another explanation is that Pang Sua may means ""release sand"".
The over-carrying sand lorries were escorted to Pang Sua to release the excess sand.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
M M,5,"My Personal Review of Pang Sua Pond
Having recently visited Pang Sua Pond in Bukit Panjang, I was pleasantly surprised by how much this small urban wetland has to offer. Here‚Äôs my honest take on the experience:

First Impressions
As someone who enjoys nature but lives in the city, Pang Sua Pond felt like a hidden gem. The moment I stepped onto the elevated boardwalk, I was greeted by a gentle breeze and the calming sight of water surrounded by greenery. It‚Äôs amazing how peaceful it feels, even though it‚Äôs right next to busy roads and HDB blocks.

What I Loved
The Boardwalk: Walking across the pond on the elevated boardwalk was my favorite part. It offers a unique view of the water and the floating wetlands. I enjoyed stopping at the lookout decks to watch the fish and spot a few birds.

Community Vibe: The area was lively but not crowded. I saw families with kids at the playground, joggers making their rounds, and elderly folks using the exercise stations. It really felt like a space for everyone.

Accessibility: Getting there was easy-just a short walk from the MRT and linked to nearby malls. I appreciated that I could grab a coffee or a snack after my stroll.

Evening Ambience: I visited in the late afternoon, and as the sun set, the boardwalk lit up with colorful LED lights. It added a magical touch to the whole experience.

What Could Be Better
Size: The pond isn‚Äôt huge, so if you‚Äôre looking for a long hike or a deep dive into nature, this might not be the spot. My walk around the whole pond took less than half an hour.

Shelter: There‚Äôs little shade on the boardwalk, so it can get quite hot during midday. I‚Äôd recommend visiting in the early morning or evening.

Final Thoughts
Pang Sua Pond may not be Singapore‚Äôs biggest or wildest park, but it‚Äôs a wonderful retreat for anyone living nearby or passing through Bukit Panjang. It‚Äôs perfect for a relaxing stroll, a breath of fresh air, or simply unwinding after a busy day. I left feeling refreshed and grateful that such green spaces exist in our city.

Would I recommend it?
Absolutely-especially if you‚Äôre in the area or looking for a peaceful, community-oriented spot to enjoy nature.

If you want to include your own specific experiences or feelings, just let me know, and I‚Äôll tailor the review further!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114442474015223259254/reviews
