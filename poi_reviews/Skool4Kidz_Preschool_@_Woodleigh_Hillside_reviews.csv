Melvin Fam,5,"My child attended her K2 here and I have to give a huge thanks to all the preschool teachers for their dedication. I can see my child really loving to go to the school ever since we have switched to this school. The environment is pretty clean too with regular disinfection and updates.

Special thanks to Chen Li Laoshi, Teacher Ira and Teacher Marianne for making my daughter's preschool days a fun and awesome learning experience!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105822400745036535080/reviews
