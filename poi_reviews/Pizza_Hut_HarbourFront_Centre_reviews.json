Although there were some inconveniences during the registration process, everything went smoothly after getting in touch with Cherry, the manager at the Harbourfront location. Her professionalism, communication skills, and kindness were truly appreciated.\n\nThe workshop itself was excellent! It was clear that all the staff put in a lot of effort and preparation to make the event special. My child had a wonderful time learning and creating their own pizza. Thank you for organizing such a fun and meaningful activity. We‚Äôve made some unforgettable memories at Pizza Hut!",
