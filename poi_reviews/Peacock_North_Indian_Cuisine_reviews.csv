pooja rana,5,"We recently ordered from The Peacock North Indian Restaurant, and everything we tried was delicious!

*Dahi Bhalla* was fresh and perfectly chilled, with a nice balance of sweet and tangy flavors.

*Veg Manchurian* had a good crunch and came in a tasty, spicy sauce â€” a great Indo-Chinese touch.

*Samosa* was crisp and generously filled. Classic and comforting.

*Paav Bhaji* was rich, buttery, and full of flavor â€” tasted just like Mumbai street food!

*Rasmalai* was soft, creamy, and not overly sweet. A great way to end the meal.

The packaging was neat, and the food arrived warm and well-packed. Highly recommend for anyone craving tasty North Indian dishes at home!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100930980741678957471/reviews
yvonne lai,5,"First visit here and definitely not the last!

Had pani puri craving and was looking for a place to have and this restaurant had outstanding review so came to give it a try.

We had the Pani Puri & Samosa Chaad + Mutton Vandaloo and Butter Chicken paired with Saffron rice.

My mum said this is the best & most tender mutton sheâ€™s ever had. The butter chicken was also tender and the gravy was just finger licking good. Amazing.

Service was also excellent!
Would give this place a 6 star if I could.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104385876076672277940/reviews
TN Boey,5,"Went to get some indian food with my friend and stumbled onto this place online. Run as a chain with other great indian restaurant places. Ordered the lamb biryani, chicken tikka masala, plain naan, butter naan, and chicken 65. Food was definitely fresh, flavourful and plentiful. Went at an off peak timing of 4pm and there was an eatigo discount of 50% off the menu items, excluding some items and drinks.

Overall would definitely dine here again, and I recommend that you do too if you are in the area. Their biryani comes with 2 different raitas which are sauces made of tamarind and yoghurt respectively.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105375668338316247264/reviews

Amanda,5,"Came across this restaurant while looking for places selling good pani puri.

The ingredients used were really fresh & the pani puri were really tangy & crispy! It was so good.

We ordered the palak paneer and it was so creamy - itâ€™s like cream of spinach but all blended together! It was my first time trying as it was recommended by my friend and I liked it. The butter chicken needs no introduction!

As for their naans - omg, the butter naan is so buttery and chewy. It can never go wrong. Their garlic naan was really fragrant & crispy yet chewy!

The bill was about $70+ for the dishes ordered so itâ€™s on the pricier side. Honestly, I wouldnâ€™t mind paying for the hospitality & the food.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101458981373717649606/reviews
