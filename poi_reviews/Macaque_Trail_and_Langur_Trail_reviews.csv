Forest BK,5,"🐒Both Macaque Trail and Langur Trail is accessible from Old Upper Thomson Road.
🙉Entering from Old Thomson Road, Macaque Trail leads into the forested area on a well kept jungle trail.
🙈A bridge spanned across a flowing downstream.
Intermittent chirping bird calls are heard from along the trail.
🐵Macaque Trail soon connect up with Langur Trail, which is a very short Trail that lead back to Old Upper Thomson Road.
🙊Just before the Langur Trail ends, is the ruins of a concrete wall and some pillars.

Joyce “Joyful Explorer”,5,"As the name suggest, do expect macaque. May have a big group of them hanging around this area. Gentle slope and short trail out to other trails in the Park.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116040496274789301932/reviews
Anthony Gunawan (R'Borne),5,"Lush greens, short trails, decent up and downslope but still bearable. Pathways mostly paved, may get kind of slippery. Few remnants of old building structure within the forest. Saw 2 snakes crawling, so please do look after yourself. One of the entrance was packed with macaques.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113982447075945401846/reviews
