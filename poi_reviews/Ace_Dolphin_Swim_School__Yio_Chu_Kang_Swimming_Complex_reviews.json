Special shout-out to Coach WeiJie for his patient, fun, gentle yet firm way of conducting his classes.\n\nThe Coaches are experienced, have a standardized method and focus on strokes and stamina, thus children have good progress and  completed their Silver/ Gold SwimSafer exams progressively.\n\nMy children love attending swimming class with Ace Dolphin and I recommend parents to try them out.",

After 8 lessons now she can swim very well without floaties and now she knows freestyle and breaststroke  … it’s amazing to see her improved so much !",
