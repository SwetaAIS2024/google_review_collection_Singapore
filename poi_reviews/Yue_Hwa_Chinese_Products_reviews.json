Some products slightly differ from the other China supermarket brand.\n\nSelf payment kiosks available. Plastic bag is not chargeable.",

Pricing however tends to be slightly more expensive than your local neighbourhood TCM shop but makes up for it with it's extensive range.\n\nMost of the staff are however monolingual and can be a challenge when asking for items etc.",

      "text": "想家吗？五样在YueHwa必须买的东西.\n\nFive Items you should check out at Tue Hwa\n\n1) Authentic Chinese Dumplings that are Made in Singapore\nHaven't seen this brand at Fairprice, this  packet of dumplings are a good find. A little expensive cos it is made in Singapore unless most other brands.\n\n2) Cod Stick Cheese for kids??\nThis is pricey but so darn interesting! See pic.\n\n4) Chinese Beverages from Herbal Tea like Wang Lao Ji, Pear Juice and Apple Vinegar Juice\n\nTop fave amongst the Chinese. The price can be quite competitive when they are doing promotion. Check out the expiry date.\n\n5) Steamboat Little Fat Sheep 小肥羊 Instant Steamboat Packet\nBefore there was Hai Di Lao, there was the grandmaster Little Fat Sheep. This brand has lost some of its lustre and is not quite famous with people who are not familiar with China. They sell these steamboat packets at Sheng Siong too and it taste similar to Hai Di Lao.",
