Marshall Ho,2,"The coconut rice is fragrant and cooked perfectly. However, the dining experience was let down by the service. From the cashier to the kitchen staff, the attitude was noticeably rude and unwelcoming. It really affects the overall experience. I believe the staff either need proper training in customer service or perhaps better remuneration to reflect their hard work. Great food deserves equally great service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114608543636534555173/reviews
Alan Koek,5,"One of the best nasi lemak I have tried so far. The rice fragrance is definitely thumbs up, and not lumpy or sticky.

Worth the trip but limited seats in the restaurant.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115374109805844895323/reviews

Rong Jia Lau,4,"Nice comfortable environment for having a local dish. The chicken wing, otah, curry vegetables and chili I had all tick the boxes. It was not crowded during weekday lunch when I visited.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116771749648359443035/reviews
S Wun,3,"Aug 2023: so so only. Had better Nasi Lemak before. Good for just trying once or with tourists.

Apr 2025: about 2 years since last visit and I guess will be another 2 years if any. Was craving for nasi lemak and my favourite stall at Tiong Bahru was closed as the TB market was closed for renovation. Dishes were so so only but I must say that brinjal was good.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110012229164046535881/reviews
