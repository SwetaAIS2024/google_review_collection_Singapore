Stefan Ansorge,5,"I've been learning bass guitar with Jiv for the past two years, and it's been outstanding. He teaches you to understand rhythm and structure of music. Quality learning, instead of just churning out half digested songs.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107213398902325289517/reviews
Orla Stark,5,"I’ve only been going for guitar lessons there for 2 months but I can already see such an improvement. His approach to learning and teaching us is making us the musician, not the learner which is the best way to do it. In schools they teach you to make you the student but it’s not as good and fun as it is with Mr Rajiv. I’ve been getting cello lessons at my school for almost 7 years, and the way she teaches me is so different and not as helpful as the way Mr Rajiv teaches. The atmosphere of it is so calming and feels like you are in a music studio (you basically are). He also teaches you how to record music and make your own songs, if you’re into that sort of stuff. It’s right next to the bus stop which is very convenient for most learners. I highly recommend coming here if you want to learn an instrument or song write. Thank you so much Mr Rajiv!!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108969328620772435957/reviews
Mohd Shamir,5,Rajiv has his way with music and kids. He is able to connect with my daughter in a way I have not seen before and helped her gain confidence in playing drums. He is definitely a great music teacher and the ambience of his school is very conducive (not cramped in a room like other schools).,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100333164953547729206/reviews
Sulin Chua,5,Started learning the drums with Jiv since Apr 2021. Never thought that I would be able to play any musical instrument in my lifetime but it’s never too late to start! I wasn’t sure if it was just going to be another short-lived interest that would slowly die off but Jiv really inspires and makes learning the drums fun.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118172362068605433297/reviews
Alexandre Divo,5,"For the past 6 years, I have learned the drums with Jiv. He gives approach to music I had never experienced before: he makes lessons fun, interesting and efficient all at the same time. I very highly recommend the Musicians' Village!
Ps: bus stop and MRT both quite close to the school",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101826230167709915681/reviews
