Robert Chai,5,"Beautiful private art gallery space that is great for hosting events in a very private setting that will surprise you and your guests!

The owner and staff has been very friendly and would definitely come back again to visit!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101775319044798524953/reviews
ferdinanfiv,5,"A few days ago, I visited 39+ Art Space with friends, and I must say, it’s probably one of the nicest small-to-medium-sized galleries I’ve ever been to! The artworks on display are meticulously curated, a testament to the excellent work of the curatorial team. I’m still debating whether to buy one of the horse drawings above the lobby desk—if only I wasn’t broke, haha!

It’s such a great place to visit and get lost in the art. A big shoutout to Ning at the lobby, who was incredibly kind and helpful for educating and facilitating us!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110740325694306982502/reviews

Maan Yul,1,"The curation was spot-on, with each area having a cohesive and vibrant vibe that really drew me in. However, the experience was dampened by staff, who was unwelcoming from the moment I arrived. Their unfriendly demeanor made it hard to fully enjoy the art. It's a shame that such beautiful works are overshadowed by poor customer service.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114910950397170574361/reviews
