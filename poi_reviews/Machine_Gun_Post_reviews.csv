Forest BK,3,"This Machine Gun Post was built by the British for the defence of the harbour in case of a Japanese coastal invasion.
A second Machine Gun Post can be found further away behind the park's Public Toilet.
With a children's playground just side by side to the Machine Gun Post is, somehow a happy coincidence.
Inquisitive children may inquire about it presence and thereby learn about its history.
Talk about outside classroom lessons.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Fun Kwok,5,"This is a machine gun post set up to anticipate the entry by Japanese forces during the World War II. However as Japanese forces entered from Malaysia, this fort was primarily unused.
I would have been very intrigued if this was open for people to view, much like Fort Siloso.
The views at the surrounding is very peaceful.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102827686654539049214/reviews
Adam Lee,5,"Fort Pasir Panjang, located on the hill and cliff next to the sea, was completed in 1878 with two gun emplacements. The cliff’s high vantage point led the British to identify it as a defence site to protect the entrance to the harbours of Singapore. It became one of nine sites in which the British had set up their batteries, and is part of the British overall defence system for Singapore.

Labrador Park is better known for having been one of the British navy's strategic defense sites meant to protect the harbor of Singapore in World War II. The bunker was sited to protect the 12-pounder guns on Berlayer Point – on the hill right above. Another machine gun bunker is located behind the public toilet further down, along the foot of the hill.

This defence position was part of a strategy based on the popular belief that an invasion of Singapore would probably come via a coastal attack, and so the placements of these guns were fixed facing the sea. In practice, they could be turned around. This was the case in February 1942, during World War II, when the guns were reversed almost 180 degrees and used by the Malay Regiment in their 48-hour struggle against the advancing Japanese 18th Division in the Pasir Panjang / Alexandra Road area.

World War II relics such as machine gun posts, bunkers and secret tunnels - rumoured to lead all the way to Sentosa - can still be seen in the park. The former fort was a key bastion of the British defence against Japanese sea invasions.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115680102960193169110/reviews

Wee Han Tan,5,This old war relic was built by the British during WWII thinking that the Japanese would attack from the south by sea. When I was younger you could enter the bunker but now it is locked. One of the interesting sights at Labrador Park,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113994885645615349944/reviews
