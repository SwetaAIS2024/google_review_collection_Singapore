Ailsa Naismith,4,"I had a very good experience here. Service is professional, brisk but courteous and precise. Gave clear notice of expected completion time - actually, they had my frame ready a day before due. High quality frame, nicely hung and carefully packaged. And at a very reasonable price. I'll definitely return for future frame orders.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110925558258129692054/reviews
Jocelyn Chua,1,"Heard that this place does good works and yes it does, but I was really disappointed with my first experience on their service. Gave them the work with my event tote bag, and informed that we will need the tote bag back because my husband was told that they required the tote bag to keep the work. Hence, they informed that they will give it back to us upon collection. Upon collection, they told me that they gave away all the bags when other customers collected their items. Not even sure if the proper message was being passed down. Think that it is really irresponsible of them and really really really disappointed with them.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116566377777845037200/reviews
Hongye li,5,"I just had to share because I noticed some really mean reviews out there. Sure, the auntie at the shop might seem a bit strong-willed, but her professionalism and advice are valuable ones. Those negative comments totally miss how great the frames areâ€”they might be priced at a higher range, but they're seriously well-made. I really recommend the shop if you value for quality and expertise and I promise you will not regret it! Go see it for yourself before trusting those unfair reviews!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110626329683761634949/reviews

Despite the shop owner's brusque demeanor, their unwavering commitment to preserving the artwork was admirable. While their services may lean towards the expensive side, the quality and dedication are truly worth the investment. The refusal to compromise on the artwork, even in the face of challenging customers, speaks volumes about their dedication. This shop offers an expensive yet immensely valuable experience for those seeking unparalleled dedication and artistry.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101702294137186401818/reviews
HJ,1,"Genuinely, if you want to preserve your photos well. Please DO NOT come here. I went for a photoshoot with my family to get high quality graduation size S8R photo (difference between sizes s8r and 8r is about 2 inches). I could not find s8r frames in other normal shops so i told my mom to look for one in a frame shop.

Absolutely dishonest people who tricked my mom into paying for a frame that does not fit.

Reasons why they are a red flag:
1. They told my mom that a black $60 frame would be best to put my photo with full black background. If you are like me, you know that black on black sucks for a photo.
2. Proceeds to bring said frame and photo to the back where my mom cant see, and then bring it out already done, telling her ""Auntie ah, cut already look nicer"" (THEY ALREADY CUT MY $100 WORTH PHOTO BEFORE THEY TOLD HER) lack of conscience to even seek permission before cutting the photo
3. The frame they sold her was a 8R frame, which is the WRONG SIZE for my s8r photo. they could have told her to go elsewhere, or at least asked her before they did anything but no.
4. Everyone knows that the point of a photo is to be as centred as possible. Apart from cutting the photo on their own accord, they cut the photo unevenly. My perfectly centred original studio quality photo, became wider on the right as compared to the left, just so they could sell her that $60 frame, on account that ""it will look nicer"".
5. Marker stain on the photo. My mom brought it there to get them to explain. Gaslights her that the stain was already there and she just ""cant see it"". Mind you, its a studio photo worth $100. Obviously anyone in their right mind would check that nothing is flawed beforehand. If the marker stain was truly originally there, shouldn't you flag it out on the spot? If it was really not that obvious for anybody to see, surely the first reaction would be ""oh what marker stain?"" and not ""oh it was already there"". GASLIGHTING wow. another level of low.
6. The frame had dents and flaws. Mom brought it back to them and told them about the flaw. Once again, they pushed it back to my mom, telling her ""oh its like that one or you want you can just pay another 60 bucks to buy one new one lorh"". No initiative whatsoever to take any sort of responsibility for the quality of their products.

Please for goodness sake, take your treasured memories elsewhere. The fact that they bothered to lie to my mom is not at all acceptable. The followup audacity to gaslight her is enough for me to take time to comment and warn everyone else who is intending to engage their service. They ruined it for me, don't let yourself fall into this.

To those working at the shop:
If you are going to comment and invalidate our experience, I rather you take a look internally at how your staff is doing their job. Please take the feedback constructively.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111951290811646372641/reviews
