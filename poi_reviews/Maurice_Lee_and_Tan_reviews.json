This law firm helped me to identify all the pressing issues on a macro level and then zoomed to set up set my Will, Trust and LPA. I chose this law firm after some searches because they don't claim to be jacks of all trades. They are focused on a few practice areas and they did it well. They are easy to contact and responsive to my queries. It has been a pleasant experience. I like their professional approach and methodology in problem solving. They are customer centric. Now that  I have addressed my Will, Trust and LPA, I feel at peace knowing come what may (Covid19 or otherwise), I know that my legacy planning is intact. This law firm is a hidden gem in the East.",
