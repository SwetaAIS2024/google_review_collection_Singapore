Pesto Sauce,1,"Poor variety of food options and shops have short opening hours/often closed during meal times.  In particular, the zi char store serves especially terrible food - tried the steamed fish (strangely sour) and egg drop soup (tasted like it had gone bad and was so bad that my friends refused to finish it).  The fact that there are so few people eating here is testament to the poor management and food quality. Hopefully the shops here close down soon so the residents can get better food options!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110661274614661986817/reviews
N O,4,"I was jogging around the vicinity and came across this eatery. It was really quiet at 7pm. Most of the food stall doesnâ€™t look appealing. Was approached by the zhi zhar person and decided to order a sambal prawn with rice. It was pleasantly nice. Portion was ok, for $7.00.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116315505302335582154/reviews
Shawn Goh,1,Craps coffee shop. Happy happy stalls close. Happy happy open. Most are lousy stalls with lousy food and lousy opening hours. Nothing much to choose. Worst coffee shop ever. Govt must be silly to let them ruin this place. Will write in during elections.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108371301857855149431/reviews
nicole,1,"Bought the prawn noodle and paid $5 for it. the portion is so small not even enough to feed a primary school kid, how to feed an adult? Did not ask for what noodles I wanted and soup gave also very little. This coffeeshop has been constantly changing their prawn noodle stalls and it keeps getting worse and worse. The prawn is not even a whole prawn, its probably maximum 2 prawns sliced up. Not to mention the opening hours are so inconsistent. No vibes at this coffeeshop at all as it is so quiet and not all stalls are even occupied.

Just a disappointment at this coffeeshop, the owner needs to do something. It is not at a bad location, there just needs to be more variety.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102863097799122470932/reviews
Amy Yee,3,"Came here while waiting for consultation at DA Taman Jurong Clinic. Tried the pork rib prawn noodle (dry), got promo $1 off for all noodle now. 3 choices of noodles. I enjoy mixing meehoon and keow teow.

Mix rice here not much options.
Teh peng from drink stall is $2.20. Seems expensive? No price tag of drinks seen. Canned drinks available too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116058321475732523491/reviews
