Tot2travel WP,4,"Less crowded and will pop by when nearby for some nice fruits. Blueberries and cherries, both are sweet.

Repeated purchase for blueberries from Africa, ""African Blue"" . 2nd purchase after first time trying out this brand of cherries from Australia.

Jumbo blueberries is sweeter, non-jumbo will need to put a few days then will taste ""sweeter"" for ""Ozblu"" brand. Promo for Ozblu 3 for $9.90 for the square container packaging. Grapes from Australia that is branded tasted sweeter, than another No brand Australia grapes.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109058897885515300830/reviews
