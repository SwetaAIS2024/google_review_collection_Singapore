Kartel Kraft,4,"Staff is good but unfortunately I book the same days when it had an event in the hotel. The people from Indonesia came here and let the children play together in the hall way and very noisy

Not quiet at all. People always slam the door you can hear that.

But overall is good enough",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109636929844736051524/reviews
Mel Che,1,"The hotel is very dated, very old, and very mildewy. Air condition did not work well. Hotel only gave out one key to open door (key, not key card). Very noisy at night. I could hear footsteps, talking and outside noise through the night. Close to food spots but mostly Muslim food. I’ve stayed at 2 star hotels that were better than Hotel 81 Tristar. Do not recommend. 3/10. Overpriced for a dingy hotel.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113569906449071810578/reviews
Manuel Glöckler,4,"Basic rooms which are quite big and quite clean. Pool is very shallow i.e. 1m deep, but with good opening ours from 7 am - 9pm. Location is 15 minute walk from the Paya Lebar Metro station from which you can go in 30 minutes either downtown or to e.g. the expo.

Overall a good value for the price.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117250132390405558171/reviews
James Smith,5,"We stayed here for our first night in Singapore.
The staff was incredible and offered very helpful advice for us first timers.
