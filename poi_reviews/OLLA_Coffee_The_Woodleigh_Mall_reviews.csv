Jorryn Lee,5,"Love the coffee! A sip of it instantly transported me back to Melbourne where a strong coffee culture thrives. The cafe uses Nylon coffee beans.
There are 2 seats with electric sockets that allow working on laptop while enjoying good coffee possible :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116204850878907318924/reviews
Ivan Michael Pung,5,"Home of the Singapore 🇸🇬 Barista Champion 🏆 2022! Ok lah, in true-blue Singaporean Fashion, I had to come by and try this out! 🤣 Lol

Conveniently located 📍next to Woodleigh Village Hawker and at the ground floor of Woodleigh Mall 🏬, you will find this nice little café. Took my breakfast 🍜 at the hawker and came by to have my morning cup ☕️ and they are just 3️⃣ mins across 🛣️ the Hawker.

Café : Woody 🪵, Cosy ☺️ and Bright 💡. It’s not huge but it’s warm and very welcoming. Clean 🫧🧼of course and the seating 🪑outside are pet friendly. (I sat next to a nice Poodle 🐩)

Staff : 2️⃣ of them served me. Lady 💁🏼‍♀️ took the order and prepared my cakes 🍰 while the guy 💁🏼‍♂️, the barista, prepared the drinks. Very friendly, smiling and was more than happy to run some recommendations. Regret, I should have taken my breakfast here as well. Sometimes I wish I had 2️⃣ stomachs, the menu 📝 looks so good!

Coffee ☕️ and Cakes 🍰 : The cakes were nice and moist. Especially the chocolate, it hit the notes with the coffee ☕️. The Lemon 🍋 Cake 🍰came with a tiny cup of concentrated lemon juice and OMG, it was so strong 💪, lucky I didn’t pour it over the cake. Both were very nice and refreshing.

Coffee – Round 1 : Filter / Pour Over …. We ordered both options from Brazil 🇧🇷 and Colombia 🇨🇴. I preferred the Colombia which gave off a robust taste of Fig, Plum 🍈, Persimmon and flowery 🌸? (Guessing) Brazil was sweeter with hints of Sultanas 🍇and Peachy 🍑or Apricot? They both complement the cakes and it was well prepared.

Coffee – Round 2 : Café De Olla (Spiced Long Black). Ok ….. This one is totally out for me 🙅‍♂️. It’s too “herby” 🌿🪴 for me…. If you allow ✅ me, it’s almost like drinking Chinese 🧧medicine. The Chai and Spices were just too overwhelming for me to the point, I couldn’t appreciate the coffee. Skip!

I will be back to try the rest of the brew, perhaps a more conventional Latte or Americano?",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100551027047446956883/reviews
Hayeon Kim,5,"The price is slightly higher than expected, but I loved the ambiance of the cafe. It offers pet-friendly outdoor seating and is just a few steps away from Bidadari Park and Woodleigh MRT.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108692266308913262201/reviews
Fairy,3,"I only had food and didn’t have any drinks.

The waffle tasted a hint of orange, but didn’t have the eggy taste. I wasn’t impressed.

The toast with poached eggs and avocado was decent.

Overall I didn’t find it to be good value for money for food. However, it is cosy place for a drink.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110707374703256523409/reviews
Mason Tay,5,"OLLA—the name has a European ring to it. I was instantly drawn in by the coffee, the cozy atmosphere, and the soft, soothing music playing in the background.

It’s a small café, quiet and wonderfully relaxing—perfect for a peaceful break.

I happened to pass by and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the coffee. One sip of that rich, roasty flavor, and I was hooked.

Thank you OLLA.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108195777674730720034/reviews
