Saifu Angto,5,"Large size church with plenty of seatings with choir.  It's a mix between modern building and old ornamental, eg: stain glass windows.

A nice and peaceful place for a mass.

Visited for Christmas service a couple years ago, and photos included.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews
