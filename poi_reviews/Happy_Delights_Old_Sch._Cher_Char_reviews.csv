Joe Vu,4,Best Cantonese 'cher Char' store with 'wok hei' wok fragrance of the old school art of frying & cooking unlike those of Msian standard like of quick cooking. This guy works in a 5 stars restaurant before & knows his art well! Price is the cheapest in Spore & taste is hotel-like! A perfect plc for a good dinner!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104576786135323463711/reviews
