I'll remember Mr Zaki, a great Science teacher and the stories that he shared( If you're in his class, please watch his videos ;) ). I think they're gonna add another facility next year so watch out for that. They have wellness Wednesdays to help stretch and share gratitude. That's all i have. Hope you join our school :) !!",
