Came here 3 times in the past year and their quality of food consistently dropped. Nasi lemak with absolutely no nasilemak flavours at all.\n\nIt’s tough to do fnb in singapore but i really hope they can maintain their standard. They started off great, to “meh”, now it’s just bad.",

My fav was the belachan!\n\nRose and lychee tea was comforting. Wanted to try to rose latte, unfortunately decaf is not served here. Would suggest having decaf options as singaporeans are now more sleep hygiene conscious.",

      "text": "It is a small restaurant on the ground floor of an HDB block with a seating capacity of about 26. We went without a reservation on a weekend and waited around 20 minutes. For the price of around $13.80, the food was generally above expectations and came in huge portions. The ice lemon tea was very good. The service was excellent. The best part was that this restaurant does not charge GST or service charge (which typically adds about 20% to the price). Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience.",
