      "text": "NOW, Each time I order the same mini salad, I need to separate the meat onto the cover to see if the correct portion (by weight, they said) is added because I once noticed the meat was so little that I didnâ€™t take a photo to prove my case and the next visit onwards I will check first before eating.  Today, I reported to a service staff, showing the amount of meat therein and THEN he took out back to kitchen and returned with a box with double the portion earlier.   I now have 2 photos to show the before and after-complaint.\nOther than the above, the food is good - delicious and fresh; and itâ€™s for this reason that my family eats here regularly, like 3 days a week. The serving staff were polite and friendly too.\n(Notr: I was offered a free drink or small fries if i write a review; but when i told them it will not be a 5 star review, he said then I canâ€™t have the free stuff, unless i give them a 5star review ðŸ˜¬",

      "text": "I have patronised this outlet several times but today was a disappointment with lack lustre experience.\n\n1. I stood at the ordering counter for over 30 seconds with a few staff busy working roundabout the counter but didnâ€™t pay attention to me. I waited until a lady staff instructed a seemingly new trainee to take my order.\n\n2. I ordered 3 bowls of burrito bowl and wanted to add on beef. I needed clarification between the ground beef and steak beef. I used to have shredded chunks of beef and realised that it had been replaced with minced beef. I ended up ordering 1 Ground and 2 steak. When served, was disappointed that the ground beef version was not as delectable as the shredded beef version that my family liked. I believe the cost of goods must have been a critical factor for the change to minced beef.\n\n3. What made it worst was the 2 servings of limp and soft fries. This was the first time I was served such unappealing fries at GG. I think they served the pre fried fries instead of going for a 2nd round of deep frying for the crunch. It was sub standard and a big disappointment. I hope it was only so fortoday. However, since it doesnâ€™t serve the shredded beef anymore, nothing entices me to patronise again.\n\n4. Self service cutlery had the wooden forks and spoons mixed together. Disorganised. I had to pick several times to check if it was a fork or a spoon.\n\n5. For dining in, we had no choice but to use the disposable containers for our condiments including onions and cilantro. Such a waste of disposables.\n\n6. I hope the Australian Franchisor is aware of the situation and rectify the situations.",

I especially enjoyed the burritoâ€”it was packed with generous fillings and just the right amount of spice. The staff were friendly and efficient, and the overall atmosphere was vibrant and welcoming. Itâ€™s definitely a spot Iâ€™d come back to for a satisfying and fuss-free Mexican meal.",
