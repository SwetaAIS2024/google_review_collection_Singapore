Laura Abella,5,"Dr. Anne Hagarty is truly the best OB-GYN I’ve ever had. Her expertise sets her apart from other doctors—having delivered tens of thousands of babies, no one has seen it all like she has.

What makes her exceptional is that, despite her unmatched experience, she treats every case personally. She patiently answers all questions, provides genuine care, and offers unwavering support every step of the way.

If you’re looking for a doctor who combines world-class expertise with heartfelt compassion, I 100% recommend Dr. Hagarty —you won’t find anyone better!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101794631287153095807/reviews
Mercedes Ontañon,5,"Great, professional and caring doctor. Had my baby with her in Singapore and no issues at all after a C-Section. All questions answered and medical aspects straight to the point. A bit more expensive than other clinics and its usually busy (waiting time can be annoying but the nurses usually call you to let you know the exact time). The team is also very supportive and nice. Would definitely recommend the clinic for a pregnancy or important matter.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106126693587837228419/reviews
Joel,5,"Dr. Hagarty is diligent, caring, professional, and thorough. My wife and I are traveling from out of town and sought Dr. Hagarty after receiving an impressive referral about her when my wife unexpectantly needed medical attention. I have nothing but good things to say about her and would love to have her as our primary doctor if we lived here.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115688844895830651980/reviews
A. J.,1,"Wouldn't recommend the clinic. It is all about making money, no proper explanations, no report unless you want to get one for the insurance. But worse: trying to worry the patient to send her for more costly checks! Would have expected a doctor with 40 years of experience to diagnose perfectly and talk in a professional manner to the patient. Clinic not well organised and seemed untidy.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100864011239378823793/reviews
