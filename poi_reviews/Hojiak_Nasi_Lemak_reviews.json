The rendang chicken was delicious and reasonably priced, but my favourite is still the Ayam Merah (red chicken). The sauce is incredible—it really enhances my appetite! The nasi lemak and chicken wings were also great. I’ll definitely be back!",

The price is very reasonable and the taste is not so bad.\n\nWe’ve tried their bee hoon set and the chicken rendang rice set. It was a bit salty but still taste good. If you come a bit early, you can try their kway teow and other type of noodles.",

Love the chicken rendang; the portion given is just nice for a plate of bee hoon and the chicken inside is very juicy and tender. Too bad the kopitiam it is in has too little ventilation to enjoy this dish fully.",
