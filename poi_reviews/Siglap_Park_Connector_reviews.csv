Forest BK,4,"Access from Kembangan MRT Station towards Siglap Park Connector to get to East Coast Park.
Siglap Park Connector can also be accessed from the newly operational Marine Terrace MRT Station.
The approx 7 km long Siglap Park Connector runs mostly along Siglap Canal, passing by Telok Kurau Park, crossing Changi Road, East Coast Road, Marine Parade Road and East Coast Parkway (ECP) towards East Coast Park.
Paths are well demarcated for both pedestrians and cyclists.
