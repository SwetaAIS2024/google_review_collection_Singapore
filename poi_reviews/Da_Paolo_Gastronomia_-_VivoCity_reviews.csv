Phobe N.,5,"First time trying the outlet as there‚Äôs a promotion going on. Get a free Margarita pizza with any purchase of a pizza. (Every Monday)
It‚Äôs really very worth as the size and taste is really very good. Would patronise again if there‚Äôs a chance.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101218056141206229292/reviews

From the moment I arrived, they welcomed my friends and me with such warmth and genuine hospitality, instantly setting a positive tone for our visit. Throughout our time here, they were incredibly attentive, consistently checking in on us to ensure that everything was perfect, from the food to the overall dining experience.

Not only did they provide outstanding customer service, but they also took the time to suggest a variety of fantastic menu recommendations, which we thoroughly enjoyed. Their deep knowledge of the menu and their passion for delivering an unforgettable experience really stood out. Every interaction with them felt sincere and thoughtful, making us feel truly valued as guests.

On top of the amazing service, the food at Gastronomania was absolutely delicious, and the atmosphere was welcoming and lively.

Devy Pribadi,4,"Came here for coffee break, weekdays not so many people as weekend, managed to get a table. Ordered regular Hot Skinny Cappuccinno and Raisin Cinnamon Bread. Coffee was okay, but seems they have changed to the smaller cup now for the regular size. Bread was okay and got reheated too, served with butter and jam.
On the other day I came and ordered their Cranberry Cornflakes Scone and Hot Skinny Cappuccino. But this time the scone served was not warm, I would say it was still cold even though I‚Äôve asked it to be reheated. It didn‚Äôt taste as good, because it‚Äôs cold.
Environment and service is okay. They provided plain water too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827903087596800354/reviews
