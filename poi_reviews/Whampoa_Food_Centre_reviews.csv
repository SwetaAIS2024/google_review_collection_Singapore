Lorna Foo,5,"If you're a fan of flavorful comfort food, the mushroom minced meat noodles are an absolute WINNER! The combination of the savory minced meat and earthy mushrooms is perfectly balanced, creating a rich and hearty flavor profile that keeps you coming back for more. The noodles were cooked to perfection ‚Äì springy and soaked up all that delicious sauce.

What really stood out was the seasoning ‚Äì not too overpowering, but just enough to bring out the depth of the ingredients. Each bite was packed with flavor! It‚Äôs also served fresh and in generous portions, making it great value for the price.

This dish is a must-try for noodle lovers! Whether you're ordering it for a quick lunch or a dinner treat, it‚Äôs bound to satisfy. Highly recommend it ‚Äì you won‚Äôt regret it! üçúüëå

Yap Hoe BENG,4,"Feb25, Whampoa is a very old hawker centre, it‚Äôs used to be called Raman market, the 2nd market carpark used to be a play ground. I have try many different food and all is very good. Today I try the Mee pok at 01-118 ( there is no English name for the stall) and it is very very good. Noodle just cook right with plenty of meat & livers. It must be cook by the elderly man a true blue Singaporean - 1/2nd generation. I think it open for breakfast till lunch only.

AnnAnn Chia,5,"We try China hand made noodle after seeing good reviews. Have to wait for a while, many order. It is abit disappointing after a long wait, soup is too salty, if can reduce to half, it will taste perfect . We never drink the soup after 1st spoon, like drink salt water .overall still not too bad except soup too salty",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116999566776933957722/reviews
MyBean&Kho.,5,"Whampoa Food Centre, not visible from the main road, is popular with local people with one of the best quality/price in Singapore. This centre has two large blocks of covered food areas: one is operating early morning until 2pm, then the other block will take the relay until 10pm. Around this food centre, there are plenty of shops selling fruits, vegetables, meat and many other things at reasonable prices.
The toilets are quite clean with SGD 0.1 per pax, toilet paper needs to be requested for free with the lady sitting there.
With local friends, we enjoy certain food stalls. Food stalls have a number on the side, easier to find if you don‚Äôt know how to read Chinese:
-one stall 01-45 in the central area proposes nice xiaolongbao and guotie dumplings (steamed ones and pan-fried ones).
-one stall 01-70 proposes fish steamboat with a soup rich in anchovy taste. Different types of fish are available.
-one stall 01-79 proposes some Thai food, especially if you crave for stir-fried vegetables or seafood served in a big portion.
-one stall 01-26 at one very end proposes homemade kway chap soup (wide flat and thin rice noodle) served with a generous plate of pork meat, innards, tofu and egg, all for SGD 5 (unbeatable).",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113488965293874123641/reviews
