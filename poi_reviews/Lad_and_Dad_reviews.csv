Ashok Sankaran,5,"The food at lad and dad was exceptional and extremely tasty. The thick and thin cut fries taste very fresh. The fish and chips were very well done with a good amount of fish in a crispy batter . However, lad and dad is a good place to come and eat with family or friends.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116151474993521378025/reviews
Chen Johnson,4,"Fish and chips (small portion) with mushy peas and curry + Scotch Egg.

This place has been on my ""Want to Go"" for a while and I'm glad I took the time in the end. One of the most authentic chippies I've been to this side of the UK, and I was happy to see mushy peas actually on the menu and malt vinegar on the condiments.

Special mention to the fish batter, which is light and crispy enough that one minute you'll be admiring it and the next you'll be wondering where it went and why your arteries are dying of happiness. Order this on an empty stomach as the portions are fairly generous too.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102009231607870899791/reviews
Cheiro Theorem,5,"The food is fresh and appetizing, especially when paired with the flavorful sauces. Every bite delivers a satisfying crunch, it feels comforting. The batter is fragrant yet doesnâ€™t overpower the natural sweetness of the seafood. It's truly delicious.
The decor is minimal, and the environment is simple, yet very clean, spacious, and comfortable. Sitting outside in the evening, watching the storefront, the scenery, the passing people and vehicles is a perfect way to unwind.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106441412113355113329/reviews
Benjamin Park,5,"One of the best fish and chips Iâ€™ve had in Singapore. We tried the Scampi shrimp was good but the batter a bit thick however the prawns were very fresh and succulent. Iâ€™ll give it 7/10

The fish and chips haddock fillet is 10/10 , I prefer the original fries with double Tartar sauce (you can choose from 4 side sauces) .

Scotch egg was 9/10, very nice side dish with purple cabbage slaw at the bottom which was very complimentary to the taste.

Onion rings were perfect ! 10/10 . We finished it very quickly in no time

For drinks we recommend the Earl Grey Ice tea 10/10
