Wei Jiang Yia,1,"On the 26th of January 2025,
, a concerning incident occurred during my family's scheduled photo session
at Lilipop Studio (picture me), located at Suntec City level 3, #03-356. Upon arrival at the studio with my family of five, including my wife and three daughters aged 10, 14, and 18, we encountered a distressing breach of privacy that I feel compelled to bring to your attention.
Upon entering the studio at approximately 1:55pm, we were directed by a male staff member to a large white curtained area for our photo session. Shortly after, my wife discovered a hidden camera in the changing area, which was both unexpected and distressing. This situation not only caused discomfort and embarrassment but also raised significant concerns regarding our privacy rights.
It is evident that the actions of Lilipop Studio (picture me) in directing clients to an area under surveillance without prior consent constitute a serious violation of personal privacy. Such practices are unacceptable and must be addressed promptly to prevent similar incidents in the future.

I kindly urge you to take swift and appropriate action to address this grievance and prevent the recurrence of such violations in the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is highly appreciated.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113652049797649033204/reviews
