Tehsi siudai is $1.6 for takeaway ($1.5 for dine-in). Coffeeshop is not too crowded nor hot even during lunch hours. Ample alfresco space. Paynow available.\n\nEdit on 22 Aug 2023: a friendly warning to those customers who dine solo : pls do not leave your food unattended, as the mynas will help themselves to it!",
