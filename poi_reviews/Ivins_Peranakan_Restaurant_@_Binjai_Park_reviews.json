A definite win.\nBabi Pongteh was the star ðŸ¤©â€¦ tender & full of flavour. Loved the sambal potato leaves (a nice change from kang kong) â€” tasty without being too salty or oily. The Assam fish with ladyâ€™s fingers was also good.\n\nYes, Iâ€™ll be back to try the other signature dishes.",

Had the feel of a long run establishment.\n\nWe ordered the ayam buah keluak,\nHoney chicken, sambal kang kong, chendol and bobo char char.\n\nFood was alright and servings are small. Only 2 buah keluak seeds in the dish. We found it to be on the salty side. Desserts are not their strong point so will not recommend it.\n\nPeranakan food is not readily available in sg, would come back again.",

Very challenging to decide which dishes to order because too many dishes to choose from; furthermore, all are equally delicious!!\n\nIt offers small portion size so that you have space in your stomach to try other dishes.\n\nYou might wonder after having such a delicious and savoury dishes, you will burn a hole in your wallet? Fret not, it is priced reasonably. I paid about $85 for these dishes shared by 2 persons.",
