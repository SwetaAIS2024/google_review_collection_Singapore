      "text": "I think South View Primary School is generally a very good school . It rarely has bullying cases and the teachers there are not bias at all and most of them are understanding,kind and supportive in what we do . But I do have one teacher that has been my form teacher, Ms Shaan for 2 years in p3 and p4 . She helped me score AL1-3 for my eoye . She’s also super supportive and kind . Ms Shaan is also very supportive even if we don’t win . She said at least we got in the finals . She doesn’t have high expectations and gone through a very challenging class but she did not give up on us , she continued trying to teach us .Thank you to all my teachers who taught me a lot of things , even though some things were challenging for me you never gave up on me and continued trying to teach me . I am very grateful !",
