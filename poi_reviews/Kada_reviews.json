      "text": "Just a minute’s walk from the Maxwell MRT station, right behind Maxwell Food Centre—you wouldn’t believe such a gem has been hiding in plain sight!\nI’ve passed this area countless times, and yet somehow never noticed it until now.\n\nThe building, once an old hospital, has been beautifully repurposed into a collective space filled with eclectic shops and restaurants.\nI love the concept of preserving a slice of history while breathing new life into it.\nIt’s not a large building, but it certainly has character.\n\nWe visited in the evening, so we didn’t have much time to explore in depth, but even then, it was clear there was quite a variety of stores inside.\nWe had dinner at a lovely Japanese restaurant, and afterward, we took a ride in the building’s original vintage elevator—yes, it still works!\n\nIt was like stepping into a time machine.\nWith its double metal gate doors and fully visible shaft during the ride, it was pure nostalgia in motion.\nWe rode up to the top (4th) floor, only to find the rooftop bar had already closed at 9PM—such a shame, because even from the doorway, it looked like a great spot to unwind.\n\nMost of the shops had closed by then, so we called it a night.\nIt seems like the whole complex may have fairly short operating hours.\nStill, it’s such a cool and thoughtfully preserved space—I’m definitely planning to come back during the day to poke around a bit more.",

      "text": "Feeling like a tourist today with a walk around Maxwell mrt station and its vicinity. Very antique lift which is really beyond my birth era luckily I brought my mum along and my niece to have an eye opening experience. Of course the hype is about the various cafes and mix of food and massage and also accommodation this triangular building have to offer. Glad to have visited this on a weekend to see that it’s bustling with people.",

      "text": "My first impression of Kada Shopping Mall is that it’s really small. It’s the newest mall, converted from a former hospital, which gives it a unique charm. There are plenty of coffee shop options, an art studio, restaurants, a gym, and more. The place is also very Instagrammable, with stylish interiors and cozy spots. One interesting highlight is that they have the oldest electric elevator in Singapore.",

      "text": "Kada is a charming spot, especially for F&B lovers, with an interesting mix of cafes and restaurants in a beautifully restored 1920s building near Maxwell Food Centre. From Echo House for coffee and pastries to Lavi Tapas Bar for Mexican flavors and Alani for Mediterranean brunch, there’s a good variety to explore.\n\nThe space blends heritage and modern vibes, with Singapore’s oldest operational electric lift from 1929 adding a unique historical touch. While not a major attraction, it’s a pleasant place to pop in for a meal or coffee if you’re in the area.",
