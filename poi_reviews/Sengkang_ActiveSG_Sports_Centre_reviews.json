      "text": "Parking: very small sheltered carpark. The open air carpark at macs can sometimes be full too. Alot more open air parking along the entrance of carpark\n\nLevel 2 activity room:\nFor exercise classes. Nice big room, everything looks new and clean. Excellent space!\n\nToilets:\nLevel 1 toilet next to the lift is DISGUSTING. Very few cubicles, smelly, dirty, wet.\n\nThe other level 1 toilet that you have to access through the outside walkway next to the drop off point is very clean, many cubicles, BUT narrow. I have to squeeze myself out whenever I open and close cubicles door while carrying my bag. Also I feel can have bigger signage directing people to this better toilet, seems underutilised.\n\nLevel 2 toilet at the sports hall: ok sized, clean. Also needs more signage around level 2 outside the sports hall to direct people to the toilet inside.",
