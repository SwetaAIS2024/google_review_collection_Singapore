      "text": "Tried this kampong chicken for the first time and the chicken is tender and chewy and cooked just nice and very flavorful for the chicken. Except that it is a bit pricey at half chicken for 28$ and one bird cost 38$. Except if you have liking for the liver and gizzards, this is offered as add on with no charge. This is definitely a good place for chicken rice if you are fancy for kampong chicken.",

      "text": "I went here after watching the Chicken Rice stall testing youtube video of Angel Hsu and consulting the comprehensive excel list she published, with data of more than 100 Chicken Rice stalls in Singapore, including taste and hygiene (e.coli, lower is better ;p) Wow! That list is really nice, so much effort to compile it. Ah Five scored at the top both with regards to the taste and the hygiene. So I came here on two consecutive days, ate the Kampong Chicken Rice both times, I liked the taste a lot, and the owners are very friendly. I went on the weekend, at around 2PM, the atmosphere was relaxed and many free seats available at this time.\n\nUpdate: It has become my definite favourite Chicken Rice in Singapore.",
