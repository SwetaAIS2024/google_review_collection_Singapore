Van Chan,5,"This is a fab place to unwind after a hard day’s work, chill with your friends and sing your hearts out 🎤 🎶

Updates: Gossip Bar has shifted to a bigger space #01-27/28 (just 1 min walk from its old location) since Nov 2023. It now has a pool table & is a lot more spacious.

Have been here thrice and love the retro karaoke pub vibes and the bar grubs! Especially recommend the sotong balls & vegetarian rolls 😋😋 Couldn’t get enough of them ☺️☺️

I like the easy to navigate song search system. Scan the QR code at your table and you have a long list of English, Chinese & Canto songs to choose from.

Heard from the staff they have open mic Live Singing sessions on Thurs & Sat Nights. Would love to check them out in the future.

Great that their location is so accessible - It’s just a few min walk from Tai Seng MRT Station.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102169738300622572121/reviews
G Casey,5,"A great place for singing. The sound system is good, niche place with like 7 tables and doesn't need to wait too long for your turn.
They served Blanc, Guiness and KuroNama on Tap.
Definitely a gem in the area.

They live bands too on certain nights. Do head down if you are in the area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111625694854221114456/reviews
