BaoQin Daphne,5,"5 stars is not enough to justify how happy I am to have found Global Art Kovan for my daughter.

I joined the class for the idea of increasing her focus/ concentration level; but my daughter gained more than that. She learned to stay focus, to draw, to color and most important, to appreciate art.

She looks forward to the weekly class with Tr Truc who is never stingy in imparting her knowledge. Tr Truc accommodates to our timing so that my girl can fully be engaged, sends me photos of my girlâ€™s progresses and keeps open communication with me.

Global Art Kovan is a safe space for children to express themselves through art with no judgment but lots of creativity.

Thank you Tr Truc and Global Art Kovan.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110418551784395876263/reviews

Jacqueline Chan,5,"Location is convenient and easy to find, my daughter started lessons in Nov 2021 and she enjoys going to class every week. The principal Ms Truc is friendly and is accommodating to my requests for make up lessons. I can see a difference in my daughter's drawings in 2021 vs now. Will recommend Global Art Kovan to anyone staying in Serangoon central/Kovan area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100293896356623227084/reviews
