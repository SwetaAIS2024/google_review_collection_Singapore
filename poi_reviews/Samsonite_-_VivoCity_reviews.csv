Nicholas Chua,1,"Terrible sales associates, 2 of them weren’t even keen on entertaining customers, just standing at the side, caught them playing with their phones too.

Even though I went with the intention of buying a luggage I decided to walk out. Such a poor service for a reputable brand.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105321990394559402717/reviews
Joy Ng,2,"Came here to look for a luggage on a weekday morning where it was empty. The 2 older female staff here have no basic knowledge of the luggage and couldn't answer my questions about the material or services provided. Was keen on the Proxis luggage but the staff didn't know what ""made of Roxkin"" meant and even told me wrong info about the free personalisation provided. They even told me to find the info myself online- which I did later and one of them did not know what ""personalisation"" was.   Please train your staff to have basic info on your products- I don't know what they are getting paid for. Would have given 1 star if not for that they were not rude.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112204043398685672412/reviews
QuynhAnh Le,2,The store had three staff at the time we came in yet none of them knew which is which.  I saw that I’m not the first to have this type of complaint but it’s as if neither the owner nor their staff seemed to care about making a sales.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117800895705877290060/reviews

Hameed Aslam,5,"When Jesse Shwayder founded Samsonite® in 1910 in Denver, travel was once reserved for only an exclusive few, those who had the means to see the world. Given this exclusivity, travel was a high quality experience from the transportation, to the attention to service, to even the accessories used to carry one’s belongings.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101767038721387023498/reviews
