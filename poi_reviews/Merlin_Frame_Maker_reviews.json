Our latest piece was a little larger, challenging the size of the pasteboard but Noor figured it out and the result is stunning. Merlin is worth every cent and more. Thanks again for your expertise Noor!",

      "text": "I'd like to share my recent experience with this shop. I needed to replace the frame for a large oil painting, so I reached out to the shop via email for a quote. They were the first to respond, providing a detailed breakdown of their services and prices. The shop manager, Noorul, was exceptional. She took great care of my painting, even sending me messages on whatsapp to seek my opinion and approval before proceeding to the next stage. Given that my oil painting was old, they were concerned about potential cracks while restretching the canvas. Surprisingly, the frame was completed earlier than estimated, and it was flawlessly delivered. I was impressed by Noorul's professionalism. I learned that she has a background in graphic art, which explains her deep understanding of the significance of each painting and photo to her customers. She treated my painting as if it were her own, and I highly recommend this shop to anyone seeking quality framing services.",
