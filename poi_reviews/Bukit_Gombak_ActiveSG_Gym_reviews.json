Decent amount of cardio machines, 3 weight racks (to 20kg), weight machines, 1 power rack, multipurpose cable machine and 1 smith machine. Wished it had another barbell bar so people can simultaneously do deadlifts and squats, since there's only one bar currently at the power rack. Has a separate room opposite just for women.",
