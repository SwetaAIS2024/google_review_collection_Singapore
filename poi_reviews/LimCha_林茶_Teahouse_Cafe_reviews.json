      "text": "I think this teahouse just newly opening only. As I had seen the kettle flowing out smoke with its bbt drink. Finally it has landed at this spot at our little red dot.\n\nThe staff were very nice to recommend their signature tea - Ya Shi Dancong in iced. Cos the outside weather was too hot for me. Tot requested for 100% sugar level, not as sweet to my own. The staff did explain not to have the tea sugar level too high in over powering to its tea brewing. Also ordered their cheesecake just nice yuzu flavour. Will come back again for their orh nee cake & perhaps brewing tea in hot üòã\n\nP/S : be careful in climbing up & going down the stairs, quite steep & narrow.",

The atmosphere is serene and traditional, making the tea-drinking experience feel truly immersive and cultural.
