Í≥†ÏñëÏù¥,5,"My experience at IJ Sec was unforgettable.
During Sec 1 Icebreaker Week, the activities were fun and engaging. The PSLs were warm and welcoming, making it easy to settle in.

The 'campfire' was unique and different from those at mixed schools, creating a memorable and special moment for everyone.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112881937509423013859/reviews
Eric Yong,3,"I was on a bus when I saw girls from your school cutting the queue for the the bus at woodlands interchange, immediately when the bus came. I feel that this is a bad habit that should be corrected especially because they are not injured and should go to the back of the queue. I cannot blame teacher's
for not teaching them because this is basic etiquette that they should know .",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109201894514445947816/reviews
J X,1,"Students were rowdy and noisy. There‚Äôs a female teacher with the students who is equally rude. In the same lift as them, pressed the open door button for them to exit , the teacher just walked out, taking it for granted. Very self entitled. Not surprise to see the students behave this way when the teacher herself is so rude.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100690937580175323173/reviews
SaiKrishida Thevar,5,"I am planning to go to this school as I have seen the Instagram account of this school and it seems pretty fun and apparently it‚Äôs in a primary school so we get friends with the variety of age 7 to 16.
I am already in a CHIJ school and it‚Äôs not my favourite cuz they push the Christianity on me. We get that we have to practice god but it‚Äôs too much for people who don‚Äôt want That. It might lead to atheists. So I hope you aren‚Äôt like that pushing religion. Wish to join soon ü§û",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118280655722146396925/reviews
Risaki Sanako,4,"Generally, the school quite ok. Teachers teach able to understand. Good news, teachers here don't give a lot of homework(most of the time).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113686762810718079752/reviews
