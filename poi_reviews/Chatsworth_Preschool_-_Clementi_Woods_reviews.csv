Izzuddin Amir,5,"CW CW (Chatsworth Clementi Woods hehe) has been absolutely wonderful to my son, from infantcare to pre-nursery now at almost 2.5 years old. Love the outdoor space and focus on outdoor activities too. Thank you to all the lovely teachers that care so well for my son!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110701459311249505237/reviews
ying jie chan,5,"My son had been attending this school since he was a 4mo infant until 2.5yo, when we sadly had to withdraw due to house moving. He really enjoyed his time there and would constantly talk about his teachers with a lot of affection. There were many well-planned activities for the kids, and sharing sessions conducted occasionally by the teachers to update parents on the school curriculum as well. My son loved going to school and we would always drop him off with a peace of mind before heading to work. Thank you so much for all the care he has received :)",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109785039491112507934/reviews
Pamelyn Chong,5,"Chatsworth has been a great school for my daughter since she was 18 months to 4 years old. The teachers/staff are nurturing and patient with her, and we have seen her progress significantly during her time there. They also take time to speak with us parents on sharing her progress and developments. Big thanks to Ms Nicole, Ms Eve, Ms Judy, Ye laoshi and Deng laoshi!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112032330889071306478/reviews
U K,1,"I really regretted  entering my kids to this preschool.
Teachers didn’t take care well of children.  They didn’t notice when children got hurts. The Japanese teacher told us only good things before entering. I couldn’t trust her at all. I regretted to stay here for a year…I feel sorry to my kids.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118359857996014024563/reviews
Chinthin Ng,5,"Chatsworth has been nothing short of amazing for my baby from her 4th month to 18th months. The teachers are caring, the curriculum is great (lots of outdoor play and sensory exploration), and I feel assured and less guilty as a working mother who had to leave my baby under the care of another. When we have to pull baby out for a nearer and cheaper option, we were (and still am) doubting if we made the right choice. Baby seems to enjoy her time way more at Chatsworth than at the new school.

Missing Chatsworth deeply at 2 weeks after we changed school.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100535360433693499405/reviews
