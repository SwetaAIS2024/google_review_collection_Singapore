      "text": "Never been! It was the first time we took our seven-year-old to a children's in-line skating class. . . I wanted to skate but there were too many people. My classmates at Nanyang Primary School said it was fun, so I traveled across mountains and rivers to the west coast. . . The air here is good, and the children had a great time participating in their Summer School Holidays Skate Camp. Learned it in a few days. Itâ€™s amazing how quickly I learned rollerblading!",

Children attend holiday training classes. . . I had a great time learning inline skating at the West Coast Park and learned a lot. . I can't wait to go to class every day. There is too much pressure in life, and children just love to play. .\nThere are not many Summer Camps in Singapore during holidays. Children can learn English, exercise and have fun. Some children started attending classes at the age of three or four. . ðŸ˜†",
