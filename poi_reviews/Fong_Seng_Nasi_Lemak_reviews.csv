Kef Low,2,"Very normal nasi llemak. compared to the branch at Clemanti road, this branch is bad. Chicken wing is hard and dry, tasted like being fried yesterday. No ikan billis.

Only 1 customer when I was there,",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107955224785853922261/reviews
Drew,1,"Taste wise is ok. Fresh and good. Price wise probably not the most value for money. Paid $8.8 for fried bee hoon, egg plant, tomato egg, curry cabbage and one chicken wing. Doesnt come with a gold bar which i was expecting to find for that price. Probably can get the same kind of food from the coffee shops beside at a better value.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114066250562207640517/reviews
Kai,2,"This place is clean and comfortable for dining and the staff are friendly.

Nasi lemak wise is really disappointing. The rice is not lemak at all but a little hard. Fried fish fillet is normal. Chicken wing is under seasoned and dry.......  Ikan bilis is normal. In general, totally not worth my trip from the east......",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117612273412230021726/reviews

Jiak Pa Liao,5,"Nowadays, it is not easy to find fragrant coconut rice. The rice here was fragrant and better than Coconut Club. I assumed this is one of the best until I find another one. Eggplant was not so good. The rest of the ingredients were excellent and has old school style and taste. They were very generous with the chili (I got an extra plate).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101618764404579404742/reviews
