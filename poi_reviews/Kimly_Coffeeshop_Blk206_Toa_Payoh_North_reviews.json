One of them is Kimly Dim Sum store, selling its Dimsum for $1.50 per long and it’s highly hyped as it’s affordable.\n\nLui San Jie Mee Hoon Kueh is also one of the high traffic stores where they offer delicious MHK and fried KacheongGai.\n\nNonetheless, Poh Kee Chicken rice store is the OG store here. They offered succulent chicken meat and I must say this is one of the better chicken rice stores around Toa Payoh!",

However, I had a truly horrifying experience today that I feel must be brought to your attention.\n\nAfter taking a few sips from my Ice Milo, I was shocked and disgusted to discover a bug or insect inside the drink. This is extremely concerning from a hygiene and safety perspective.\n\nI hope this incident is taken seriously and that appropriate steps are taken to investigate how this happened and to ensure it doesn’t occur again—for the safety of all customers.\n\nI would appreciate a response regarding this matter and how you intend to address it.",
