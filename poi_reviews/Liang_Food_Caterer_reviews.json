      "text": "I’ve been working with Liang Food Catering for over a year, and they’ve consistently exceeded my expectations. We've ordered full buffet setups and bentos, and the food is always delicious, and the portions are generous. I've received excellent feedback from the attendees of our Saturday classes. The ordering process is simple, and they always go above and beyond to accommodate last-minute changes. Even their delivery team is friendly and helpful. I highly recommend them to anyone asking for a catering suggestion. Thank you, Liang!",

The only sad part was the portion of the stir fry broccoli with cauliflower oyster sauce was not sufficient.\n\nI would recommend their crabbites fried rice, sweet and sour fish, Chicken curry and chocolate eclair.\n\nWorth the price and will definitely order again.",
