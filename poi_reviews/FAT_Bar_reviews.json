People inside the bar offered us some drinks but the lady requested not to pour us and kicked us out. Once kicked out, they locked up the metallic door and kept all customers in drinking, playing darts, singing Karaoke and left us outfoor... shocking scene !",

It’s shocking and unacceptable that such blatant discrimination is still happening today. These are permanent residents who have lived here for over a decade. This kind of behavior is completely unjustified. I strongly advise others to avoid this place",

      "text": "Have come here 4 (?) times now. Probably will mark this as my local now. Good place to come for a drink and relax. I usually come alone to just unwind and relax.\n\nYes. I also read the other comments with 1 star reviews about the quality of beer and the singing.\n\nMy experience:\n1. I got the beer from the tap so it does not taste off. $28 per jug which is very reasonable.\n2. Yes. The singing quality by customers is not the best but my view is that if your singing is so good, you will be a professional singer already. The crowd claps - even if you sang badly - I guess because they are applauding your courage for daring to sing in public.\n3. Crowd has younger as well as older folks. Expect people to sing along even if it is not their song. It's obvious that everyone is out here to have a good time and just let their hair down.\n4. Customers are friendly and you can end up making friends with some old timers here.\n\nOne possible bad point is they do not have enough snacks (i.e. nuts) on most of the occasions I am here. But they are quite chill about you buying snacks from outside to munch.\n\nTip: You can buy snacks from the nearby 7-Eleven next to the Punggol Nasi Lemak coffee shop. I always get the Meadows potato chips which cost just $1 per pack.\n\nOverall, a chill and relax. If that is what you want then this is the place for you.",

I would avoid this without a doubt.\n\nBut if you have no confidence in your voice, coming here would be good. They clap after every song regardless.",
