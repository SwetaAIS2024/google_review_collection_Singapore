Tan Kwan Wei,5,"I would like to thank Mr Yeo for his extremely insightful lessons for the 2 years that he has taught me. Every lesson with him has always taught me something new that will definitely help me in my exams. His dad like humour and friendliness definitely lightens up the mood in the class, especially when A levels are nearing. He has inspired me to do my best for my A levels and get an A. He is a great teacher that deserves more recognition for his teaching skills and remarkable way of explaining difficult concepts to students.

Tse Hng Lim,5,"I would like to thank Mr Yeo for being such an amazing teacher. He is the most enthusiastic teacher I ever had and he always seem to be so happy and really enjoys teaching, which makes me more interested to learn from him as well. He explains concepts very well and in a way that is very digestible and easy to understand. He is very caring because he makes sure every single student fully grasp and understand before he moves on. He will always be patient when students ask him questions and is very willing to answer any questions regarding physic. He is willing to sacrifice the short breaks between/before lesson to answer questions and i appreciate that a lot. He also checks up on us after each exam and genuinely cares about us. Thanks to him, i can really feel that my understanding for physics have improved significantly and from j1 to j2 my grades have jumped from an S to a B. Once again, i want to thank him for everything he has done and i‚Äôll always appreciate it.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109786258191679807823/reviews
