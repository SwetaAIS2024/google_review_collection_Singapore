Jaws Lee,5,"Tried their Dry BKT, not easy to find.  Very savoury, abit salty, so must pair with rice.  For $8.5 + rice at $0.5, the price seems a little high.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109768592146500707028/reviews
Eric Chai,2,"1st time trying and ordered the pig stomach and intestine herbal soup with rice and fried dough fritter for $7. Soup taste ok only, not piping hot even thou using claypot, you do not find the soup bubbling. Pig stomach was good but the intestine was overcooked and not very clean so only ate few pieces and skip the rest.  Amount of soup was quite little and not enough for the dough fritters, rice was abit lumpy and i only ate half bowl. Overall average and will be my last time patronising, stall owner was also putting a grumpy face.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104748996103428144183/reviews
yuanting ting,3,"Didn't manage to try the pepper base soup. Went at 7 and it was out of stock already. Herbal version of Bak Kut Teh was normal, meat was soft and rip off the bones easily. Would not recommend the you tiao 油条 cause there is a weird taste like the smell of other food and not heated up.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113765866531387961234/reviews

Choon T,4,"Seems to be a popular bak kut teh stall on this area. Always a constant queue when I was there.

Not exactly cooked in claypot but rather served in a claypot. Tasty and delicious, generous with the ingredients for a $6 bowl. A little more herbal would be great!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114720035040328969753/reviews
