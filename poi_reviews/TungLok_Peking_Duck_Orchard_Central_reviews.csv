Ruth Go,5,"Had our company CNY dinner there and enjoyed the meal. Their duck is delicious! The different cuts of meat offers different flavour profiles (fatty, meaty, etc.) and comes with different sauces/accompaniments , there's something for everyone's preference. The other thing I liked is their steamed fish, delicate flavour with just the right sauce that's not overpowering.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112369372959976661693/reviews

Will I go back? Yes.

Sweet & Sour Korobuta was very good, beef was also delicious. Peking duck was cooked very well, skin was amazingly crispy. Over all we had a great experience. Thank you Mary for your awesome service!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104982698392088913732/reviews
Celine Le Cotonnec,4,"I celebrated my birthday at Tung Lok, hoping to enjoy a great Peking duck—and it did not disappoint! The food was delicious, but what really made the experience special was the impeccable service from Kim Lian. She was so kind and thoughtful, even surprising me with a little birthday candle to blow out. It truly made my day. I’ll definitely be coming back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104788573204193178055/reviews
Jeffrey Ng,4,"We ordered the Irish Peking Duck, and it was absolutely delicious. The chef expertly carves the duck on the spot, adding a touch of theatrics to the dining experience. The meat was juicy, and the crispy skin had just the right amount of fat, making it a standout dish.

The stir-fried French beans were another highlight, cooked perfectly with a delightful mix of clams and minced meat, adding layers of flavor. The spinach beancurd was smooth, flavorful, and well-executed. The salted egg prawn balls were enjoyable as well—the salted egg flavor was well-balanced, enhancing the prawns without overpowering them.

However, I wouldn't recommend their fish. We tried the Marble Goby, which was priced at $11-12 per 100 grams, amounting to nearly $120 for the whole fish. Unfortunately, it didn’t live up to expectations—the taste was quite average, no better than a $20 fish I could easily steam at home. The texture was unimpressive, lacking the firmness and flakiness you’d expect at that price point.

Overall, while most of the dishes were excellent, I’d say skip the fish and focus on their specialties like the duck, beancurd, and prawns for a more satisfying meal.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114361573681952194788/reviews
Melissa LovesIceCream,5,Irish duck done Peking style was crispy and succulent. There was only 4 choices of dim sum which was odd. Service staff was not attentive for a non-crowded weekend lunch,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111353505751212189241/reviews
