      "text": "It's been a while since I've last visited Miam Miam as the one that used to be near our place had closed. We ordered the Clam De Jus for starter. The slight creamy gravy didn't do much justice to the baby clams. A lighter gravy would probably bring out the taste of the clams better. The Mentaiko Crab Aglio Olio is a fail, or I simply don't know how to appreciate this version of aglio olio. The Souffl√© De Nauge is üëç. The fluffy egg on top is superb. I still remember how good Miam Miam is at their desserts, and the Truffle Chocolate Pancake did not disappoint. We can't even go wrong with their single scoop gelato, which we had a strawberry one topped with marshmallows and a chocolate one topped with cookies. I recommend going for their desserts as well as their rice dishes, which are way better than their pasta.",

Difficult to decide what to eat.\n\nCrab pasta and pork tonkatsu   tasted great. But the curry rice could be better.\n\nWill go back again to try other dishes.\n\nParking at this Bugis Junction shopping mall is quite huge. Parking shouldn't be a problem. There is an MRT station very near this mall.",
