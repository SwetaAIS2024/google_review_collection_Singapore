      "text": "My friends and I have breakfast here after our walk almost every week. I really don’t know why we continue coming here when the customer service is so poor. None of the staff has a pleasant disposition; they speak to customers in a very abrupt manner often with zero eye contact and sometimes even show impatience if they feel you are slow or unclear in placing your order. And as if it isn’t already the most expensive kaya toast eatery in Singapore (you can find kaya toast sets for $2-$3 less also in the city area; at the MBS foodcourt it costs $5.50), they charge 50 cents more if you request for extra butter on your toast (and only because the amount of butter on the toast is so little to begin with) (see photo for the miserable 50 cents worth of extra butter).",

It's not the first time we use the voucher anyway. Voucher stated clearly it was for local breakfast set.",
