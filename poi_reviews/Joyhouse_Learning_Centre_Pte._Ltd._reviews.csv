jay!,2,"in my opinion these are the pros and cons about this student care:

pros:

• some of the teachers are nice enough to help.
• there isn’t any actually HAHA

• i made some really good friends

cons:

• the teachers bang the table for the most stupid reasons possible

• the principal omg acts so annoying  when i see him. he is rlly biased and also cheap. he shouts when we make too much noice while they hv tution but they let us play one so like what they expect💀

•their homecook meals are rlly unhealthy. (some of them) sometimes right, they only serve beehoon with egg and sausages and also fish cakes. it’s not healthy?!?! the meals are also not really balanced meals such as nuggets and broccoli like huh??!

• your rlly have to behave well and like if u talk too much (it’s unreasonable) or make mistakes they r literally gna bring it up all the time.

• they gossip so much about their students . i alw hear them talking bad things about students behind their back like i don’t think they should do that you know it’s not rlly good imo.

•also, it’s not a conducive place to study at bc it’s so noisy. (the children playing and the teachers banging the table) therefore during my psle prep it was hard for me to concentrate

plz don’t go it’s trauma💀🙏🙏",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111666705229989012197/reviews
