      "text": "Utilised the SGH shuttle bus service from the clearly marked waiting area outside the Outram Park MRT Station's Eu Tong Sen Street public bus stop. Was there just before noon and had missed a shuttle bus, but another one arrived in less than 5 minutes. The shuttle bus is an essential service for senior  individuals or those with mobility issues, to ferry them from the MRT station to designated stops within the SGH complex and vice versa. Designated stops and frequency of the shuttle buses are clearly indicated at the embarkation / disembarkation points. Very evident that this shuttle bus service, operated by a pool of courteous and diligent drivers is heavily utilised.",

Friendly bus driver will bring me to specific SGH building skipping the heat. Free service for all, good for elderly people and children.

NO ORANGE shuttle came .\nOne of the coach passes us at around 645pm BUT DO NOT STOP. May I know why? Please counsel your drivers. We rushed from work to see our love ones and they dont even care. They are irresponsible. This is my 2nd experience.",
