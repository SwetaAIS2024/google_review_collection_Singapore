Mohammed Junaid,5,"Marina East Park is a serene and scenic escape located in the heart of Singapore, offering panoramic views of the Marina Bay skyline, the iconic Marina Bay Sands, and the sparkling waters of the Marina Reservoir. It's a peaceful haven that perfectly blends nature with urban beauty.

The park is ideal for outdoor activities, whether it's a casual jog along the walking paths, a relaxing picnic by the water, or simply enjoying the tranquility of the surroundings. The lush greenery and the waterfront views make it a perfect spot for family outings, leisurely strolls, or catching a gorgeous sunset.

A highlight of the park is its innovative design, which includes open spaces, playgrounds, and plenty of shaded areas to enjoy the tropical climate. It's a great place for both relaxation and recreation, offering a quiet retreat from the bustling city life.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112718123701423001485/reviews
