I felt their sincerely and joy in getting to know you.\n\nThe preaching is Bible centred which I enjoyed much. A church that takes community work seriously and at the same time offering “an open welcome door” policy. No obligations at all.\n\nChildren program are available too.\nIt’s a nice family church. Young and old are welcome there.\n\nAmple car parking too !",

After COVID situation, I have chances to attend the church according to my personal choice which is bring in me to gets new friends and gets to know more about the Lord who has been in my heart to believe more, trust more which makes me confident to be being Christian. Whenever I attend to the church, I feels that’s my home which is warmly welcomed, heartily friended, and the most supportive is people who have positive vibes, attitudes which I always wanted to surround myself with all these.",
