Barbette Strauss,4,"We found this provision shop tucked away in the heartland of an aged neighbourhood in Hougang Ave 3.  The provision shop was situated right at the corner and the interior seemed cramped, and stacked up with daily essentials ranging from washing detergent to tin food.  We are pleasantly surprised to find a wide range of Chinese tea leaves and immediately bought this Koh Kian Huat Tie Guan Yin (铁观音）which I have personally been using it at least 4-5 times a week for soaking my feet since I was 10 years old.  The elderly be-spectacled uncle might seemed poker faced but he tried his best to cater to the requests of customers and assisted us in locating products in his shop which can seemed like a maze for newbies to his shop like ourselves!
