Tian Lau,4,"Paul Ocean Financial Centre outlet you need to reward a Chinese lady in 50s to 60s working on 4.4.25  during lunch hour. She was very attentive and quick, if not for her, I would have given a lower rating as the first impression would have been quite fix at another lady who left me waiting at the door for 5min even when she saw me. Also your sandwich needs to be softer, while waiting for the other main course, the sandwich hardens until I left it untouched. I‚Äôve also attached the photo of the lady who left me standing outside the door.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114834492297240317408/reviews
Han W,1,"Rude manager demanded that I order a drink üëéüèª

Came here with my dad and aunt on Feb 19 at 4:12pm as they were near my workplace and wanted to get catchup.

I didn‚Äôt order a drink as I didn‚Äôt want caffeine nor was I thirsty, but ordered a pastry and 2 cups of coffee for my dad and aunt.

30mins later, a man with a very harsh tone, akin to reprimanding, stood behind me and declared that I NEED to order a drink. He didn‚Äôt have the civility nor courtesy to address me directly, and stood behind me to ‚Äúsupervise‚Äù and ensure that I have placed a 2nd order - the kombucha

What turned out to be a happy surprise ended off in the worst possible outcome.

The only saving grace was that the two waitresses had reassured me that this is not the store policy, and what the manager had mandated, but still advised me that it was best if I got a drink‚Ä¶

I understand if the place was packed, people were queuing up, and we had been occupying the place for > an hour, but the restaurant had empty seats and I had initially ordered 3 items.

Honestly, this was the worst experience. This manager makes the Parisian waiters look like angels.

Charlie October,1,"Greeted with totally unexpected and unpleasant experience from a prominent fnb chain. Seeing the good weather we decided to spend time sitting at the place on cny eve. When I proceeded to order (my first time here), i asked my gf to sit first. The lady taking the order did not smile and asked me if take away ok, i thought its because of cny eve. After receiving order i proceeded to sit and then the manager approached us and asked us to order and told us we cannot sit if we ordered take away.

I told him i din know the restaurant policy (he should be the one advising me) and told me not to sit. I told him i want to sit and be said price is different and so on, and i told him how much i will pay difference, he said must cancel the previous order and other excuses, he left inside and moments later another lady also asked me to leave and i told her i was informed of the policy and tell me how much i need to pay. The outdoor seating was empty with only one table filled and they have the audacity to kick customer out. Worse ever Paul i visited",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116731340539050186025/reviews
Ashish Bagchi,4,"Food is great in all the Paul outlets . This particular one is in the buzzing CBD heart at Raffles place making it particularly crowded at lunch time .
Although the staff tries their best they struggle to cope up with the rush hour crowd and that might be affecting the service with order mix ups and other delays .
In general it‚Äôs always a draw for the healthy and tasty fare they have standardised across their Menu and the coffee is always good which makes us return again and again . The chain will benefit in investing in staff training , development and other motivating measures .",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115354379134829799809/reviews
Sundeep Reddy,4,"Good spot for Breakfast/ Brunch meetings. Getting table takes time. Good selection of breakfast and bakery assortment. Staff is attentive, but order takes 15 minutes to arrive. Place worth visiting if you are looking for quality food wtih seating in this area.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100002925110091194623/reviews
