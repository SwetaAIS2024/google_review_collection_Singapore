      "text": "Itâ€™s not really worth the price for $10.90 for a 3 rolls set, at that price you can buy a salad with more protein and more vegetables that is much more healthy. The set comes with a lemongrass drink that cannot be changed and I felt that itâ€™s not that nice. And the options for the $10.90 set donâ€™t have much options for meat, the rest are all vegan. If you want meat you need to top up at least $1 more. Too expensive in my opinion for what you are getting since the materials are really cheap.",
