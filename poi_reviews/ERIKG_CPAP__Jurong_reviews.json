      "text": "The technician who is supposed to be \"in charge\" of me has poor work ethics. Texted him to request for rental of cpap but only reply 3 to 4 days after. Understand that there may be many enquiries but a response beyond 2 days is unacceptable. At least tell that he is busy instead of ignoring messages. Also he recommended the wrong mask which caused me to saffocate multiple nights. He only showed me 2 different masks whereas there is supposed to be a third mask which is more ideal for my situation. After responding he said he will contact me again but so far it has been months and no response. Shows a lack of interest and sincerity, and is very unprofessional!",

He is also very detailed and careful to make sure everything is placed properly. He also made sure I was comfortable with all the wires hanging all over me. Thank you for your patience and professional.",
