Sharon Chia,5,"Rise and Grind is one of my fave cafes at Punggol! Food is always awesome and my go-to is the mentaiko chicken chop. The best!! Cafe is nice and relaxing too.

This place will always be my top choice when I go to Punggol Oasis.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115809355717183714672/reviews
Louisa Seow,5,"Went there during lunch and they had a lunch set promotion, any mains with a free drink. Super worth as the portion is big and the chicken is tender, fries are crispy. Will definitely come back again. Highly recommended.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112596569035833956414/reviews
Lawrence Chong,5,"The food standard is still there but the tomato soup is too sweet. Steak and pasta are still great but due to the cold air from the air conditioner, the food get cold fast, esp in a cold raining day. Probably can use a air diffuser to disperse the wind flow or increase the temperature around the dining area.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108159182972565898884/reviews

Wendy Tan,5,"Rise and Grind at Oasis Terraces has become one of my go-to makan spots – I’ve eaten here a few times already and every visit confirms why I keep coming back. The food is consistently good – can’t say this enough! I’ve tried the chicken chop, ribeye steak, foie gras, and mushroom soup… all super tasty and well-prepared. You can tell they put in the effort with every dish.

The lava cake with ice cream – my favourite. And the service? Always friendly, prompt, and they never make you feel rushed. It’s such a gem of a place – comfy vibes, solid food, great service. Definitely deserves five stars!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109171816871388420361/reviews
