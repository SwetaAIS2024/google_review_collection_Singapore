      "text": "Have not ordered from Maki-San for sometime üòÖ. Saw from their IG that they have recently launched the Mega D.I.Y Merry Chickmas Fries Meal (S$14.90) and decided to give it a try.\n\nI usually order their salad but decided to customise my own sushi this time round. I ‚ù§Ô∏è the cute box design. The chickmas üê• fries were not too bad and the jalape√±o nacho sauce was not spicy at all. Mind you that my spice tolerance level is 2/10.\n\nIf you can‚Äôt decide what to order, can always opt for their house sushi or house salad. üôÇ\n\nDon‚Äôt really like their location here as it‚Äôs next to an arcade centre and washrooms. Not an ideal area to wait around to collect your order.",

The staff have terrible attitude problem when there is no order in the making. One of them was still listening to music with an ear-bud, pretending not to see customer. At the time, the store was not flooding with orders & they never will with such food quality and staff working there.",
