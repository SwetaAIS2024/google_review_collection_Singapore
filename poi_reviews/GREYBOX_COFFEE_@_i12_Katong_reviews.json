      "text": "Nice little cafe with okay coffee. Could be better if the coffee was just a little less bitter but maybe it was just the dark roasted beans they've used for their flat white and cappuccino. For those not so into bitter dark roasted coffee, you should opt for their medium roasted varieties. At least their coffee tastes nothing like the  charred burnt tasting coffee of some unnamed large chain coffee establishment.",

It’s the most logical strategy to do for cafes but apparently not many cafes implement it.\n\nGood deal and even better coffee!\n\nKeep up the good work Greybox i12 team!",

      "text": "Recently visited Greybox Coffee at i12Katong! The Americano was rich and full-bodied, the Jasmine Orient Tea has a subtle floral flavor that paired perfectly with the savory treats.\n\nWe had chicken sausage and egg wrap was crispy, flavorful, and generously portioned. The service was friendly and the ambiance was cozy and inviting.\n\nHowever, there was a minor hiccup - our order was mixed up with the customer ahead of us. Fortunately, I was able to swap it myself without fuss.\n\nConsidering they're still new, I'll chalk it up to teething issues. Perhaps additional staffing would help streamline their operations.",

The service is a distinguishing factor between a good and very good cafe. I was given a specialty latte with cake at the regular set price .. appreciate the sweet gesture. Will return!",
