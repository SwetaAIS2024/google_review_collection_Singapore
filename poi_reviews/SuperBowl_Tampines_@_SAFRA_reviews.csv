Kenny Yap,1,"Dear SuperBowl Management,

I am writing to express my disappointment and frustration with the service I received from your staff, Emily and Gerald, at the SAFRA Tampines branch on 20th December 2024. My group and I had intended to book bowling sessions, but unfortunately, our experience was marred by poor attitudes and unfair pricing.

We initially approached Emily and Gerald to book three small groups of 10 pax each for bowling sessions. We were informed that the walk-in price was $24 per hour per lane. However, to our surprise, Emily and Gerald insisted that we pay the corporate rate of $65 per hour per lane. This rate is more than double the usual rate, and we felt it was unfair to be charged this rate since we were not corporate clients.

When we expressed our reluctance to pay the corporate rate and requested to book single lanes instead, Emily and Gerald demonstrated poor attitudes and refused to accommodate our request. They claimed that the lanes were ""down for maintenance,"" which we found suspicious given that we had just seen other customers using the lanes, and there were multiple free lanes available when we were there.

We were taken aback by the poor service quality and unfair pricing. As a result, we decided not to pursue bowling further and left the premises. We were disappointed that our experience was ruined by the inflexibility, poor attitudes and extreme disrespectful behavior demonstrated by your staffs.

I hope that you will take our complaint seriously and take necessary actions to address the issues we faced. We hope that in the future, your staff will be more accommodating and transparent in their pricing.

Thank you for your attention to this matter",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102826891456368516761/reviews

Yingying,5,Good place to hang out with your friends. They don’t sell snacks but they do sell some bottled drinks. Typical bowling lanes. We walk in and there were still slots. Price is decent.  We brought our passion card and it was $4 per game. We also rented shoes. We played around 3 games and total cost about $30.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117289079780130956871/reviews
Ritchie Li,4,"Traditional bowling alley. No frills, serves its purpose. While place looks worn, the lanes are well kept and is an enjoyable place to bowl at.

Price wise considered value for money.

Place gets a bit chilly at times (but then again, aint it the same for all bowling alleys?).

Service staff are very friendly and nice.

Worth coming for people staying around the area.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100353451087931864909/reviews
