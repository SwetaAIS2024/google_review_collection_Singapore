KHOR Soon Chuan,5,"Tried yoga & meditation with Instructor JiaXin for the first time.
She's generous and candid with her knowledge and sharing about meditation and wellness.
Not my first encounter (albeit first with AHA Move), we did meditation (sound bath-aided) and it's a great first wholesome experience for myself.
Will go back to try other categories.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100034940187578790171/reviews
