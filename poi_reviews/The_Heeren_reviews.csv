The history

Sharmilla Singh-Binda,4,"We were waiting at this building for our food delivery and one of the security staff was super friendly and helpful, his name is Suhaime. Suhaime thanks for helping us with our stroller and the kids, you are so kind!

Taking away one star as I didn't like is all of the smokers (workers in black pants and shirts) in front of the building, there were at least 8 or 9 of them. Guests inhaling that much second hand smoke is not ok!  The smell was terrible and we had to go back inside the building.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103373569815090682575/reviews
Johnny,5,"The Heeren is centrally located on orchard road, convenient and accessible. There is a bus stop just in front of the building which is opposite Mandarin Hotel. Alternatively take a train by mrt and stop at Somerset station. There is also ample parking for those who drive. Robinsons department store is the anchor tenant. Robinsons is the iconic department store founded in 1858. The older folks will remember fondly this grand dame situated at Raffles Place until the building was destroyed by a fire in 1972. Thereafter Robinsons moved to Specialist Centre than to Centrepoint and finally to the Heeren. Robinsons have always prides it self of good service and premium products. They have beauty products, men, women and kids departments and a home department.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114447936007656708756/reviews
