Abhishek Misra,3,"Food is good but 4 stars as chicken satay was double fried. Tiger beer draft was ok.

Decent atmosphere.

Not much of service offered as you lookup the menu and order on your phone. Finally you walk to the counter to pay the bill.

Quite expensive.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105271974882046100826/reviews

Zin Mar,5,"Harry Resorts World Sentosa is truly stands out! This place is a must-visit in Sentosa area. The food boasts flavourful options. Pizza features a thin crust and crispy texture. Fish and Chips is generously portioned and reasonably priced. It pair well with Beer.Their kid meal is well-suited for young diners. They incorporated WOW Factor. Peter, their formal service provider, exemplified extraordinary kindness and professionalism, demonstrating the significant influence of even a small act of kindness. He proved to be exceptional with children and gained my parents' appreciation. Peter eschewed high-pressure sales techniques and provided comprehensive explanations of the menu. Even in a crowded restaurant, numerous customers specifically requested his service. He delivered outstanding service consistently to all patrons. We were extremely impressed. Thank you for providing insightful food recommendations. Peter undoubtedly positively impacts his brand. We left with full bellies and happy hearts.Harry should really proud for their menu merchandising.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102929314091380892367/reviews
