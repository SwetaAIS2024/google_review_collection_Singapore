Mee Siam comes with thick rich gravy, and must add a piece of Otah. Also tried the rice options like Nasi Lemak, and Mee Rebus, not bad!",

There‚Äôre options to add a fried fish cake and choice of regular drink to your set meal. My sambal fried rice was decent and although is on the wetter side, was tasty and fragrant. Coffee is dependably good.",

      "text": "Ordered their Kaya Butter Toast set. The half boil eggs are perfectly cooked. You have to de-shell the eggs personally. If it's a problem, ask if the staff can crack the eggs for you.\n\nThe butter in the kaya toast was  a 'Little' disappointing...Little is the key word here...pun intended. Killiney Kopitiam @ East Coast Road was way more generous with their butter. You get a 'whole' slab of butter that covers almost the entire length of the toast! Here you get 4 tiny squares and you can't taste or feel the butter in your mouth. Can be either good or bad depending on your butter tolerance! I have seen people removing the butter from their kaya butter toast and throwing the butter away. üòÇ\n\nMore butter like what I get at Killiney East Coast and I will add 1 more ‚≠ê.\n\nService was excellent by friendly and chatty staff that were proud of her barista craft and highly recommend her kopi-peng! That's great!\n\nHighly recommended!",
