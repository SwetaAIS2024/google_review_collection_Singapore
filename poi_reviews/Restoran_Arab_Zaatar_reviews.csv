Saveendra Ekanayake,5,"Had an amazing meal at Restoran Arab Zaatar! The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, making us feel welcome from the moment we arrived.

We tried the Madfoon Chicken, and it was absolutely delicious â€“ tender, flavorful, and paired perfectly with fragrant rice and savory broth, with generous portion.

The desserts were a highlight too, especially the assortment of baklava and nut-filled sweets â€“ so rich and satisfying! We also enjoyed the Arabic tea, which added a nice finishing touch to the meal.

The ambiance was cozy and authentic, with beautiful Middle Eastern decor and comfortable seating. Great value for money and an overall fantastic experience. Highly recommend!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112485216419568676213/reviews
Denis,5,"Interesting culture and food experience and efficient service.

If you're ordering the family platter the cooking time takes a while.

We couldn't finish the family platter and added on one portion of rice.

Overall the food is yummy and drinks like tea goes well with their food tooðŸ¤¤

Thank you",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107269275231105198912/reviews
tm sii,4,"Located at the ground floor of Encorp Marina Puteri Harbour, it's rather a quiet place during the day. Awesome fresh from oven crispy roti and it tastes great even if eating it plain. Chicken dumper and shakshuka egg are delicious too.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104063137357045257769/reviews
Shakir Ahmed,5,"Excellent! The best Arab rice dishes in Johor. My favourite is Lamb Maqluba and the lamb is always very tender and succulent. Portions are huge! Great place to go with friends and family for lunch or dinner and chill.
The only drawback is there's no shisha.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115673366796902686634/reviews
saudah S,5,"Good service and friendly staffs. We enjoyed the food here and the atmosphere. Such a beautiful and cozy restaurant. We ordered the lamb and chicken rice set. It was delicious. Comes with two types of soup. The Arabic mint tea and strawberry drink were good. They sell arab perfumes too at the entrance. And outside is their kunafa station. Next round, would definitely try their kunafa.

Seating might be a little bit limited although it is 2 storey. Seems like parking is not so direct access. So, we just parked by the road side. This restaurant is definitely our top spot for Arab food in Johor. Will definitely come here again.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108990974633776639780/reviews
