YH J,5,"Very reasonably priced mixed vege stall. Offers both porridge and rice. Great supper spot with wide variety of dishes. Coffeeshop still bustling with life even late at night.

Tip: order one person serving even if you are sharing so you can get more dishes :)",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110082210226531439831/reviews
