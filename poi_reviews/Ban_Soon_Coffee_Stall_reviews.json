      "text": "A Gem with a rough edge.\nThis stall is tucked away inconspicuously among the brightly lit new addition to the hawker centre. He serves a wicked cup of coffee. The coffee has a bold and strong body, low acidity, with an earthy bitter sweet after note. I suspect he has some share of a coffee plantation or at least some secret dealing. Every cup is a \"Kopi å¤´\"; a fresh brew everytime. He will add coffee powder and brew a thick brew to the pot before serving. He will not compromise his drinks and will not use a cup or a glass that is not clean to his liking. After a few times, the owner will remember your favorite orders.  He is not fancy or adore himself with a new stall front, just a simple good cup of coffee.",
