Also, the aircon is very loud. Thanks",

Stumble on this & decided to walk in to see if they had availability for next few days.\n\nWe were met with Joel who was happy to show us what some of the rooms looked like.\n\nWe went across the street to have a drink/snack, checked pricing with booking sites & booking directly, and Joel was correct, booking direct was cheaper than Bookings.com!\n\nWe booked 2 nights, and I walked across the street and mentioned that it was our honeymoon trip.\n\nWe came early to drop off our bags on check-in day and left. Upon return (early check-in was available, Joel messaged as he said he would), our luggage was already in rhe room, and a nice display/card was on the bed!\n\nWe like that all the mini bar items are complimentary and replenished!\n\nJoel is ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ and is an asset to your establishment.",

We slept late last night and wanted to get extra sleep, but the loud bangs and vacuums noise is really disrupting…",
