Runner Kao,4,"Happen to visit Highland Centre for work and explored for a little bit. Level one is dominated by a printing company called Batok Sign. The rest of the shops are services providers including other printing companies, maid agencies and more. The only food I can find is Durian Empire, where it serves mostly desserts. A cool little rustic centre where it is mostly business. ðŸ˜Ž You might be able to find a niche service you need.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106055160577192220530/reviews
