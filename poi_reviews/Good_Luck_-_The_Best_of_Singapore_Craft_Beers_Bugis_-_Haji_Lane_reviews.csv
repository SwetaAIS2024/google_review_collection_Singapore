wan de ping,5,"You can call them if they have table before going down . And they do make an effort to get back. But best is just walk in .

Food was pretty good. ambience was also nice , and get to enjoy music from other restaurants. So is still easy to chat with friend .
Attentive Service from Val, Colin , Shane.

Got shoots for Galentine! Really good too with a local flavour .

Great place to chill out after work or catch up with friends .",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117714418821789646915/reviews
XH Tan,5,The food offering is interesting. We went in for some snacks and drinks. They served the wrong beer and gave us the drink for free. We know that the taste is kinda different but wasn’t really paying attention to what was being served when it was brought to us. Wouldn’t have realised it if the staff hadn’t told us.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118421080287778142136/reviews
Suzanne-Cindy Fromson,5,The beers are amazing and the food is phenomenal. Taste the beers and order food from Fatt Choy Eating House. We ate the Sichuan Dumplings and Iberico Stays skewers and they were so good. Worth the price tag.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115994998310620832709/reviews
