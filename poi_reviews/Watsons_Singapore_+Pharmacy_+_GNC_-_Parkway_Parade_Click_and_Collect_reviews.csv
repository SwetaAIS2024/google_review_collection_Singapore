Tim Fredricks,1,"Had a very nasty experience from the indian cashier. I was queuing up behind one single lady to make a purchase. At first, I was not aware of the specific direction to queue from. Hence, i stood on the right of the lady in front of me. After a while, I realised the direction of the queue started on the left of the lady, hence I moved. No one was behind me at this moment. It was just the lady in front of me and myself. A few seconds later, a man queued behind me. This was AFTER I moved to the correct direction of the queue. However, this Indian cashier told me to move behind the man who joined the queue after I moved to the correct direction, as he pointed out I was queuing from the wrong direction. But I moved to the correct direction before the man behind me joined the queue! This is blatant bullying by the Indian cashier. Watsons is supposed to provide support to the customers‚Äô wellbeing, not rob them of it. Pure unprofessional act on the Indian cashier‚Äôs part. If you (the Indian cashier) has an attitude problem with his job, please go back to your own country, do not take it out on innocent consumers. Singapore does not need unprofessional workers like you!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104564842047388127328/reviews
