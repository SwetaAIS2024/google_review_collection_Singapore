S Elan,5,"Things are all fresh, and refried when you pick. Super quick can just wait there for a few minutes. Very generous with kuah and onions and chillis. Tasty ingredients. Reasonable pricing.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103544649935674572451/reviews
Bosch Xie,5,"Would rate this 4.5 star. The rojak was fried to perfection, crispy as it should be. Went well with the delicious gravy, which were seasoned well with peanuts and some kind of soft fruit-like seeds where upon bursting gave an extra sweetness to the gravy. The rojak pieces tasted better after cooling down for a while and still maintained the crunchiness. Paired well with the iced teh tarik from next door. After the meal, didnâ€™t feel greasy despite fried food. Price wise for the rojak was reasonable $7.50. Definitely top few rojak in Singapore.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104650723552655383899/reviews

Christopher Tan,5,"Lunch with bro and family. Nasi lemak Q too long so chose this as only 2 queuing. Total came to $16. At geylang serai, probably $3-4 cheaper.

Upon dipping the items into the sauce and taking a bite, gravy taste similar to geylang serai. Thick and starchy, not watery. Food not oily. The items are also reheated which makes it more tasty. Even my bro said it was good. Though expensive I felt, at least food makes up for it.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108503604929176809063/reviews
