      "text": "We are extremely pleased with this preschool and highly recommend it to other parents!\n\nThe teachers here are exceptionally nurturing and patient, and they genuinely respect each child as an individual. Unlike other preschools I’ve visited, I’ve never seen any shouting or screaming from the teachers toward the students. The atmosphere is always calm, positive and cheerful, which reflects the professionalism and care the teachers provide.\n\nThe administrative staff are equally wonderful—polite, cheerful, and always greeting us with warm smiles during pickup and drop-off. It’s a pleasure to interact with them every day.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of this preschool is the long tenure of its teachers and exceptionally low turnover rate. This reflects the nurturing work environment and strong sense of community among the staff. With such stability in their roles, the teachers provide consistent, supportive interactions with the students, creating a dependable and secure atmosphere where children can truly thrive.\n\nThe preschool also organizes monthly excursions, giving students opportunities for more exposure and holistic learning experiences. My daughter looks forward to these outings every month, and they have become a highlight of her school experience.\n\nSpecial mention to Ms. Chuxian and Ms. Wang Laoshi, who have been instrumental in my daughter's development:\n\nMs. Chuxian has done a remarkable job instilling discipline and reinforcing rules with a patient yet firm approach. This has helped my daughter understand and respect boundaries, both at home and in school. She is always prompt in providing updates and feedback, ensuring I’m well-informed about my daughter's progress and experiences.\n\nMs Wang Laoshi is truly nurturing and encouraging. She creates a supportive learning environment that my daughter loves, often speaking about it with great excitement. Her attention to detail is exceptional, and her updates about my daughter’s progress and behavior are invaluable.\n\nBoth Ms Chuxian and Ms Wang Laoshi’s dedication and genuine care have made them an irreplaceable part of my child’s journey.\n\nWe are deeply grateful for the outstanding educators and staff who have made this preschool a fantastic place for children to grow and learn.\n\nThank you to the entire team for your dedication!",

      "text": "My child used to dislike learning Chinese, but  loves her mother tongue now due to the loving dedication of the chinese teachers, 解老师 and 金梅老师.  We are grateful for English teacher, Miss Vineeta for always making lessons fun and interesting.  My child has grown to be more confident, outspoken, independent and loves learning.\n\nHighly recommend this school especially for the positive vibes and tender loving care. The outstanding dedication to every child is beyond description.  The gatekeepers Miss Ching, Miss Woong, the principal Miss Doreen and vice principal Miss Chuxian, have displayed exceptional patience, loving attention and kindness towards the children and parents, it just comes out naturally from them.\n\nMy child looks forward to school everyday and as the year is coming to an end, she has made many good friends and memories, and will surely miss her happy and fulfilling memories in the school as she graduates.",
