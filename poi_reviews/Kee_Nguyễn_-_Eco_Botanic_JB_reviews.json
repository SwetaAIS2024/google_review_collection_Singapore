      "text": "Taste 4/5 The coffee is pretty strong as expected of Viet coffee. Don’t expect it to taste like espresso though\n\nService 3/5 my coconut coffee is pretty delicious but I personally didn’t like how pushy the girl was in getting me to purchase their classic instead of my coconut coffee choice. I had to insist THREE times that I want the coconut coffee.. every time she suggested the classic\n“I suggest the classic coffee because it’s the usual choice”\n“no, I want the coconut coffee”\n“But people usually go for the classic ya”\n“no, I like coconut”\n“The classic is quite nice with the condensed milk, you can try”\n“no, I prefer coconut”\n\nLike. Seriously?\n\nAtmosphere 3/5 Quite dim inside the cafe just now.. not my preference but at least I only had take away.",

      "text": "Tucked in between car workshops along a stretch full of workshops, it’s easy to miss especially when a car is parked in the shopfront (the cafe is sharing space with a design firm Gliss design)\nWe missed it going past the first round and made a big turn to check if Google maps was wrong.\nFinally after a hot and tedious ride, we entered into its small and cool interior. Small and clean space, perfect for working on a hot afternoon with easy music playing in the background.\nThe coffee is excellent!! Super good! I had the salted coffee, specifying that I want it less less sweet, the lovely barista made it perfect! Slightly salty with strong coffee and a hint of sweetness to bring everything together.\nMy friend had the Mocha coffee which was also good with deep chocolatey flavors. A bit too sweet for me but he loved it. Definitely worth a visit!",

I enjoyed a classic iced coffee (SO AFFORDABLE) and the company of Jaclyn, who worked the register. Be sure to check out this spot and keep an eye out for new locations opening in October ☺️",
