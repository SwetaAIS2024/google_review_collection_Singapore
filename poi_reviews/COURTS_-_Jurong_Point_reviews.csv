Xinjie OO,5,"I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the exceptional service provided by Mr Harry and Mr Afiq.  Mr Harry's extensive product knowledge, particularly regarding various air cons, allowed me to confidently make a purchase. He patiently explained the pros and cons of various models and, beyond air con, offered valuable guidance on choosing a suitable water heater.  Mr Afiq's service was equally impressive; he efficiently handled the payment process and ensured the air con installation appointment was scheduled to meet our needs.  Courts is fortunate to have such dedicated and knowledgeable employees.  I highly recommend them.üëçüèªüëçüèªüíØ",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107541382258819713531/reviews

Steven Hoe,5,"Went to look for a vacuum at courts, met hisham who came across as sincere, honest, down to earth, patient and knowlegeable.

He not only give good advice for the products that he knows well, but for those he isnt, he is honest to say he isnt and will get someone else to help.

Ended up buying 2 bosch vacuum and other items like iron, microwave and water filter on separate trips. Because i feel that i can trust him. Good job!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118217536480491001084/reviews

Janice Lim,5,"I was looking for an ipad and came across ipad promotion at this branch. After browsing the options available, we were attended by Mr Koh Xiong Hui who helped advise us on our choices. He's knowledgeable and was able to evaluate the requirement needed for my usage. I bought an ipad air 13"" 256GB as the 512GB has no stock and will have to wait a month or more.  Xiong Hui was helpful and friendly. He even helped out the cashier to count the bank vouchers which I included during my payment. I went again to Courts Jurong Point just last Friday to get the Pro-Pencil that my girl requested. Xiong Hui immediately help out with the retrieving of the stock till ensuring the payment are smooth, he did the packing and also help out to ensure I collected my LPrivilege points. The sales transaction is smooth and pleasant. I would recommend Xiong Hui to my friends if they are looking for any IT gadgets at Courts JP.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112688296009587866198/reviews
