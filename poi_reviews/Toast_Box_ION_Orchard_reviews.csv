Patrick Lin,4,"Good iced coffee. Decent Kaya toast. Check box (Kaya toast). Checked ✔️

It's food court adjacent location. So expect food level ambience, service and food quality. The store has seating too but it was full.  But plenty seating outside the store in the actual food court. No sweat.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114905200627730952515/reviews
stephanie liu,1,"Toast box, do you srsly think it's acceptable for ALL your takeaway cups to constantly be leaking to this extent and scalding us???
Almost $3 and yet you cant even R&D a decent, spill-free packaging. I would rather you give us the kopitiam style plastic bag pls",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115230312562520964748/reviews
Roland Polzin,5,"If you're new, the food ordering system and menu might take some getting used to. However, the dishes are priced fair, taste great, and come in good portions. The coffee and tea are good too, so I'd recommend getting one along with your food. Come here if you're looking for some local food without frills that makes you full and happy. Highly recommended  :)",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111892328568969891470/reviews

Priscilla L,1,Got the traditional kaya toast set. Kopi was just ok. Had better kopi at other places. I don't like runny eggs. Plastic individual soy sauce and pepper for dine in option. It's not worth the price.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117973749974288025363/reviews
