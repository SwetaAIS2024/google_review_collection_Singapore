Gulshan Singh,5,"Do yourself a favor and visit this lovely bar. Being a drinking INSTITUTION in the Chinatown bar scene, the service is unmatched. The staff truly cares about your experience. The experience is absolutely amazing.

A wonderful place to catch up with friends, old and new alike over drinks. Feeling hungry? Fret not as they also dish out bar bites.

Been going to this bar over the years and they have certainly kept up with times but with an old school, feel-good vibe. Great music, drinks and company, this is my go to place whenever I am in Chinatown.

So what are you waiting for? Highly recommend!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101708949778997311316/reviews

Matteo D'Antonio,5,"We have loved Mabuhay since 2019; the ladies have always been sweet, accommodating, and very honest with the bill, even when we were intoxicated. However, this year we encountered a lady who appeared to be dishonest. She claimed that we had given her a drink when we had not. The first time it happened, we tried to ignore it, but last night it occurred again. This behavior is concerning and does not reflect the positive experience we have come to expect from Mabuhay.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112265047319177519533/reviews
