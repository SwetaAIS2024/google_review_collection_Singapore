alex lim,2,Been here many times ( at least once a week if am in town) The bryani is kinda of disappointed.  Will never order it again.  The curry sources lost the heavy taste of spices.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107074785732950970143/reviews
lontongstroong,4,"24-hr heartland prata place which is pretty popular among the locals. Sometimes go there to grab a prata supper in the weekend. The roti prata is always freshly made, warm, and crispy, served with some kind of South Indian acidic fish curry. The other meals are also generally good, for instance, the chicken kuzhambu (curry) comes with a flavorful and pretty thick gravy. Surprised they also served chilled Shams, which is a non-alcoholic malt beverage from Iran, which means this rare stuff is imported twice from Iran to Malaysia, and later across the causeway to Singapore.

The place is airy, with a lot of ceiling fans and some tables located in semi-outdoor setting.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews
Milo Anonuevo (Milo),2,"Severely understaffed, work flow is in a mess... order receipts all over the place, they are not sure what order to do next.

No tray return station so plates and utensils all over empty tables, new customers have to move and clean the tables if they wanna dine here.

Ordered 4 teh tarik, took them 30mins atleast and with reminders.

Probably would be better if you are the only table ordering, and with less customers so they can focus on just u",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111055536389776240966/reviews
Jun Yuan Hui,1,"This place is low key racist. I been to this restaurant a few times just because it’s just directly below my house and it’s convenient and food is good.

However, out of all the times I came, I always have an issue, which is regarding to their service. Sometimes when I am at the cashier wanting to order, the service staff can take his own sweet time before coming to take my order. And everytime when I placed an order, definitely need to wait for at least half an hour even when the restaurant is not crowded. There are times where other customers who are Indian place an order after me, their food arrived but mine still not ready. Don’t bother visiting unless u have a lot of time to spare or unless u are Indian.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104663236191264256716/reviews
Teng Yan Wen,4,"Nice comfortable place. Food was good too. Quite many people during the weekends. Their roti prata is pretty big.

Update: sometimes their waiting time gets long, because they don't operate smoothly.  They get messy between taking orders in person, taking delivery order, giving out orders... just messy.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106243166814153638950/reviews
