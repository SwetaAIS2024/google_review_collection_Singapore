Xinni Petrova,5,"Portions are great, super tasty, and the boss is so friendly. We had the XL chicken wrap with fries and it was so delicious. The kebab was also amazing, portions are massive enough for 3-4pax and we love their homemade curry sauce that comes with it. Fries were fresh and crispy. Anyway my husband ordered the food so I don’t know the Turkish names and cannot select the correct recommended items on Google Reviews.

Location is so clean and nice, the drive there from Tuas checkpoint is quick and views are scenic.

The boss was really friendly and my husband probably got too excited and talked too much (he loves Turkish food).",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101836329972500116934/reviews

David Tan,5,I think this is their new location. I passed by and did a take-away was I was rushing back to Singapore. Generous portion and amazing value. And the kebab I order is so good. I am going back again for sure to try their other offerings.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102100948937914370045/reviews
