Prasanna C,5,"My 2nd time here with family. Good South Indian food. 1st time was South Indian meals.. now Had their Jeeraga samba briyani and an egg fried rice for the kid. Both were less oily as per our request. Best part was the South Indian filter coffee which, in my view, is the best we had so far. Even beats the A2B version at Little India. Will come back for sure for the coffee and South Indian food.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111313401109571135917/reviews

Charlie Tan,5,"Ordered the ceylon parotta and filter coffee

There is a refined skill to the food and drinks made

Coffee was made was good beans and has the right kind of kick to it - fragrant and smooth

Parotta was prepared very well with plentiful flavours

This place should be on a Michelin star!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101362794644966130862/reviews
