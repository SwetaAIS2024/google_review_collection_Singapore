Roy Low,5,"MKE Timber Solutions team provided a high standard of professional equipment packing service for our company, today at 8@Tradehub21. The team had a positive problem solving attitude and showed great cooperation to get the job done with a full set of tools and packing material. Our equipment was superbly secured and packed with bubble wrap, shrink wrap in multiple layers and finally vacuum packed and crated.  Super efficient, hardworking and friendly crew is much appreciated. They have provided similar services to us in the past and their track record is just faultless and excellent. Would not hesitate to recommend them. Many thanks MKE Timber Solutions!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102884762819777589710/reviews
