      "text": "We decided to try the Mango Sorbet and Belgian Chocolate Gelato. They were quite expensive for one scoop each.\nThe two flavors had notably different levels of sweetness; the mango sorbet was overwhelmingly sweet, whereas the chocolate gelato struck a perfect balance between the bitterness of dark chocolate and the richness of cocoa.\nThe absence of a seating area was quite a bummer! :o\nIf you're someone who doesn't favor exceedingly sweet treats, I'd suggest avoiding the Mango Sorbet and opting for the chocolate Belgian gelato instead :P",
