Yummy with a distinct sourdough flavour. Will visit again (soon ðŸ˜œ) to try the other breads & pastries.\nDo visit early as breads sell out fast. Preferably before noon time to enjoy the full selection of breads & pastries.\n\nNote to management: Do update your Google page so as to avoid disappointing customers. Thanks & kudos for your great tasting & authentic sourdough breads.",

We tried the olive garlic one and itâ€™s so savory.. the guy over the counter told us olive, tomato and jalapeÃ±o are the best seller.. the Kouign amann was also unexpectedly good, itâ€™s crunchy crispy on the outside with buttery soft swirl on the insideâ€¦ u will regret not buying more",

Like that it is not hard and dense and still have some chewiness. The meat focaccia indeed look like roast pork appearance it comes with a nice crust. Asked for cutting of the sourdough. A simple shop for takeaway of excellent bakery product, donâ€™t expect too much of a service.",
