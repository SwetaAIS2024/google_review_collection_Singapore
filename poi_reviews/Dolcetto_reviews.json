      "text": "Never ever overcrowded, this quaint, charming Italian cafe has a lovely showcase that's always brimming with  sweet bakes.\n\nThe cakes although attractive, are a hit and miss. There's a black forest gateau that offers a nice edgy, boozy kick with juicy cherries within. That I can vouch for. My advice is to skip the cannolis altogether cos they're just sitting out there the whole day and the ricotta cream removes all the crispness in the cannoli shells. A pity.\n\nI'm partial to the savoury snacks, including loaded croissants with fillings like prosciutto and smoked salmon. Love the cheesy creamy pastas which usually hit the spot when in need of comfort food and something more substantial. Otherwise, they offer a loaded wall (yes, literally a display on a wall) of breakfast pastries all day long including cruffins and crusty loaves.\n\nWe drop by occasionally for a decent enough cappuccino on lazy mornings after a stroll at the Botanic Gardens.\n\nUltimately though, what appeals to us most are their unique offerings of Amaretti Virginia. It's probably the most comprehensive range in Singapore I've come across besides the one at Jupiter 57.\n\nService by the ladies are either pretentious or stiff while the gents are more genuine and warm.",

      "text": "Lovely atmosphere and delicious food. The service is also fine and the prices were generally okay for a hotel cafe. Really no complaints. I probably wouldn’t buy any of the cheeses or other Italian sundries here, as they’d be cheaper almost anywhere else, but for a coffee and something sweet, it’s reasonable and high-quality, and a comfortable place to take a short rest or kill some time. Their breads and pastries really are better than most other places. The sandwiches and yogurts are also good. Definitely worth a visit. I think it’s also worth noting that, perhaps a bit oddly, there are two sides to Dolcetto that have separate entrances. In addition to the side facing the large open seating area, there is another side closer to the hotel’s main entrance. They have wonderful gelato and it’s reasonably priced for what you’re getting. Great little spot. There is also an additional selection of deli items around the corner.",
