Forest BK,4,"🌳Bukit Panjang Neighbourhood 5 Park is located right behind Pang Sua Pond.
🌳The hilly neighbourhood park provides great connectivity for residents of Jelapang, Saujana and Fajar to commute to the Bukit Panjang main road, where the MRT Stations and the Malls are located.
🌳Morning joggers, brisk walkers and seniors on wheelchairs with their caregivers frequent the neighbourhood park in the morning hours getting around the labyrinth of paths at the hilly terrain.
🌳Several BBQ Pits and Pavilions are strategically located around the park.
🌳There is also a Children Playground standing side by side to an Elderly Fitness Corner located at the northern end of the Park.
🌳An Amphitheatre stood a little distance from where the Playground is.
🌳This serene shady Neighbourhood Park is a welcome green lung around the Bukit Panjang Estate. 🌿🍀",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Sydney,4,"There's a whole lot of amenities here, I think the only thing missing is a dog run. The nearest dog run around is Segar but it's quite small and inconvenient. Whereas we get a lot of space in the neighborhood park and not all of them are properly utilised. Some of the bigger parks have dog runs / fenced areas, so please consider allocating an area or even a small patch of grass would be good. 🙏🏼",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109051847069665963115/reviews
Rectilon,5,"It's a great and natural place to bike and walk. You can also have barbecue parties here. Awesome view of the pond is also visible. Sometimes a bit scary at night, but it is a 'must visit' place.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105331406750639376427/reviews
