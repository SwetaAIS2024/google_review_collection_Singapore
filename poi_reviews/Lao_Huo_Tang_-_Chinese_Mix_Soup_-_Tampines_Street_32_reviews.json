      "text": "I’m a soup lover and found this stall with generous delicious soup. I have tried a few of them on the menu and will try the rest. The soup is piping hot and with fresh tender pork ribs. The flavorful soup definitely will warm your empty stomach and satisfying feel.\n\nIt is also children friendly as I bought it home for some kids and they love it.\n\nWhat is best if you dine in, you can still top up the soup but of course please don’t take advantage of it and show graciousness towards this benefit.\n\nThey have golden gourd and white rice to go along with the soup. Their ingredients are fresh and boiled till it’s so tender for kids and senior.\n\nThe fullness of the soup is there, the peanuts in the soup are well cooked, ginkgo are soft, red dates are sweet, pork ribs are tender and many others ingredients are tasty too. White Chicken meat soup are a bit too chewy but the black chicken is good.\n\nIt is good to go along as a side dish as a meal for family.\n\nResidents who live around here should truly agree with this reviews as I always see queues going on and on.\n\nThe staffs are friendly and nice with their attitude towards patrons.\n\nFor full review video, please go to\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rFh8YIym0jU?si=o2ky2SHUs2RPLacJ",
