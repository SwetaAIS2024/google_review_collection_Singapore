Paul Chan,5,"apart from having one of the best children’s handbell choirs in the region, witness a handful of sisters whip up the most delectably authentic regional cuisine around... from Vietnamese Phở to Bak-Zam Gai to Bubur Cha Cha... & if u’re lucky n have been very good, u’ll be spirited away by pastor Anna Lee & sister Wan Yee’s baking... (no wonder Reverend Daniel can’t lose weight 😉)
