Tim,2,Had a 7:00 appointment arrived three minutes early. Waited until 7:25 and the doctor was still not in the office. Pretty poor care.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114384842020330748701/reviews
Y S,5,"Dr Ben has been the trusted medical professional and advisor for my family members since 2017. He has been the go-to person for my elderly parents, in-laws and even my young children. Apart from dispensing sound advice and spot-on diagnosis, he has been very dedicated in following up on our treatment progress. Thanks to his sharp observation and speedy referral to a specialist, we detected a tumour in one of our family members (recovered). His support staff team is also friendly and warm. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118118580808505455554/reviews
Sharifah Fadilah,5,"All I can say is, if I can give this clinic 10 stars I would. We all have been to many clinics, lets face it. But when ure sick and down in the dumps, you want at least some positive experience at the clinic. Here, ull get that. Dr Benjamin is one friendly and assuring doctor who cares for the patients he sees and doesnt rush. Once, he even saw our infant after a small freak accident, just when he was ABOUT TO LEAVE. Talk about dedication to the profession. I met many awesome doctors, he just joined the ranks and im truly grateful we found him. The staff are all so friendly, helpful and pretty much very kind.

Whole team is just awesome.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105079355777431508601/reviews
Ceil T,1,"Phone lines are engaged most of the time. Call today to enquire about some medications but cannot get through since 6pm.

Managed to get through at about 6.15pm but the phone was picked up and left aside as I could heard the conversations among the clinic staffs.

Was trying to get their attention but couldnâ€™t do so. Was on hold for about 10 minutes trying to get their attention.

Apparently, it seems like they picked up the call and left the handset aside. They have no intention of picking up any calls.

Probably this explains why till now I could not get through the line.

The phone line engaged since then.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104362296378580692196/reviews
Anthony Penalosa,3,"A very convenient clinic for Interlace residents but somehow online bookings using setmore notifications are not being followed.
My appointment today is at 9am which should be the first when they open the clinic but i waited until past 9:45am to be called after complaining.
I hope it doesn't happen again.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106156222095303244334/reviews
