Sean Yong,3,Been eating from this stall since the 90s.  I think the standard has dropped  cos the you tiao is not consistent.  Revisited this stall after many years and found the fritter too thick . Was expecting it to be more fluffy inside.  I had one today that was fluffy on one half and full on the other.  A bit disappointing.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108535124596952191042/reviews
Ida Einjaw,3,"I was there 9am and the youtiao was already not crispy. Their youtiao is a bit short But their youtiao is flavourful. I also bought their hum jeen beng, also not crispy, but the texture is fluffy and bready, good amount of red bean paste, really satisfying compared to the youtiao.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108652927491238470317/reviews

Cheong Yew Ng,5,"The salted bun (hum chin pang) was excellent. Plenty of salted sections all over the insides, unlike the ones from other stalls which dont have much salted sections.

The butterfly bun was also top-notch. Delicious sesame taste, and not-too-sweet.

Two thumbs up and will definitely come back again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105539408712371132699/reviews
Ivan Teh,4,"Dessert Fritter (~ SGD $1 per piece) @ You Tiao Man.
.
Founded in the 1940s and among the more affordable brands retailing dessert fritters, they're mostly known for being a halal business-to-business supplier.
.
However, 4th generation owner Audrey Chew still has help maintaining a hawker stall, showcasing their product range.
.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, they pivoted to the online and offline consumer market, selling directly to the customer - ensuring business continuity with a multi-channel digital approach.
.
Today, their dough is still freshly made from scratch, and formulated to be kept for up to 9 months, allowing one to enjoy these in the comfort of home.
.
Their ham chim peng has a light fluffy chew, with the 5-spice version having salty savoury spice notes, and the red bean paste version carrying earthy sweet nutty flavour.
.
The butterfly bun is chunky and soft, with a light crispy bite to texture, and lovely nutty sweet bready flavour.
.
The dough fritter / you tiao has a softer chew than elsewhere, with nice bready savoury flavour.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114332345573544911646/reviews
