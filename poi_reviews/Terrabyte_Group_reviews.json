Zero long-term benefits\n\nLIES AND HALF TRUTHS\nAlways told lies in order to get people to commit their time and effort. Know that they will change whatever the initial job specification is while not even explaining before asked, and when they do explain do not provide any concrete reason. Employees are left with the option of either to have wasted so much time for training or to continue working for them with low pay and no benefits. They will make sure to tell you that others are happily working and there is no politics while they are actually suffering and not able to do anything about it. Many people leave very quickly.\n\nWORST ON-JOB TRAINING PROVIDED\nCompared to 3 other companies that I have went through, and based on many others' experiences, they have by far the most questionable training. No mistakes are tolerated as they will either make sure to tell you that you will be fired with any internal/external complaints that are not valid, or you never hear about it and you just get fired. Resources already available are sometimes never provided. Questions about pressing issues are 90% never answered.\n\nZERO LONG-TERM BENEFITS\nWhen the company needs to cut cost, be sure that anybody they can fire they will do so without. Benefits of hardworking and excellent individuals are only abused and minimally rewarded no matter how long you work for them. Many are complaining that the benefits if any are very quickly removed. Since the start we have already given them sufficient feedback but was always ignored. Higher management never explains their actions even when asked and even when they do they tell you lies or half truths, they never ever specify.",
