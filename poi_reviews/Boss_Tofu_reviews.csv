Wei Tan,5,"Generous portions and great tasting food. The braised trotter was flavourful, moist and tender, and the fatty bits were soft and tasty too (though not the melt in your mouth kind). The curry vegetable was pretty decent - not too watery or bland, but I would rather it with a little more kick. At about 7 dollars I do think it's good value for money and certainly worth recommending.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113727367121706943852/reviews
Freddie Koh,5,Tucked in the quiet Newest mall. The pork cutlet curry rice is very tasty and goes well with their home made drink. The service crew is so polite and provides good recommendations. The whole dinning experience is very delightful.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118387222045159659473/reviews
Faye Cheang,4,"Dropped by lunch and as usual this mall is quiet. Ordered pork cutlet curry rice set. Came with fried egg and curry veggie or plain veggie (non spicy). Choices of chicken curry with potato, pork cutlet or fried pork belly (南乳炸肉）. Set is $8.90 and ala carte is $7.50. Recommended go for the set. They have limited choices of drinks but you can buy bubble tea from Yanxi and get 10% off when you quote having meals at Boss tofu. The portion was just nice and curry was good. They also sell Yong tofu if you prefer soup noodles but not a lot of varieties.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109031139763319733926/reviews
