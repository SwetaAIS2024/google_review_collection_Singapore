The Chicken Chop that finally arrived also tasted as hard as a rock!!!!!\n\n17 July 2023 update: No queue when arrived to order. However queue formed after. Staff were efficient and smooth. Didn't wait long to receive my order.\n\n23 May 2023 - Arrived just before lunch time, so there was no crowd. Ordering was quick and so was the food preparation. As for food quality, it was the same as previous visits.",

But we received mushrooms soup üòÖ, which was actually quite nice.\n\nThe two pieces of fish looks like large goreng pisang.  Taste just average.",

      "text": "Visit 2:  I came here again today for brunch after my lipid panel at Outram Polyclinic.  Had toasted wholemeal bread with fried egg & cheese in between sliced tomatoes and cucumber.  Its lovely, fresh but the bread is soft, not well toasted. The coffee-C in traditional Nanyang style is aromatic and satisfying.  As good as Yakun‚Äôs and Toastbox, similar price too but coz it is served in a mug, so there‚Äôs lots more coffee to drink here than those served in a small coffee cupüòÖ. The place is more spacious than most coffee places. The setback previously was the unfriendly staff, the older women serving at the counter. Today‚Äôs service staff were young guys who were friendly and jovial. But they need to improve the toasting of bread.  Recommended for nice meals at a good price.\n\nVisit 3: came here today 15/5/24 for lunch. Had Fried Chicken with young ginger with Rice. Chicken serving is generous. Fit for two. Young ginger is old, not young. Tasted quite good. A nice lunch.\n\nVisit 4: came here for breakfast after a medical appointment at SGH. Had curry puff and kopi C kosong. Enjoyed my breakfast.",
