Marcos O. Diogo,5,"Love it there, you’re checking out on Amazon fish in Singapore, wow!

I wasn’t expecting to see these while having a walk through of this space, this is located within gardens by the bay which has plenty of spaces itself such as:

- Super-tree observatory
- flower dome
- floral fantasy
- cloud forest
- bay east garden
- dragonfly and kingfisher lakes
- children gardens

Among other small spaces not worth mentioning, this is wonderful itself and gotta appreciate Singapore initiative to create green spaces across the city, green spaces that are represented at its most here.

You should make this one of your stops if you’re visiting this city.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113809644458768259113/reviews
