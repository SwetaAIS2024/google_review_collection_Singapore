Melissa Aw,5,I was happening to explore the newest food court in the industrial area when i chanced upon this stall. Its also their first opening day and as its breakfast time near 9:30am I’m also their first customer on their day. Honored to be enjoying a hot bowl of ‘Lu Rou Fan” 卤肉饭 some braised pork belly meat slices on rice dish for a heavier late breakfast.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107701735181442278856/reviews
