CS T,5,"This is the first time I engaged a website and logo designer, and Subraa has set a bar that left me absolutely satisfied. The quality of his work does not need further elaboration from me, but what I must commend here is his after-sale service and support. After delivery of the deliverables, he still made himself available for me to troubleshoot issues or to help me familiarise myself with Wordpress. Superbly attentive and helpful.
