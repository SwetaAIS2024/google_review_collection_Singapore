      "text": "Thank you very much to the lovely and caring teacher Dan, a very young Chinese teacher. Every day I send the children to see the teacher smiling and enthusiastic and remembering all the children's names. There is often a scene of the teacher's heart-warming care for the child at the window. The child is a little afraid of strangers, but the teacher has been patiently comforting him and carefully comforting him. Thanks to the nurturing and dedicated team for letting me trust you with my children. Thanks!",
