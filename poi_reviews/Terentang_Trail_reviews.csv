Ang Wei Xiang Jayden (Westspring_ps),5,"The Terentang Trail is a lesser-known but essential path within the MacRitchie Reservoir Park, most commonly used as the access route to the iconic TreeTop Walk. While it might not be as famous as other MacRitchie trails, Terentang offers its own quiet charm and natural beauty. It winds through secondary forest, gently undulating terrain, and shaded pathways, making it a peaceful and immersive hike for nature enthusiasts.

Spanning approximately 1.5 km, the Terentang Trail starts near Venus Drive and gradually leads hikers toward the TreeTop Walk checkpoint. While the trail is relatively moderate in difficulty, it does include some uphill sections and uneven terrain, so good footwear and hydration are recommended. Along the way, you‚Äôll be surrounded by dense foliage and the sounds of the forest‚Äîchirping birds, rustling leaves, and perhaps the occasional macaque or squirrel darting across the trail.

The trail feels refreshingly secluded, especially on weekdays, offering a quiet escape from city life. It‚Äôs also well-maintained with signposts to guide hikers, making it easy to navigate even for first-timers.

Whether you're heading to the TreeTop Walk or just looking for a peaceful stroll in nature, the Terentang Trail is a lovely route that offers a balance of light adventure and serenity. It‚Äôs a great introduction to Singapore‚Äôs wild side and a reminder of how much greenery lies just beyond the city.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110753435619778868180/reviews
