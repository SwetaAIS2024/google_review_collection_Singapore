Jennifer Wang,4,"Chanced upon this restaurant and happened to know its the oldest Peranakan restaurant in Singapore.
Food quality is great but not all dishes is tasty to me. Otak otak texture is light unlike normal ones are firm and chewy which is what I personally preferred. Ikan fish is the outstanding one and I love the Nogh Hiang

Def give it a try when you are at that area.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107986140932546980153/reviews
B Y,1,"Firstly, the standard isn’t that great. Being a Peranakan myself, I know how the taste of these dishes should be. The otak otak and hee peow soup including the fish ball are way too salty! Brought it up to the service staff but no service recovery whatsoever. The asam fish is too sour and not much taste. We were surprised that the hee peow soup ($20.80++) was served in 3 small bowls and where was the balance?! The price totalled to $203.35 for 3 pax and that’s too expensive for this kind of standard. Very disappointed.

I don’t think I’ll recommend this place to anyone in future. My HK friends didn’t quite enjoy it.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105397731078462092594/reviews
Danny Chan,4,"First time visiting Guan Hoe Soon after they shifted over to the current location. Place has a nicer and more cosy feel compared to previously.

Items on the menu look pretty much the same. We'd otak otak, ayam buah keluak and sambal terung. Dishes tastes good although the portions seem to have shrunk.

Nonethless still a nice place to visit for peranakan food. Overall a pleasant dining experience and looking forward to the next visit.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113160105025497916599/reviews
Zac Yeow (Zac Zakku),3,"Expensive especially if you get the fish. Good quality peranakan food. The serving is a bit small for the price. Bits of pieces of the Babi ponteh was rough, some where tender. Ngoh hiang was great. Cendol good. Ayan bua keluak best. Overall, too expensive. Spend about $60+ per pax, but that's also because of the fish. Atmosphere is too noisy and no network connection and wifi.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117789579119392630062/reviews
Flo Yeow,3,"This restaurant offers a fairly standard Nyonya food experience, especially considering the price. While it's been around for a long time, and the recipes might be traditional, the overall quality is just average.

Dishes like the Nyonya chap chye, Hainanese pork chop, and fish maw soup tasted as if they had been pre-prepared and assembled upon ordering.

If you happen to be in the area, or are dining with elderly family members, this could be a reasonable choice – a safe bet, if not a particularly exciting one.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
