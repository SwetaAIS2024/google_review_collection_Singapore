Victor Ng,3,Comes with lots of ingredients. The taste and noodle texture used to be better. Noodles overcooked and a bit too salty.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115343125507441223772/reviews
Sean Goh,4,"Noticed that this stall selling fishball noodle constantly having long queue while I was there.  The queue doesn't seems to finish. This stall sell fishball and fishball minced meat noodle and prices starts from SGD$3.50 onwards. There was at least 7 people infront of me when i joined the queue, thankfully it move pretty fast.

Ordered their fishball minced meat noodle. it came with ingredients like fishcake, fishball, minced meat and pork slices as well as some braised mushroom. Noodle was nicely cooked, texture of noodle was springy. What really stand out was their chill sauce. The chili was savory and not too overly spicy. Apart from that, their ingredient tasted like those factory product.

Overall, very decent bowl of noodle, wouldn't mind eating again!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Ravina S,5,Walked around and saw a queue at this stall so decided to try. No regrets! The fishballs are big and juicy. Flavour was just right for the noodles. My only small problem is that the hawker centre that it is situated in is quite dirty and smells a bit. But this place definitely sells one of the best fishball noodles I would say! Definitely going back again and queueing again!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118387801871850799456/reviews

Leon Kwang,2,"This is a good place for fresh produce in the market, but not too many good foods in this hawker centre, and this certainly isn't one of them. One more stall ""checked"".",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116326892362989736040/reviews
