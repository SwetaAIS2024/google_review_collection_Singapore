WGY,5,"My go to place for food gatherings. Kimbap are great ( spicy tuna - it's spicy, tuna , teriyaki chicken, bulgoggi) Chapjae is best seller, love the tteboki with cheese which is on the sweeter end. Their Ginseng chicken is good as well

Friendly staff and cosy place with only a few high chairs n counter seats.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114290594947004766273/reviews
M MATHEW,5,"First time trying the kimbap at this place  and i must say that the experience was pleasing. I ordered the big sausage kimbap  with the rose tteokbokki. I have never had a rose tteokbokki before and it was interestingly delicious, the sauce is creamy and silky with a unique blend of sweet and spicy. The portion size was generous on the kimbap and it tastes good as well. The staff were kind and helpful when it came to ordering as i have dietary restrictions. Overall a positive experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101270556578663715150/reviews
Gerald Lim,5,Ordered delivery to share with a group of friends and the kimbap was delicious despite having been left outside for a while. The bulgogi kimbap + bacon mayo sauce was to die for and their mala tteokbokki was heavenly. Very value for money with generous portions. Couldn't stop munching!!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107138502269763067329/reviews
Flora Aurelia,1,"I don't know if this is a franchise store but the standards as compared to orchard pales far in comparison.
I ordered 4 rice kimbap , 2 riceless kimbap, 1 jolmyeon and 1 ddokpoki.

All the rice kimbap are falling apart with super AL DENTE rice grains ( in the worse way possible)
With the bulgogi and tuna tasting sour.
The rice cake in the ddokpoki was so mushy to the point that it's not edible.
That's not the highlight.

THERE WAS A MINI ROACH CRAWLING INSIDE MY JOLMYEON?

the order wasn't cheap and I'm so disgusted by the standards and hygiene.

Never again.
Order at your own risk.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109688135932628621461/reviews
Kaiser A,4,"Came down for a quick lunch with friends, saw this little shop and thought to hop in and try the kimbap.
The shop is pretty small, capable of seating around 7~8 people at once. I saw quite a few people coming in for takeout so I guess that's probably the target audience. Otherwise the place was clean and comfortable for having a meal.
I got the Kani kimbap, and as can be seen from the photo, the kimbap was nicely packed to the brim with fillings while the rice is just a nice thin layer. Usually in other places you'll see them add more rice to bulk up the kimbap while skimping on fillings. It is nice to see them give value to the customer. The taste was good, just nicely seasoned without tasting too strong (like too much mayo with the kani). Though the rice could use a bit more sesame oil, but I would say that's more of a personal preference so others might prefer this more.
We also got the japchae to share, and it came with two sauce, bacon mayo and Kimchi. The japchae was cooked just right and went well with the sauce. The bacon mayo might need a bit more salt to taste, but I still felt that it went well with the japchae.
The total damage was around 14~ per pax but the kimbap alone would set you back 10~ and is perfectly portion for a meal. Would recommend to try if you're in the area.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100935436405208246440/reviews
