      "text": "Rail Corridor Access (Ewart Park) is part of Singapore’s ongoing efforts to transform the old railway tracks into a green and recreational space. Located near the Ewart Park area in the Bukit Timah region, this section of the Rail Corridor allows easy access to the lush, green stretches that have been repurposed for public use.\n\nEwart Park itself is a charming neighborhood park, and the access point to the Rail Corridor here provides visitors with the opportunity to explore one of the best parts of the corridor, which runs parallel to the former railway line. The corridor is now a vibrant space for outdoor activities like walking, cycling, and nature exploration. It integrates Singapore’s natural environment with its historical railway heritage, offering a peaceful escape from the urban hustle.\n\nVisitors can enjoy the scenic surroundings, historical remnants of the railway, and ample green space, making it a popular destination for nature lovers and families.",

      "text": "well maintained trail with Playground material surface, rode at night & you would be surpised at the amount of critters that come out to use the trail. Once saw an owl hunting for rodents in the middle of the trail. It flew off of course. Just ensure that you have sufficient lights to guide you through the night, 800 lumens is good starter.",

      "text": "It was very easy to access the rail corridor as my family and I live in the nearby condo. It was a sketchy path at first but as we went along we saw more people jogging and biking. We saw a monkey near bukit timah railway station and the trains at the station were very fun to play with for my sister and I. Overall a good experience, good for families that want to experience green things!",

      "text": "Great to go for a run or cycle in the green. However, I don’t understand why they are cutting more and more trees - this landmark should be strictly protected. Some portions of it are ugly now. At the rate it goes soin the so-called « green corridor » will become just a concrete track. Also, the government should regulate how private owners can make trees adjacent to the corridor disappear (the owner of 12 Ewart Park and many more). Beautiful trees were providing shade on the corridor and are now completely gone !",
