I appreciate the staff looking over the queue because there were some visitors who try and sneak past other people waiting for their turn - she saw what they were trying to do and sent them back to their spot in the back of the line.\n\nYou can buy food here, they also have very clean bathrooms and a gift shop.",

      "text": "There is a couple of staircases to get up to Mount Faber. We loved this area as it is completely dog friendly which is great. We reached the Mount Faber Peak and saw this is the area to take the Cable Car! We saw many things while walking around such as different lookout points to view the city, different colonial houses, a small Merlion statue, the Henderson waves (which is a cool bridge) and then onto the South Ridges to see the Telok Blangah Hill Park (sadly the Forest Walk was closed). We hiked for approximately 6km, we found the hike to be medium in difficulty, with some stairs and hills. It‚Äôs a great place to get some exercise, see some good views and even enjoy a picnic up here. Make sure you bring water and are sun smart while here.\n\n‚ÄúJonique Life‚Äù  If you find value in our reviews please consider following our social media outlets on Facebook and Instagram as we highlight magical places you can add to your ever growing bucket list.",
