Boon Guan Soh,5,"Oops I finished the food... It is like a big canteen beside the pool. Good place to stop by for a rest and eat. Food is good and the portions are right. Unfortunately, like most tourism areas, the price is slightly on the high side. Nevertheless it is still considered affordable. This place is also kids friendly. Experience is great. Come try it.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101774482362419244596/reviews
Kelvin Ong,5,Fabulous food. The birds are a nuisance though. But young cleaner cleared the unreturned plates and cutlery left by uncultured visitors fast. Thanks for her  commendable effort.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108323726971523582106/reviews
Toni is traveling,5,"Food was better than expected for a waterpark restaurant, I was expecting only junk food but was surprised to see soup and few more cooked meals. There are 6 variants to choose from, pretty limited but OK.

There are a lot of birds nearby, might get a bit annoying",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112092604242223846516/reviews
