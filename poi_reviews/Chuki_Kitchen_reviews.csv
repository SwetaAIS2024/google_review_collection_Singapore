Anar,3,"We tried Assorted Veggie Fritter, and I swapped one veggie for a Shrimp Fritter. We also had Hta Min Paung, Kyae-O Si Chat, Pashuu Fried Rice, and Grass Jelly-Tamarind Juice. I forgot to take pictures of the fried rice and drink.
The veggie fritter is popular, and the shrimp fritter really gives that Myanmar night bazaar vibe. It was good, but if it wasn’t so deep-fried, it’d be better.
Kyae-O Si Chat only comes with pork, so keep that in mind if you don’t eat pork. The vermicelli and taste were normal, but the meat was good. If you’re used to places like YKKO or Shwe Taung Tan, it won’t be as satisfying, but it’s still acceptable.
Hta Min Paung was better than Kyae-O. It had bamboo shoots, which I didn’t expect, so if you don’t like them, you can ask to leave them out. But it was the most delicious dish.
I didn’t try the fried rice, but my friend said it was good.
Finally, the Grass Jelly-Tamarind Juice was bitter, not sour like I expected, which was disappointing. That’s why I go with 3 stars.

Arvin Tunas,5,"When trying new cuisine sometimes the menu can be bit overwhelming, Chuki kitchen on other hand quite newbie friendly.

Tried the noodle salad and fritter platter and they were amazing.

Come early if you want to visit, seems to be very popular among the Myanmar community.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118223737114607877642/reviews
