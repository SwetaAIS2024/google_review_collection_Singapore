Leon Kwang,5,"Yes, it's hard to believe but they've got really good 北京炸酱面 and this ""青椒面"" was really good too.. love the texture of the noodles and the flavor is not those fiery 四川 type.. with that said, it was enhanced by adding some Chinese chilli/ oil. This might become a 必点 each time we're here.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116326892362989736040/reviews
