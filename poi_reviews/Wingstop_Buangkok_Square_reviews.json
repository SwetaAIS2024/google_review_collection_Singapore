      "text": "Visited on a sunnday night, around 6.45pm. It fairly empty with only 1 or 2 tables occupied. I scanned the QR code on table to place my order. However, the App didn't prompt for dine in or take out, it defaulted to take out, I only realized after placing my order, and I noticed other 2 tables had the same issues.\n\nInformed the staff my order intended as dine in but they continue to pack order as takeout, even though at the time food were already boxed, but yet to be bagged.\n\nIt took 20-30min for the food to arrived.\n\nThere were a few issues with my order: they substituted Can Ayakata green tea for Coke because they were out. I asked the staff if I could have a cup to refill from the machine instead, which they provided.\n\nHowever, they forgot to include cutlery and the large coleslaw. I had to go back and forth to sort out each issue.\n\nThe food was lukewarm at best, with one chicken dish not hot at all and the other only slightly warm. Taste-wise, it was just soso.\n\nHonestly, with all these issues, I'm even doubting if the coleslaw was really large. First time at Wingstop and I'm already skeptical lol.\n\nPros: Like their dipping sauce ü•∞",

      "text": "I had a disappointing experience today. The lady at the counter was neither helpful nor friendly. While I was queuing to order, she repeatedly told me to ‚Äúscan, scan‚Äù to place my order, even though I was paying with cash. When I did try to scan, the system was slow and eventually crashed with a 504 error.\n\nThe staff were clearly understaffed at the time, with only three people working, which made the situation worse. Despite this, the same ‚Äúscan, scan‚Äù response was given to multiple customers, including me, without offering any real assistance.\n\nOverall, the setup and service were frustrating and  definitely need improvement! They were more focus to online orders rather then the customer waiting in line!\n\nFinally I got help by the kitchen staff who were full of flour on the shirt, thank you brother!",

They were running a promo for free Voodoo Fries, but when I tried to place the order online, the website repeatedly showed an error message saying, ‚ÄòOrder cannot be processed.‚Äô After multiple failed attempts, I approached the manager, hoping they could assist. Unfortunately, it seemed the manager wasn‚Äôt well-trained to handle this issue and simply suggested that I place a normal order instead, which would mean missing out on the promo entirely. It was frustrating and felt like they didn‚Äôt care about making things right for their customers. Very disappointing service and management.",
