We waited for close to 20mins for our food, and we had to prompt them again even after 20 mins.\nThe staff all seem pretty inexperienced as you could tell that nobody knows what’s happening.\nFrom the video of the curry chicken, I think there’s not much to be said. We have never come across such watery and bland curry chicken.\nNeedless to say, this is our first and last time patronizing.",
