Samantha and her staff nurse team at reception have always attended to my registrations and other requests expeditiously and without delay, so as to ensure that all my visits were as pleasant and smooth-sailing as possible. Dr. Tina and her team of medical practitioners have also demonstrated thoroughness in their investigations as well as provided sound medical advice and treatment plans for whatever health ailments that plagued me. All in all, i am grateful to the entire medical team at Bethesda Medical @ Suntec for their many years of taking care of my requirements, and I wish all of them well.",
