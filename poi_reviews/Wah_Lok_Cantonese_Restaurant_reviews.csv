AB XY,5,"We had a family gathering at Wah Lok, a Cantonese restaurant, for dim sum. The taste was okay, with a good variety of dishes to try. The place was nicely decorated and felt comfortable for dining. Staff were polite and service was smooth. It was a pleasant spot to enjoy time with family over a simple meal.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106259055586805470977/reviews
Claire HZ,5,"Amazing experience every time! This Chinese restaurant has consistently delivered excellent food and service. It's a perfect spot for business lunches and now it's becoming our go-to for family celebrations.

We ordered the set meal for 10, and the portions were very generous. Every dish was flavourful and well-prepared, and they even treated us to complimentary desserts at the end. Only feedback was the chicken was a bit salty.

The staff were very attentive, changing plates almost after every dish. The location is convenient, and the ambience is great. Love that the tables and seats are spaced out comfortably and not too cramped like some other restaurants. Will try their dim sum next time.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100737240137203778146/reviews
Sophia Ong,1,"Dim sum : food standard has drop compared to the past. Variety also lesser, no more salad prawn dumpling, no more porridge. Its ok for price increased but we were not very happy with decreased level of service standard. The old waitress who served table 45 (12 Mar 11.30am appointment) sucks. Lousy, rude attitude, place all the dim sum also like very unhappy. The tall junior waiter definitely serve better than her. Wah Lok, educate your old waitress service, there are many younger ones can serve better than her.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106213260277786424343/reviews
Doris Voon,5,"From making reservation to choosing Ala Carte menu, Restaurant manager, Samantha has provided excellent service. She advised what foods are suitable for elderly and the portion to order for 15 people. She even gave us 2 complimentary desserts and all said are very delicious and yummy.
We ordered the Ala Carte dinner menu for 15 and the portions were very generous. The staff were very attentive & friendly. Tables and seats are spaced out comfortably.
The Soon Hock fish was perfectly steamed and meat was soft and tender. Love the crispy oily Peking duck skin that goes with pan cake wrap &  paired with the rich, flavorful sauce. The duck meat was reserved to its own dish but the meat was salty.
Restaurant provides Complimentary Car Park too.  Overall, we are satisfied with the dining  experienced at Wah Lok !",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113944292409292683157/reviews
M Mmm,4,"Reservation is needed, and itâ€™s a long wait. Nice dim sum with reasonable price. Peking duck is so so, the highlight was the Zhaliang, pork spare ribs and yam pastry.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110088043357308799235/reviews
