      "text": "I have been seeing Dr Woffles Wu for acne, and it has been a great experience. He has been very patient in ensuring I fully understand the severity of my condition as well as the treatment plan I was going for. He is very easy to talk to, and I felt comfortable sharing about my condition. Over the next few months, my acne has cleared, something no other doctor has been able to help me achieve for years! Furthermore, the staff in the clinic are extremely friendly and professional, making my entire experience there simply amazing. I highly recommend going to Dr. Wu's clinic for acne, and any other aesthetic conditions!",

      "text": "Dr Woffles Wu did a surgery for me 15 years ago which made my face more feminine and better proportioned. I felt much more confident! For the past 10 years I have also been seeing him for fillers—am always so impressed by his outstanding skills and sharp eye for beauty, the results he can produce with a small vial of filler are stunning! Have seen other people with strangely filled cheeks, but Dr Wu gives you higher, fuller cheeks that look totally natural.\n\nAlso he is very knowledgeable and will honestly tell you if a procedure is not recommended, or if there’s a less invasive option. Very kind and trustworthy doctor and his team of staff are also warm, caring and professional. I’m thoroughly impressed by my experience at this clinic :)",

      "text": "Had my fillers and botox done with the most renowed and famous plastic surgeon. Dr Wu is super nice , gave a good analysis on my face and gave really good advise on my treatment plan. He has his own set of skill and techniques where you can ever find it from another clinic.\nStaffs are friendly, keep me calm and joke with me during treatment. Injection is done quick and swift ..before you know it, it's done !\nBest things after treatment, I've gotten many good feedbacks from friends that I look really good . It's so naturally done where they don't tell actually what I have done . Amazing! Instant looking younger and rejuvenated.",

      "text": "I recently did a rhinoplasty with Dr Wu, and i can be a testimony that he lives up to his reputation. He is a dedicated surgeon who puts in his best  during the surgery. He has an impeccable skill set and extensive knowledge, which is evident in the final result. Im really pleased with the result and he has indeed set the bar high for other surgeons. Prior to the surgery, he personally crafted the implant to suit my nose, which came as a pleasant surprise because it takes time aside from our consultation to do so. Lastly, he has a surgeon’s heart and i could tell he truly cares for his patients. His personal touch, sincerity and dedication put me at ease and i didnt feel like just another patient. Thank you Dr Wu.",
