Cher ruphon,5,I was searching casually  for this doctor who rid my very bad fistula at least 20 years ago at SGH.  The first doctor did not solve the problem. Dr Koh rid it off once and for all. Till now I still remember him vividly from time to time as one of those very outstanding colorectal surgeons who add years of lifes to many of his patients as he has had to my lifel.   We have many  outstanding doctors here.  Dr Tan Ker Kan who I have recent encounter in NUH  is one of such medicine angel  in human form. Dr Daniel Chew Ek Kwang is one of those doctors in their best human forms who cares for his patients. Stay well n safe  in this very strange era of the virus.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103512312486816427679/reviews
Rachel Tay,5,"Dr Goh is an excellent doctor with impeccable bedside manner. He is calm, confident and I felt very safe with him for my colonoscopy. He realised my hands were very cold in the scope room and personally held my hands to transfer some warmth and comfort pre-procedure which I really appreciated. Thank you Dr Goh for a comfortable and smooth procedure, two thumbs up!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114764367518961074470/reviews
Paul Kewene-Hite,5,"Dr. Goh Hak Su is an excellent doctor. He has a superb bedside manner, he is very knowledgeable, and a great surgeon. I had a very different experience from the other reviewer who said that he wouldn't look at the patient's medical history; he examined my medical history, family health history, and test results from other doctors. His care before and after my surgery was world class. I recommend him highly.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113471968147907413417/reviews
