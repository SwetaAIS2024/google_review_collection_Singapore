Very good serving , value for money.\nHowever, a bit thirsty after meal which is normal for drinking curry gravy .\nI tried the dumpling noodles previously and it was quite good @ $4.5\nParking is challenging due to the competition from nearby mosque. May need to park further at HDB and cross over .",

Only a handful dishes like Mee Siam contains eggs, but you can opt to have the eggs removed if you’re vegan)\n\nFood is delicious and affordable, all below $5. Enjoy.",
