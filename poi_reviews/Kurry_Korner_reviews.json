Everything is prepared as there are no cooks/chefs for the dinner.\n\nThe food is below average. There many better Indian options in the area. You should try other restaurants.\n\nThe waiters dress very badly and look dirty. Their hygiene standards are very low.\n\nAVOID THIS RESTAURANT.",

Especially at the end they just gave us desserts even after we declined ordering. Service aside; the food is AMAZING! Rich, tasty and a whole chunk of well made dishes. Almost everything I tried was above average and especially good was: Chicken Tikka Masala, Samosas & Muttom Dum Briyani. Really amazing and I would be back! üíØ",
