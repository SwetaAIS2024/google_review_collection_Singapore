The flavors are vibrant and fresh – it’s clear they use high-quality ingredients. The service has also remained top-notch; the staff is friendly, attentive, and made me feel right at home. It’s a wonderful spot to relax and enjoy great food. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a welcoming place with fantastic eats and service.

      "text": "Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)\n\nMy Awesome Cafe stands out not just for its eclectic decor and charming location along Telok Ayer Street, but also for its warm, lived-in atmosphere. Housed in a heritage shophouse, it gives off a nostalgic, artsy vibe — a place that feels both casual and characterful. It was pretty packed on a Saturday afternoon, so don’t come expecting quiet.\n\nThe potato-crust pizza (pozza) was a highlight — crisp, flavourful, and something different.\nThe prawn curry didn’t quite hit the mark for me; it was serviceable but lacked the punch I hoped for.\nThe pulled beef burger had great-tasting beef, but the brioche bun was a bit too much, throwing off the balance a little.\n\nWhat really stood out, though, was the service. One of the staff members was especially genuine — very honest in her recommendations and open about what she personally liked. I appreciated her sincerity and energy — it added a lot to the experience and made the space feel even more welcoming.\n\nA cool spot with a few creative food twists and a human touch in service. I’d come back for the pozza and the vibe.",
