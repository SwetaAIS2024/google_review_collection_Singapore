It houses shrines dedicated to several Buddhas (it appears to be a Tibetan school of Buddhism) and also Hindu deities. A chief character here is the Kshitigarbha Boddhisatva, known for his vow to not achieve enlightenment until all living beings are rescued from hell. The temple is situated on a small hill and on the other side, is a small pond with terrapins and fish. This place has a tranquil and rustic appeal.",
