Samuel Lam,4,"Very flavourful!!!!!

The skewers are a must order! I recommend the marinated beef, lamb and chicken. Really goes well with a cool beer.

The sourkaut fish soup is a generous portion. Better to share.

Good place for lunch and dinner!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103278705053675847980/reviews

konnisii,1,"DO NOT ORDER THEIR OYSTER PLS.
Look at this, it is similar size as my pinky nails. I understand it only cost $5 but at least a little bigger right...? I tried to ask their manager about it and what she told me is that i shouldn't trust the photo on their menu. OK.

I recommend you to go outside and buy a bowl of $5 oysters meesua, all the oysters in the meesua confirmed bigger than this for many many times. Dun waste money on this.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113078837916400005730/reviews
TC J,3,"Good that you can call to order for takeaway - saves lots of time!

The skewers were nice but the spices not evenly applied for the pork skewers.. many areas with little spices (see the half portion whiter parts in pic). Pork and mutton good. Chicken soso (won't order again)
Do note for takeaway, the metal skewers are removed.

The 拍黄瓜 cucumber wasn't as nice as  the usuals that I had.

Will try other dishes again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110090362760848888971/reviews
