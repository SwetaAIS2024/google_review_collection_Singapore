Elton Tan,5,"Very helpful guy, even answered and attended to my needs late night after 10pm. Offered me a temporary wheelchair while mine is been repaired. Even took all the trouble to go to his shop to look for the replacement parts as I told him I needed it urgently. Pricing is very cheap and affordable.
Eventually I didn‚Äôt engage his service as my brother took the wheelchair and got it repaired on his own.
I felt bad as he went through so much trouble just to try to get my wheelchair repaired by today so I tried to offer him a little token of appreciation but was refused by him.
He told me ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok, no worries‚Äù
Very nice and a true gentleman. üëç",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107736869143661500928/reviews
Daniel Clark,5,"Mr Kim came to our rescue!
My mum was visiting Singapore for a holiday, but arrived just before the Lunar New Year and we hadn‚Äôt arranged a wheelchair to rent. Mr Kim kindly arranged to deliver the wheelchair to our home so we had it as soon as my mum arrived. She was so pleased as we were able to show her so much of Singapore, which is very wheelchair friendly. If it had not been for Mr Kim, we probably wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get a wheelchair until almost a week later, so he saved her holiday.
Mr Kim always communicated promptly and clearly and was an absolute pleasure to deal with. We just can‚Äôt recommend him highly enough. And if that were not enough, his rates are very fair too.
Thank you so much Mr Kim for making my mum‚Äôs holiday perfect.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110427218950024011170/reviews
