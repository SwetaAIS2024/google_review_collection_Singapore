Hairil Sukaime,4,"I've been frequenting this stall on multiple occasions since they took over from the previous tenant, for both dine-in as well as takeaway. While the food can be hit or miss (mostly dependent on who is doing the cooking), the portions are generous and the staff are generally friendly.

A thing to note is that the dishes (i.e. nasi/mee/kway teow/bee hoon goreng) automatically come with a fried egg (albeit at an additional cost), so you'd have to inform them in advance if you don't want it served with your meal.

The hawker centre itself can get pretty crowded during weekends and meal times. Pesky birds - such as pigeons and mynahs - can also be seen in and around the place.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110281876693217934680/reviews

Starfish,1,"Fried kway teow was very peppery and had tons of MSG. It left a lingering taste in my mouth that was extremely unpleasant. Other Indian food stalls around Singapore don't fry their kway teow like this. This is by far the worst in Singapore.

Hawker centres work with NEA to promote healthy and affordable food but the food at this stall is not healthy at all.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111470341483788010405/reviews
