      "text": "Bought their new offering, tuna mayo sandwich set that costs $5.40 at base price and $7.50 after changing the drinks to a large iced Kopi C.\n\nMassively disappointed at the amount of tuna mayo the sandwich had for $5.40 (or whatever the ala carte price is). The tuna mayo filling was beyond measly. Not expecting a thick layer of tuna mayo, but this is just taking a piss at your customer. Saving grace is their coffee has been exceedingly consistent.\n\nDo better, kopifellas team.",

However, the food and drinks that we've had so far were alright.\n\nThe kitchen staff seems to be in a perpetual bad mood and gives off very unwelcoming vibes.\nFor example,  when asked \"is there a bag for our takeaway items?\", we received not a verbal reply from the male staff but an annoyed look with a vague hand gesture towards the direction where the plastic bags were located.",
