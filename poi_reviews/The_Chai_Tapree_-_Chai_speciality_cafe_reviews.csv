Manjima Sharma,5,"Just had a lovely time at @thechaitapree!
As a dosa lover, I had to try their Matcha Dosa ‚Äî and wow, it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Crispy, tasty, and that hint of matcha? Perfect.
The Matcha Mango Lassi was refreshingly different too.
Super convenient location right next to Simei MRT and the Indian supermarket. Great for a quick meal or chai stop. Bonus: the food isn‚Äôt too spicy, so it‚Äôs kid-friendly.
Don‚Äôt miss the Indian sweets and pulav ‚Äî and their chai game is strong (pink chai was my fav!).",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104304468665192832780/reviews

Innovative Indian cuisine done right! The Matcha Dosa at @thechaitapree is a must-try ‚Äî it‚Äôs a brilliant fusion that still feels authentic.

Amby Pandey,5,"A hidden gem near Simei!üòç

Just had an amazing experience at The Chai Tapree! As a dosa lover, the Matcha Dosa was a pleasant surprise ‚Äî crispy, flavorful, with that subtle matcha twist. The Matcha Mango Lassi? So refreshing.The Pani Puri setup was super fun with the auto-dispensing machine.

Their chai game is next level ‚Äî from Pink Chai to Cardamom Masala Chai, everything‚Äôs brewed to perfection (not overly sweet, which I appreciate). Also loved the Sev Puri and the variety of Indian sweets.

Located right next to Simei MRT and the Indian supermarket, it‚Äôs perfect for a quick snack, casual hangout, or proper tea stop. Kid-friendly, vegetarian-friendly, and honestly just wholesome vibes all around. Service is warm, and the owner‚Äôs passion really shines through.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116781099884139331169/reviews
