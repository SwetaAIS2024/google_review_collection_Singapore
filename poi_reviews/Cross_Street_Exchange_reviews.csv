Shawn Woo,4,"Upper Cross Street Exchange (formerly China Square Central) is my go-to spot for quick errands or a relaxed break in Singapore’s CBD. The blend of modern shops and preserved Chinese architectural details gives it a unique charm – a refreshing contrast to the glass towers nearby.

What I love:
- % Arabica fuels my mornings with reliably excellent coffee (open early on weekdays!).
- Folks Collective is perfect for picking up quirky gifts or home decor – their curation feels thoughtful.
- Affordable parking ($3 flat rate after 6 PM!) makes evening visits stress-free.
- The customer lounge (B1) is a lifesaver for directions or parking help.

Food & Vibe:
CHAGEE’s bubble tea hits the spot, and the open layout avoids the cramped feel of bigger malls. It’s not a food paradise, but 7-Eleven snacks or a coffee break work well between meetings.

Pro tips:
Visit weekday afternoons – quieter and easier to explore.
Pair your trip with nearby murals or Sri Mariamman Temple for a cultural pit-stop.

Downside: Smaller than mega-malls, so don’t expect endless shopping.

Perfect for: Office workers needing a quick caffeine fix, tourists exploring Chinatown/Telok Ayer, or anyone seeking a laid-back CBD stop with character.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102960528165807270681/reviews
shigella tan,4,This is great place for family and individuals to spend the lazy Sunday afternoon soaking up the atmosphere at the flea market. Lots of vintage stuff antiques knick knacks toys whimsical stuff that will bring a smile on your face. Most stalls began setting up around 10 am and packs up around 4 pm. There's great food too from coffee to noodles to freshly made pizzas. I will post more pics in the future but usually ended up busy shopping.,8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106028660132558944519/reviews

TOMMY THAM,5,"I chance across this KEI Singature Japanese Restaurant while scouting for a seat to have a decent dinner. I gave 5 stars for its excellent service. The welcoming service did not prompt me to think otherwise. He recommended 2 signatures meals. The photos posted were the recommended one on my table.  On the delicacy. I gave a 5 stars, the salmon, the egg, the side dish and the miso are excellent. On the ambient. I alluded myself on the corner table and it is comfortable too. I think I had a good meal today. Worth trying indeed.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106272961535317300809/reviews
