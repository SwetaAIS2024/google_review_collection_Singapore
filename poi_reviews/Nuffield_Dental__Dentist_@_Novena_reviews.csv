Honey Shufflez,5,"Went in for to get a crown. As someone with TMJ, dentist visits are usually a chore and painful. This is the most patient dentist I've ever met. Super grateful for the friendly nurses and admin as well!

Lastly, my dentist treated his nurses with respect (which I rarely see in clinics and this reduced the tension during the treatment as well!)

10/10 will come back!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102545973854216519626/reviews
Angeline,5,I had a sudden toothache that required some attention on the 3rd day of CNY. Thankfully it was nothing too serious. Chanced upon Nuffield that is opened and managed to secured an appointment with Dr Hamdan. He is an attentive and gentle dental doc. Will definitely go back to him for a second appointment. :),3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115113690625117056065/reviews
Shu Tian Ng,5,"I had my Invasalign consultation with Dr Hamdan. He was knowledgeable and and patient when explaining to me the pros and cons of different options for straightening my teeth. What I wanted was simple and non-urgent. There was no pressure to take up treatment even though the consultation was provided at a promotional rate, which I greatly appreciated.

So I think this is a good clinic to visit for people who are considering treatment but would like to learn more first.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108175621320325454381/reviews
