Recent consultation with her was to seek second opinion. Dr Goh patiently explained and give her professional advice about my condition. I feel that she's an understanding doctor with compassion.",

Moreover I had called before to confirm if there would be charges, i was told there will not be. But in the end i was charged. This is ridiculous and not fair on the patient. Pls note this when you consider this clinic",
