Flo Yeow,5,"Quite tough to miss this ATM machine that's right by Orchard MRT. It's right next to the exit leading to Jewelry Street, Ion Orchard. If you're coming out of the Orchard MRT station, turn right, and you'll probably see the ATM along all the other machines by the side of the MRT station.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
