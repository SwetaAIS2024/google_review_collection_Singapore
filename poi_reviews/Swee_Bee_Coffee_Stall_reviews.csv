Ken W,3,"Kopi gao siew dai - quite fragrant, but could be a bit thicker

Toast - very thin slices but well toasted. Didn't have much Kaya in it. There was a slight bitter taste (think it was over toasted?) as well

Eggs - nice and semi runny üëç",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111469334813473591346/reviews
Winston Ho,4,"This stall is at the far corner of the Tampines round market, on the side that faces the green field.

It draws regular queue of customers.

I had a Kopi siew dai to go. The coffee is good and robust.

Only downside is the price, as it costs me $1.50. This is the price at a coffee shop, not what I expect at a hawker stall.

The pricing is similar to another stall at the same food center, which charged me $1.40 for a Kopi o.

Coffee is rather expensive in Tampines Round Market and food center. üò∞",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109087882208981210478/reviews
W L,5,"Came here to try the coffee after reading good reviews and they did not disappoint! The long queue is a testament to the claims. The line moved swiftly as both the boss and worker could be seen hard at work taking the orders and preparing as quickly as they could. Even though they were busy, their service was not compromised. I ordered the set ($3.80) and they made sure the individual items were served as they were ready.

Love everything about the kopi, toasts and eggs! Will be my staple from now on.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112917591831961441915/reviews

LP Pua,5,"Ordered 2 cups of Kopi-O Kosong, and uncle asked if we wanted it gao. We said yes and he filled almost the whole cup with black coffee and added just a little bit of hot water. Tasted shiok and no bitterness taste.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
