andyloe,5,"This food stall definitely provides a welcoming experience! The owner is warm and attentive, taking the time to ensure the drinkâ€™s sweetness is just right, which shows he genuinely cares about customer preferences. I appreciated how he patiently waited for me to confirm with my friend, even holding a spoon of sugar ready until we decided. The prices are reasonable, and the added convenience of PayNow makes the experience even smoother. Overall, a great place to enjoy a drink with excellent service!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110109116555826289679/reviews
