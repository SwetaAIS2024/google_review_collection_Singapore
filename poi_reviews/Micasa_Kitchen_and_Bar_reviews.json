      "text": "Running out of dining idea, did a quick search on Google map for restaurants near me and saw Micasa. I was drawn by the paella on the menu. Ordered the ultimate seafood paella, croquetta de jamon iberico, charcoal grilled Iberian pork ribs and live steam clams (lala), wine, butter and garlic confit. Paired with Bordeaux Blend.\nThe saffron rice is cooked just nice, the rice crust, sweetness of the prawn and clams elevated the dimension of the dish.\nTexture of the croquette is not just plain creamy, cured ham could have blended better to the croquette instead of laying on top.\nThe grilled pork ribs is tender, not overly grilled and hardened. The chef offer the fermented chilli sauce to pair with the ribs, which nicely ‚Äúwashed the greasiness‚Äù down.\nThe live steam clams (lala) another dish not to miss. The savoury from the soup and the sweetness from the clams complement each other.\nAnd shoutout to the chef, very welcoming and made the guests feel homely.",

The octopus like what all the other reviews said, is a definite must order. However if you are alr having the squid ink paella, you could skip it as it alr has octopus in it.\n\nThe wine selection are excellent as well!",

      "text": "Update: Back here for a second time with my hubby who loves Spanish food. He enjoyed the food but noted that it‚Äôs too heavy on the palate for me. I do find the pork ribs too oily (but secret chili and garlic blend was great) and cauliflower too salty and oily, but I guess that‚Äôs just me. Thanks to Mikey for giving us two little macarons to cleanse our heavy dinner!\n\nWhile there was only one main service staff, he did his best to serve us with professionalism and dedication, and even recommended dishes for us. I ordered salmon fillet, which was not bad. My friends ordered Squid Ink Paella and Ultimate Seafood Paella. The latter was pretty nice with big, juicy prawns and sliced fish and clams. Overall experience was pleasant, I would be keen to try their set menu!",
