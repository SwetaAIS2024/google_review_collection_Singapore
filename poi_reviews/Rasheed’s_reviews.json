This place is kept rather clean and provided with Round Marble Tables and good support chairs for patrons.\n\nTried the Economical Bee Hoo stall and I ordered the Kway Teow and Mee combi; the Kway Teow has the char Taste which is good on my opinion!\n\nMany workers from the nearby offices popped in for breakfast. Many choices of Indian food here and the western grill and pasta which I would definitely like to try on my next trip here!",
