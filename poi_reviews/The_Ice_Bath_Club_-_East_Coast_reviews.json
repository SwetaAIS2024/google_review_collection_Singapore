The kitchen crew is amazing they are professional chefs and can whip up great food. Waiting for the launch of their new sour dough by kobashi. I was lucky to try their sample one day. The\nchef knew exactly how to make it crispy on the outside and soft inside..  the coffee is great too just right after a dip in cold plunge for breakfast",

      "text": "The sauna facilities were what first attracted me to sign up for a membership. After being a daily user for two months, I feel itâ€™s time to write a review â€” Iâ€™ve benefited so much from both the sauna and the cafÃ©.\n\nThe sauna is impressive, and their maintenance and hospitality are top-notch. Joanne from customer service, along with Hemilia and her team, are always ensuring guests' comfort. As pioneers of a traditional sauna club-like experience, they truly take care of everything: clean towels, well-maintained facilities, proper sanitization, and warm hospitality â€” things that are hard to replace. Being there daily, I also witnessed how quickly and attentively they troubleshoot any issues.\n\nThe cafÃ© is another highlight. Coffee is always hot, consistent, and excellent. Their large printed menu (no QR code needed!) is a nice touch. The space has a coworking-style vibe, often filled with working adults during the day, with power plugs and Wi-Fi available on request. They also have an impressive book library corner filled with growth mindset books, perfectly matching the cafÃ©â€™s warm and motivating atmosphere. Families with prams and children are welcome too, with a cozy toys and books corner.\n\nAccessibility is another plus. Itâ€™s conveniently located near the Central Area, and they offer a bicycle stand inside the cafÃ© for secure parking (plus extra space outside). There's even a welcoming bench out front where you can take calls. While a small ramp at the entrance would be a helpful improvement, itâ€™s a minor thing overall.\n\nTheir membership pricing is affordable considering the health benefits and exceptional hospitality. Theyâ€™ve built a lovely community of both locals and expatriates. Early weekday mornings are peaceful if you want quiet time, while evenings are lively and social. The space is curated at night with warm, dimmed lighting for a truly relaxing atmosphere.\n\nWhile the events and club programmes offered so far have been somewhat repetitive during the short time Iâ€™ve been frequenting the club, Iâ€™m excited to see more variety, vibrancy, and new club partnerships in the future. Iâ€™ll be looking out for more of their community offerings to complement this wonderful space.",

The prompts around area help newbies figure out what to do on their own. But lots of folks to talk to as well. Amenities are great. Their coffees great too! Will definitely be back.",

I always finish off with their Nutzman smoothie (seriously, itâ€™s amazing), followed by a dip in the cold pool. The lounge music and chilled vibes make it feel more like a mini getawayðŸ˜€. Highly recommend it for anyone who trains hard and wants to recover smarter!",
