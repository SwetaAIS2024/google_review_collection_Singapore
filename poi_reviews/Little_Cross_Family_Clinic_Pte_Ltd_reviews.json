Don‚Äôt be a doctor if you‚Äôre just rushing and consultation was less than 5 mins.\n\nI have never experienced such doctors until I met Dr Chan. Please don‚Äôt be a doctor if you‚Äôre not listening to your patient. I will be taking this issue to the higher authority as I think no one should go through that. Awful.",

Dr Foo recommended that I join the government subsidise SG Health and help me save cost to pay for my longterm health care cost as I am near my retirement age and my employer does not pay for my longterm illness medical cost.  The support stuff are also very helpful.  Thank you Little Cross.",
