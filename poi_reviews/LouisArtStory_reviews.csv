Jhaythen C,5,"I'm extremely satisfied with LouisArtStory.

The quality of the film is excellent - it's thin, yet durable, and provides great protection for my watch. Barely visible to be honest.

Their customer support team was responsive, friendly, and helpful throughout the entire process. They answered all my questions, provided timely updates on my order, and even followed up after delivery to ensure I was satisfied with my purchase. The level of care and attention they showed me as a customer was truly impressive, and it's clear that they're committed to providing an exceptional customer experience.

I'm impressed with the quality and value of the watch film from them. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable and effective watch protector!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112929293639786323106/reviews
Winston Lam,5,"Louis's service is top notch... i have been to a couple of places and I must say that the service here is far better in terms of the protective flim placement. From my experience, he goes the extra mile to ensure that my watches are well treated.

Louis's knowledge of the watch industry is also great and I have personally learnt alot from his experiences. A very friendly guy and it is always a great experience chatting with him.

My watches are always well treated by him and a very trustworthy guy.

There are always snacks and charging ports around, and he always makes sure that I am comfortable in his shop.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106906132372231235687/reviews
Gladis Hor,5,"My first visit to the store and I was glad it was a nice experience. Went there to get my watch protected with 8roshield ,delicately wrapped by Louis.

He shared his knowledge with me about watches and it was definitely a job well done.

Would recommend first timer to make an appointment first before heading down~",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117614978412994173441/reviews
