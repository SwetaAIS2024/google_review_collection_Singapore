If visiting, payment has to be done in cash and it has to be exact change. It is definitely worth it to have enough cash, just be sure you have enough! The staff is super friendly and you can get on lots of items. Our favorite was Requisite, unique jewelry and very high quality, affordable and watches.",

Our loots were: 2 silk screen-printed kitchen towels, a crocheted Pochaco charm and an illustrated book — Lil Ducky Dreams of Adventuring. It’s a 2-storey space that has a couple of small food stalls within too. We had fun!",
