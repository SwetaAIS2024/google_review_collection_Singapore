Given her dedicated patience and guidance, my child has progressed tremendously in terms of speech and social awareness. Thank you for going above and beyond to prepare social story and customised reward board to provide better support to my child learning needs. ❤️",

What I appreciate most is that she takes the time to connect with parents, keeping us involved and informed. If something isn’t working, she’s always ready with a different approach to help my child progress.",

      "text": "We truly believe that Nat has been a miracle for our family. We started working with her when our son was 20 months old (diagnosed with ASD), non-verbal, and lacking joint attention. Now, at almost 6 years old, he has made significant improvements. Nat's effective teaching methods seamlessly combine play and education. She consistently shares tips and tricks with us on how to handle our child's behavior. Nat is very caring and attentive to his progress, willing to listen to updates from both home and school. She also keeps us informed about her sessions with our son. Nat involves family members in her sessions, helping us engage and understand practical skills better. We are incredibly grateful and highly recommend Nat and her ABA methods.",
