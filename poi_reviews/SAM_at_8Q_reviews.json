It worths to pay a visit if you like arts especially cinematic arts. But if you just want to see some fine arts, you would need to wait for opening of the other galleries.\n\nThe main museum was nearly closed, probably under renovation.There was only a free exhibition there showing the museum history. I don't know why the art museum of such a developed state would be nearly closed anytime!",
