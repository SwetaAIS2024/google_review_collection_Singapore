Collin Boon,5,"Love the taste of their chilli crab, not too spicy and sweetness from the tomato. They still have their crab promo starting from 2 crab for $48.
Another must order dish is Manila Clams. It is big and juicy paired with vermicelli, which was on spot.
The place tends to get crowded and noisy at times. But who cares the food were good and staff was helpful & nice.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109385143998742897827/reviews
LP Pua,4,"Attracted by their crab promotion (2 crabs for $45 and the next 2 for $35) displayed on a poster outside their restaurant, we made a booking with the intention of getting 4 crabs at the promotional price. After sitting down and eating the standard appetizer, it took a while to wave down a waiter to take our order, only to be told that there was no promotion despite the prominent poster at the entrance. Feeling cheated, we proceeded to order 2 chili crabs (2 for $58), a vegetable dish, and tofu. Fortunately, the food was very good, and the crabs were quite meaty. Unfortunately, there were three tables with people having company dinners, and some highly intoxicated individuals were shouting and making a lot of noise, which made the environment feel like a fish market. The service could be improved, but since there is no service charge (though there is GST), I won't complain too much about it. Overall, go there for the good food and try to overlook the shortcomings for a good meal.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
L C,2,"Singapore is known for its food culture. This place is sub par. Long wait for food, expensive and the quality of food isnâ€™t worth the price. They are severely under staffed. Price point is mid to high.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116778773261696583647/reviews

Angie Ling,5,"Came here with my friends for a simple dinner. I remembered I've tried their curry fish head before and it was the thick kind of gravy. So I recommended this place! We ordered curry fish head, scallops with brocolli and the chilli crab. They were having  promotions, 2 for $48, of course don't expect huge crabs. But the crabs were fresh thou! Order the friend mantou to dip with the chilli sauce, so yummy! My friends fell in love with the curry fish head as the gravy was so delicious. Will definitely come back again to try the other dishes!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115912021747467223459/reviews
