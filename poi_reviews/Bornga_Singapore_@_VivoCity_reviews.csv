Min HL,3,"did not opt for bbq here and ordered steamed egg, seafood pancake and gochujang pork.

steamed egg/gyeran-jjim - not fluffy at all. there were grainy bits inside, told the service staff and got a new one without the grainy bits but still not fluffy

seafood pancake/haemul pa jeon - not crispy, more like omelette

gochujang pork/dwaeji - good, enjoyed this!

considering the prices here not cheap, had higher expectations and was disappointed.

Wilson Tan,4,"Ordered lunch set BBQ for 2 which includes 2 meat (got the signature beef and pork belly) with a seafood soup. And of course many side dishes!

Signature beef was really good but the pork belly was dry and tough. Service was good!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117872071504904813067/reviews
Zackery Goh,5,"I recently dined at Bornga VivoCity, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish! The ambiance is warm and inviting, making it the perfect spot for both casual meals and special occasions.

The highlight of my visit was undoubtedly the food. I tried the signature Korean barbecue, and each dish was bursting with flavor. The marinated meats were tender and juicy, and the side dishes complemented the main course perfectly. The staff was attentive and knowledgeable, providing excellent recommendations that enhanced our meal.

The restaurant also has a fantastic selection of drinks, including traditional Korean options that paired wonderfully with our food.

Overall, Bornga VivoCity exceeded my expectations. I can’t wait to return and explore more of their menu. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for an authentic Korean dining experience!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109405400403426765330/reviews
Fab Foodie Swede Malin Nordblom,4,"Korean BBQ as I like it. If you have eaten at Bornga in other countries this is the same. For me this is exactly how I like an Korean BBQ to be. You can choose set’s with different kinds of meat. Or pick out the ones you like. You get all the add ons here, it’s all included. Salad leaves, garlic, sauces, kimchi etc.
As an added bonus you can choose to sit by the water.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107062657007062713328/reviews
