      "text": "Probably the worst hokkien mee I had in my life.\n\nPlease note that I am not a regular at tagore. Came here to collect company delivery and saw this new shop decided to order one fried hokkien mee, $10, takeaway.\n\nUpon returning home, to my surprise, no lard or pork was present in my hokkien mee. Is this a halal business model?\n\nThe noodles were not sufficiently fried, \"Zero\" wok hey detected.\nSoup stock was mid so noodles tasted mid as well.\n\nThe middle aged cook was grumbling about his workload and being really moody throughout the cooking process of my wait.\n\nIrregardless if he is the boss or staff, this shoddy attitude is highly undesirable.\n\nThe positive redeeming factors was 3 prawns provided were large and big, I applaud the fact they did not use Msg.\n\nAt the end of the day there are still better choices in yishun and AMK. If no improvements are made, I doubt this business would last more than one single year.\n\nRegrettably, I feel that this hokkien mee has neither the value nor taste. Kindly look elsewhere.",
