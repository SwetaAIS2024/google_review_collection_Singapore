Surendar VP,4,"It offers a mix of retail, dining, and entertainment options, making it a convenient one-stop destination. The mall features well-known brands, a variety of restaurants, and even a cinema. While it generally receives positive reviews for its accessibility and range of stores, some visitors have reported occasional service issues at certain outlets!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104924682578579923425/reviews
Alvin Looi,4,"It's a great one-stop centre for almost all your shoppingand dining needs, from groceries to electronics to Lego. Easy access to the Jurong East MRT station too. However, one disappointment (and partly why it doesnt get 5 stars) is the lack of common seating at the basement corner (see pics). There are nice tables but strangely too few chairs/stools. What's the thinking here?",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111779542834081512565/reviews
Sam Goh SE,5,Vibrant mall with easy commute by public transport. Lot of nice shops and F & B outlets. My wife & I went there for our anniversary dinner at a Tonkatsu restaurant and were not disappointed.

Orange,1,Je is ALWAYS under maintenance. Whether or not is the escalator or the toilet. This is just a toilet at level two. More than half the cubicles/sinks are on maintenance. And they are dirty. Gosh. So many people but no money to keep the mall clean and nice?,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
