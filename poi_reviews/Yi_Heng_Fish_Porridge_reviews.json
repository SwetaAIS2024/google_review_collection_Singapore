      "text": "I am reluctant to share this review, because itâ€™s so good I hope thereâ€™s no queue thatâ€™s going to form over time. This place is low profile but the fish is absolutely very fresh, thick with a hinge of sweetness and the fish taste doesnâ€™t linger in your mouth after meal. Their seafood fish soup is good especially if youâ€™re a fan of fish roe and if they have it available as it only brings in limited amount of fish roe daily I heard.\n\nMy father who is a foodie brought me here and I crave for it sometimes that I come back myself often. ðŸ˜‚\n\nYou wonâ€™t need to stand and queue for a long time unlike some other fish soups. This is definitely a must come for if I ever crave for fish soup.",
