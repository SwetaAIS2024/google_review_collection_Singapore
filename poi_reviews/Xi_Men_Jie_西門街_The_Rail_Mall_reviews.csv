Daniel Wong,5,"Went there on a weekday lunch so the place was pretty quiet. My wife liked her oyster mee sua and my son loved his beef noodles. My braised pork rice although decent was not as good as I would like.
The cheese and egg pancake was nice too. The prices are very reasonable and if you pay with Grab Dine Out, you can get 10% discount.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115145949078497107987/reviews
Abraham Lee,4,"Newly opened along the rail mall, and itâ€™s located towards the springleaf prata side. Nice environment and bright colors and ambience. We liked that it was relatively empty for a Sunday dinner time. Staff were prompt and polite and food was served really quickly after placing the order via a QR code. Reasonable prices and good taste for Taiwanese food. You also get a free drink now when you leave a review!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews
Kelvin Sim,1,"The dessert is so sad..Nothing like the picture in their menu. I was hoping the ice is snowy smooth and not the usual coarse ice.  But end up, there is no ice at all.. like they just poured more water into leftovers and serve to us. Ridiculous.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110754416688973170885/reviews
Kai Ling,5,Super fulfilling meal. The intestines were flavourfully braised. Sesame chicken mee sua was so comfortingly warm for rainy weather. Sides like honey chicken cubes and tempura fish cake were gone in a flash.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100635259993109346258/reviews
Sophia Ang,5,"Tried the Taiwanese Stir-Fried Rice Noodle. Love how thin the bee hoon is. Flavourful and chockfull of ingredients like meat, prawns, dried shrimps, mushrooms and cabbage.

The Shrooms with Spicy Garlic Dressing is tangy, appetising with a mild spicy kick.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103947385276367415272/reviews
