Swaminathan Iyer,5,This is the old KTM railway track which is now converted to a walking / cycling path. Itâ€™s a great place to go for walks or cycling in middle of urban singapore as both sides are covered by trees and see various kinds of animals and insects . It also has markers every 100 m for those who want to see how far they have travelled along the path .
