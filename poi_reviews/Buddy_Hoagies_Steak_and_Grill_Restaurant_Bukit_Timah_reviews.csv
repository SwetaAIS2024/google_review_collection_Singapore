Liting Tan,5,"The food there are very good!! It is like a very family place, you can have a gathering with family & friends, as they got main food, kids meal, snacks and beers. Very suitable for all ages. I like their rosti, they cooked it till crispy and the taste is good. The mac & cheese also very good! Photos are shown below and can have reference. Even though the mall is not very atas, but the food and atmosphere in the restaurant is good!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102651901505464176496/reviews

One of the few places to do Rosti deliveries.
Portions correspond with the grab prices.

Hope to have steak and Rosti combination for selection",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106728704755913363642/reviews
elayna chin,5,"The staff at Buddy Hoagies were incredibly friendly and efficient, making our experience outstanding. Despite them being busy seating customers and serving dishes, they were attentive to our requests and always approached us with a smile :) plates were cleared off as soon as we were done eating.

The flavours and food here has always been consistent and we always enjoy a good grilled chicken and salmon here.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105460859948112165491/reviews
Kevin Wang,5,"Never disappoints.

I have ordered over a dozen times from them (and eaten there). They have always provided excellent food, quickly and reliably . Country fried chicken is always crispy but never dry. Steak is always perfect in doneness to the order.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101117452154846621767/reviews
Jeremy Moi,5,"The food was very well done. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients used. Service was attentive and warm. The location is popular with students, so when we were there, it was noise af. The open concept of the shop means that the noise goes everywhere. You might have to shout at your partner when having a conversation. I recommend coming for the food, but watch for how crowded it may be.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117737715480240571393/reviews
