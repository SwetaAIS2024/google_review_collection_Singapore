Musing wanderer,4,Food is pretty good! Had the lunch set meal which comes with 3 trays of meat and Veggie. Shabu shabu and Sukiyaki soup is great.  Staff were very nice too. My only complaint was the amount of meat given to me and my lunch mate was different. He has way more meat than me. So would be good if thereâ€™s no disparity ðŸ˜€,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118105145571767559902/reviews

Colin,5,"Good value, soup base is not too salty. The garlic fried rice is surprisingly good.
But doesnt have as much cooked food as the dhoby outlet.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112477726864016792635/reviews
Phoebe T,5,I have been to Suki ya many times. Came here solo to treat myself and to unwind. Was pleasantly surprised to have Phillip who is deaf who served me. He was really good at his customer service. Very attentive to all tables and meticulous when he is cleaning and setting up for new tables. I noticed he even lifted up the heating board to wipe the sides below that were a little dirty. Heâ€™s a conscientious worker and I am glad to see sukiya being inclusive of people with disabilities. Heâ€™s the best service staff I ever encountered here over my years of coming here frequently. :) please give him my compliments!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114751308296646791371/reviews
PK Ong,5,"I often come here with family as they have arguably one of the best shabu shabu here, with a good range of nicely sliced meats, huge variety of veggies and Japanese style dessert. The variety of sauces is also great. And I like the garlic fried rice they have.

A couple of times, we encountered their friendly service staff Philip (who happens to be hearing impaired) but he delivers good service with attentiveness and dedication, clearing empty and dirty dishes and adjusting our hotpot fire level by observing what we needed at any point of time.

Keep it up!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109204941058970455867/reviews
