Midori P.,2,"The mee hoon kueh was nice, not chewy kind but very thinly torn, and just about 10 thin pieces only. 吃不饱.

The soup is abit salty to my taste, though flavourful.

$4.50 for the portion actually is ok, but perhaps can give more kueh, too little. Not filling at all.

The food handler (lady) did not wear gloves to handle the food like tearing the mee hoon kuey dough, cracking egg & also for collecting cash and returning coins for change.

Oh my… this will be the first & last time I am eating here due to the hygiene purposes.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114768912874047917748/reviews
