林建峰Daniel,5,"Huge thanks to Mr. Robert! He was incredibly responsive and came all the way to unlock my bathroom door. What a dramatic day—my wife and I got stuck inside the toilet around 6AM++, had to climb out through the window, enter the house through the kitchen, and then call for a locksmith. Mr. Robert arrived within 30 minutes, just as he promised over the phone. Truly a lifesaver!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109232650600852200430/reviews
Pui Yin Lau,5,We had a stuck door handle at 1am and Steven came to our rescue in 30 min. He was very professional and did his best to minimise the damage to the existing door handle & lock so that we wouldn’t have to pay an exorbitant price to change unnecessarily. Appreciate his helpfulness and tips in maintaining the door handles!,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100503553588041253685/reviews
Ken Lee,5,Search reviews on google and found Botak Locksmiths. Sent a text to Mr Yeo and he replied instantly. I sent him videos of my issue and he just suggested a video call and helped me solve it by giving me instructions. Managed to solve it within 2 mins and saved the money ! Highly recommended!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100843381187616836797/reviews
Nicholas Tan,5,"Quick and reliable. Has a quick call explaining my situation then Robert was able to give a quick quote and an ETA. ~$70 for unlocking, varies according to how far your place and the type of lock. Terence came by promptly and fixed it, explaining to me what he was doing along the way and what he thought the problem was. He even explained in Hokkien to grandma! Friendly guy Terence!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114539238587315369780/reviews
Prinisha Sukumaran,1,"The location showed here is not the accurate location, been circling this block for more than 15 minutes only to find out the location showed is actually a Community Centre that have been there for the last 7 years. I tried contacting them but both numbers are invalid. Please if you're still in Business kindly update your information, I've wasted more than an hour coming here and trying to locate it. Very disappointed.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107271276496595477892/reviews
