Ziling Zeng,5,Love the free flow side dishes! Every time they serve different side dishes and I like the eggplant and omelette the most. The food is a bit pricey general but the food variety and taste are not bad~ Recommend seafood pancakes and grilled pork,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102076387804044773766/reviews
Andy Chua,4,"Over all experience is good, the dishes were nice and the portion was just right. Felt that the pancake was on the pricier side. Overall you can give it a try. Do go early to beat the lunch crowd.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110739422020409270733/reviews
Vincent F.,5,Been here many times since the time I sated my wife. Went there to celebrate her birthday with her family. The Korean food here never fails . Good value for money too.

Cheong Wai Chun,5,"Delicious korean food hidden within the one-north office district. Very generous portion sizes and the food taste really authentic to what you can find in Korea. Prices are reasonable for the amount you get. You know the food is authentic and good when majority of customers on a weekend are koreans :)

They provide homemade side dishes but you are only allowed to refill it for free one time! Free ice water as well.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110277802954320740112/reviews
Cyndi Poh,4,"Still two minds about this place. The banchan only has 4 selection - the green stuff was abit stale. The kimchi so so. Only the egg was nice. The soup was very hearty, ordered one pork soup and the other one I forgot which one. The BBQ pork belly was nice but for the price point it was a small portion. Guess come for the soup on a rainy day.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117806932922343587190/reviews
