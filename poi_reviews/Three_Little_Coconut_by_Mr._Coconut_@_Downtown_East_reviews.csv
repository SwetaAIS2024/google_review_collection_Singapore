Jenny,4,"The coconut snowy ice quality was good! But we both felt that something about the paste & toppings to ice ratio was off -- we finished the sides and still had quite a lot of ice left... suggestion to have a bit more paste/toppings, with slightly less shaved ice",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106827143697295415460/reviews

Keith Zheng Zhao Khong,5,"Flavour is amazing, I ordered the Coconut-flavoured snowy Ice for 04.10 SGD with the use of Grab App (Original price is 08.10 SGD).

Elizabeth Cheong,5,"Love the comfortable decor, clean tables and chairs. Trays were also not sticky although this was a Chinese, croffles and snow ice desserts place. There was no additional GST or service charge for dine-ins. Wide variety of desserts and probably the best mango pomelo sago I've ever had! Dessert was a perfect level of sweetness ðŸ¤¤ Definitely will be back!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100055103201741575624/reviews
