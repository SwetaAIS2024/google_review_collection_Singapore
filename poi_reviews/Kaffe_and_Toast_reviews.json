      "text": "Great spot for local delicacies that I've been frequenting for a long time. On this visit, I tried the location at Joo Koon during a trip to Decathlon. The place was just okay. The food didn’t taste as good as what I’m used to at Kent Ridge. The Milo dinosaur drink was watery, the iced lemon tea was too strong, and the coffee was cold. With no other options and kids with us, we had to eat there, even though it was already late for lunch. As it's a food chain, they should definitely look into improving the quality of their food.",

I accidentally pressed takeaway unknowingly on the kiosk and maybe her instinct seeing my settling down with all my stuff on the table made her double checked if i really wanted to takeaway or dine in. Alas, her situational awareness had saved us all the hassle.",
