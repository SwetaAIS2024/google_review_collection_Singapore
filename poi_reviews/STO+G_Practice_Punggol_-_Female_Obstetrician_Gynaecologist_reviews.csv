cindy lee,1,"Due to some discomfort , I contacted and made advance appointment (at least 2 weeks) to see the doctor. On 2 occasions, the clinic called me one day before the scheduled appt and postponed it, each time having to wait 2 weeks. Not everybody has the luxury to wait for so long just to get a consultation.
So unprofessional of the clinic.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117140841924234057854/reviews
