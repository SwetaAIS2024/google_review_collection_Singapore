Christina Tan,1,Went there to buy groceries but was shocked when I came home and was about to cook my dinner when I opened one pack of the cheese that I bought and it was all mouldy. The other pack that I opened was okay. Is quite shocking to know there can be mouldy cheese sold there.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104081731896580991686/reviews

M Lee,4,Would like to give a compliment to Mr Shahrizan (Serangoon Gardens). He was very hardworking and pleasant whilst serving customers in the queue. Needed help on paying via 365 App. Mr Shahrizan was very patient and guided us on how to go about with the payment. We forgotten to let him know that we are ‘members’. He was the one who asked about it instead. Appreciate his nice gesture and extremely dedicated attitude. Thank you!,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112210222291038984326/reviews
