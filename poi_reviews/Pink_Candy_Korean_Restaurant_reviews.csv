Natasha Tjahjadi,5,"Service was really fast because it was an early Monday dinner. Only waited around 10 mins for the food.

The beef bibimbap was really nice! The sauce was special, there was a bit of roasted sesame taste and some tangy ketchup on top of the usual gochujang.

The marinated pork was a nice change from the usual gochujang pork, the marinated meat was not overwhelming. The pork was tender and the portion was quite generous! It came with lettuce and special sauce which you can add to the pork. The owner was quite attentive and topped up our kimchi before we even finished the already served kimchi.

Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101744417641852989607/reviews
Pamela,5,"Been their fan since years ago.

The kimbap is a must-try!!! My family‚Äôs favourite, it tasted really authentic & better compared to other places. Dined-in on a weekday 5.30pm. Very fast service, & food was so fresh, piping hot. Chilled kimchi was yummy I finished it all. Outdoor sitting but the wind is cooling. Nice music too üëåüèº",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107581998935972871148/reviews
Joey H,5,Don't know why the reviews are so mixed but we enjoyed our food. Kimchi stew ($13.90) was on point and the beef bulgogi was nicely seasoned ($14.90). We came during dinner and it was windy. Overall service and vibes were good! Not the cheapest but value-for-money. Would come back again.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112657256021450124489/reviews
