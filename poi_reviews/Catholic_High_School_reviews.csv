Sean Tay Shao Heng (Chs),5,"Hello! I'm currently a Year 1 studying here. So far, I've been here for 4 months and I have to say, the camaraderie between the students is insane. Although canteen food here quite expensive, like seriously there are 2 places here that sell lemon tea, one at canteen  and one at cafe but one sells for $1 and the other sells for $1.30, makes no sense ngl. But aside from that, the students here are very welcoming but sometimes can be a bit noisy cus its a boys school haha. The teachers are also not bad but like some of them are kinda strict but aside from that they'll actually spend time teaching you concepts so you won't fall behind. Big campus as well with multiple paintings throughout. Also, if you are planning on coming here to study in IP, be prepared to have a lot of work on your hands. The teachers mainly don't care if you have CCA that ends at 6+, they'll just give you homework as if its normal. Also theres WRP symposium with the sister schools so good luck with that. The prefects will also give you bookings if you forget to wear name tag, school badge, late etc and like if you have enough bookings you can get detention. All in all, the school has a strict system in place but welcoming students so would highly recommend!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111998318379151139679/reviews

Alden Lee,5,"Review of Catholic High School: A Journey Through Track & Field and Student Leadership

Catholic High School is more than just a place of learning‚Äîit‚Äôs a place that pushes you to be your best, both in and out of the classroom. Throughout my time here, two things shaped my experience the most: being in the Track and Field CCA and serving as a student leader in the Student Council. These roles weren‚Äôt just activities; they defined my growth, resilience, and leadership.

Track and Field: Beyond the Limits

Joining the Track and Field CCA was one of the most challenging yet rewarding decisions I made. Training sessions were intense‚Äîearly morning runs, endless drills, and brutal endurance workouts. But it wasn‚Äôt just about physical strength; it was about pushing past mental barriers. Every time I felt like giving up, my teammates were there, pushing me forward. The camaraderie in Track and Field was unmatched. We weren‚Äôt just athletes; we were a brotherhood, motivating each other to chase personal bests and school pride.

Competitions were a different beast altogether. The pressure of the starting line, the adrenaline rush as the gun went off, and the pure exhaustion at the finish‚Äîit was all part of the thrill. Whether I won or lost, every race taught me something: discipline, perseverance, and the importance of preparation. Representing Catholic High in competitions was an honor, and knowing that I contributed to our legacy made all the hard work worth it.

Student Council: Leadership Beyond the Badge

Being part of the Student Council was a whole different experience. It wasn‚Äôt just about enforcing rules or planning events‚Äîit was about being a bridge between the students and the school, making real changes that mattered. As a student leader, I learned that leadership isn‚Äôt about power; it‚Äôs about service. Whether it was organizing school events, mediating conflicts, or just being someone others could rely on, every moment in the Council taught me the value of responsibility and teamwork.

Balancing council duties with academics and Track and Field wasn‚Äôt easy, but it was worth it. There were days when stress piled up, when meetings stretched late into the afternoon, and when handling expectations felt overwhelming. But those moments made me stronger, more adaptable, and ready for any challenge that came my way.

Final Thoughts

Catholic High School wasn‚Äôt just about studying‚Äîit was about growth. My experiences in Track and Field and the Student Council shaped me into someone who doesn‚Äôt back down from challenges. The lessons I learned‚Äîdiscipline, teamwork, leadership‚Äîare things I‚Äôll carry with me beyond school. If you‚Äôre looking for a school that pushes you beyond your limits while surrounding you with a strong community, Catholic High is the place to be.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109394864427033157287/reviews
XD Ez_goi,1,"Catholic High has gained a reputation for being a school with poor sportsmanship and a lack of discipline, both in the classroom and on the field. Despite its religious affiliation, which emphasizes values like respect, kindness, and integrity, the school has continually failed to demonstrate these principles, especially in athletic competitions. Students at Catholic High have been observed displaying unsportsmanlike conduct, such as taunting opponents, showing disrespect to referees, and engaging in aggressive behavior that goes against the spirit of fair play.

Moreover, the coaching staff has been criticized for not addressing these issues, and in some cases, even encouraging negative behavior. This failure to promote good sportsmanship reflects poorly on the school‚Äôs reputation and undermines its educational mission. Students are not only failing to learn the values of respect and teamwork but are also setting a bad example for younger athletes. The focus on winning at all costs has led to a toxic environment where the well-being of students and the integrity of the sport are compromised.

In conclusion, Catholic High‚Äôs poor sportsmanship is a serious issue that tarnishes its overall educational experience. The school needs to reevaluate its approach to athletics, emphasizing respect, discipline, and fair competition to align with its core values.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105782532486004425720/reviews
