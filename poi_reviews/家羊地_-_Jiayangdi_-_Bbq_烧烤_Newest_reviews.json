The restaurant wasn't too crowded, but four friends of one of the staff and one staff member were having a great time at the table next to us, and it was quite noisy.\n\nIt was unpleasant to hear them shouting so loudly that it interrupted the conversations of the other tables. If the staff were going to join in, I wish they would at least control the tone of their voices.\n\nIt was a nice, reasonably priced restaurant, but the vulgar noise of the five people, including the staff member, ruined everything.",
