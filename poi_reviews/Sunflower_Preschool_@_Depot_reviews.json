      "text": "Regrettably, our experience with Sunflower Preschool at Depot Road fell short of our expectations, leading us to withdraw our child. While I understand each child's needs are unique, there were aspects of the school's environment that raised concerns.\n\nThe atmosphere felt overly rigid, leaving little room for the free play and exploration that are crucial for preschoolers. The children seemed constantly on edge, unable to truly relax and be kids. The school's disciplinary approach seemed excessively harsh, creating an unnecessarily stressful learning environment.\n\nAdditionally, we were disappointed with the overall cleanliness of the facilities. Maintaining a hygienic and safe space for young children should be a top priority, and unfortunately, we found this lacking.\n\nDespite these issues, we appreciate the teachers' efforts and understand that every preschool has its own style. However, for our child, the emphasis on strictness over a nurturing and playful approach was not a good fit. I hope this feedback can be constructive for the school to create a more balanced and supportive environment for its young learners.",
