      "text": "Ordered double chocolate cheese. It originally cost $5.50!?!? Even after fave discount 50% using the eCard, it is not worth it at all at $2.75. Terrible looking egg waffles, while it is crispy, most of the holes are empty pockets, parts with chocolate is burnt. No idea why this place still survives.\n\nStaff at the counter provide nowhere near any leve lof service. She looks so pissed off with new customers coming",

Most of my egglets were empty so it was just some overly crispy and burnt egglet. extremely sad. i ordered pandan but u can’t even tell from the picture. Would not even pay $0.50 for this lol",

      "text": "I’m a regular customer of this outlet, love the egglet!\nHowever, today when I was at the store I was served by an unwelcoming older lady.\nHer attitude was horrible, cooking skill was horrible too.\nI came by before the peak hour at 5.45pm, ordered and she tsk me as though there was a lot of orders but it’s only me…  after ordering I went for a walk.\nCame back, orders were piled up. New customer queued to order, the staff told them off saying there’s a lot of orders already and she’s like asking them to go away. Super disappointed with her tone and response.\nIt took her x2 longer then the usual time to fulfil my order, she kept opening and flipping.\nSuper inexperience and keep showing black face.\n\nWhere is the Xiao Mei?\nShe’s always quick to receive order, and fulfilling orders.\nDespite longer waiting time, she will mention to customers if it’s okay to wait about 20 mins as there’s a lot of order. And we’ll happy to order and wait.\nIt’s the same 5 pans and piled orders, but service/approach was totally opposite.",

After she back from her toilet she is not happy with me when I questioned her I’ve waved at her just now.\n\nShowing black face not even apologise for what she did.\nStill try to argued back with her bad attitude.\nThis is horrible customers service.\n\nAnd the food she cooked is so hard! Like stone.!!\n\nI asked for her name she refused to give me. So leave me no choice to took her photo.\n\nDear Management, please improve your staff and send them for a proper Training!!",
