As someone who doesn’t usually drink, I was pleasantly surprised by TapOut’s craft beer selection, especially “False Sense of Security”, a fruity, smooth, and easy-to-drink beer that even non-drinkers like me can enjoy. It’s light, refreshing, and a great intro to craft beer. I’ll definitely be trying more beers in the future!

The food is equally satisfying. The trio beef patty burger is hearty and perfect for sharing with friends. The skewers are well-seasoned, the fried cauliflower is a must-try, and portions are generous. Only minor note, the fish and chips batter was a bit salty for me, but that didn’t take away from the overall experience.

With its chill atmosphere and solid menu, TapOut is a great spot to hang out, eat well, and explore the world of craft beer, whether you’re a regular or just getting started.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107628884150723380259/reviews

Robert Chai,5,"Dropped by this place that played pretty old school rock hits and had a great time when it came to their series of craft beers which were pretty fantastic!

Staff were also very helpful to guide us on drinks that will fit into our current palette.

Cozy venue with also good light bites that paired well with the large array of craft beers.

Definitely will come back again if near the area.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101775319044798524953/reviews

Case Woo,5,"This is one of the best takeout gourmet Cheeseburger we’ve ever received. Packaged and delivered with care, arrived warm and perfectly structured. Lovely juicy patty. Awesome toasted buns. Not mushy or messy. Fresh greens. Super airy crispy chunky fries. Absolutely love it. Damn shiok.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104415171534053217226/reviews
