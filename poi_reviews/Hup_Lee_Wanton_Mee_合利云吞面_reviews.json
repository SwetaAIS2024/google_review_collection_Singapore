On the outside it looks the same but when you bite into the wanton, sauce and especially the char siew like eh, not same you know?\n\nWorth it. Don't under estimate the creativity and culinary prowess of the local Singaporeans, my friends. TASTY LA.",

      "text": "Revisiting this market / hawker from my Primary school days. The wanton Mee is better than what I remember it!\n\nThe noodles are more to the QQ type, chewy & bouncy sort. They have changed up the type of char Siew that are used. It‚Äôs softer now. The stall vendors said that it‚Äôs for the community at Bedok, as it‚Äôs mainly the aging population üëçüèº thanks for catering to the masses ü•∞\n\nPersonally, I prefer the hard & meaty char siew, but it‚Äôs a great move by them.\n\nThe atmosphere there is what you‚Äôd expect from a Singapore hawker center. Lively & buzzing, fellow patrons sharing tables, exchanging smiles & greetings. Wouldn‚Äôt exchange this for anything anywhere else in the world ‚ò∫Ô∏è",
