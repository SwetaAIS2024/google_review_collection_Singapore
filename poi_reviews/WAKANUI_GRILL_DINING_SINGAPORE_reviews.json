From the moment we arrived, both of them were incredibly welcoming, professional, and attentive. Their warm hospitality truly elevated our evening and made us feel genuinely valued as guests.\n\nWe were celebrating my partner’s birthday, and thanks to Ganesh and Christine, it became a celebration to remember. They anticipated our needs and created a relaxed yet refined dining atmosphere.\n\nThe food was exceptional—every dish was beautifully presented and full of flavor. From start to finish, the experience was seamless and enjoyable.\n\nWe left with full hearts and happy memories, and we’re already looking forward to our next visit. Highly recommend Wakanui, and if you’re lucky enough to be served by Ganesh and Christine, you’re in for a real treat!",

We were a little bit worried to come with our 3 year old but the staff was simply charming and he felt so welcome. Do pre book the lamb Wellington, my 12 year old said he could have eaten the half by himself. Next time we’re getting the full portion. Recommended wine was spot on and a generous pour. We will definitely be back.\nThank you Chef, Logan, Christine and Ganesh for the exceptional service and great time.",

      "text": "Our third visit to this restaurant, as always, it has been a wonderful culinary journey and the experience is truly memorable!  Instead of the typical set lunch, we requested Chef Andrew to organize something special for us this time.  What a delightful treat……\n\nThe fries were irresistibly golden and crispy delivering a rich potato flavour with every bite.  Next we have Burratina, heirloom tomato with grape with very refreshing dressing.  The carrot chawanmushi with snow crab was heavenly as the sweetness of the crab was delicate, refined with a subtle natural brininess.\n\nWe have two mains.  The crispy scale blue cod with tantalising cucumber salad was the highlight of the meal, perfectly cooked with a golden brown crust that crackled with every bite, encasing tender, flaky white fish!  The second main was Chipotle BBQ pork secreto complimented by luxuriously creamy and smooth mashed potato.  The pork was tastefully cooked as it was tender and juicy.\n\nMany thanks to Chef Andrew who has artfully crafted a menu featuring gourmet creations, seasonal ingredients and expertly paired flavours.  Service is impeccable.  We will definitely come back again!",

Atmosphere was pleasant enough. What was a standout was really the quality of the meats - the fillet steak and lamb- well prepared and superbly tender. It also came with a complimentary bottle of wine",
