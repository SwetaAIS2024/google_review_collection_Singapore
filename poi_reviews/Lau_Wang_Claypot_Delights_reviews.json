      "text": "Claypot Soup – A warm little gem bubbling in the heart of the neighbourhood.\n\nDropped by this cosy spot and found a few hits worth slurping.\n\nTried the frog leg soup—it’s alright, but leans on the bland side. Not bad, just not the star of the show.\n\nThe real MVP? 麻油鸡. So. Damn. Delicious. Fragrant, warming, and full of that rich sesame oil flavour—an absolute must-try.\n\nAlso had the 青龙菜—a bit on the salty side, but still tasty enough to clean the plate.\n\nVerdict: A comforting little claypot gem in a growing neighbourhood. Come for the 麻油鸡, and leave with a warm belly and a happy heart.",

      "text": "Service staff was welcoming and efficient. The ambient was cosy and air-conditioned with ceiling fans but not too cold on a rainy day so old folks who are afraid of the cold can still dine with in. They do provide out door seating but it was raining.\n\nOrdered the small portion not knowing what to expect. Thinking the portion might not be much but was I wrong. The claypot was filled which chicken chunks that was surprisingly tender and moist and the sauce wasn't too salty or sweet and pairs well with the white rice. The only thing that could be improved if the sesame oil flavour could be more pronounced as the dish is sesame oil chicken after all. I ordered less spicy but it still came quite spicy (peppered with chilli padi) so perhaps if u have kids dining just order non spicy.\n\nValue for the price paid and would recommend family members to come so that we can order a variety of their dishes to share.  Definitely bringing my family here next time to gorge ourselves!",

      "text": "This restaurant is great for value meals that don't compromise on portion and taste. Came here a few times and tried different dishes each time. So far, only the stir-fried long bean with tofu was a letdown because it was quite bland. The other dishes were all satisfactory and portion is always generous, even for the small-sized option! My personal favourite is the Mala Chicken, as well as Sambal Kangkong. The staff here are polite, and seating is quite plentiful and comfortable.",
