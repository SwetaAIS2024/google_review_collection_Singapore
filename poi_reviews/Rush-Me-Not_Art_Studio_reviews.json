      "text": "When they stopped teaching at the childcare that my 4+ year old girl was at last year, she was so sad and asked us to allow her to continue at the art studio. Itâ€™s been more than a year and she truly enjoys her art classes such that once she burst out crying thinking that there were no more art classes in the future when it was actually stopping for 1 session due to public holiday. ðŸ˜… Itâ€™s more than drawing and painting. She came home with beautiful art pieces we could frame up, clay art to display etc. she started brainstorming about what colours she will get when she mixes different colours. She became more confident in art and craft, and we were pleasantly surprised that she managed to creatively right a mistake when she was doing art on her own. We were also very surprised when she started to recognise familiar art styles when we went out. she loves her teachers there and learnt a lot from them. We always look forward to her telling us about how she worked on her art pieces whenever she goes to the studio. We are thankful that she experienced so much joy during classes and it has grown her love for art.",

      "text": "My daughter and son has been with Rushmenot for over 2 years. We have tried many other art studios in the past whether it was for permanent lessons or holiday class. I got to know Rushmenot through holiday workshops. I have to say the holiday classes conducted by the studio is entirely different from many other out there. The quality and thoughtful holiday workshops are very well thought out according to the artist, types of art work, pencil work and stroke work. Even for more difficult pieces like the Vincent Van Gogh's sunflower, my 5year old could do it with guidance, but stroke work and concept and patience was the key for them. Jealina, owner is amazing with kids and she is a gentle, patient and trained in counselling for children. Hence, you would expect a different approach to art with her and the way she handles children in the studio is very respectful and motherly. No regrets to knowing Jealina!",
