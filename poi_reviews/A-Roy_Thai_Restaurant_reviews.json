The stuffed chicken wing is hands down the best I’ve had in Singapore.\n\nCan’t believe I only just found this place — I’m already planning to come back with my family to try the rest of the menu!",

Grilled sliced pork -tastes flavourful, fats and meat is well balance pair well with the chili. Kaeng Jend Woosen - The soup was rich and satisfying was a true comfort food for me. Deep fried chicken wing - Not oily and taste perfect. Pineapple fried rice and Pad Thai both are scrumptious. Pad Ma-Keua Yao - Delicious. Mango sticky rice - Sweet and Savory. Will definitely be back to try on other dishes. Conclusion - Must Eat!",
