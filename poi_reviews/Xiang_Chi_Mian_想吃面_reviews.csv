咦呀呀呀呀呀,1,"10 Apr 2025 （around 6:40pm)

I visited your stall recently and was quite disappointed with the lack of service. There were no staff members present at the counter, and even after pressing the bell, no one came to take orders. An elderly customer was also seen waiting for a long time without any assistance.

This kind of service can be very frustrating for customers. I strongly suggest having at least two staff members present at all times to avoid such issues and ensure that every customer receives proper attention.

I hope you will take this feedback seriously and make the necessary improvements.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107236189884612427564/reviews
khaikhai123,4,"The  fishball Noodle  costs $4.00 is pretty decent price.

I order dry fishball  with chilli , it  is not the best fishball noodle BUT!! I will give it a "" better "" fishball noodle.

The noodle is  not soaky nor too dry. It just nice. And the chilli mixed well with the noodle.

I noticed there is some minced meat on my bowl but  it was not stirred well with the chilli and put seperately , it lost a star for  it..  if tried scooping some minced meat with the chilli sauce, it will be more nicer.

The interesting part is the fish cake slice are fried , making  a unique texture . I wont say it is bad nor good, just awkward  feeling but it is still nice for the fried fish cake slices",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115116364248656767934/reviews
