Karen Gads About,4,"Tucked inside Roxy Square Kopitiam, Suki Bowl SG is such a hidden gem for Thai food lovers! I tried the Thai glass noodles and the MAMA dry tomyum version — both were bursting with flavour and super comforting. The suki sauce is the real star here — perfectly sweet, salty, spicy and tangy, just like what you'd get in Thailand!

Starting from just $5.50 (depending on your choice of proteins/ingredients), it's really value for money, and you can tell the team put effort into getting everything right — from the imported noodles to the generous ingredients.

This is actually by the same folks behind Siam Square Mookata & Running Egg, who literally spent 5 years perfecting this!

A great spot if you're craving authentic Thai sukiyaki-style noodles without burning a hole in your wallet. Highly recommend!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113503192007654817905/reviews

Chan Tze Hui,4,"It’s a very hearty meal when you crave for stir fry noodles, nothing special, pork ratio meat to fats is good, but theres only 3 slices. For the price point, I wish there’s at least 4 slices",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103188300122776435883/reviews
NomNomFables,5,"Tried Suki Bowl at Roxy Square and was really impressed. Prices start from just $6.50, and you get to choose between mama noodles or dong fen as your base. I had the All-in-One and Powerhouse bowls, both flavourful and good.
Everything is stir-fried with veggies, egg and your selected toppings, then tossed in their signature tangy sukiyaki sauce. You can go for dry or soup style too.Good for a quick, hearty and affordable meal. Will be back to try the other bowls!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116604684195918553212/reviews
