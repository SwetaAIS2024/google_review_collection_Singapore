To my astonishment, there were already 20 customers in front of my queue number. Moreover the branch has limited seating spaces and there are only 3 customer service counters. While I'm writing this review, I looked at my watch and the time tells me it's 12:15pm. More than an hour and it's still nowhere near my queue number. As a long time OCBC customer, I can't help being immensely disappointed.",
