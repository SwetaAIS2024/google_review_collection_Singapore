troo foo,3,"Could have been better... the aps!

The developer of the APs  needs to review their system. Despite the fact that I am savvy in tech, I tried so hard to get my order through the APs. Eventually, I have to make a phone call. The operator does sound too happy to pick up my call.

However, after all these, I was very impressed with the pizza. Influence by TV advertisements (Playing nonstop) I ordered the Festive Bonus, 1 regular Rendan Pizza and Curry licious melt, and I loved it. Especially the Curry licious melt, so chessily sedap!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101259140556170631421/reviews
Muhd Danish,1,"Been ordering at this outlet for the past 8 years with no issues whatsoever until today…Firstly I ordered at 8:09pm and the estimated timed to reach was 8:44pm. Arrived at 9.20pm. Sure. Secondly, when my order arrived, the rider looks like he’s in a rush..felt suspicious but let him go..then when I look at my order my garlic bread was missing…Called the outlet but to no avail..Thirdly, the pizza in the middle was warm and the crust was stoned cold…like how can you messed up a pizza?? forget my garlic bread alr then my pizza stone cold..call them also useless..maybe they change their management or something im not sure but after today onwards I think I will start ordering from Pizza Hut at Ghim Moh..and I think the outlet can just remove their telephone..call so many time and still wont answer..I know they have quite a number of staff there because I physically went there to take my food aswell..",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118020565409410388531/reviews
yamuna mohanram,1,"Extremely disappointed with their pizza. I couldn't believe they could get their pizza taste this bad. To whoever reads this review, don't ever order a chicken curry pizza. Horrible horrible. Their vegetarian pizza was bad too. The pizza base was equally bad. Forget the pizza, their fries was super dry, under salted, under flavored.  Why pizza hut why? Please don't go anywhere around here, find another place. Run, run, run",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102396677643961543131/reviews
Las,1,"I ordered Ultimate meal from Westcoast pizza hut outlet and received our garlic after 30 mins which was suppose to be part of original order. Really disappointed. Even though I spoke to someone at the store but despite of that, it took them 30 mins to deliver the garlic bread.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111453287278210957718/reviews
