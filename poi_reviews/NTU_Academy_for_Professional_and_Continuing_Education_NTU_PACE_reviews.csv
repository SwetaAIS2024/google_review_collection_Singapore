Long Tianhao,5,SkillsUnion Software Development Immersive course is great because we were given what to expect from the start to the end. We were trained to be independent while getting help and care from the instructors. Our instructors still managed to squeeze in slots of time for us despite their busy schedule. We were also taught what was currently out in the market and it was a great place to learn and upskill ourselves.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105876417285411079292/reviews
Sarah K,1,"SkillsUnion Software Development Immersive course is horrible. Wasted 6 months of my life. Instructors too busy building their side businesses. Students made to figure things out on their own even without tech background. Instructors too busy to offer help, usually don’t even reply. Doesn’t have what it takes to be an instructor. Don’t waste your money. There are other programs out there that are much better, like Trent.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105371845861631046507/reviews
Qing Guo,1,"Worse than polytechnic skillsfuture courses with half baked instructors, who are irresponsible in delivering classes. Low quality and clearly money minded for the entire department. Why is NTU hiring this kind of 'educators' is beyond belief as a university.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103669009552543872296/reviews
Mia Foo,5,"Offers an array of credit-bearing CET courses that are stackable towards relevant NTU certificates, offering us with flexible pathways to upskill. Not only are most courses SkillsFuture funded,  NTU alumni are also given course credits to support their upskilling.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104503452951489300460/reviews
Amyn Othman,5,"I’m constantly thinking of improving myself and to increase my employability within the job market so it's great news that it provides flexible learning pathways for me to acquire new skills and knowledge with a wide variety of courses! It allows me to stack academic credits earned from the courses to a relevant Master’s degree from NTU. Additionally,  most courses are SkillsFuture funded CET courses!!!!

Looking forward to embark on my journey towards lifelong learning and I hope you do the same too!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112441157979471589986/reviews
