Leon Kwang,3,"It's quite difficult to get a solid Lor Mee in Singapore these days.. this is just about a decent rendition (and I'm being positive/ encouraging towards the young hawkers :)

Hope they'll refine their offerings and go up a few levels (which there are certainly room for).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116326892362989736040/reviews
wick,4,The lor mee they serve is the average Lor mee you can get around the neighbourhood. Their laksa is quite good however the portions are quite small. Love the chicken cutlet they sell.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102058245572157755790/reviews
