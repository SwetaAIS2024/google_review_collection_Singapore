Ger Maine,5,"My family and I just went there to eat - meat dishes + kang kong & hotplate tofu. It was overall a delightful meal because of very pleasant staff, aircon and peaceful atmosphere. Food is not as great as those outside coffee shop zi char but it still tastes nice and is healthier which we like.
