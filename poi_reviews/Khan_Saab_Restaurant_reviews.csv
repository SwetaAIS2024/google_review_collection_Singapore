daphne lim,1,"Been coming here for years and the standard dropped. Standard of the food and service here is also extremely inconsistent.

Waiter (bald man with glasses) keeps yapping which slows down the service. When we first ordered, we ordered prata with one plate of mutton curry- however, when the prata was served, we were short of one plate of mutton curry (3 ppl, 2 small plates of curry). We called the waiter and requested for a plate of mutton curry, he then came and served us a plate of curry which was NOT the one we asked for, so iâ€™m not sure if he was paying attention or yapping. Was trying to get his attention multiple times just to order an additional piece of prata, in the end, the prata never came and it wasnt even keyed into the system (not on the receipt) so we just left without itðŸ« ",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109905216366942197410/reviews

Catpura,5,"Legendary mamak shop since 2000s. Serving the BEST Prata and Thosai in Chai Chee. Mr. Bala probably the only long time employee working there. Friendly, macho and we made friends.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116561415671907910712/reviews
Elijah Tan,4,"We had a quick dinner, seizing the opportunity during the interim of our laundry's completion. Fortuitously, we arrived during a period of relative tranquility, thus avoiding the crowd.

In terms of food, it was satisfactory.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109287346354369266778/reviews
Muz Hamid,5,"Came to Khan Saab Restaurant for a weekday dinner.

+ Tried the Maggie Goreng Putih (Putih=White). Looks plain but very flavorful, one of better tasting Maggie Goreng. Comes with no meat by default, just vegetables and cut tofu. Sunny side up is also extra.
+ Tried the Cheese prata next. Cheese used is not those cheap square cheese (Kraft singles) used by other Mamak stores. It's shredded mozzarella. So got actual cheese pull. Freshly pan fried per order, so prata is crispy. Pair with the dhal and it's fantastic.
+ Service is fast and attentive. Service staff will come to you when you arrive.
+ Parking is convenient, open air car park beside the restaurant.
+ 24hrs and Halal menu.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115384080713383885657/reviews
