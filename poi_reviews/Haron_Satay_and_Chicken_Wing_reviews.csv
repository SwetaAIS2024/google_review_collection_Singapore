Winston Ho,5,"Great satay at East Coast Park Food center.
Haron Satay is one of my go-to stalls for satay. I will order their chicken and mutton satay. The mutton satay is great tasting! Itâ€™s served with sliced cucumber and red onions.
I also got the Ketupat (Boiled rice cake) which paired well with the satay peanut sauce.
They used to have babat satay (tripe), but no longer sell it.
Prices are $1 for a stick of satay. Minimum order applies. The ketupat costs $0.50.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109087882208981210478/reviews
RS,3,Used to be better. The beef satay is hard and cold. Like frozen and not juicy at all. The satay gravy was too little as well in a tiny bowl. The young person taking the order looked not interested at all. The reason I gave 3 stars is for the mutton satay which is still ok and for the atmosphere by the beach. Next time I will try others.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113493992591617460438/reviews
Elvin Tan,1,Please check your satay when you eat as we encounter raw lamb and beef. My point of view is regardless how tired your working day is as long as you serve food the food must be safe to eat.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111335987684609147398/reviews
YEO WEN JUN ROY,5,"One of the better satay stores around. The meat is well marinated and tasty to eat on its own, without the need to dip the satay sauce. Take note that each stick of satay is now $1 (October 2024) so it is on the pricey side.

Recommended to try.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110368122443353685000/reviews
Leonard Wee,2,Mediocre at best. Crazy charred and sticks super oily. Impossible to eat decently. Avoid! 1 dollar a stick is just daylight robbery.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116841518027778345489/reviews
