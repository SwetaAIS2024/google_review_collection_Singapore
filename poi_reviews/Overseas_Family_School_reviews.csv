Li Lo,5,"I would say this school is amazing, from their admins to their teachers: Ms. Yovita, Ms. Lyn, Ms. Angie, the mid-school principle, and all teachers. They are really paying attention into details, especially about each student's guardianship.
OFS cares and gives opportunity to every new student who would like to join the school without need to wait or being wait-listed, which I think that will be a waste of time if your children need to wait without knowing when they will be avail to enroll. Every second is matter to absorb as many education as possible (correct me if I am wrong).
What I like most about the school is their facilities / all facilities are top notch but my input for OFS is you should build indoor basketball courts (OFS if you read, pls upgrade 2 semi-indoor courts to indoor by using carpet / no need wooden floor nor air-con, just install huge ceiling fans).
Additional info, parents can follow the students daily learning activities and what is next for agenda from online.
The school also offering free of charge after school or lunch break programs to nourish their students. They also offer paid after-school programs with professional instructors.

From my son, he said that time flies in OFS because the friends and teachers are fun. He gets bored once home. He loves canteen foods especially pizzas.

All in all, I would recommend this school to my friends and relatives if they would like to search for an International school in Singapore.
Love their layout as well because the school hallway and canteen air is always fresh and cooling even tough no air-con is used.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108629516583214094098/reviews

Fantastic performances and delicious food.
At OFS, we truly believe in creating a united community through the celebration of different cultures.
