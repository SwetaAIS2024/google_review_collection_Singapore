Bian Lee,4,"Went to the hawker centre for the second time to eat the Come Daily Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee. It‚Äôs was closed when I was there the first time. Have to wait for 20mins for my order. The noodle is well braised and flavourful. It was good with or without the chilli sambal. It‚Äôs worth the travel there. The hawker centre though packed with lunch crowd, was airy.

I also had a plate Hainanese chicken and rice. The chicken is served with tau Kwa and generous serving of scallion sauce. Chicken is moist, tender and well cooked. Very delicious.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106963842817729813226/reviews
Liu William,4,"This is a hawker centre or non air conditioned food centre, so it can be warm on a humid day. Chicken rice, fusion karaage are good. Kway chap is ok only, the meat kind too hard, bean curb (Tao Pok) too salty, eggs are really small (big yolks little egg white).",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112866133406758384944/reviews
Dennis check,4,"I had carrot cake from ÈùíÂ±±. Both the chili and non. Chilli option. Really good. I suggest that you go early to avoid the crowd in the morning. I added some pictures to show what I ate. They only have the white option.

Crispy and fragrant. Quite evenly cooked. Will come back again for this plate of goodness.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104765340207011638270/reviews
xaxxolonch,5,"Love the traditional chwee kueh and the chee cheong fun here, the black sweet sauce was sweet enough pair with the chili. The price was cheap too. There are lots of soy bean milk choice here too.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112943480526851653374/reviews
Kevin Tan,4,"Second time here. Love the variety of hawker food! Usually quite crowded and difficult to get a seat during peak hours. Some food there sell out fast too, and the famous ones have long queues. Overall, worth visiting multiple times to try different food. Tried the kway chup today! Was good! üëçüèª",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103323257647265222662/reviews
