Thaddaeus Kwok,4,"Very convenient. Got bus service to Malaysia through Woodlands checkpoint. Bus queues can sometimes be really Long. And occasionally, the bus can take quite a while to come. Even if one arrives, sometimes no one can board it. Not sure why. Worse was when I had to experience this for 3 busses in a row.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101855097094224507881/reviews
Jerry QUEK Cheng Pang,5,"Location is just by the Singapore Turf Club.This mrt stn is a connecting point for getting on the Public buses to Johor Baru,Malaysia.Can see a long queue for buses to Johor Baru on Saturdays especially if  the Saturday is a holiday's eve. Also there is a gate within the station with a walkway leading into the SingaporeTurf Club.There are several amenities within the station, e.g. Kopitiam foodcourt, cake shops, mobile phone shop,Malay foods shop,dessert/drinks shop, atms, etc.
