Totally not professional, there are better maid agencies out there, hire them at your own risk. If can rate a 0, it should be the rating. Lesson learnt: to review all the companies before engaging them for any services.",

Company (Comfort Employment Pte Ltd) was unwilling to return pro-rated placement fee refund when the maid missed home and ran away.\n\nMaid was subsequently found and employer was not at fault. Company pushed the blame to Indonesian agency and Comfort Employment Pte Ltd boss, Benny is unwilling to talk and resolve the problem after months of chasing.\n\nEngage their service at your own risk!\nAn unscrupulous way of doing business!",

      "text": "I once had an agent who was very irrelevant, everything I brought was confiscated, my wallet was confiscated, my HK ID card, even small change was confiscated. I also followed the employer, not according to the rules, saying that the job also had 1 child, 1 house, but it turned out that the houses were 2 big, the employer's house was all glass and had to be wiped every day, my grandmother's house was also glass and had to be wiped every morning and evening, I got angry after a short break, the children were not allowed to be touched, I was returned to the agent for 2 weeks with reports that were not good, especially when there was a miss at the agent, I forgot who she was, she was fat, insulting, I wanted to report her to my husband that I was a prostitute in Singapore. The other miss was thin, all the contents of my wallet were confiscated. My HK ID card was thrown away. Luckily I got another Chinese employer, she was a good person, after the contract was over I went straight home without going through an agent again.",
