James Bartholomew,5,"One of a oldest estate in Singapore. Most are public housing where live by different levels of earning residents, not many private properties. The hawker market selling authentic local favour of foods. Range from Chinese, Malay, Indian and local Western food. 80 per cent food are good. I had a local chinese mixed rice(which a choices of dishes mixed with rice)   the stall had a very nice creamy curry chicken. I had one meat(chicken meat) two veg, it's cost $4.50. Very generous portion! I were over fed! The market is clean and it's usually open for breakfast till late lunch(1430hrs) for most of the stalls. Washroom $0.10cent Singapore coin per entry.

Michelle Koh,5,"Planned trip to eat charkwayteow, after seeing the queue, no matter how nice it is also don't worth the time to queue (estimate 1.5hr) and the boss is cooking relatively slow. So turn to this stall selling hokkien mee and turn out to be quite nice. $5 per plate, there are $8/$10 option available. For the $5, 3prawns were given, plenty of squid.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113005302051880474302/reviews
