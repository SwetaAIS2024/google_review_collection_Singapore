X L.,5,"Always loved visiting all their aquarium outlets.

Went to Sims Ave outlet to purchase a filter. Got home to realise that part of it has broken. Called in to check if I could exchange to a new one despite not having a receipt. Fornutely, I remember my payment method, they verified and let me do an exchange.

When I got to the outlet, told the same uncle who was doing cashiers the day before whom I purchased the filter, that my filter is spoilt, he was so nice to check all his available stocks to make sure the exchanged one is perfectly fine.

Upon looking through the stocks, we realise most of the stocks are cracked due to transport issue.

But whag Uncle did was so nice. They were still somewhat busy during the time I was there and he was so patient to help me find the stock.

Thank you bubbles aquarium!

Sheron Oh,5,"I visited the shop due to its convenient location and positive reviews. The owner assisted me in finding the necessary accessories and products, and offered valuable advice on setting up my filtration system. I appreciated that his recommendations were practical and that he advised against purchasing more expensive, unnecessary items, such as a larger pump. The prices are reasonable. Highly recommended.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106560183505261604011/reviews
