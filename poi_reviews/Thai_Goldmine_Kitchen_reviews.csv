Yip Lim Bing,5,"The place is seriously one of the best Thai places I’ve been to in Singapore!
For one, the tom yum is friggin amazing! Thick, flavourful and not salty at all. The generous amount of seafood and mushrooms inside are yet another good point for this dish.
The basil pork was also really great, bearing a satisfyingly flavourful punch of basil.
The instant noodle salad was also somehow absolutely delicious. Marinated without being overly soggy or salty, they went well with the seafood served with it.
The vegetables were nicely cooked and sauced, crisp and savoury.
The shrimp cakes were, surprisingly, made out of actual shrimp, which was a nice surprise. Anyway, they also tasted great.
The milk tea and the rice was nice, but nothing really outstanding.

All in all, one of the best Thai places on this island. I would definitely recommend going here to eat, but as seating is limited, I would advise to get a booking beforehand.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111604257577160692138/reviews
Any,4,"Popped by for a quick meal for two pax. We were welcomed at the door by one of the young men working there. First impression was pleasant! At least it felt like a genuine warm welcome.

Food was served pretty quick. We had a Tomyam soup and basil chicken, even though we would’ve loved basil Pork instead. On top of that, we also had 2 glasses of Thai milk tea!

Loved the milk tea, it was fragrant, not too sweet and just $2 a glass. Also really appreciate the fact that it came without straws. Server made an effort to highlight that they are trying to go green by excluding straws. Of which , we greatly welcome!

Overall it cost us $22 for this dinner pictured below (without the teas though!)",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106243564713958233243/reviews

Garlic chicken set is good. Like the fried garlic bits. Taste kind of sweet. The Tom Yam soup taste authentic and delicious. But not much ingredients. Small bowl. The set meal comes with one fried egg as well. Will return to try other dishes. Overall not bad.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104258555113765533217/reviews
Ernest Ezra,4,"Simple and casual thai food at affordable prices. Though presentation isnt fancy, fried rice was fragrant and had wok-hei. Pad thai was on the sweet side and tasted like kuey tiao stir fried with just black sauce.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117668791710501418515/reviews
