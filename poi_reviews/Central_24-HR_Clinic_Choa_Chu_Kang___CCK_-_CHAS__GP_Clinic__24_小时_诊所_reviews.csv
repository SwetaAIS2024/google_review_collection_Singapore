Nurul Natasha,1,"Extremely disappointing experience at this clinic. The front desk was rude and unprofessional. Please change your front desk officers lah.

I visited today but the care I received was subpar.
24 hours but doctor was not available until 1-1:30pm. Like seriously? What’s the point of having it for 24 hours when you cannot even adhere to it.

Would not recommend 24 hours clinic to anyone. Expect better care and service from a medical professional.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102827615520438426201/reviews
Jabby Jack,5,"Went to the clinic after my work shift ended. The registration is fast, the registration counter take the inatiative to ask the patient whats wrong with us, the que also quite fast and the doctor also very friendly n professional. Double thumbs up for this clinic.
I know theres other bad reviews abt the clinic but this based my own experienced with them. The first time i went there, during CNY festive, at registrastion counter told the consultation fee is $145 medicine not included. As i reluctant with the fee, she told me the best to go A&E, she very friendly and soft spoken when explain to me knowning i had a high fever. But i really hope the clinic take the review seriously and change for the better. Cheers!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107338421795929922118/reviews
小玗小玗,5,Doctors and nurses are very polite and friendly. Doctors listen and understand patients issue and give helpful advice and necessary treatment. Nurses are efficient in preparing medicine and patients do not need to wait for long hours. The clinic accepts different insurance cards and is hassle free for patients.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100736765091397599606/reviews
