      "text": "Dr Jonathan Chong is an excellent doctor. His bedside manners? Impeccable. So nice & polite, non-judgmental, respectful.\nIn fact I don’t think I’ve ever seen a GP who is this nice in my life.\n\nHe’s also extremely gentle & careful when drawing blood & doing other examinations. Due to my chronic illness I have to get my blood test every few months, and it’s always a pleasant and painless experience.\n\nHow I wish all doctors were like this!\n\nThis is clearly a doctor who loves & takes pride in his work.\n\nEven though DTAP is a bit more pricey than the typical GP clinic, but honestly I’d happily pay more for this level of healthcare.\n\nOnly downside is sometimes the clinic counter staff can be rather curt & unfriendly. So there’s certainly room for improvement there.",
