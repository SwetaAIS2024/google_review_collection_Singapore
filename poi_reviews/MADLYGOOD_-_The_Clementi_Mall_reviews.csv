Lina Lim,3,"All day brunch food is not bad. Cost $16.80.
Croffle is so-so. Pistachio cream not bad.

There is 30% discount on all pistachio items.

Clementi mall s3 app can redeem points for $5 off (min $20 spent).

Food overall is not bad but counter staff taking my order maybe in a bad mood. I feel she very angst when taking my order. Dont know what she cant find, but she look so glum. Im not expecting big smiles when taking customer's orders, but at least be polite and patient pls.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107917244728844048910/reviews
Liojn,4,"MadlyGood never disappoints! Their ice creams are amazing, and I love how they‚Äôre always introducing new flavors to try. The waffles are also top-notch‚Äîcrispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and pair perfectly with the ice cream. The only downside is that it's a bit on the pricier side, but for the quality and taste, it's still worth the occasional treat. Definitely a must-visit for dessert lovers! üç¶üç∞‚ú®",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114025054730355014633/reviews
Posh Pearl,5,"2nd visit to try the waffles and crepe. Generous portions and good taste. Will visit again!

My first time here! Walked past and decided to try the gelato!
Please send my compliments to Min En! Her service is so heartfelt and sincere! Her cheerful disposition makes the whole experience even better!
We also enjoy the Pistachio gelato and the cookies and cream gelato! I definitely need to try the pistachio cream waffles next time!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106728704755913363642/reviews
C,3,"Located on the 5th floor of The Clementi Mall, MADLYGOOD is a popular caf√© best known for its specialty desserts, though it also offers a small selection of all-day breakfast items.

Tried it for lunch and had the Chicken Ham Breakfast ($15.80), which includes a choice of pancake or croffle, scrambled eggs, saut√©ed mushrooms, chicken ham, tater tots, and a mesclun salad. The presentation was neat, the pancake was enjoyable, but the eggs were overly salty.

While the savory options are decent, desserts remain their strong suit, making them the better choice for a visit.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
Lee Ern,3,"Ordered the student meal comprising of a Nutella Banana Crepe and a Hojicha Latte for $10.50. Thought it was quite a reasonable price compared to the other items on the menu! Food was a let down though.
Hojicha Latte is a 0/10. I drank a few sips and didn‚Äôt touch it again. So bland and flavourless. Tastes like water with a pinch of Hojicha powder. Nutella Banana Crepe was very average. Crepe was a bit too thick and also, flavourless. The Nutella and Oreo bits on top made up for it a little.

Overall, nothing about the store compels me to visit again. Though the store was quite clean and provided sockets for charging. Also had colouring papers to entertain children",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101153837126395574721/reviews
