      "text": "This is one of my favourite BBQ places. Their sambal is nice, not overly salty yet fragrant and flavourful. Their stingray are always grilled nicely, not overcooked or undercooked. Their kangkong, while not the best I had, is also admirable. I was there at 7+pm this time, and most ingredients were already sold out. Thus, do come early and be prepared to wait. The aunties will take your orders and serve you promptly when the food is ready.",

      "text": "The sambal stingray here is superb! I was also very impressed by the sambal sotong. It was cooked to perfection and the sauce they used just tasted so good. Do try to eat the sotong first though, as the longer it stays on the hotplate, the tougher it gets. I'd give the kang kong a miss though, as the portion was really small.\n\nTheir business is really good, so do avoid coming during peak periods. I'd recommend reaching before 6pm to avoid a long queue.\n\nWill definitely be back for the sambal stingray and sotong again!",

Its also very bland. And both dishes were soaked in oil. Oh gosh... the only saving grace? Its piping hot, jus like how bbq seafood should be served!",
