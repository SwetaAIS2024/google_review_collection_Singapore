Baoling Cheong,1,"Very bad attitude from the stall owner. Ordered a packet of duck rice to go and wanted to pay but the QR code wasn't working. (I tried using 2 different phones). Asked nicely if there is any other QR code to scan, they are so defensive and said that's the only one and other people can scan. Others paid $300+ and blamed on my phone. Asked me to change hp.

Ram Lim,1,"Scammers, asked for $7 portion, gave me $5 portion. Not the way to do business, unethical, stupid aunty and uncle. Still can lie through their teeth and say ""alr add meat liao"" . Is this what you call ""add meat""?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102586108402425293350/reviews
Stanley,2,"Came here after a recommendation by a friend. After trying their braised duck noodles, I wasn't really impressed. Noodles were well cooked. Duck meat was a bit hard and tough. Braised egg was hard as well. Their soup had a mild herbal taste and was a bit too peppery. I felt that they could definitely do better than this. Just my personal opinion.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109779294020772182875/reviews
