Food variety is wide and can be spoiled for choices here. The ambience here is family friendly. The best part is the closing time which stretches way past midnight.",

I didn't have any expectations after it moved, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the new location feels even better than the previous one. Itâ€™s spacious and clean, and the surroundings are not too crowded. The taste of the food and drinks remains the sameâ€”good and affordable. They also still offer live music.",

Missing the lemak in between. If the lemak is there the sate will be perfect! Please put the lemak in between.\n\nNasi goreng tepanyaki seafood 9/10\n\nButter prawn 7/10. Not the same like the previous singgah selalu at danga bay.. Seems like got salted egg sauce?\n\nOverall the food are satisfactory.. Ordered take away too",
