      "text": "I rarely give high reviews to clinic, especially for skin, I‚Äôve been to plenty of skin specialist for my bad acne scarring and none of them is as personal, welcoming and sincere like Dr Shane. I did my procedure today, regardless of results, I do think Dr Shane clinic is worth going, he look at every little detail of his work on your skin. He take his time to explain and he put In extra effort to make sure the treatment is done as painless as possible.\n\nHis nurse is friendly, not pushy and most importantly, they are warm and treat scar patients with sensitivity. Many acne scars patients has low self esteem, with even the slightest bad attitude can be a major turn off. Today, I did not feel it at all and I felt fully respected and pampered as a patient.\n\nI will recommend his clinic to the people around me! Thank You Dr Shane, Stella and hazel, keep up the good work~  üòÅ",
