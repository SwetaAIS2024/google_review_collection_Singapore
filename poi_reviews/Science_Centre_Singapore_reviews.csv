Jackie Mellor,5,"Absolutely loved it. So many things to see, you'll need hours here to see it all. You can grab a bite to eat with kaya toast or fries in the middle at the Coffee Bee, or something more substantial. They have water, coffee or soft drinks as well.

The fire tornado at 2:30pm is fantastic to see, kids loved it. So many amazing exhibits, adults and kids alike had a wonderful time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103702680447161025482/reviews
William Lu,5,"We had fun here. We came slightly after 10am, bought ticket onsite via website. $6 per adult and $4 per child. Scan in the QR ticket and enter through gate.

Walked around 1 hr plus and reached lightning show at 12pm. It was electrifying show. Went for lunch at coffee hive (the only restaurant inside), there is one outside as well with long queue. Walked another 1 hr plus and watched the show at 2:30pm for fire tornado. It was hot standing in the front.

Wasn't planned to spend the whole day here but ended up till 4pm.

It was a lot of good information learned from this place.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
Widi Arya Muhammad Khairul Nizam,5,"It was my first time visiting and it didn't disappoint. My friend invited me here for research purposes but also to have some fun. There was a wide variety of different exhibits, each one focussing on a certain topic. My favourite part was definitely the mirror maze. I had a blast navigating through and finding my lost friend. I somehow even found a way to tell if there was a mirror in front of me just by looking at the floor. The gift shop had plenty of science related toys and games but I decided to buy a cute plushy. An overall great experience and would definitely come back againðŸ”¥",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105366038139449016086/reviews
Michael Joel Mawikere,5,"Science is great! Itâ€™s free for Permanent Residents of Singapore but foreign people must pay. There is an escape room game. It is a bit dim there. Colorful lights sparkle in the dark. Outside at the entrance, there is a waterpark. Also there is a gift shop inside. The museumâ€™s collection includes dinosaur bones, solar system, our mind, angles, light and shadow and odd vision. Laser maze is like an adventure through a phantom city! There are some hands-on activities. You should come here to learn!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110185022401059709772/reviews
Mei Lan Ang,5,A great place to hang out with primary school kidsâ€”an excellent learning spot! The Thatâ€™s Gross show is definitely worth watching. The other two shows are only available on public holidays,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104565441027356637032/reviews
