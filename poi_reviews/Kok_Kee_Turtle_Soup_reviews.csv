Drew,4,"I think their herbal chicken soup is done better than their turtle soup. Don't get me wrong, the turtle soup is decent, but far from great. It was light on the turtle meat, though they cooked it til it's soft, and the cartilage / joints were nice to chew on. However, the taste of the soup is too light, bordering on the blander side.

Not my favourite, but OK in a pinch. It's in a hawker centre, so don't expect an upscale ambience or anything. But they do close early, so maybe they do have a steady stream of customers.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101284562920569774106/reviews

EUGENE LIM,4,"I bought a $10 per bowl turtle soup.  Herbal taste soup with pieces of meat enough to go with a bowl of rice. Soup can be refill but tasted different from the original so..not sure is it been diluted..overall, still consider good if you want to find turtle soup in toa Payoh",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105508654382108087850/reviews
