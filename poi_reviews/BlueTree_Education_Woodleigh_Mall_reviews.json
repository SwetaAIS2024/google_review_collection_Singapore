      "text": "My daughter has been learning under Teacher Keefe since Sec 1 and is currently in Sec 3, where he is now teaching her A Math. He is able to identify her weaker areas and effectively correct them. He takes the time to go through her school test papers in detail, pinpointing the exact reasons for any marks lost and helping her improve strategically.\n\nHis dedication, thorough approach, combined with his engaging teaching style, has made a significant difference in her understanding and confidence in the subject. We are very happy to have such a committed tutor. Highly recommended!",

Thanks to your engaging and effective teaching methods, she has been able to focus better and stay interested in the topics. It’s the first time my Primary 5 daughter scored full marks on a paper — and we only started lessons with you in December 2024! Thank you, Teacher Seri, for making such a positive difference in her learning journey!",

Ever since he joined Blue Tree under the guidance of Teacher Seri, his love for Science has grown, and his grades have improved tremendously.\n\nP5 is not easy, but Teacher Seri makes the learning journey smooth and enjoyable. She explains concepts so clearly that Isaac understands them effortlessly. The best part? Science tuition has become something he actually looks forward to every week!\n\nThank you, Teacher Seri and Blue Tree, for making Science so fun and engaging. Highly recommend to any parent looking for a solid Science foundation for their child!",
