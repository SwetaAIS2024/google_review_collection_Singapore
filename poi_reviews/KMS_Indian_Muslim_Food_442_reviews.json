Made on the spot, unlike usual prata stalls which have mountains of pre-made cold pratas at the side.\nPrata was served hot, taste was quite ok, just that not crispy (-0.5 star) (might have to ask for more crisp). Vegetarian curry (Dal) was too watery (-0.5 star), thou taste wasn't too bad. I have tasted better pratas but this was decent.",
