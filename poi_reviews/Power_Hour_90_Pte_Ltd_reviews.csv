Andre Gerard Ballesteros,5,"Ruby designed and implemented a bespoke fitness and training program to help me in open water swimming, focusing on key areas (flexibility, strength, etc) in which I needed to improve. He would quickly adapt to what I needed to work on during a particular session -- whether in the gym or in the pool. Ruby's program helped me achieve a personal best in a recent 5 km swim. Not content, he is ramping up training for an even better result in my next events.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110489901681259378320/reviews
yandy tan,5,"I don't know how to express my upmost gratitude to Ruby who willingly to share at all his best during my journey of fitness.

The hardest is to consistently kick-start your everyday routine. Once Ruby knew your determination, he made sure I did it right and continuously giving me the right advice when I'm lost in certain ways. And realign myself and move on.

From 83kg to 57kg. 9 mths. Thank you Ruby. Although we worked together virtually, your ways of motivation matters to me.

I managed to reverse back my prediabetic issue and now I'm still maintaining. Almost 5 years and I definately will continue on.

Thank you Ruby",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112284252197292008877/reviews
