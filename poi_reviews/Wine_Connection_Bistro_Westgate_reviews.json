      "text": "Decent ambience and service crew is pretty good. My friend and I ordered a pot of peppermint tea each however they ran out of teapots so they requested us to share a pot of tea first and they will refill it again with a new bag of tea when we need it which I find reasonable. Even though they requested us to move seats towards the end of our meal (since both of us were occupying a 4 person table), they kindly explained why they had to do so which I thought was pretty nice of them\n\nFood wise, we ordered the aglio olio with scallops and prawn which tasted pretty good. However the portion was just too small. I could finish the spaghetti in 3 to 4 mouthfuls. While we ordered a bowl of soup too, it was just not enough for us hence we had to get a pizza which only filled up perhaps 70%\n\nOverall I think that the dining experience is pretty good but we would need to order more in order to be full since the portion is pretty small",
