The overall food quality was quite good , with a great variety of dishes that were well-prepared and flavorful. The service was smooth, with orders arriving promptly, and the staff was friendly and attentive throughout our meal. The experience was well worth it, offering great value for the price.",

      "text": "Went there for a birthday celebration and had their Valentineâ€™s special.\n\nWe loved the vibes and the service. But honestly the food disappointed as a whole\n\nThe beef tataki was well cooked and salad was fresh. The octopus pasta was honestly pretty good. Love the deep seafood flavour in the sauce and rather tender octopus.\n\nThe lamb looks nice but it was overcooked, abit tough and dry. Accompaniments were alright.\n\nBangers and mash was not too bad, but the mashâ€™s main flavour profile was butter. Like I get it, butter makes everything better but this was abit much.\n\nFinally, thought we could end the night well with the cannoli but my god, we actually hated it. Really hard shell and a stupidly sour berry compote that was so hard to eat. Itâ€™s suppose to pair with the  tea ice cream (just tasted like vanilla) but itâ€™s still too too too sour. My face just reacts when I think of it. This dessert need to be looked at again.\n\nCocktails were fine, nothing special.\n\nThat being said, their service was really really good. They took the feedback well and did a service recovery. I hope the main menu is better than the specials I had.",
