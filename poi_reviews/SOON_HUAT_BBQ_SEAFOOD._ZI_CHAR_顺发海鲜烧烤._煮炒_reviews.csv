Boon Leong,4,"Ordered the black pepper deer 🦌 meat rice
Meat is tender, black pepper flavor a little overwhelming
But overall is still tasty
The price is $8",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118439101019407877742/reviews
Barry Lo,5,"Had a very good meal here. Sambal Stingray with falling off flesh when scrapped. Nice sweet sambal sauce to perfectly go with rice.

For the lala, we went with the kum heung sauce for something different. Very fragrant and every morsel is coated in the goodness.

Fresh green veggie stir fried with mushrooms and garlic bits.

5/5 meal as always. Will be back again when I am around the area.

J's Tan,1,"Fried rice is horrible as alot of grains are as hard as a rock. I don't even understand how this place is still in operational. They cannot even get the basic of cooking right. The long pony tail lady keeps encouraging me to buy expensive stuff like seafood even though I said no already. Very disappointing Soon Huat

leticia ong,1,"Terrible service the ah seng middle age girl with VERY long pony tail anyhow accused me of not knowing how to cook when i found the fish’s scale on my food, of course, naturally it’d be weird to find that on my PORK RIBS RICE so i asked what this was? She arrogantly replied “Fish scale lah” and said to her worker that i don’t know how to cook? Eh please. People know how to cook ofc, with hygiene lah. What kind of person will cook then end up with FISH SCALE on pork ribs sia. 你知道怎么说人们不会做饭，但不会剪头发和提高卫生啊？不开心就回去Malaysia了。However, the aunty was super nice and lovely. Very cute old auntie.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100191333210337155557/reviews
Sebastian Lee,1,"$15 of BBQ sotong. Didnt finish half the plate because it's so underwhelming.

1. They didnt remove the outer skin of the sotong properly, and it's a choking hazard bcus the skin is not easy to bite and it's long, thin and stretchy.

2. No taste in the meat. I thought it was steamed sotong instead of BBQ sotong. Maybe cos i didnt order the traditional sambal. Also, Where's the hotplate?

3. Price. Definitely not value for money.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117385737623152267279/reviews
