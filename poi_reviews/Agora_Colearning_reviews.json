      "text": "Aisyah and team are impeccable. We recently celebrated our son‚Äôs 1st birthday at Agora Co-Learning Space and honestly, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. From the very first message to the last moment of packing up, Aisyah went above and beyond for us.\n\nThe attention to detail was insane ‚Äî every corner of the venue was thoughtfully arranged, the setup was beautiful, and the whole flow of the event was seamless. She helped us coordinate with vendors, gave honest recommendations, and even secured better deals for us. What really blew us away was how she handled things after the event too ‚Äî one of the vendors arrived late (not her fault at all), and yet she still gave us a discount just to make sure we were happy. That kind of care is so rare.\n\nAisyah was also incredibly accommodating throughout the planning process. We had a lot of specific requests ‚Äî from kid-friendly setups to ensuring the space worked for elderly guests ‚Äî and she just handled everything like a pro. She even gave us a really fair and affordable package without compromising on quality.\n\nAnd here‚Äôs the kicker: she‚Äôs pregnant and still stayed till the very end to help us pack up. We tried to stop her but she just smiled and insisted. Truly someone who puts her heart into what she does.\n\nThank you Aisyah and the Agora team for making our little boy‚Äôs first birthday so special. You really made our dream event come true. Highly, highly recommended ‚Äî and seriously to the bosses, give this woman a raise!",
