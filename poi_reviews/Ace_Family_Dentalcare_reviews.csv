Jessilin Khee,5,"I would like to put up this review for Dr Tan as he has been a wonderful and professional dentist since I start dental treatments and doing my Invisalign  braces with his dental clinic since 2016. He has been the most friendly, cheerful dentist I have ever met who makes every dental experience not that scary for me! I appreciate how patient he is with me and often cracks cute jokes and even remember alot of details about his patients. Since appreciation for always giving wise advice and keep my teeth at their best condition! Kudos!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117642050484907128362/reviews
David Ah Chai Lim,5,"I am extremely pleased with the treatment and quality of service from Dr Tan and his staff on my dental procedures. I had an implant on my right lower jaw and an almost full upper jaw denture. The treatment took many months to complete and many visits to his practice. I must say that customer services and courtesy  were of the highest standard which I am very proud to acknowledge to him and his team. His reception staff were friendly and courteous and never fail to remind me of my appointments these few months. More importantly, Dr Tan was always on time with his appointment.. I am very happy to endorse Dr Tan and his staff to anyone looking  for a good and reliable dental surgeon. Thank you/David Lim",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101770200318993345295/reviews

Tan TG,1,"Dr Tan is very unprofessional. this dentist charges are very expensive and he will over do the necessary treatment so that he can charge more. both my wife and I had very very bad experience.

When i called in to speak to him, the clinic assistant will say he is not in, or he is very busy.

if Google review allows me to rate zero star, i will do that.

my advise to all not to go there for dental treatment.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107479747860582333758/reviews
Lee Jaze,5,"Was intro by my friend to visit ACE clinic years ago. I was attended by DR Lee. She is a professional and caring doctor, she first did polishing for me and it wasn't pain at all, which i can feel the good result after the polishing. She is a patient doctor and she will answer to my concern and enquiries. Has been constantly looking for her to do polishing and fillings since then.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113889787155200901545/reviews
