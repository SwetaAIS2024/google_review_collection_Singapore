Verindha Octria,5,"A small park around the Fort Canning Park area. I passed this way when I go to Tiong Bahru to have my lunch.

Actually, this park is quite bigger than I thought, since there was some amusement media that I didnâ€™t capture. But, when I saw in google, I found it interesting.

So, in this area, you can play with kids, running, walking, or just enjoy the moment.

You can have free water here from the fountains right here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116523238390617203681/reviews
Alinda Tian,5,"2/20/2024 I and my husband come in and walk around this area, I think the location of this section is very convenient, close to the subway station MRT, there are many landscape and a variety of plants and flowers.

Ginny Toh,5,"First time checking out this park. Beautiful spacious surroundings with a small public car park next to it.
A fun wooden obstacle course greets us as we walk toward thr park from the car park. Next to it there are a couple of inclusive swing (for the kids who are wheelchair bound) Nice!! And there are about another 5 swings just round the corner.
Further up, there are 5 different slides for the kids to play on. Spotted two sets of see-saw under a partially shaded area.
In case you run out of water, we spotted two re-filling stations around the park. There is even taps for the little ones to wash their hands and feet after playing on the sand.
And if u are hungry after all the chasing and playing, Tiong Bahru Bakery is just nearby. Follow the aromatic smell of bread & coffee. ðŸ˜‰
Note: Do come earlier in the morning as it can gets hot by 1030am.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113103868486256084260/reviews
Leah Loy,5,"It was my first time to visit with my boy. And glad I discovered the other side of this park which is perfect for my little one. As I usually visit here for some events like â€œFilms at the Fort â€œand some concerts in previous years. Loved the big seesaw, slides and the climbing net. Iâ€™m always grateful for the amazing parks of Singapore which offer loads of fun for both kids and adults. And itâ€™s FREE!!! Definitely will come back here. And kudos to the staff and volunteers for keeping the park clean and in good condition as always.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116635677251612577151/reviews
