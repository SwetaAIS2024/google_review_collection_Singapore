Ordered 7 dishes and the bill came up to $60ish, which is much cheaper than a typical zhu chao place.\nOne thing to note though, perharps because it's relatively new, there was only 2 staff working of which 1 had to work as a cashier too. Be patient to wait for their food, you would not regret it!",
