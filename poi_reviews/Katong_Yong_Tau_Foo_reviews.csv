Soh Wee Kian,5,"Don‚Äôt let the environment deceive you, the Rojak prices are in SGD 4.5 6 8 portions and I ordered the SGD 6 to sample.

My my my I am pleasantly surprised as this stall takes its youtiao Ê≤πÊù° very seriously, the chef a seasoned one deep fried the youtiao, and the prawn paste sauce is superbly fragrant and delicious as it‚Äôs really the true original authentic taste of Rojak seasoning, the cucumber crispy, pineapple fresh, turnip fresh, it would be perfect if they put bean sprouts, the peanut is generous and the prawn paste sauce is superb! I classify this as the 5 out of 5 star traditional authentic cuisines of Singapore!

Dennis Heng,4,Taken the yong tau foo laska. Laska gravy is nice and well prepared with dried shrimp and coconut milk. The gravy is more towards sweet than savoury. The fried yong tau foo tends to go better with the laska than the non-fried one.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105806047459951151393/reviews
