Agedeshi Nashu delicious soy sauce not too strong with grilled eggplant at right texture.  Gindara Teriyaki grilled well and tasted delicious at right texture.\nTraditional deco indoor and generally comfortable / spacious dining environment though maybe noisy.  Minor gripe about staff sweeping floor right next to my table when dining…",

I especially appreciate how vegetarian friendly the place is for my husband (he always has at least 4-5 options here between the soba, tofu, potatoes and salads). Service is prompt and non fussy. Highly recommend!",

Each eight-piece maki comes with chunks of crispy prawn/deep-fried soft shell crab/grilled eel with omelette, cucumber and sushi rice. Our favourite of the lot is the the ebi fry maki topped with a savoury mixture of sesame seeds, crushed bonito flakes which added a different flavour and texture.",

Their cooked foods are not a disappointment either and am so happy to see they have updated their menu to have more selection of dishes. They will occasionally surprise you with a seasonal menu to deliver foods that are in season with Japan, offering you a unique experience that you don't often find in other restaurants. I have been visiting this restaurant for years and I am never let down every time.",
