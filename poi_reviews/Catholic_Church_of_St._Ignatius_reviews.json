The Church facilities are all clean and modern. Appreciate that there are lifts at each level which makes it accessible for many people. They also have a columbarium at basement 1. God bless everyone. üôèüèª",

It has been a feeling of bliss that welcomes me each time I visit this place. The church has a lift near the main entrance. There is a small store but it has a wide variety of affordable reading materials. The church is meaningfully and richly decorated during Christmas season that will remind church - goers the true meaning of Advent season and Christmas day. Although the church is located near to posh houses of the \"rich\", the church is known to be very friendly and welcoming to migrants, domestic helpers and elderly.",
