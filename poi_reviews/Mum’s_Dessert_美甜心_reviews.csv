Eva,1,"Brought my container for the soup, have paid the noodles at $7.60 (2 packs). After returning back, the auntie told me that need to pay extra $0.40 for the 2 noodles plastics bag (the plastics bag is smaller than NTUC plastics bag and is much more expensive).

Auntie explained that take away need extra 40 cents as I only bought container for the soup and didn't bring container for the noodles.

Previously I bought the noodles, took away also $0.20 for a food container.

Auntie cooked the wrong noodles that I requested. I being nice and say is ok.

Very dissatisfied and disappointed with the service.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114444735939245018042/reviews
