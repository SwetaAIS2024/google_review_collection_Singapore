Of course, adjustments donâ€™t work overnight, but with their dedicated plans, consistency, and effort, Iâ€™ve personally seen significant improvement. Thanks to Ryan and the whole team!",

Ryan helped me understand where the pain point is and recommend at home exercise which I can be doing for myself.\n\nOverall I am very happy with my progress and everyone who is working makes me feel welcome whenever I come for my session.",

      "text": "Been going to this woodleigh outlet since July and the service provided by Dr Ryan, Emily and the front desk team has been excellent.  They did quite a detailed posture / spine analysis that was very reasonable. After 3 mths I do feel that my headaches are not as frequent and bad as before. The ringing in my ear has also stopped. Both Ryan and Emily are very experienced and caring. There is even a waiting area for my children to do some colouring while they wait for me.   The front desk team has great customer service too. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "Practitioners: Ryan\n\nI was initially quite skeptical about seeing a chiropractor, but Iâ€™m really glad I gave it a shot. The staff here are incredibly helpful and made me feel comfortable right from the start. After a thorough initial assessment, the drop-in style appointments have been super convenient, especially with a busy schedule.\n\nIâ€™ve noticed a real difference in my pain levels since starting treatment. While I still like to combine chiropractic care with Physiotherapy and Traditional Chinese Medicine, the adjustments here have definitely played a valuable role in my overall recovery and pain management.\n\nLooking forward to seeing how things continue to improve with ongoing treatment",

      "text": "Chiro Singapore (Woodleigh) truly changed my life, quality of my life improved drastically since lower back pain was managed! ðŸ¥¹\n\nI had persistent back pain since Sep 2024 after a small accident while moving bulky items, my mobility worsened and the pain was unbearable at times. I first consulted with Dr. Emily, and gone through adjustment sessions with both Dr. Emily & Dr. Ryan. Committing to regular adjustments made a world of difference! My lower back pain subsided, my posture improved, and I regained (better) mobility. Dr. Ryan also recommended inversion therapy, which worked wonders for lingering soreness. Iâ€™m still going twice a week because the improvements have been incredible. Highly recommend their expertise and care!",
