Healin Tay,5,"Had a good glamping experience and great family bonding time together.

The tent are spacious, cozy and very clean!!. It's come with a portable air conditioning unit and standing fan. Good enough to cool the tent after sunset. The campsite is sitted in exclusive corner nearby Constant Wind sailing club. Shower room and toilets are exclusive for glamping guests only. Although the air mattresses are not the most comfortable to sleep in , remember this is a camping ðŸ˜„, not hotel.

Thanks to the crew for adding small touches of decoration for the Christmasy mood.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115578908036663904498/reviews
AC,1,Very expensive for what it is: sleeping next to the parking lot and have the impression a Boeing plane is going to crash on the tent every five minutes.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106891779134289330509/reviews
