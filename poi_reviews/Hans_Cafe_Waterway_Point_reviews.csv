Julius Tan,3,"An okay place to have a fuss free meal. Standards do vary wildly on different days, what you are essentially paying for is western food and local delights in a slightly more comfortable environment than hawker centres. Sweet and sour fish is soggy dory and bad on any day. Fish and chips, Hong Kong noodles, scrambled eggs and seafood horfun can be quite good depending I guess on the day or chef. The horfun is the most consistent of the lot followed by the breakfast set. The hk noodles can taste very bland and oily and sometimes the fried eggs in the sandwiches are completely overcooked. The sausage in the breakfast set seemed to have a weird gingerly note since a few years back. Standards have not been improving but the prices have been steadily rising for years.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113038098593710664705/reviews
Chong KV,3,"Dec24: considering the pricing, the sitting layout got no different from food court nearby. This outlet bacon carbonara taste really good, worth trying. Hor Fan is norm but personally not worth paying this price.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114047288472149349381/reviews
Diana Low,2,HANS TEA is what attracted us but nowadays new people n staffs takeover don’t seems to know how to make the tea anymore. Was disappointed with the diluted teabags with this outlet.

Gabriel,4,"We ordered the seasonal laksa chicken cutlet pasta and a club sandwhich, together with honey lemon tea. To be fair, the food was not fanastic but were above average at most. The staffs were friendly and polite though. It as crowded when we came and we waited for 10 mins for a table hence would advise to avoid lunch period if you are rushing for time",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117387838809977391267/reviews
Siang Hwee FOO,1,"This is not about that amount of money! It’s a matter of principle!

Come on, extra surcharge on a working day? 10% more? Your staffs did not even serve us and we “self-served”some more!

It is not a public holiday though it is CNY seasons, everyone is back to work today. No doubts it’s quieter today and not much crowds but we loyal customer came support your business and you guys did this? Not nice! Not nice at all!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113691243693785257285/reviews
