It gives a beautiful combination with the rainbow veggies. Combined with the braised veggies (clear stir fry) and end with a nice warm Ormosia Job's Tears Semen Euryales Tea.\n\nMakes my day... Would recommend friends for some nice healthy food.",

      "text": "Small vegan and allium-free cafe tucked away in the heartlands, with a simple homey ambience, serving dishes mostly consisting of local delights and Chinese food. The menu was mostly whole-food plant-based with low salt, oil, and sugar, though some items did contain meat substitutes. Although the food looked deceptively simple and wasn’t really “Instagrammable”, I found them tasty and healthy, not to mention very reasonably priced despite using organic ingredients. Would highly recommend trying the tempeh in particular. I honestly consider this an underrated gem and I’ll definitely be back again! Btw this cafe is under Kampung Sepang Charity and Education Foundation, a larger organisation which also offers student care and special needs therapy, senior care services and mobility aid repair and medical services, environmental sustainability and holistic wellness (including plant-based diets) programmes, etc. I’ve ever donated to them (as an abillion Impact Champion) and am glad I finally visited the cafe. Do support their great initiatives and enjoy some fuss-free wholesome food too! 6min walk from Aljunied MRT~",
