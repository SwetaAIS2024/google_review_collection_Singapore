      "text": "On International Women’s Day, it is only fitting to highlight a mosque built by a woman—Hajjah Fatimah Mosque in Singapore. This historic mosque stands as a testament to the resilience, generosity, and contributions of women in Islamic history. Hajjah Fatimah was a wealthy Malay businesswoman of noble descent who married a Bugis prince. One day, her home was raided and burned down by robbers, but she survived simply because she was not there at the time. In gratitude to Allah for her safety, she donated the land to build a mosque for the Muslim community. Completed in 1846, Hajjah Fatimah Mosque showcases a unique architectural blend of Malay, Chinese, and European influences, with its leaning minaret often compared to the Tower of Pisa.\n\nThis mosque serves as a powerful reminder that women have long played vital roles in shaping communities, not only through leadership and trade but also in faith and social service. Islamic history is littered with women who have made a difference—from political leaders and scholars to philanthropists and spiritual figures—leaving a lasting impact on society. Nearly two centuries later, Hajjah Fatimah’s legacy continues through this mosque, standing strong as a symbol of her enduring impact.\n\n#ramadan30days30mosques #ramadan #mosque #mosques #ramadanchallenge #islam #muslim #holymonth #tourism #travel #muslimtraveler #bangladeshi #bangladeshitraveller #internationalwomensday #women #singapore #singaporemuslimah",

      "text": "Hajjah Fatimah Mosque exudes an air of tranquility and serenity, making it a cherished sanctuary for worshippers and visitors alike. Stepping into the mosque, I was struck by its timeless elegance and graceful architecture, which reflects the rich heritage of Islamic culture in Singapore.\n\nThe interior exudes a sense of peace and reverence, with intricate arabesque designs adorning the walls and ceilings, and soft light filtering through stained glass windows. As I joined the congregation for Eid prayers, I was enveloped in a sense of spiritual harmony, united in worship with fellow believers from diverse backgrounds.\n\nHajjah Fatimah Mosque serves as a beacon of faith and community in the heart of Singapore, offering solace and inspiration to all who seek solace within its hallowed halls.",
