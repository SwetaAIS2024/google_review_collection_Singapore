      "text": "This store has turned from ok to bad and now to worse. The downward slope is more evident in recent months. The products is bad, you can’t find some upper scale products yet the prices keep high or even increased significantly. What’s even worse is it sold expired products. For example in the picture (taken on 25 Mar, 2025) it was selling product expired on 20 Mar, 2025. And the products were soaked in suspicious water leaking from the fridge. The store changed layout with no sense or taste. Many products are on the shelf without price tags. Eggs of different brands with similar packages are mixed on the same shelf making it difficult for consumers to choose. Staff are rude and lack of training (or received training on how to offend customers?) eg. When I was self checking out, one of the employees closely stood by me and watched me, and grabbed my receipt to check even without asking! I was astonished by this type of behaviour and realised she was not trying to assist but as a police watching a crime and catch a thief. Please go somewhere else for shopping!",

The company & its management and staff should have moral responsibility, especially in their food and drinks quality management as selling spoilt food can cause its customer health issue.",
