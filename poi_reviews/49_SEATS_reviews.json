What stood out even more was their truly lovely service. The staff went out of their way to make sure everything was convenient and comfortable for the customers.\n\nHighly recommend for anyone looking for a satisfying and pleasant dining experience!",

Was rather happy with the fish and mashed potatoes. Fish meat portion was generous with some clam sauce/chowder and mashed potatoes tasted good.",

      "text": "We came on a weekend and ordered the tom yum seafood pasta, the smoked duck aglio olio, and the salted egg popcorn chicken.\n\nFood: the tom yum pasta was great. The spiciness is customizable, which adjusts the amount of chilli padi. We tried the 'bit more spicy' version and it was just about right. The aglio olio was sinfully good as well, on the oily side.\n\nService: After seating, order and pay at the counter before being served. Food came relatively quick.\n\nPrice: Objectively, on the higher end in price. However, it is relatively reasonable factoring the location and that there is no service charge.\n\nOverall, I would recommend to try out when there are ongoing promos and discounts.",

Ordered the tomyam pasta which was tasty but a little too salty. The portion for fish & chips was generous; easily enough for two persons with average appetites. Good service",
