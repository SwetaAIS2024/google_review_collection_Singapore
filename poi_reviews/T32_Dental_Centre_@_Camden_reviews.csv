S Tan,5,"I’ve been going for dental checkups and maintenance at T32 Camden for many years, and it’s always been a great experience each time. Dr Chin is very friendly, thorough and meticulous and there is no discomfort whatsoever when doing dental procedures. Registration is always fuss free and I’ve never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes. Kudos!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113006509068406510021/reviews

Savfina Chaufik,5,"I had all my wisdom teeth extractions performed at T32 Dental Centre (Camden), and the entire experience was exceptionally smooth and efficient. Each procedure went well, and the recovery process was seamless, with no complications.

The cost was also relatively affordable, particularly with the ability to utilise Medisave, which made the process more accessible and manageable.

I would like to extend my thanks to Grace, who was consistently helpful, responsive, and reassuring throughout my visits. I’m also deeply appreciative of Dr. Bruce, whose professionalism and clear communication made the procedures far less daunting.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105408376051014627376/reviews

Li Ann Lim,5,"Apart from the initial problems regarding appointment change and timing of which I have raised in my feedback to the clinic, the experience with Dr Lisa and her assistant were as usual excellent. Both were professional, efficient and made the whole scaling and polishing pain free and relaxed.
Dr Lisa always only does what is appropriate and necessary . She doesn't recommend procedures which may be aesthetic but not beneficial in view of my age and condition of my teeth and that is much appreciated.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116728747711222016134/reviews
