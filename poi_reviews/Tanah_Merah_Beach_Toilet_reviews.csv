A R-T,5,"I really like this quaint toilet. For a cyclist, this restroom is conveniently situated between T4, Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal and ECP.

Note that there is NO potable water here (so no sink) but there is toilet paper. As a cyclist, I just use some of my bottled water to wash my hands!

There are two gender-neutral restrooms, both catering to those with physical disabilities. These are wide and spacious enough that I bring my bicycle in with me when I need to use the facilities.

The toilets have lights and they were on when I went about 7am.

Next to the restrooms is a vending machine with drinks, plastes, small towel, etc. If there was a water cooler here, I would definitely not stop by NSRCC's any more!

The restroom is located next to a wide canal opening into the sea and there is a small area to park bicycles and even take a wade!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117945263201862639410/reviews
Kai,5,Useful for a toilet break and rest stop just before embarking onto TMCR. Take note that there is no water cooler / drinking water available at this spot - and the toilets are not in the best conditions.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102372198462322368637/reviews
