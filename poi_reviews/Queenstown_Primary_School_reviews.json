From my experience, all of the teachers in this primary school are very patient during our learning journey especially towards the Primary Leaving School Examination(PSLE). They definitely played a big part in my primary school journey, making it memorable while making sure that every students strives to do their best in their exams, cca, etc. They will also take the initiative to help us with our troubles and difficulties, making sure that we can all feel safe in school. QTPS made me feel like i was home and the pupils there are also very sweet. Shout out to Ms Ratna and Ms Peck who made my journey towards CGS possible! I would definitely recommend children to join QTPS!",
