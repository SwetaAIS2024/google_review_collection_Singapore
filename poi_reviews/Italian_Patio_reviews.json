      "text": "I recently had the pleasure of dining at Italian Patio, and I can honestly say it was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had! From the moment I walked in, I was enveloped by a warm and cozy ambiance that made me feel right at home. The setting beside the poolside, with the golf range in the background, created a serene atmosphere that was perfect for a relaxing evening.\n\nThe menu is a true delight, featuring a range of sumptuous Western cuisine that left me spoilt for choice.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the impeccable service. The staff was not only attentive but genuinely friendly, making sure I had everything I needed throughout my meal. Their recommendations were spot-on, enhancing my dining experience even further.",

      "text": "Venue was decorated pleasantly and atmosphere was lively and perfect for families. Biggest turn off however was definitely the waiting time. While informed that there would be a 30minute waiting time, it took 45 minutes for two pizzas to arrive, and a total of 50 minutes for two slices of bruschetta to be served. Food was decent, nothing to rave about; to describe it simply, lasagna was slightly better than the frozen ones from NTUC, pasta dishes were perfect for those craving an after-meal coating of oil in the mouth. Would definitely recommend coming only during non-peak hours if you'd like to give this place a try. In somewhat fairness, the waitress did apologise for the one hour waiting time when handing us the bill. Nonetheless, wouldn't be recommending this place for a good while to others.",
