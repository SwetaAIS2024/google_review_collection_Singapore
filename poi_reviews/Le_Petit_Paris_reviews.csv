Maureen Thomson,5,"We found this place by chance as we looked to try a different French restaurant. The wait staff were incredibly welcoming and efficient. The food was delicious and brought when we were ready. The smoked pork belly was devine, foie gras and desserts delicious. A fabulous personal touch by the chef as he greeted all the guests and chatted. We will definitely come back.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117291052441663319431/reviews
Marie K,5,"if you canâ€™t already tell from the various pictures, my family and friends are regulars here- and thereâ€™s a reason we keep coming back!

we often come here for brunch because itâ€™s in our neighbourhood and the food is simply delicious! all the pastries are fresh and so comforting, my family also really likes their eggs benedict and big breakfast!

we also come for dinner to celebrate special events, because we love the food so much haha. every single dish on the menu is delicious so you really canâ€™t go wrong, but my personal favourite has to be the smoked pork belly.

their desserts are also super nice! the chefs specialty cakes under the counter are super unique and unlike any dessert iâ€™ve ever tried (my brother is currently on a mini quest to try them all ðŸ˜‚) and i love their gelato ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹

also the ambience and general vibes are so nice and chill. the interior is super pretty and cosy and the staff are so friendly, and they give the best recommendations! if youâ€™re ever unsure what to order just ask them and you canâ€™t go wrong haha. the chef is also super friendly and often comes out to chat!

overall, easily once of the best cafes in sg (and iâ€™ve been to a lot) never had a bad dish or experience here!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108093104899567342594/reviews
wanz,5,"Been here twice and will definitely be back. Highly recommend the smoked pork belly - it was so tender and melt-in-your-mouth with all the right flavours.

We also ordered salmon mosaic, duct confit and ratatouille. Everything was perfect.

We ended our meal with a banana bergamote cake made by Chef Felicien Cueff himself. It was delicious, refreshing, light and hit the right spot.

I always had the impressionable French food was inaccessible around here but am so lucky to have found Le Petit Paris by chance tucked in a corner of Siglap at very reasonable prices.

And the service was fast and excellent - very friendly, attentive and approachable staff, including Chef himself.

Thanks again for having us :-)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114627786041186937710/reviews
Chang Xian Tham,5,"An excellent French restaurant in a quiet location. The lamb chops were to die for, the pork belly succulent and flavourful. Service was good and attentive, and chef came out to check on the food too. Will definitely come back again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104338661189095898016/reviews
Hui Qing Whye,5,"I visited Le Petit Paris a week ago to celebrate my birthday, and it was a truly memorable experience. The service was excellentâ€”friendly, attentive, and thoughtful. They even surprised me with a special birthday celebration, which made the evening feel extra unique and personal.

The food was fantastic! The air-flown oysters were incredibly fresh, plump, and briny. We also tried the foie gras, duck confit, and seafood spaghetti marinaraâ€”each dish was well-executed and full of flavour. Iâ€™d highly recommend all three if youâ€™re visiting for the first time.

For dessert, I especially enjoyed the pistachio ice creamâ€”smooth, creamy, and rich with authentic pistachio flavour.

Overall, a wonderful dining experience, ideal for special occasions. Highly recommended.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108878916779249494376/reviews
