Sarah Yeoh,5,"This Chinese shop really sells the best cheapest beer in heartland only $2.00 Garlsberg where can you find the beer at such a good price? Itâ€™s a steal for beer drinker.

As compare 711 sells $4.00, NTUC sells $2.75 and New Generation sells $2.20 per can.

I definitely come here again and the best thing is you can use Fave apps to pay conveniently without using cash and Cashback. ðŸ˜„",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101973180167730001433/reviews
