      "text": "If you're craving Malaysian-style baozi and dim sum but prefer the convenience of enjoying it at home, this shop is a must-try! Their frozen offerings are surprisingly delicious—just steam or heat them up, and it’s like having a **fresh dim sum feast** in your own kitchen.\n\nHighlights:\n✔ Fluffy Malaysian Baozi (包子) – The dough is soft and slightly sweet, just like the ones from kopitiams. Fillings are well-seasoned and generous.\n✔ Siew Mai (烧卖) – My absolute favorite! Juicy, porky, and with that perfect bouncy texture. Always stock up on these.\n✔ Haw Kow (虾饺) – Packed with whole shrimp and a thin, chewy wrapper. Tastes just like yum cha quality.\n✔ Black Bean Pork Ribs (豉汁排骨) – Tender ribs with rich, savory black bean sauce. Great with rice!\n✔ Braised Chicken Feet (凤爪) – Super flavorful, with that melt-in-your-mouth texture.\n\nThe prices are reasonable, especially for the quality, and the shop is strictly pick-and-go - no frills, just good frozen dim sum ready for your steamer. Perfect for busy folks who still want a taste of authentic Malaysian-style breakfast or supper.\n\nVerdict: Highly recommended if you love dim sum but want the convenience of enjoying it at home. Will definitely be back for more!",

But I guess the fluffy buns make up for it. The XLB is apparently herbal but no overpowering herbal taste, my kid loves it.",
