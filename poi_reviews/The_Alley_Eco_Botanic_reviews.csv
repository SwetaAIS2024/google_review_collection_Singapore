N Y,5,"First time trying The Alley! Defo lived up to its name of being a lifestyle.

Went after dinner at Eco-Botanika, was a + point as it closes at 11pm instead. Great place to hang out w friends.

Drinks were unique and refreshing to end the night on a good note!

Friendly service and pleasing ambience.
