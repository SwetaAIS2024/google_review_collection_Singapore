It make us feel that the waiting time is bearable. Clinic Staffs esp Li Wen and Dr Cheryl Goh are very friendly and approachable. Her smiling face put a smile on my face too. It make me feel comfortable. Enjoyed interacting with them. High recommendation for this outlet for any tooth related issue. I will definitely make this outlet as my first choice. There is a reason why they deserve a five star rating. The whole experience is a smoothing and excellent.",
