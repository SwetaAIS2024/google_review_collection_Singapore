      "text": "My 3 just turned 4 year old daughter has shown interest and excitement to attend her weekend classes. She even once said she prefers her madrasah class than her gymnastics class. As for progress, she often recounts back what she has learnt by reminding us to exhibit good traits and habits she picked up in class in terms of fiqh. Her ability to memorize surahs and recite them in the car, at home or in public has left her parents and many others impressed. Her parents are also very proud of her achievements in class as the ‘crowned’ winner and hope to see her to flourish and grow  in LQK. Thank you to the dedicated and loving teachers in LQK block 462.",
