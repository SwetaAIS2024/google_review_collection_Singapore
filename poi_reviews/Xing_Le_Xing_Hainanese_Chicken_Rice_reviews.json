They have double boiled soups on their menu as well. The family had tried their food and they were good by general standard. The stall is located right at the corner of the coffee shop. Prices are economical and reasonable.",

The succulent chicken, paired with fragrant rice and a delightful homemade chili, rivals renowned establishments like Boon Tong Kee and Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. This culinary experience deserves a solid 5/5, proving that great flavors can be found beyond the expected favorites.",
