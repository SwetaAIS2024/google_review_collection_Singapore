Muhammad ‚ÄúZhaf‚Äù Zhafran,5,"Tried the nasi lemak with chicken wing. I‚Äôd say its as good or even better than taliwang. Sambal is tasty and not too spicy.

Have yet to try the wagyu nasi lemak.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117800860200313250994/reviews
Elexis X,5,"I feel this place is pretty underrated. I tried the Grilled Wagyu burger, and the patty was super thick, especially for the price. It‚Äôs affordable and really filling. I initially thought about getting nuggets on the side but after the burger, I couldn't even finish the fries that comes along with the burger. Personally, if they used a little less salt will be even better. The staff is really friendly too. Will definitely dropby again to try their Grilled Chicken Chop.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113867634575590993197/reviews
