Bertrand Tan,1,"Lousy service. Bought a wedding car decor set from him, but the mesh cloth was missing the first round, then after going back to get it, he gave a shorter than usual length. Bad service, watch out. Was extremely rude when we called him to ask him to sell us extra mesh, saying that his shop is closed for the next few days",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104389513103627464832/reviews
