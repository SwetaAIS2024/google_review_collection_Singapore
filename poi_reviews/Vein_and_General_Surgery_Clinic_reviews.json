      "text": "My friend's mom recommended us to Dr Sanjay before, then as my mom has similar problem about varicose vein, I brought my mom to meet Dr Sanjay, my mom was so happy with Dr Sanjay's patience, caring and very approachable manner.  Dr Sanjay really tried to understand my mom's concern and make her comfortable during the process. My family came from Indonesia to here for the treatment, and my mom felt glad to be able to meet Dr Sanjay as Dr can also speak in many languages from Bahasa, Chinese and English. Although, we haven't proceeded with any necessary operation yet, Dr Sanjay understand and let us think thoroughly first. From the start of making appointment, his assistant, May was also very helpful in arranging, understanding and answering all my queries. Thank you Dr Sanjay & May for giving us such a good experience.",
