Lots of food outlets to feast on.\nAnd E!Hub was great with everything you need, from f&b outlets, japanese supermarket, electronic to gadget stores, hairdressers to manicure/pedicure services. There's live entertainment and the cleaners always on standby to do their cleaning job.\nIts was a wonderful weekend outing for the family...",
