Kenric Koh,5,"One of the rare places where there are options of both types of soup for bak kut teh: pepper and herbal (Malaysian).
They don't mention it on their menu but it's possible to mix and match the items you want e.g. Stomach + tail.
Pity they don't offer you tiao anymore.
Flavourful, rich soup. The stomach slices were generous and nicely cooked. Not rubbery at all.
Tail was also very well done.
Will come again!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106831284731037635165/reviews
