The walkway passages were extremely narrow and there were also people blocking the way trying to sell insurance, credit cards and so on. There were many food and beverage outlets and other retail stores.  Overall it was a very unpleasant and stressful experience.",

Just above Kovan mrt it is easily accessible! Toilets are located at level 3 for guys. Toilets for ladies are located at both level 2 and level 3. Toilets at ground level need payment for entry. For a small mall this place has lots of shops especially eateries!",
