      "text": "Surprisingly I enjoyed my visit a lot more this year. Special mention to the Loh Hei and Coffee Pork! It’s amazingly my absolute favourite! Can’t find elsewhere where they can make it better. Size of Lou hei could be bigger as it was barely enough for 8 pax, but the taste was oh so on point! Also the coffee pork is well seasoned and oh so umami without being too overpowering. The other dishes are fine and slight above average. Only gripe is the that cereal prawns was served with frozen prawns, the texture is very bouncy for some reason and not in a good way. Hopefully they can opt to get better quality prawns as it’s not exactly affordable to dine here in the first place haha",
