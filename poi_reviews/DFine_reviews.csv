Elaine Li,5,"D’Fine catered my wedding, providing both a beautiful breakfast for the bridal party and a delicious lunch reception. Their team was prompt, incredibly accommodating, and made planning a breeze by helping us craft the perfect menu. Set-up and tear-down were seamless, and the food was phenomenal—so much so that guests were eager to take home leftovers! The vegetarian bee hoon and spring rolls were a morning favorite (even more delicious reheated in the air fryer the next day), and the cereal fish fillet and seafood noodles at lunch were a huge hit. The sambal was especially memorable! I’m beyond grateful to the D’Fine team for helping the day run so smoothly and making it unforgettable. Thank you!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116430029874969556798/reviews
Gary Tay,5,"We recently ordered a wonderful dinner from D'Fine to celebrate our daughter's 5th birthday, and the experience was exceptional! Although we could only confirm attendance close to the celebration date, we placed our order just two days before the event, and D'Fine handled everything seamlessly.

Victoria reached out shortly after I ordered, and after learning it was for a birthday celebration, she thoughtfully recommended dishes that would suit guests of all ages. Her suggestions were spot-on, and everyone at the party loved the food.

The dishes were flavorful, even though we chose healthier options! D'Fine truly made the evening special with their fantastic food and attentive service. Highly recommended!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110237828742391079728/reviews

emilene tan,1,"Very lousy web ordering system and customer service. I ordered at their available date and timeslot and got a order number.  Called 1 day before event then i was informed the following:
1. they did not receive my order!
2. There was also no slot in the first place!
3. What i saw as 'available' in the website was only 'my request'!
4. ""You must read carefully! we got say if no email confirmation means not confirm!""
Therefore, order from this place at your own risk.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109589384459616499430/reviews
