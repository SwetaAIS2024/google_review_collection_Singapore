Jasper koh,5,"Dine in here for the very first time today and the customer service is surprising very good.

Not your professional kinda customer service but the staff here gives off a ‚Äúmy next door neighbour friendly vibes‚Äù which is very comforting.

We got the lychee & strawberry jelly hearts & rainbow cake.
I still think the Strawberry jelly hearts is the best item.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103969433559486829987/reviews
M. Chen,5,"Called up a few outlets in the east before the friendly service crew, Alisah, picked up my call. Glad to know that the Multi Layer Rainbow was available.

Everyone at the party was commenting how pretty and yummy the cakes are. It is a good mixed of jelly and cheesecake, most importantly it is not too sweet. I ended up eating 3 pieces.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117219980570993006062/reviews

Mel Ramly,5,"A chic cafe not only for your caffeine fix but also desserts such as their famous Tangy Mango or Luscious Lychee Cheesecake! They also have savoury desserts for non sweet tooth cafe hoppers. We were served by their friendly staff, Ms Alisah, who was willing to give us recommendations. Thank you so much.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115114955176217947085/reviews
