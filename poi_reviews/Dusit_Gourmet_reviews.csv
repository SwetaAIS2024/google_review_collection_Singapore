SK Lim,5,"Was introduced to this place by a friend. Was pleasantly surprised - great ambience and truly a hidden gem. Good service and big array of food. Understandably whilst they don’t display loads of food out, they’ll happily replenish or provide when you ask as there’s always a staff behind each international food section. Also, with so much food wastage going on - I think it’s a more responsible way of serving. Staff are super efficient (clearing used plates), refilling water and friendly. The dessert selection is huge; tea too. Admittedly we did not succeed to try everything as we were too full to do so.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107309196184213009530/reviews
Kaptain Kerr,4,"This is the small shop in the lobby of the Dusit Thani Laguna, selling mostly cakes and a few other treats which you can enjoy as part of your stay. Also sells some drinks for takeaway. The shop is quite small so not a large selection, but still a few items if needed. Located next to the Greenhouse restaurant.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111145456892345385117/reviews
