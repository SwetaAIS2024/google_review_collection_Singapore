Esther Puar,3,"Heard from sister that the fish soup is nice so came here to give it a try. Indeed always a queue and longer queue line build up near and during lunch hours. Personal opinion, the fish soup is acceptable and slightly above average. However deep fried fish not so crispy and may be due to soak in soup. Would like to order separately if I come again. Also ordered the Hobkirk fried noodle cuz seems not bad, keep having people coming to order for takeaways. Personal opinion (again), there is too much beansprouts for a plate of fried noodle, but the wok hey smell and taste is definitely üëç. There's also pork lard too! If I come again, shall special order a plate without beansprouts.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115922737811766603880/reviews
BT,3,"$1.90 for Ayataka green tea (2024 April) when aircon foodcourt is charging less than them.

Otherwise, the place is clean, airy, bright. Food options have since change of hands but still decent. Good alternative if you do not wish to squeeze in the ever-crowded hawker nearby.

Not a big issue but still, I think it is unjust to be charging $1.90 for can drink (price comparison to other operators).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116600642017526132937/reviews
