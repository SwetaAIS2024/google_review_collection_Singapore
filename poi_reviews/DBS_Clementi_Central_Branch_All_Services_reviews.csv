Linda Maida - Koh,1,"Bank fails to assign more staff to a branch in an old heartland that caters many services. Most customers are above 60s and do not have a smartphone or not digitally savvy. They are shorthanded because each request from an old person needs time.

Wee Sun Tan,1,"Very disappointing experience with DBS. Teller took in my cash and did not deposit into my account.  Try to followup with branch and hotline.  Waited 2 hour and Request me to put up a claim and wait for 9-15days on investigation, if they found the cash will deposit into account and if not will ask for more evidence.

A big bank making a mistake and take customer for granted without wanting to address issue on the ground.
