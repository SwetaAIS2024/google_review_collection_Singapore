The taste is generally good, but lately, I've noticed the portions are getting smaller, which is a bit disappointing.\n\nAnother thing I wasn’t happy about was that the nasi lemak now comes prepacked, and worst of all, there was no sambal included.When my helper went back to ask for sambal, the aunty assumed she had already put it in the bag and said that my helper was just trying to get more sambal. Its so frustrating.It's such an important part of the dish, and not having it really affected the whole thing\n\nI hope the shop can take this feedback into account and return to the quality and portion sizes that made it great in the past.",

FIRST Time customer and definitely the LAST Time Customer at this stall.\n\n2 very RUDE & impatient ladies, my 81 year-old Chinese mother craved for Muslim food, so I accompanied her to order.\n\nMy mom asked for the Chili gravy form the cuttlefish, but the impatient lady just took a piece of cuttlefish and whacked on the plate.  She went on to add tiny portion of peanuts and anchovies and charged $5.\n\nI wanted to ask her where was the egg (if this is nasi lemak set U were charging me) if you added peanuts and anchovies but she was already making noise behind her mask. I lost my Cool and told them both be patient lah! If you work in the F&B and have such an attitude, good luck!\n\nI was reading the reviews and realised we are not the only ONE.\nNasi Lemak, Fried Chicken, Peanuts, Anchovies & Cuttlefish for $5. (See picture}",

      "text": "Generous portion of rice for the Nasi Lemak. I think the sambal needs more flavour and spice to it. The rice was also a bit lighter than how I would like it, maybe more coconut milk and salt will kick it up a notch. Overall, I think it’s just average for the dish that I ordered, but I’m willing to give the stall another try in the future.",
