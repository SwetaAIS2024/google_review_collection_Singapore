      "text": "After reading countless negative recent reviews, i am quite delighted that I have quite a decent experience overall.\n\nThis is my first visit on this shop, so I will not know how good it is previously.\n\nAnyways, while i agreed that the price is slightly costly, the experience do matter. The food is cooked in front of you and the chef will do the allocations.\n\nMy portion of squid and beef is rather decent, with lots of vegetable too. Personally, it is abit spicy and the squid is frozen, so it does not taste as good. Beef is not bad tho.\n\nHowever, the soup is too cold, tasted horrible. The rice is also subpar (a lazy homecook rice will be like this)\n\nOverall, we are contented eating. A one time experience would be fine.",

      "text": "It has been a while since my last visit, and I noticed that their prices have increased significantly, and the menu has also changed.\n\nI ordered their Set C combo. The overall food quality hasn’t changed much—it’s the standard teppanyaki.\n\nIt seems like they now have more teppanyaki chefs, and the female chef I wasn’t too fond of is no longer there. (This is based on my subjective impression that she tended to allocate smaller portions compared to the other chefs, possibly to serve more customers in fewer rounds of cooking.) With her absence, I found the experience more satisfying.\n\nHowever, there are two areas I hope they can improve: first, the texture of their steamed rice is too hard, likely due to insufficient water used when cooking. Second, I wish they would offer sugar-free canned drinks.\nOverall, I’m quite satisfied with my visit.",

      "text": "Express Teppanyaki, my go-to spot for Taiwanese-style teppanyaki, has taken a hit lately. The food quality has gone downhill, and prices have skyrocketed.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, they now need to certify their food as halal, which means they can’t use certain ingredients like rice wine or non-halal sauces. That’s a big change, and it’s definitely affected the taste of the dishes.\n\nOh, and the best part? They don’t even have pork as a protein option anymore. That’s a huge bummer for all you pork lovers out there.",

The steak was overcooked and VERY tough— we couldn’t finish it because our teeth and jaw hurt from chewing so much. To make matters worse, the rice was undercooked.\n\nAdditionally, the cashier was rude and rushed us to place our order, seemingly so she could return to watching shows on her phone.",

And when there were a portion of beansprouts left, he topped up to a table that was given more share rather than mine that were very little.",
