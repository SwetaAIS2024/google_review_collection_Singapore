Jonathan Goh,3,"Came for lunch one day to try it out.

Carrot cake was interesting and a little spicy.
Pandan char Siew Bao is the best of the lot. Portion is good and fragrant and crispy.
XLB is also quite good.
The char Siew rice roll is the one that irked me honestly.
For everything except the Bao, the portion size is just sad.
Everything is made so small and the rice roll really took the cake. The picture shows how small it is. It’s so thin it can barely stack on each other and it’s practically transparent.

Don’t get me wrong. The food is decent. It’s just the price portion ratio that needs work.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110102844324205858222/reviews
Patrick Lau,3,"It was a breeze for us to book a table online for brunch on a PH for 5, less than 24hrs before the meal

Please feels new and ceiling is high.  Space is pretty limited but we were lucky to be allocated a corner table where the kids have more space to goof around while having lunch

Service was spontaneous and friendly.  Alas, we still feel they are understaffed although we can see the team doing their best

Food wise, more hits than misses.  There are quite a few misses.  The Pandan Char Siew baked buns was a let down.

Overall, experience was not bad.  Only last peeve was car park was expensive for this location - $4 plus for less than an hour!

Might not be back again",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106881591692184457438/reviews
Ellia Tio,4,"Came for lunch with family
Great variety of dim sum
I enjoyed the pan fried yam cakes
The food comes rather staggered eg. The beans came rather late relative to the dim sum

The pandan pork buns are flavourful and aromatic. Strong pandan smell. Delicious pork. 10/10",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107375555291136569164/reviews
Shannen C,5,"Tried this place for the first time at friend's recommendation, and didn't regret our choice! It is located at HomeTeamNS Bedok Reservoir. We were ushered to our table by a friendly male staff, and we didn't wait long for our food. Food was really nice, and not too expensive as well. Worth a visit if you are in the neighbourhood.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104333995766460405826/reviews
