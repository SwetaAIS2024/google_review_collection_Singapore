James,1,"Went for their furniture sale, the absolute Worst experience dealing with this BD manager Doris Lim.
- Quoted one price before walking around and when deciding to give payment, she jacked up the price. When confronted, she say give wrong price and after probing, she say we wasting her time when she could be doing her work.
-Not a one time moment as she decided to tried to pull another stunt on me again for a chair with 65% markup from quote.
(Just Imagine what she can do to you if you find her to do interior design)
-Its a sale but when negotiation about price take place, she refuse to lower any price.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101208347131461312754/reviews
