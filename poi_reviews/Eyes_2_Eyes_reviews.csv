Eric Lee,5,"Bought 3 pairs Ray Ban sunglasses from Eyes2Eyes @ Downtown East Mall. I requested for Delivery since all 3 pairs required stock in by placing orders. MySha and Sabrina, both very attentive and helpful with my purchase choicesâ€¦ comes with generous discount too. Appreciate both for putting in much effort to expedite delivery to reach next week on my children birthdays. Amazingly the delivery parcel reached on their birthday.
