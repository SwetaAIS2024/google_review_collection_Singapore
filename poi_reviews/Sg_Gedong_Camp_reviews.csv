divian nair,5,"Sungei Gedong is great!! Loved the feeling of being away from the rest of human civilisation!

Accommodation is not posh but sufficient if freedom is meaningless to you.

Loved my nervous brisk walks into this resort :) The adorable wild dogs along the path were a wonderful and inspiring reminder to keep fit.

If youâ€™re looking for more solitude in your life, Concierge service will surely provide confinement services. Two weekends? 8 weekends? No problem. Just sign extra.

Quite a romantic place. *french accent* Once amour always amour...",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101845851758464675556/reviews
Eugene Tan,5,"Halcyon, idyllic, bucolic.

Brimming with an abundance of wildlife, this nature resort affords a scenic getaway from the metropolitan cityscapes depicted in Crazy Rich Asians.

Absolutely worth the long drive to the west end of Singapore. Recommended stay in the resort is 24 months.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109307041662143750951/reviews
FI E,5,"Love this place! Sungai gedong offers 24 hours friendly concierge and security services. It a great place to stay beside the exquisite phenomena of the physical world with varieties of plants and bird chirping before sun rise.. Wild cute dogs can be heard barking with the synchronise melody of the winds. At night, its a place where star gazers would set up perfect camping spot.

For new comers, is best to stay during the weekends where there are plenty of rooms. No regrets staying here for vacation. Will definitely visit this place again the year after.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110900148128914024131/reviews
Bryan Leow,5,"Truly a world-class resort in a calibre of its own, Gedong will always seek to surprise you with what it can offer. From the artistic renditions of white plaster peeling off the walls and ceilings to the fresh nightly aroma of defecation that waft the resort at night, Gedong is a feast for the senses. The open-air restaurant comes alive with their groundbreaking integrated petting zoo experience, allowing you to pet wild dogs, cats and boars whilst you enjoy your meal of exotic delicacies - the cuboidal shaped poultry products being a favourite among guests and a must-try for anyone visiting. With such great accomodation it's no surprise then that most lodgers choose to stay on for 22 months.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113728956991102215502/reviews
lion doge,5,"Was fortunate enough to spend 15 months here, starting out as a trainee before being promoted to a managerial position in one of the companies in this establishment.

Housing is free but be prepared to share a room and communal bathroom with more than 10 other people. Meals are also provided and the menu is updated regularly (the pork cubes are to die for). Physical training is also free and you get to be exposed to a variety of training regimes at different locations including Singapore's finest forests.

10/10 would recommend. I still pay a visit once a year.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101774999501731301455/reviews
