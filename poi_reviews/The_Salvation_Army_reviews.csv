Xin Hao,5,Easy to locate at the corner of a busy street along Bishan and Sin Ming road. Hard to miss. Regular donor of my items at the back within their tent setup. Please do remember to categorize your items beforehand and place them in the allocated red boxes accordingly to avoid extra hard work by the volunteers later on. There’s a small parking area just at the tent but it’s mainly for unloading of items and can get jammed up sometimes. Area is also under CCTV surveillance for extra security. Not too convenient for MRT commuters as it’s pretty far from either Bishan or AMK station. Have to take a bus and walk slightly. Best if you can do private transport especially if you have bulky items. I believe it’s opened 24/7 for donations as it is essentially an open area.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101038177603319548234/reviews
Jay Jay,5,"To all fellow patrons, here's a guide on the categories of items for donation for your segregation before arriving ☺️ alternatively do bring extra bags for segregation! to reduce the tendency of containers being filled up with wrongly categorized items and easing the work load of  those dealing with the donated items

•toys/bags/shoes
•clothings
• fragile & electrical

(no furniture or bulky items)",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108319217561772518352/reviews
TCH,4,"Besides being a Church, A Donation Centre etc; it also houses a fully equipped Park Tool Set-Up bicycle repair facility too!

The in house Bike Mechanic is Andrew who has experience in Bicycle Build up and repair services!

Do more he is not there on a daily basis as he also runs errands to customers place on request for bike services too!

OlyLife,5,"Frequently in neat and tidy conditions. Perhaps need to plant a staff there to educate donors to not go put their moldy and filthy condition stuffs there in hopes of helping someone else with their crap. It’s heartbreaking to see people actually believing that they are helping the society with their trash sometimes. Mold bugs, bedbugs and many.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118261851637784442534/reviews
Karyn Ong,5,"Great place to drop off donations anytime, any day! It’s not gated, right next to the HDB carpark.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113097295712985188390/reviews
