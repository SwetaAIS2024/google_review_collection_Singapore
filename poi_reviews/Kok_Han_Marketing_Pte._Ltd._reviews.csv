Gucci,1,"Products arrived in poor condition which should have been a red flag given similar poor reviews. I asked politely if I could visit their warehouse to exchange and top-up with some cash, and was told the accounts have “closed” and it was too late. Well I only purchased the items a couple of weeks ago and we were still in the same month. I tried to reason with the young chap who said he was in charge but I could speak to the boss because he set the no-exchange, no-refund policy 30 years ago however boss comes in and out anytime he wants. Such arrogance. I figured the man to whom I was speaking was the boss’ son which he admitted. Such an “Ah Sia Kia” who drives a light blue BMW using his father’s cash and will probably run the business into the ground. In the future I will plan earlier and buy products from China. At the very least, I would not have to pay so much and deal with such poor attitude from an ungrateful, second-rated second generation business owner.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100847726353251001199/reviews
