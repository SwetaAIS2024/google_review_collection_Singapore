They ‚Äúcook‚Äù for you but more like putting as much meat as possible in the grill. Side dish ok, soup and cheese pizza are not tasty. Overall not bad but there are definitely better Korean bbq at same price level along the same street. Will not revisit.",

Though the pork belly portion of looked small, 2 players was enough for 2 of us girls to get full.\n\nService is good, our server cooked and served all out meat. Free side dishes - 5 plates. The ssamjang (spicy sauce) wasn't spicy at all though.\n\nPricey plates of pork $25 each. And there's tax + service charge added in Singapore so it'll end up being even more than you thought.\n\nShould you go here? Yeah good late night Korean spot especially after drinking.",

But only the meats are refillable, the kimchi pancake, chicken, egg etc is just one-off. The fried chicken was tasteless, I will avoid getting it next time.\n\nThe male staff were quite cold and unfriendly but there's this woman who was quite nice.\n\nYou can also get a small yogurt drink like Yakult after the meal. I will come back again.",
