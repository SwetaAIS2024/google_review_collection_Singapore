Buren,3,"Huge pao, take away only.
Located in front side of People Park Complex, a very crowded and messy area with many stall food.

The paos are mostly covered under the fabric, which is good, although I thought it's not opened. Service is okay, just straight to the point, no pleasantry, broken language.

The pao though, very soulless.  Bland, tastes like nothing, bun tastes like a bleak future in dystopian novel. There is no enjoyment at all in eating this pao.

It's filling tho. I give you that. I believe it costs $2-2.5/3? I tried the pork one.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103975090698079167241/reviews
Ant Tan (Ant),4,The fried bun with red bean paste pastry (red bean paste pancake) was pretty good overall. The only downside was that the bottom part turned out a bit dry when there wasnâ€™t enough red bean (tou sau) filling.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116001171041763971352/reviews
Leila W,5,"Had their spinach mushroom chicken bun and the carrot egg rice vermicelli bun, and both were delicious. The carrot egg bun was esp huge and value for money. Service was quick and the buns were served hot and fresh. Would recommend!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105725213570739633496/reviews
N T,2,"Pumpkin steamed cake - 2 stars
Even though it was covered with a cloth it was so dry and had hardly any dried fruit.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103165559486640653412/reviews
Di Di,4,The meat filling is tender but I found it too be really salty. It is huge and thus filling. I was hoping to get the pan fried one instead but it was not ready at 8am. Bun is served hot.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews
