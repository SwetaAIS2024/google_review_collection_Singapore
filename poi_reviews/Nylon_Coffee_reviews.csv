Ivy,4,"The barista is friendly and helps you choose a coffee based on your preferences, even explaining how to taste it in a way that enhances the flavor. The coffee itself is excellent. However, the shop is quite small and often extremely crowded, which makes it hard to relax and fully enjoy the experience.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104142190637013063889/reviews
Yen Liew,4,"The café is located inside a Singapore flat. You have to walk through a narrow path, and then a small, open green garden comes into sight, with the café on the left.

Though ，the café is small,  the outdoor area is decorated with lots of plants, so you can sit at the outside area to enjoy the 'green' decor.

We ordered 2 Iced Long Black , and it's the best Long Black I've had in the past five years. It has a bright , clear fruity taste with just a hint of bitterness— very refreshing drink after walking under the sun.

The staff are very friendly and make you feel welcome!

vivien wong,4,"Been here few times . Best is their hot white , perfect extraction with nice aroma. Ice coffee  a bit diluted after the ice. Maybe less ice cubes if u want order ice coffee. Very crowded cafe and always long Q , location not so easy to find under a local flat Apartment . Multi storey Public car park  available. Price is value for money.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102601960120430745688/reviews
Niteesh M.,5,"One of my favourite neighbourhood coffee spots. Nylon never disappoints. There’s usually a long wait, but it’s totally worth it—especially for the iced batch brew. It’s light, crisp, and incredibly refreshing, best enjoyed on the spot. The staff know their craft, and the quality is consistently top-notch. If you’re a coffee lover, this place is a gem.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110117796641376580021/reviews
J Teo,5,"Rather hole-in-the-wall coffee place under a HDB block but still rather easy to find and walking distance from the MRT. Not a place to work but to enjoy coffee and chat with your friends as there isn't much seating.

Great coffee and friendly staff that helped with recommendation for filter coffee as well!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107621325697330797013/reviews
