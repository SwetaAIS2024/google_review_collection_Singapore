Cassia A,4,"Very very busy from 11:30-1pm. Lots of options. They have a vegetarian stall. If you’re looking for a healthier option, I’d recommend the Korean or mixed vegetable rice. I like the kimchi soup and bibimbap.
Across the hall there’s more options like Vietnamese and Indian and it’s less busy. But the Vietnamese is not good.
The drinks line is always long. They have lots of little fried dim sum items.
There’s also dessert / milk tea here now for a good price.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117662481746295955146/reviews
lontongstroong,3,"So glad they finally moved the claypot rice stall to the main dining hall. By far the standout among stalls in this cafeteria. Been treating myself countless Friday evening dinners after a whole week of hard work with the consistently tasty herbal claypot rice soups.

Other notable meal is from the new Taiwanese stall which offers more variety compared to its predecessor (also of Taiwanese food). Not only sells typical large breaded fried chicken, but also braised meat, Taiwanese sausage, and even filled guo bao (a relatively rare treat here in SG). The portion is generally somewhat smaller though. The Xi'an noodle stall is also pretty good as well.

Most other stalls tend to be overpriced for their quality of their offerings though (common problem among Koufu stalls) - the mediocre cai fan with $6++ one-meat-one-veg being the most notorious offender. The drink and dessert stall are okay though although not so special.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews
Seah Jia Hui,3,"Everything is overpriced and tastes bad here. Just skip the stalls in the main building and go to the other building to eat the claypot (best), Vietnam or Indian store. Wouldn’t say they are very good also but the rest of the food is so bad in comparison. Just walk 15 mins to NIE for affordable and nicer food if you have time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109933240025657790273/reviews
Wei Ming Chen,3,"Mixed-veg rice (2 ⭐) : very pricey compared to other other Mixed-veg stall (so-called cai fan).

Mini Wok (4⭐) : Lots of fish cutlet but sambal taste was not so good. Price and portion was OK.

Vegetarian rice (5⭐) : queue was long during lunch time but they serve food pretty fast. Overall food and price were good.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101609798020277519000/reviews
I Kao,3,"Mixed rice stall charged me $6.30 for cauliflower, peanuts and a slice of pork. Pity the students. ... Cauliflower tasted sourish by the way.

Drinks store is fairly priced.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112257003482828879834/reviews
