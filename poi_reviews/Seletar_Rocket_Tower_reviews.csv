Voidfocal,5,"I've shot many outdoor wedding sessions here and it never fails to deliver. This location is incredibly rich with compositional possibilities and different backdrops. The rocket tower itself is obvious, however there's also a hidden road that goes into the dense canopy behind the tower that is equally good for photos in my opinion. Sunset here is gorgeous and you get a combination of greenery, architecture, sky and water. What more could a photographer (or couple) ask for :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104877596206641040127/reviews

Forest BK,5,"ðŸš€Perhaps the most iconic landmark at Upper Seletar Reservior is the Rocket Tower.
ðŸš€This 18m tall (6 storey high) Rocket Tower was built in 1969. The same year NASA's Apollo 11 landed on moon.
ðŸš€A spiral staircase leads up to the top where a balcony let you have a panoramic view of park and reservior. ðŸ›¸ðŸª‚ðŸš€",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Ursa Major,5,"This 18 metre tower with a circular stairway which leads to a observation platform at the top, is an iconic landmark of the area, and here are some fun facts about it:

The tower was completed in 1969, which was the same year that humans first landed on the moon. The rocket design reflects the excitement of that era.

The tower was officially opened by Princess Alexandra of Great Britain on 10 August 1969, along with Upper Seletar Reservoir.

I personally love the design of the tower because of the nostalgia of the Space Age era it brings to me.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108566816051365753123/reviews
zhijie26ify,5,"When at night for some night walk and exploring. Very peaceful and quiet during weekday night. Still able to see the lake at night and the overview of this area on top of the rocket tower. The rocket tower is about a 2 to 3 minutes climb up (about 5 to 6 stories). Star gazing might be possible on top of the tower but due to the white light on the tower roof, might interfere with what you see.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114131182227398871229/reviews
