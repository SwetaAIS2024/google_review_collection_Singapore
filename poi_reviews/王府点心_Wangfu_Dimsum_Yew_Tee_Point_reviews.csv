Eileen L,5,"Food is good! The shrimp is big and nice filling for all the buns. Only thing is the noodles can be more. The staff is very friendly as well. The sitting area is convenient as well but there’s houseflies flying around. That’s the only downside.
Come try!!!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115254654333700999662/reviews
Aggie Ling,5,This is my third time at Wangfu and as per previous times I really love their shengjianbaos (super consistent among my visits) - so juicy and hot when served :”) worth the calories!! The other dumplings paled in comparison cos the shengjianbao is so goooood. Also shoutout to the scallion noodles super flavourful!,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110795691036396391225/reviews
Derpster Teh,4,"Great noodles , great pan fried buns. Ordered Set A with Shanghai spicy noodles. Good value .

Must try the pan fried buns if buying from this store

Side dish is bad though",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117777162038045274845/reviews
Elyna Wildchild,2,"Kinda disappointed at the size of the buns. Would you pay $29.20 for 12 pan fried bun? I thought I could share with 6pax given that the display looks like those you can get from paradise dynasty’s 生煎包. But it seems to me now that only me and my husband would gobble down because we are too embarrassed to give my parents & brothers.

When I am at the shop front, the staffs are sloppy and takes time to attend to you.

No doubt the buns were small, it did justify itself as 暴汁, but the juice is not that abundance. Flavour is ok.

So much for the hype.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101549026290131259735/reviews
H L,5,"Highly recommend all that I’ve had: 原味生煎包 Pan-Fried Pork Soup Bun, 虾仁生煎包 Pan-Fried Shrimp Soup Bun, 招牌小笼包 xiao long bao, 招牌锅贴 Pan-Fried potsticker!! They all have soup in it so be careful! ⚠️⚠️⚠️ the broth is so good and sweet. Skin is thin and there’s a lot of meat! Scallion oil noodles is really good but dries up rlly quickly, would suggest asking for more scallion oil and sauce if u find it too dry!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116709070005010975601/reviews
