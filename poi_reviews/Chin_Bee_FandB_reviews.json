      "text": "I have been eating ee mian more often this week.\nThe zi char stall at Chin Bee F&B at Blk 143 Teck Whye Lane sells one of the best ee mian in the west\n\nThe noodles are thinner than user. Most importantly, the dish is less salty than many stalls and does not give me a weird aftertaste. It's a thriving place to have zi char dinner with friends and family. On a side note, a friend told me i can even ask for less salt in my ee mian",
