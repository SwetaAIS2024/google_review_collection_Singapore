Syafiq R,5,"Ordered delivery for me and my colleagues, food was well packed and organised, food taste was superb and overall it was a good experience. I ordered the cereal chicken fried rice and the cereal with chicken portion was generous, just enough for one persons fill. My colleagues also had other different orders such as the Thai style chicken fried rice, and they had the same good experience. I have yet to visit the stall and I'm sure it will be better. Would definitely buy again when Im looking for something to eat! 5/5 üëçüëç",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103643489836712266704/reviews

Xavier Tan,1,"Ordered the fish head curry for $25, up from $22 previously, the fish head was very small and very little meat and was totally submerged in the curry. Very disappointed with this outlet. Increase price by more than 10% and given such a tiny portion. Take ur money to Ming Kitchen beside which serves better food and portion.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106885978605096751111/reviews
