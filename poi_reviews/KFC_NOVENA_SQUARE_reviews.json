      "text": "I ordered through Pandafood on Friday for 2 pax. When my order arrived, HALF of it was missing — no Zinger, no Cheese Fries. I only received a refund for the missing items, but what about my hunger? I was forced to reorder just to get the food I originally wanted.\n\nOn top of that, I specifically ordered the fried chicken à la carte (which costs more) and clearly requested THIGH ONLY, with the remark “NO BREAST.” And yet — you gave me breast. This is completely unacceptable.\n\nWhy do you think I paid extra for à la carte if you were just going to ignore my request? Why not just force me into a set meal and decide what I eat? Can’t you even READ the customer’s notes? This is inexcusable, careless service. Are you just rushing orders out without any basic checking?",

      "text": "Hi KFC SINGAPORE.\n\nToday evening When I patron the KFC at Novena square. I met a very rude KFC Crew. she was extremely rude to me. I don't like her telling me what to do. When I was about to take and collect my food she said hi take your things sir in a stern voice. As though I don't know like that. I was as taking it so why do you have to take me or take in a rude tone. I don't like being commanded okay so you don't need to tell or teach me what to do.\n\nAfter I told her she is rude then she apologized. But he apology was not sincere. I was already collecting my food of KFC so there's no need for her to tell me in a stern voice take your things sir!!\n\nAnd I realized now that i pressed dine in in the KFC app so she should put it in a tray and not in a plastic bag. she put my food in a plastic bag although I actually ordered is dine in so should not be in a plastic bag. Should be in a tray and not plastic bag. So actually I can counter back to her and tell her in a stern voice to tell the same KFC Crew. hi please take my food from the plastic bag and please it on the tray now thank you.\n\nI even told the manager that your staff is very rude of course I will take I am eating it if I don't take how to eat the food. So is common sense to take so of course I will take so why do you have to tell.me to take as though I don't know I need to take my food?",

I ordered an Original Twister, but instead, they gave me an American Twister. I don't know why most of the time I come here for breakfast is that my orders are wrong. Please do something about this as this can impact service.",
