Raj Arcot,4,"Reasonable place for lunch/dinner in Changi Business area.

The staff were helpful

The indian style food tasted very good. Probably a little spicy for some palate

The service was a bit slow. Maybe because they are popular in the evenings.

The ambience is very average. Sitting outside is good in the evenings with nice cool breeze.

The price is reasonable too. Would recommend this restaurant if one is in Changi Business Park neighborhood",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107568948833790153417/reviews
Dulakshi Ambepitiya,5,"Tasty Indian food with wide variety to select from. I’ve been to Mt. Fabre Safra outlet, food in both the outlets taste almost same. Prices are ok for me. It cost us $26 to have lunch for 2 people. Portions are big enough. Staff is attentive as well.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100103924405322471196/reviews
Fredric John,1,"Ordered fish meals and chicken biriyani through foodpanda ($36). The fish masala meals was stale and old. Disappointing portion of vegetables. One pack of keerain, potato/beans and another potato which is served with poori. Is this what you serve to take out customers ? Why has the food quality deteriorated so bad ? I am sure it’s way better when we dine in. Very bad experience. Never patronising again",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101620343523089855345/reviews
Ryan Loi,5,"Food was good and the staff were friendly, we had a large group of 15 pax and they were happy to accommodate even though it was really a hassle … even had my grandma in wheelchair, so I was much appreciative.

Chris Koh,4,"Tried the North Veg meal and the mutton briyani. Enjoyed the flavours and would come back to some some other dishes.

Staff was pretty attentive and cleared our table quite promptly and also noted we didn’t have cutlery and bring some over quickly.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115255391857475499083/reviews
