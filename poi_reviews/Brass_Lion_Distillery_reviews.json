      "text": "My sisters and I did the Gin Distillery tour and it was fantastic! We got to make our own Singapore Slings and brought them with us for the very educational distillery tour. After which, we had the tasting session with 8 different kinds of gin. Let me just say that we left the Brass Lion in very good cheer ðŸ˜Š. Please make sure you eat carbs before your tour. They serve food at the bar too - you'll need both. Special shout out to Aileen our gin expert who navigated her way through our increasingly boisterous group. YOU ROCK ALIEEN!!!!",

      "text": "Took part in the distillery tour and Singapore sling cocktail making lesson. Both experiences were excellent and fun. So proud of this home grown mirco distillery and to learn how they have grown.\n\nThe instructions to the cocktail lesson from our guide was very clear with hands on chance to make your own Singapore Sling.\n\nOur guide to the distillery tour was very knowledgeable. Her communication style was really clear, friendly and candid. The content of the tour was very interesting.\n\nOverall, plenty of gin tasting opportunity for a Saturday afternoon. So pace yourself nicely ðŸ˜Š",

Aileen (hope i spelt this right) took us through the Sling class which was then followed by the distillery tour and then a 3-flight taster (which ended being 8). Enjoyed the tour presentation and great service! Thank you - recommended!",

Lastly you also get to choose a cocktail of your choice and I chose the boozy hot chocolate which was perfect for the Christmas vibes! Overall I think itâ€™s worth the visit if you are a gin lover:)",
