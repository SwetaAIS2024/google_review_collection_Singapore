      "text": "First visit using a voucher.\nPresented the voucher and noticed the staff‚Äôs smile faded a little, which caught me off guard. I asked if I could choose any drink, and the reply was, ‚Äúit‚Äôs stated on the voucher.‚Äù I later realized the wording could be clearer ‚Äî it says $2 for any drink, any size, but it actually means $2 off rather than the drink costing $2. A small note or clearer phrasing would‚Äôve made things smoother.\n\nTried the matcha frappe, which was very diluted than I expected compared to other brands. I managed to finish about 40% of it, as the rest mostly tasted like ice. Hoping it was just an off day, as I was looking forward to trying their drinks.",

      "text": "This coffee shop stands out from similar establishments, offering a superior coffee experience. I ordered a large iced caffe mocha, tailored to my taste with normal sweetness, whole milk, and no whipped cream. The drink arrived refreshingly cold, with no dilution or melted ice. The aroma was rich and inviting. While the price of $6.50 for a large cup may be slightly steep, the exceptional flavor makes it well worth the cost. There are about 8 seats available for those who want a quick rest",

The coffee opens at 7:30am every morning which is convenient for everyone who working around to have breakfast. The bakery is also excellent.  Cheese brezel is highly recommended with a nice taste and low price.",
