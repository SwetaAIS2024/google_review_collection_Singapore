Keean Chuang,5,"Found TORIMARO as it was open after 9pm when most of the food options were closed/closing.

It has a welcoming environment with warm lighting and Japanese music playing in the background.

Lavin, who served us, was very welcoming and seated us shortly upon arrival. She recommended us the favourites which we ordered, and were surprised !

We thoroughly enjoyed the Chicken Nanban, Cold Soba, Crab Cream Croquettes and not to forget the Tontoro & Chicken Thigh Skeweres. Drinks wise, they serve a fresh Yebisu draft.

Definitely worth a visit if you’re craving some Yakitori (Japanese Skewers & Grill) in the Novena area !",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112918956997609197293/reviews
Kevin Ang,4,Good quality Izakaya food across a wide ranging menu. Prices generally on the high side for the portion sizes but items were well cooked and presented. Atmosphere like an authentic Japanese Izakaya.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111247294128726535324/reviews
Charmaine Tan,5,"Yakitori here is AMAZING. Japan authentic level of amazing. We concluded it was best yakitori the 4 of us have had in Singapore, and really can compete with Japan’s hole in the wall places!! Special yakitori items on menu that are not available elsewhere too

Edamame was amazing. Chicken soup base for somen also super good. Pork charsiew thingy (dont know the name, ?pork loin) was so good we had a second portion!!

Footfall is quite low for dinner in the area, so would highly recommend to come support this business so that they can continue to make amazing skewers!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113734747851653175263/reviews
Moby Tessa,5,"Agree with previous posters abt the good service.  Personable staff who is attentive when required.  They serve the Osaka type of Jap food and the grill is done to perfection.  Especially love the Okra.  The Coriander Salad is amazing in my opinion.  Usually used as a garnish, it’s just more than refreshing to have it as the main of the dish.  Together with the chicken, a choice keto dish.  Sashimi is also thick cut.  The set lunch is also very filling.  Much recommended.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105600039444089414378/reviews
