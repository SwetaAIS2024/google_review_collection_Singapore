Cheng Wei Lee,3,"I came here for a piano accompaniment job as itâ€™s located near the Dunman High School Performing Centre. ðŸŽ¹ Looks very old but cleanly maintained, but I must say itâ€™s not very convenient- nearly 30 min walk to the nearest MRT station (Mountbatten!).",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108548183579664769934/reviews
Elliot Oliver,3,"Now has MRT at Katong Park, so is closer than Mountbatten or Stadium. Very close for Stadium facility and easy bike/walk to East Coast",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100099460404988271026/reviews
Laura Messa,1,"Good Morning
My Son  just came back from a one week stay in this hostel and we have to reconfirm what we've previously read!
It is an obsolete building with great problem in any room.
Bad quality also for the food.
So we fully share all previous reviews related to this bad level.

- [ crush ],1,"Worst hostel ever. Food doesn't taste good and does not allow delivery, will face punishment if found. Some female teacher mentor actively give punishments but doesn't provide help to students. Moping toilets or lobby floor is just one of the many punishments.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104404562619455187679/reviews
Weihan Huang,4,"Living here for 3 years now. Facilities are old, though it had a face-lift in 2020. As such lights and equipment seem to breakdown and need replacements more often.

Understand that the budget is tight due to the pandemic, adminstrators are making the best out of the situation.

Staff and teachers are friendly and helpful.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113145056045919616899/reviews
