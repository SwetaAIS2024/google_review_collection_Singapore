I like the blue pea drink, and the toasted coconut one was lovely as well. Great vibe to the whole place more than anything … a 1970s sort of feel. Definitely worth a visit.",

There were some seats we like but we're only reserved for more guests. So unless you have the number, you can't take the seat. Menu seems interesting at first, but after a couple of drinks, it gets old. Maybe I prefer those where they tell you what are the main ingredients in it. Overall, loved the atmosphere more than the drinks.",
