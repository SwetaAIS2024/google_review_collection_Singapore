The location is great as it‚Äôs in front of the Shoppes of Marina Bay Sands and to the right next to the ArtScience Museum.\n\nThere‚Äôs also a small section all around the pond to sit which ends up filling up in the later parts of the day and on weekends. Overall, worth visiting or passing by especially in the area.",
