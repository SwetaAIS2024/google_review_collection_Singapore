Princess Mania,4,"Ordered the seafood white beehoon which came with 5 lala n 2 prawns, which all seafood esp prawns were super fresh. Broth was good, especially with the fried omelette in gravy, which gave the oomph factor",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107320587807657797918/reviews

Julian Lim,4,"Overall good dishes - had the steamboat, prawn cake, lemongrass pork. All were not bad with the fav being the pork.
Went during Sun dinner - seating is a mix of outdoor and inside the plaza. Service wasn't great - took quite a while and had to ask for our rice like 3x. But would go back again to try the other food on the menu",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108136755428298255657/reviews
LP Pua,5,"We had eaten at their Yishun branch before and it was good. We expected this branch to deliver a similar standard, and it did not disappoint. The Signature Lemongrass Pork is a must-have dish for us. The Garlic Baby Kailan was fresh and green. The Signature Minced Meat Beancurd was different from their Yishun branch (if my memory serves me correctly) but good nevertheless. The price is reasonable for the food quality and service. Recommended.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
YY,5,"Really good and flavourful fish slice beehoon!

While pricey at $9.80 for that plate, the fish slices were huge and thick - can taste and bite into it substantially.

The broth was flavourful largely due to the addition of pork lard, in fact it‚Äôs one of the best I had!

Definitely will return for their signature dish again in future, and potentially their other dishes too üëçüèª",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
