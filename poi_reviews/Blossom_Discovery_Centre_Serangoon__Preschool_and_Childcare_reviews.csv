Guillaume de Penanster,5,"Blossom Discovery Center is a fantastic neighbourhood day care center. We had our daughter there for 2 years (K1 & K2), she has been very happy and we are now confident she has built some strong foundations to enter Primary school.
Teachers and staff are all very kind and take great care of all the children, they really put their heart into their job.
Classes are small (8 kids this year in K2) which gives a lot of attention to every single child. A lot of outings and optional activities too all year long.
Special thanks to Mrs Khoo, Teacher Remah and Zheng Lao Shui :)",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111651125221855973257/reviews
Kelvin Tim,5,"The experience we had with Blossom Discovery Centre have been fantastic and satisfying.

Mr Lawrence, Principle Chen and their team of teachers are truly inspiring and dedicated towards the children's welfare and learning journey. I am appreciative of the fact that the Principal and teachers work with the parents to help address any learning gaps or issues to maximise the growth of my children.

The principal and teachers are truly patient with all children, tailoring learning to the children's pace of learning. My children enjoyed their time at BDC and loved the teachers. The teachers and aunties knew all the children, and the small teacher:children class ratio made learning even more favourable.

School environment is also fantastic,  with a good curriculum blended with a good mix of enrichment activities for the children.

Definitely a recommendation for any parent who is looking out for a childcare centre in this area. The dedication and passion of the teachers in the school is a real asset.

Thank you for all that you do.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115223211501509926829/reviews

nrfzhy1920 (fiz),5,We had a difficult situation with our son's previous school as he was unable to adapt even after 2months of school. We decided to enrol him to BD in May after Mr Lawrence's  very clear and indepth intro to BD. We're pleasantly surprised that he was able to adapt quickly. Teacher Aby and Meishan Laoshi have always been keeping us updated on his health and progress. We are glad to have teachers and school environment that is very warmly welcoming and encourage active participation for parents and students. Kudos BD!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101155559174149367697/reviews
