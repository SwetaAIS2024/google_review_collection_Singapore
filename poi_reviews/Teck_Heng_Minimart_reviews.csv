Robin Kapoor,1,"This is the most disgraceful place I have ever been in my life. The old uncle and aunty running this place are a disgrace to the Society. They scream and shout at old women ( my grandmother) . The other day, my wife went to buy a soda and picked up 1. However she remembered that she needs to buy a set. So she went to the fridge to put back the original one. When she was going out again, the old lady at the counter shouted at my wife and told her sarcastically to keep the original soda on the counter before going to the fridge. My wife queried on why the rudeness. Then her husband immediately asked her to get out of the shop.

They used vulgar words in front of my little child and acted as completely irresponsible towards her customers.

If given an opportunity, I would vouch for this disgrace to the society to be shut for good",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100385387593668574462/reviews
