Lydia Wen,4,"Rooms
-You might want to check the water temperature at R1420. I experienced the water temperature switched from cold to hot, and from hot to cold several times when I showered.
-Love how the hotel provides water dispenser in the room.
-Can tell the hotel room are renovated recently (still have the newly smell)
-Love the layout and the design of the room. Super spacious

Staff
-Friendly staff overall. We booked 2 rooms (family + deluxe king), the first FD staff told us they could not arrange both rooms at the same floor in the beginning due to high occupancy but the other FD staff assisted us to arranged both rooms at the same floor, super helpful!

Food
-Definitely not a ""5-star level"" breakfast. Could have more choices if the hotel considers itself as a ""5-star"" hotel. The breakfast could only count as ""continental breakfast"" but with ""few hot dishes provided"". I have stayed at other 5 star hotels in SG and I can tell the breakfast choices of a 5-star hotel could be more than this.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100988662561802148296/reviews
salla kleme,5,"Pros: Great hotel, loved the room! It felt very clean, modern and spacious. We had to do some work remotely and there was plenty of room for two of us to work in the hotel room. Breakfast was good, but avoid going on the busy hours. Great location, many restaurants and cafes near by.

Cons:
I wish the reception was located better - now it feels like it’s blocking the way
Gym needs a renovation- perhaps this is already being planned(?)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110539355713160636638/reviews
Abdurhmn Alageeli,5,"We had a wonderful stay at Amara Singapore. The location is perfect—close to Tanjong Pagar MRT and lots of food and shopping options. The staff were friendly and attentive, and room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. Great facilities. Definitely recommend for leisure stays with family.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105030325960615558956/reviews
MeiMei Merry,4,"Since I checked in late, I ordered room service.🍴🥪

The fridge was empty, so I ordered mineral water, but there was no bottle opener, which was a problem.

I later realized that the water was provided by a built-in water purifier installed next to the sink.

I would have preferred it if there had been clearer signs. Both the breakfast and room service were delicious.

The hotel was within walking distance of Chinatown, close to the station, and close to the shopping district where locals frequent, so the location was great.🌈🌿🕊️🕊️🕊️",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113551751353609414190/reviews
Eric Barthe,2,"The hotel is clean and modern. The rooms are rather large and equipments in the room are quite basic.
But more importantly the staff is extremely unefficient. Nobody comes and helps you with the luggage when you arrive in a cab. Nobody picks the phone when you call Housekeeping etc. It seems that either the staff does not care at all or the hotel is totally understaffed, or both.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116767564912308783708/reviews
