On the other hand, surprisingly their murtabak tastes much better than the rival across the street. The service however is very poor. They are not very accommodating and definitely not attentive.",

Portions were small and we left the restaurant still feeling hungry.\n\nIt was only 8pm and seems odd the waiter was pressuring us to make our last order and it was embarrassing for me as a host, as I felt bad about the service and regretted the choice.\nOnline the closing time shows 9.30pm though.\nHowever, the owner's nephew was kind to us.\n\nBecause we felt rushed, the dinner tasted dull and experience disappointing.\n\nSorry to say, i will not return.",
