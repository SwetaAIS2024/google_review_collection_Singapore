      "text": "One pretty quaint lunch spot away from the more well-trafficked places in NTU campus, owned by a cheery middle aged couple. It's located in a concourse of the Experimental Medicine Building (third floor), accessible from the main North Spine complex from an overhead bridge.\n\nPrice is a bit more steep than in the cafeterias and they focus more on quality rather than portion size - perfect for dieting staffs and students. The menu is large - from pastries, sandwiches, cakes, wraps, cut fruits, coffee, and most importantly rice/pasta bowl with customizable topping (choices of meat, tofu, vegs). The pastries are served warm and fresh, and the bowl dishes' toppings are tasty. The coffee (espresso-based) is surprisingly pretty good and rather well-priced.\n\nCan confirm sometimes there aren't enough seating during peak lunch time, albeit being situated inside a spacious concourse. More seating could be added so the customers can unwind.",
