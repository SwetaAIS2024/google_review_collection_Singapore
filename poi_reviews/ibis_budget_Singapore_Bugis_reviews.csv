Ben Lusiana,1,"IT'S A LOVE HOTEL...and the room swarmed with ants.

We were shocked when we checked in saw two young couples, one couple were going to check-in as the guy was informing the receptionist that he came before and was told the room was unavailable for a short session yet.

The receptionist then informed him that the room now ready and cost him $50. Then another couple came out from the lift and dropped off the card. Both couples didn't bring any hand carry or suitcases. The receptionist was laughing and made a comment about the guy's girlfriend neck got love bites all over.

We kind of suspicious about these activities after saw these incidents. And yet there are so many family with young children staying at this hotel.

When we got into the room, we checked the bed and saw transparent spots on the bed linen.. also, there were so many ants on the table everywhere that made us disgusted and decided to find another place to stay.

How can a hotel do a mix business accommodating for young families with children, tourists and short sex session in one building. Although the cleaner cleans up the bed linen and pillowcase,  to imagine the funny business has been performed, don't think you can sleep well and use their shower towels either.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103540553453228003963/reviews

Amelia Joynt,4,"The rooms were small but nice to sleep in, the beds were very neat and clean and comfortable to sleep with for the few nights we were here. Excellent area to put a hotel since there was many public transportation in the area and nice view too. The staff were friendly and helpful and is always there to help you out. Overall a good hotel, the prices are outstanding with the surprisingly good rooms you can get.

Would recommend if you are on a short trip.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101717763777809622033/reviews
