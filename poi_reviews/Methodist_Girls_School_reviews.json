On one side of the spectrum there’s those dissing others from different schools and gossiping with others about them (either because they’re jealous or have beef) then on the other side there’s those really nice angels who are actually nice and literal angels. I don’t have much friends here as compared to other schools but the diversity here is pretty good so yeah. 3/5.",

I was once close freinds with a person from MGS sec and then she suddenly started acting weird and dissing me. When I asked her to come to a consensus with me, she didn’t even bother. Very immature people. NYGS is so much better( speaking from a guy pov from a good school)",
