      "text": "Hakka Ampang Yong Tau Foo â€“ I tried the Yong Tau Foo along with the Wantan Pork Broth Soup, which was rich, flavorful, and fragrant. The dumplings were well-stuffed with juicy fillings, and the pork broth had a comforting depth, making it a satisfying choice. The Yong Tau Foo ingredients, including tofu, eggplant, and bitter gourd, were fresh and paired well with the soup. A great spot for authentic Hakka flavors!\n\n2 ðŸŒŸ - Below Average: Needs improvement in multiple areas, not meeting expectations.\n3 ðŸŒŸ - Standard, Average: Meets basic expectations, nothing exceptional but acceptable.\n4 ðŸŒŸ - Standard, Above Average: Exceeds expectations slightly, better than the norm.\n5 ðŸŒŸ - Special & Unique: Outstanding experience, highly memorable and exceptional.",
