      "text": "Had a good Vietnamese Food, own by a Vietnamese lady who married to a Singaporean. She stay in Singapore more than 10 years and decided to open a humble Vietnamese Food in Cendex Cafeteria.\n\nI came across her stall by chance last year. Today I brought my friends to try her food. Is definitely way better than going to Vietnamese restaurant and paying way much more.\n\nHer price is reasonable and is real authentic Vietnamese food,\n\nI had grill chicken with noodles,\nmy friend had chicken soup with noodles and I pack 1 beef kway teow soup -\n(Pho bo)\n\nHer food is like home cook and really good .\n\nThe only thing , she stop selling the rice paper spring roll because she has no time to make because she's alone in the stall.\n\nHer business starts from 10am to the most by 3pm as she focus only office crowds for lunch hours.\n\nYou can pay her cash or by PayNow.\n\nShe only open from Monday to Friday.\n\nDo go and try her food , you won't regret it.\n\nDo say hi to her, her name is Tina.\n\nTell her that you had read my review that's how you get to know her stall.\n\nðŸ˜Š Thanks everyone for reading my review.\n\nDo click follow so you won't miss my latest review .ðŸ˜Š\n\nStay safe everyone.",
