      "text": "I wonder if it’s a blessing to have a supposedly well known coffee brand in a busy CBD location. It sure is IF the coffee tastes good and the quality is consistent.\nService in this particular TCA at MBFC has always been varied, some days the female barista would just pour the milk straight into the espresso like mixing water. Other days they might bother to do a proper cup of coffee for paying customers. 6.90 for a cup of dirty mocha and the two pictures I have here are worlds apart.\nWhen I asked about the pale Milo-looking cup sitting on the counter, if that’s dirty mocha, she simply said “oh you want powder? Some ppl don’t want it” and she proceeded to dump powder into the cup. I stood appalled, to which she asked, “you want more?!” Wow. Just wow. I’ve ordered dirty mocha for the past 2 years, never, ever have I met this barista, just my day.\nNo one’s rushing you, please have some pride in your work.",

Slightly disappointed that a few of their coffees are no longer available (taped over in the menu board) and seems like there’s less pastries to choose from now.\nBut nonetheless coffee is still good , had the manuka which has some honey in it to give it a slightly sweet taste. The Okinawa is also nice from my memory having it a few years ago",
