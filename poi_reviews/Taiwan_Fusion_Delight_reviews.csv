Anonymous User,1,"I regret ordering the taiwan braised pork belly rice as it is not authentic and doesn't taste as good as I thought. Totally ruined Taiwan's signature dish. However, the Honey Chicken Curry Rice was good. One good thing about this store is, they give big portions to customers that is worth the price of $7.50-$8.50 per bowl

Update : Forget it. I'm boycotting this stall. I ordered curry chicken and it IS NOT worth it, the portion is ridiculously small. Probably the only dish that gets big portion is Honey Chicken Rice.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106866550286311509268/reviews
