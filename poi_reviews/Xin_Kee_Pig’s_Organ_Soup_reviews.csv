JR New,5,"This stall sells pig‚Äôs organ soup but don‚Äôt sleep on the braised pork rice, the herbal sauce is delicious and the braised pork is so well done! Comes with a serving of the soup too for the indecisive folks.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101665185105763739839/reviews
KO,5,"Young couple hawker, the boss was cutting raw meat. After I ordered he made an effort to wash his hands before prepare my order of pig organ soup. And what surprised me is the pork liver. Very nice.

MARCUS CHENG,5,"Stall owners are a lovely young couple
Very friendly and patient although I was indecisive on what to order because i was spoilt for choice.
Very meticulous on explaining to me what was what.
I ordered the pig‚Äôs organ soup & braised intestines
Super yummy!
The soup was very flavorful and the lean meats in the soup were boiled to perfection(softness wise)
Boss told me they took extra effort to cook ‚Äòem longer so as to cater to the elderlies & kids as their teeth are slightly weaker. I found these little attention for details really meticulous on their part.
Braised intestines were braised really well too, flavorful, clean and chewy(but not too chewy)
All in all, a super 5 stars for them! Will definitely be back when craving for more or if I‚Äôm in the area!

DIREK,5,"Helm by a young couple that serves an incredible bowl of organ soup. Their soup packs a punch and each organ component was nice and fresh; rightfully cooked to their own al dante.(The owner might ask if you preferred the organs to be cooked longer, but let them cook their way if you want to experience the original taste)

Will definitely be back for more!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117060159590407106456/reviews
