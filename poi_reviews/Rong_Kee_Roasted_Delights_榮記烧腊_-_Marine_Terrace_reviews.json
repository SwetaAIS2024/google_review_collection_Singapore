      "text": "Anyone who gives this place anything more than 1 star is either paid by the owner for a fake review or clearly haven't lived outside of Marine Terrace in entire their life. Or probably dealing with some weird stockholm syndrome with this stall.\n\nFood is barely okay. Got the set for takeaway and gave them my boxes (yes I brought multiple boxes for the different components of the meal) YET the staff decided to use their own styrofoam boxes (see photo). I told them to use my boxes but they curtly replied me in mandarin (I'm a Singaporean brown person btw) that they won't charge me extra for the takeaway box BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT??? SAVING THE ENVIRONMENT IS THE POINT???? More on the Service in abit....\n\nLike I said, the food is barely okay. Look at the photo. 6 thin slices of chicken for a set. Barely any roasted skin on them. Put together with the vegetables. ALL SWIMMING in a pool of soy sauce rendering everything saltier than the the waters from east coast beach nearby. I couldn't get thru the meal after 3 bites. Rice (unpictured) was bad. No flavour, no bite.\n\nSERVICE: This one... what do I say. Stall owner and stall staff make you feel like you and your entire family owe them money, your house, your spouse, your CPF, and your first born. That you should be grateful that you're eating their \"god\" given food. But the only way I'll see god from eating here is when I die from high blood pressure due to all the salt and get to heaven. Or unfortunately, Hell in this case because even god won't forgive you for eating at this stall.\nPrice also wasn't cheap for a set.\n\nI have no problem with bad service IF the food makes me happy. The triangle of a meal is Food-Service-Price. If food is good, service is good, price will be expensive. Service good but food is cheap maybe can expect food to be so-so. If it's good food and cheap, just expect yourself to get scolded.\n\nThis stall somehow defies physics and manages to break all rules of the golden triangle and is terrible at food, service, and pricing.\n\nPlease, I urge you, I plead with you - Do not visit this stall unless you are into BDSM and like pain for pleasure. There are plenty of options in the 2 coffeeshops along this stretch or in the wider area of Marine Parade/Katong. In fact, from this stall it's a 2 min walk to Marine Terrace MRT, 3min ride to Marine Parade MRT, take exit 1 and you are magically at Marine Parade Central Food market with better, tastier, cheaper options. Save your calories and your mood. Singapore already very stressful, let's not add to that.",

The set meal had 5 wonton pcs, vegetable side dish and roast chicken rice. Roast pork crispy skin and moist meat- the fact that the pork fat was melt in your mouth is a good roasting skill. Char siew is the lean version type- great if you dislike too fatty cuts. Garlic and sambal chilli also good.",

The only reason why we didn’t give 5 stars is because they gave 3 half sized dumplings (deceiving) whereas the marketing photo showed allegedly full sized dumplings.",
