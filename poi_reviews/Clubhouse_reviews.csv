TSANG ZI HENG Student,5,Damn good place to hang out as residents who host ppl to our house. Really big and can fit a ton of ppl. Had so many appliances that we could partyyy. Right beside the swimming pool so you can go for a swim before party. Really recommend residents to try this out,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108356240525812507400/reviews
