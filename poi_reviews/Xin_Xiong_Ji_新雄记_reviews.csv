Yang,4,"Mushroom Minced Meat Noodle ($4.80): Springy Mee Kia with chilli sauce, balanced with a smooth vinegary tang. Some may find it a bit strong. Includes meatballs, minced meat, sliced meat, liver, mushrooms, and lettuce. Minced and sliced meat were marinated making it tender and flavourful. Pork lard adds fragrance. The accompanying soup is clear and savoury.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103078870952547064508/reviews
Witawat Choo,1,Just bought takeaway laksa for 30mins. Staff did not separate the noodle and the broth. You can see also the coconut milk split from the broth. Terrible.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113370282370507524759/reviews

Kelvin Poh,1,"Been patronising this stall purely due to convenience and probably the only Bak Chor Mee stall there.

If it's not for my son, I will not recommend this store.

The staff (varies at different days, this happened on 24th Sep 2023 @ ~1200h) was rude.

I was only telling her that I don't need the chopsticks since I am taking out. She replied rudely, ""Even if you need the chopsticks, you need to take it for yourself.""

I was dumbfounded by her replied.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103496137315601811482/reviews
Jonathan Chou,1,"I've just had a bad experience with this hawker owner. He was rude and disrespectful to me. All I asked was for a ba chor mee sua. Sure, the choice of noodle was not the usual mee kia or mee pok, but he really acted like I was making an extremely unreasonable request. I've actually bought the same order from this place multiple times with no issue previously, so I really don't think the issue was with my order.

In any case, please be prepared when ordering here. The noodles are of acceptable quality, but the store owner's unpleasant attitude may leave a sour taste in your mouth.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111410888330115052454/reviews
