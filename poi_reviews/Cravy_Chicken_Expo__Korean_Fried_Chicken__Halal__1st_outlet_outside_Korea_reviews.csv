chee wee,5,"Your chicken wings really dam good. U have a good chef who does fire control very well. Outside crispy inside tender. I also like that the chicken taste fresh. Even the oil taste fresher than others.

I have never heard of cravy until now. But I think u beat many competitors out of the park.

xin,4,"Went around weekday lunch timing. It can get crowded during peak hours.

Here's what I got!

6 pieces boneless chicken chunks set
affordable set that comes with a side of fries and a drink. Both the chicken and fries are very crispy. There are a few different choices for the drinks (coke, rootbeer, fanta, etc)

Rose rabokki had thick and creamy sauce. Comes with al dante noodles, chewy tteokbokki, sausages, and sliced ham. The sauce was a great pairing with everything elseü§§

The cheese balls are so cheesy and chewy.

Curly fries are a must-order, so good!

Service is quite good. Overall a pretty good‚ò∫Ô∏è",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109084930946224730821/reviews

EatwithLJ,5,"Tucked away in a quiet corner of Singapore, Cravy Chicken honestly surprised us!

We had the Osaka Soy Fried Chicken, Rose Rabokki and Fries to go along. The fried chicken unlike other places we visited is perfectly seasoned not only on the outside but on the inside as well which makes this chicken dish one of our favourites.

Besides the chicken, the Rabokki is soooo creamy and sooo packed with flavors and ingredients like Teokpokki, Sausages and ham slices.

Quality food at affordable prices. Would definitely visit again to satisfy our fried chicken cravings!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117465654365756406790/reviews
