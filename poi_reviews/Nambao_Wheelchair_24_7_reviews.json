Even took all the trouble to go to his shop to look for the replacement parts as I told him I needed it urgently. Pricing is very cheap and affordable.\nEventually I didn‚Äôt engage his service as my brother took the wheelchair and got it repaired on his own.\nI felt bad as he went through so much trouble just to try to get my wheelchair repaired by today so I tried to offer him a little token of appreciation but was refused by him.\nHe told me ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok, no worries‚Äù\nVery nice and a true gentleman. üëç",

Mr Kim kindly arranged to deliver the wheelchair to our home so we had it as soon as my mum arrived. She was so pleased as we were able to show her so much of Singapore, which is very wheelchair friendly. If it had not been for Mr Kim, we probably wouldn‚Äôt have been able to get a wheelchair until almost a week later, so he saved her holiday.\nMr Kim always communicated promptly and clearly and was an absolute pleasure to deal with. We just can‚Äôt recommend him highly enough. And if that were not enough, his rates are very fair too.\nThank you so much Mr Kim for making my mum‚Äôs holiday perfect.",
