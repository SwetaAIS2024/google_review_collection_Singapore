      "text": "I had a fantastic experience at the Teka showroom today! We had the opportunity to try out their signature products, including the pizza and steak oven, and even made our own pizza. The standout feature was definitely the quality of their appliances, like the hood, hob, sink, steam oven, and microwave.\n\nPatrick and Serene, the salespeople, were incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. They provided thorough explanations of each product's features, making it easy to understand their benefits. Overall, it was a fun and informative day—I highly recommend visiting the Teka showroom if you're looking for high-quality kitchen appliances!",

      "text": "Terry and Yew provided exceptional service! They were professional, patient, and demonstrated excellent product knowledge. Their thorough understanding of the Tekka Induction Cooker's parts and functions gave me complete confidence in their work.\n\nAfter servicing my 8-year-old cooker, they assured me that it's in good working condition, saving me from potential costly repairs. Terry's advice on maintenance and troubleshooting was invaluable, and I appreciate his willingness to educate me on what to look out for in the future.\n\nI'm extremely satisfied with their service, and I highly recommend Terry and Yew for their expertise and dedication. Five stars isn't enough – they're truly outstanding!",

The ridiculous part of it is the maintenance telling me not to turn the knob to certain angles because it “confuses” the hob??\n\nAbsolutely no care of end users’ safety. Awaiting proper resolution before further legal recourse.",
