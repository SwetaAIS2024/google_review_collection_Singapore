Carl Michael,5,"Came here for Wisdom tooth surgery and I must say the team here at Bright Smile Dental are exceptional! Shoutout to Margret, Wendy, Dr. Benn Chua and all the nurses here who were very accommodating, friendly, professional and helpful!

I was quite nervous as it was my first time doing a Wisdom tooth surgery, but Dr. Benn was detailed and really reassuring, he patiently guided me along the way, explaining in detail what the approach would be, most especially during every step of the surgery itself which helped put me at ease. He also explained things to take note of post-care which were very helpful! Kudos to the team here at Bright Smile Dental Surgery! Looking forward to future appointments at the Clinic!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112167057589697156868/reviews
Ling Ling Luo,5,I consulted Dr Benn Chua for issues with my wisdom tooth. I've delayed removing the wisdom tooth for a long time. It was finally time to remove it. Dr Chua was thorough in the scaling and polishing done as well. He is also careful with post surgery care. Highly recommend.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107669140836073496738/reviews

Qiuling,3,"Dr Benn Chua is good but published pricing is misleading. The published charge for scaling and polishing (not for children) is $86+ to $129+ after GST, excluding consultation charge of $30. My partner and I went for it and was charged the maximum $129+ even though our teeth condition were normal. We have expected mid range charge instead of max charge.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104879278863364960147/reviews
