      "text": "I’m not a cat person, but I have a dear friend who loves them and happens to live in New York. So, I decided to check out this exhibition and snap some photos for him.\n\nThe exhibit is small but cozy, and when I visited, it wasn’t crowded at all. In fact, after I finished photographing everything, I ended up being the only 1 there, spending most of my time trying to capture the giant kitty statue!\n\nOne downside is that the illustrated works are displayed behind acrylic glass, making it tricky to photograph them without catching my own reflection. I had to take all the shots at an angle.\n\nThe exhibition is free, but there’s only a week left, so swing by if you’re in the area!\n\nOn a funnier note, the giant kitty statue is dressed in a futuristic outfit—apparently inspired by ancient voyages. But to me, it looks more like Captain America’s shield reimagined in red and gold. Meow-velous!",
