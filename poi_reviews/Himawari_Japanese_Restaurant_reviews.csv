Ivan Chin,1,"Came for dinner as friends recommend.
For walk-in customers, there are many empty tables around but the Myanmar waiter still insists we only can take up the table next to the counter.
All the knocking sound and ordering noise really disturbed our family.
Food is nice but a bit pricey.
For the poor consideration from the service which provided, will not return again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101851480874586481061/reviews
Jaclyn,5,"Himawari ‚Äì The Japanese buffet I didn‚Äôt want to tell you about.

Look, I really wanted to gatekeep this one‚Äîbut good food deserves a little spotlight. Himawari Japanese Restaurant quietly delivers one of the most satisfying Japanese buffet experiences out there, and I‚Äôm still dreaming of that sashimi.

Let‚Äôs start with the Shabu Shabu. The broth starts off soft and light, but after a good simmer? It transforms into this comforting, umami-rich hotpot that hits the spot‚Äîespecially after you‚Äôve gone ham on the sashimi.

And speaking of sashimi‚Äîfresh, chunky, generous. No sad slivers here. The tako sashimi had me going back for seconds (and thirds), and the variety? Definitely punches above its price point.

Soft shell crab came out cold‚Äîhard pass. I enjoyed the grilled shishamo, but the fried version didn‚Äôt quite hit. The fried stuff, especially the tempura, is a must-try though‚Äîlight, crisp, and all kinds of satisfying.

Sushi is okay, and I found the handrolls not too exciting. So unless you‚Äôre a diehard, maybe don‚Äôt waste precious stomach real estate there.

And now for dessert: they only offer four ice cream flavours, but these come in individual tubs and taste like the good stuff‚Äînot cheap, fluffy filler. It‚Äôs a classy little ending to a full-on feast.

Honestly, I didn‚Äôt have enough stomach to try everything‚Äîbut what I did manage to devour was seriously worth it.

Verdict: An underrated gem for Japanese buffet lovers. Great quality, comforting hotpot, and a satisfying sweet finish. Come hungry, pace yourself, and maybe‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs keep this one hush-hush.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112310545730950862073/reviews
ÈòøÂÆù,5,"Love this Japanese makan place!

The sashimi are so fresh & the portions are so generous!!

It is more worthwhile if you go for their buffet that costs about $56++ as a plate or sashimi is about $18 per plate if you order a la carte so if you order 3 plates is about the cost of the buffet üòì

They have a lot of options under buffet menu, is advisable to go empty stomach :-)

However, the entire place can be quite noisy so go with the mindset that you are going to eat and eat, dun worry about the noise ‚ò∫Ô∏è",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews
Sebastian Lee,5,"Very thick cut of sashimi. Food is great. Quite a popular place, best to reserve beforehand. The yu sheng is the well thought out, feels light yet flavourful; i would say even better than the traditional yu sheng.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117385737623152267279/reviews
Hao Tan,5,"We had japanese buffet dinner. The spread and dishes provided was sufficient and adequate. Was surprised to find the sashimi served was thick and fresh to enjoy.  The restaurant atmosphere was good, not too many tables hence the crowds wasn't too large.  The service by the staffs team were good. We enjoyed the evening. Serving speed was fast even with the restaurant crowded. Car parking was easy. Pricing was reasonable for the spread they provided. Will plan to revisit soon.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117487638688399238932/reviews
