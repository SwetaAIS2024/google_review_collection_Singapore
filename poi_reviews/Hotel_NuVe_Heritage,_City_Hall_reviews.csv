Maria Kamel,4,"My family and I spent 3 nights at a The photographer suite at NuVe. Nice complimentary mini bar, the hotel clean and the location perfect for sightseeing.
Their food staff friendly and helpful with every request we had. Definitely worth the stay",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106706767301817345726/reviews
Ulrike Wolf,3,"For the Photographer's suite, I suggest to set up instructions for how to use the light switches (in particular to know how to use the bathroom switch independently), I suggest to also clarify that it has only tiny windows (making it feel like a room without window) and not to forget to provide amenities for 4 persons, not 2, when you sell it for 4 persons. Also, the aircon is very loud. Thanks",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112657859866228388205/reviews
Ambrose Ho,5,"Room: Deluxe King

We were walking around in the neighbourhood, and looking for our next hotel. Stumble on this & decided to walk in to see if they had availability for next few days.

We were met with Joel who was happy to show us what some of the rooms looked like.

We went across the street to have a drink/snack, checked pricing with booking sites & booking directly, and Joel was correct, booking direct was cheaper than Bookings.com!

We booked 2 nights, and I walked across the street and mentioned that it was our honeymoon trip.

We came early to drop off our bags on check-in day and left. Upon return (early check-in was available, Joel messaged as he said he would), our luggage was already in rhe room, and a nice display/card was on the bed!

We like that all the mini bar items are complimentary and replenished!

Joel is ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ and is an asset to your establishment.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101651402282538874665/reviews
Hiang Ar,3,"The rooms are compact and not very soundproof. I could hear the guest in the next room using their toilet. The bed has a small gap that could unintentionally trap items. There is a well-stocked mini-fridge in the room, and complimentary biscuits are available in the lobby. The corridor is a bit narrow, and some walking is required from the MRT station and bus stop.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101185220797498251612/reviews
まよMayo,2,"The room is not very well maintained and clean.. We see bits of dried grapes stalks on the floor when we just entered the room, the towel are quite wore off and old. The complimentary mini bar is appreciated but the cleaning staff outside is very loud and very distracting. We slept late last night and wanted to get extra sleep, but the loud bangs and vacuums noise is really disrupting…",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100135187602715537334/reviews
