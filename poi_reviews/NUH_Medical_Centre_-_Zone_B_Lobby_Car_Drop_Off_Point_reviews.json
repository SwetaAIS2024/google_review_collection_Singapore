Then, we waited from 11 o'clock to 2 o'clock, and the doctor finally arrived. Then suddenly the staff told us to see a baby first. However, my family wanted to know the situation, and all they saw was the nurse playing and laughing with the baby, and the doctor disappeared. Is this a major? My family is in crisis and waiting for medical treatment. What kind of broken hospital is this? I don't even want to give a star, so you'd better not go!",
