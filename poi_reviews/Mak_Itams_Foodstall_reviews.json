The Seafood Tom Yum was rich and aromatic, the Ikan 3 Rasa perfectly crispy with sweet, spicy, and tangy sauces, and the Daging Merah was tender and flavorful. Loved the creamy Buttermilk Chicken and crispy Fried Egg too! A must-visit for a satisfying, hearty meal. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",

      "text": "My favourite stall ever since first ate there last month. Been patronising 2times a week at least.\n\nPrice: Reasonable\n\nFood choices/ varieties: Spoilt for choices! (Ate there for breakfast and lunch on a same day once). Need to come back few times to try out other main dishes and kuih-muihs\n\nQuantity: Generous\n\nStaffs/ Service: Very motherly and kind. Speedy service with the abang in kitchen and 2 kakak at stall front. Take note of the separate Q line for ordering.\n\nPros: Best place for the elusive Nasi Rawon (it's hard to find tasty Rawon in North area). Even just a plain rice, paru, bagedil and Rawon gravy may cost approx $7+, the serving is generous. Place is also very lively and \"kampung spirited\".\n\nCons: Peak hour around 7.30am-9am. May be hard to get a seat, although the patrons there are all very friendly and will offer a seat to join at their table.",
