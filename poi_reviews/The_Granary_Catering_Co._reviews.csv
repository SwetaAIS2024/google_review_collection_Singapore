Cheryl Oon,5,"Had the pleasure of working with The Granary Catering Co. for Checkpoint Theatre’s Secondary: The Musical Gala event on 21st April at Victoria Theatre, and we couldn’t be more thrilled with their service. From start to finish, the experience was nothing short of exceptional.

From our initial consultation, Kelvin Chin from the Granary Catering Co. impressed us with his professionalism and attention to detail. He took the time to understand our needs and preferences, even helping to curate a high tea catering menu in our early planning stage. The planning process was seamless, and their team was always available to answer questions and provide updates.

The food was the highlight of the evening. Ultimately, we opted for their Greek menu which was nothing short of spectacular. The Granary Catering Co. delivered an exquisite array of authentic Greek dishes that catered to all dietary preferences, including vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options. Furthermore, they are all halal-friendly. Each dish was a culinary masterpiece, beautifully presented and bursting with flavour. Our guests raved about the Moussaka and the Fudgy Brownie for dessert.

The service was excellent — from delivery and setup to tear down. Kelvin and his colleague were courteous, attentive, efficient and professional throughout. The presentation of the food was elegant and every detail, from the table settings to the serving platters, was executed flawlessly.

The Granary Catering Co. made our Gala a memorable event. Their dedication to quality and excellence was evident in every aspect of their service. We received numerous compliments from our guests about the outstanding catering, and we couldn’t agree more. Highly recommend The Granary Catering Co. for any event. They are true professionals who are passionate about what they do, and it shows. Thank you to the entire team for making our Gala an unforgettable evening!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105897527939474349328/reviews

Kelvin was outstanding! He went above and beyond to ensure that every detail of our event was taken care of, from initial planning to execution. His professionalism and dedication truly made the entire process seamless and stress-free.

Shaff and his team ensured that dietary preferences were accommodated with grace and efficiency, including labels that accounted for dietary preferences for ease of reference, earning praise from all our attendees.

Special thanks to Ashylar and Fayyadh, the outlet managers, for their warm hospitality and assistance prior to and throughout the event. Their attentiveness and willingness to assist with our requests contributed significantly to the success of our gathering.
