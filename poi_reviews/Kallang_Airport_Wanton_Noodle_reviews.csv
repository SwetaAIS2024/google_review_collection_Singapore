Jack W,2,"Taman Jurong food market is good with variety. But tried few times at kallang airport wonton noodle. Inconsistency and served by black face auntie. Ordered the dark sauce (dry) version. More like soup wonton mee. The wonton still good but the bowl of noodle bit Sian for the morning.
Imagine you will feedback and get a black face in return.

Vegetarian is good. Should try it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117720903937368720650/reviews
Lesley Wong,5,"New discovery.  A new member has joined Taman Jurong Food Centre.

One can enjoy a gastro-satisfying wanton noodle which accompanied with 4 wantons (including a fried wanton) and generous portion of Char Siew (6-8 slices) for S$3.80.

Planned to place a takeaway order but too late as they closed for the day on the dot at 2pm.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110314486764412709922/reviews

Benedict Lim,3,"Nice noodles but lack of hygiene. Cashier and cook don't wear hand gloves. Their hands don't look clean to hand cash and touching the raw noodles and wantans.
Noodles portion is not generous. $3.80 gets you maybe 3 slices of pork meat",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107007582954948966712/reviews
