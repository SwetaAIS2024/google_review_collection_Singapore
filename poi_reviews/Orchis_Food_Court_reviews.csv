Tonny,5,"Economy prices, multiple cuisines. Best place in singapore airport. From departures terminal go towards counter 16 at the end, take the elevator to G floor.

Nham,3,"Staff Canteen opened to the public. Just note that there are staff prices and public prices for each dish. For public dishes expect a 20-40% difference in prices.

Food was good and even with the difference, cheaper than inside the main airport. So if you are on a tight budget, itâ€™s a good place to go.

Really clean and quiet  when we went. There is a bar if you want to grab a drink. To get there walk to the end of Terminal 1 and follow the signs to Car Park 2. Once in the car park take the lifts to level 2.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110022867573876768877/reviews
Estela Duque,5,"Orchis is at Changi Airport Terminal 1. If exiting Passenger Arrivals area, first clear Customs, turn left, then follow arrows to exit at the last glass door at the end of corridor. This canteen serves Changi employees and army staff because there's a military base nearby. I've been coming to this food court for over a decade, whenever I can clear Customs during stopovers at Changi Airport, and it has excellent hawker food if that's what you're after!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112546744720057072759/reviews
Ivan Teh,4,"Mee Goreng (SGD $5) @ Abdul Latiff Food Stall.
.
So this stall is only accessible to air transport personnel and invited business partners. For 2 decades or more, this pakcik often sells out after lunch.
.
He fries each order individually, so there's usually a queue waiting patiently.
.
The soft chewy yellow noodles carry a smoky savoury salty spice flavour, conrrasted by crisp bean sprouts and juicy cucumbers, both lending a vegetal sweet flavour. Bits of wispy whisked chicken egg lend a slight eggy sweet savoury note.
.
You can opt to add several ingredients, which most do - from springy fish cake, tender boiled potatoes, soft overeasy chicken egg, to crispy battered chicken cutlet.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114332345573544911646/reviews
