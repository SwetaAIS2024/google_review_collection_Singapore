Especially their fried Hokkien Prawn Noodle.\n\nLet's talk about their Fired Hokkien Prawn Noodle, it was surprisingly full of wok-hey, with lots of seafood savory Umami and flavourful. If you eat on the spot, it might be very wet and slightly soupy, I believe they done it with purpose, that was the delicious seafood broth which is the source of great Umami taste. Even you take away, open after 30min, the noodle turn dry which soup already absorbed by the noodles, it taste even better than eating on the spot.\n\nI'm glad that the cooking team done it so well. Definitely a big treasure for Hougang residents and those who knows this place.\n\nThey also served Char Kway Teow (fried flat thin rice noodle), it was taste not bad, simple and delicious, could be more on sweet taste, you may ask to add more chilli b'cos normal spiciness version I ordered was not spicy at all, but I'm happy on that.\n\nThey do pairing the other half of stall for fried carrots cake. Which they share same PayNow QR code. But for my selection, the fried Hokkien Prawn Noodle was the best and most worthy especially for new customers like me.\n\nDefinitely come back again and again especially I'm one of the fortunate Hougang residents. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "This is currently my number one pick for fried Hokkien prawn noodles. I cannot complain about any aspect. The taste is simply nostalgic. Really rich and savoury flavour with the proper type of cooked sambal chilli, which was also spot on for taste.\nPrawns and squid were fresh, pork lard was crispy!\nThey only have one portion size which costs $5, and there are no options or add ons.\nGreat for those of us who prefer the old classic taste rather than the new age versions of this dish.",

And this one‚Äôs noodles just absorbs all the flavours. Prawns are on the small side but you get sliced pork , sotong and great chili to go with. Definitely a hidden gem of hougang ave 5",

At first, you might think it will not be specialized in HKM but it turns out to be good.\n\nWell maintained ratio of yellow noodles and bee hoon, sufficient prawn stock umami, slight wok hei and definitely not overcooked or charred.\n\nTip though, can try to add $2 for extra ingredients such as prawn or sotong because they only give 2 prawns and few sotong bits for the $5 version shown below.\n\nCame during the off peak hours because I hate to wait. Environment is nice and windy. Overall nice experience. Will come again if in the vicinity.\n\nLocated at Hougang Ave 5 Blk 309 Goh Lim Hwa Eating House.",
