Jackie (CJ),5,Food portion and taste are decent. The waiter is attentive enough to explain the food selection to me as I have no idea about Indian food. The lassi is too sweet to finish more than half a cup and the waiter offer to make a less sweet version to me.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102282722870565804245/reviews
Evangeline Tan,4,"Food was nice except that the patty was grilled a bit too long. Portion is also generous. Love how the Rose Syrup Limau does not taste too sweet. Itâ€™s perfect for me. The place is clean and pleasant. For curry puffs, will recommend the potato rather than the sardines. Waiters were friendly. Overall, a pleasant dining experience here.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106532653439880681935/reviews
Peach Mint,5,"A variety of foods can be found here, ranging from Indian dishes (Naan ,roti prata), seafood, Malay food (nasi padang , lontong) to Western food. Portions are generous and it tastes delicious.
Always keep coming here, for their nasi goreng Kampong, nasi goreng Pattaya, and sup oxtail. Kids favourite will be their kway teow pattaya and banana split.
Good customer service, Staff are very welcoming, attentive, friendly, and helpful. The boss too is very friendly, humble and very welcoming.
No regrets coming here.
Highly recommended.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112428196440653463189/reviews
Kahlil Anthony Gacasan,5,"If you are undecided about what to order, just go for 2x Cheese Prata. I've been to many Indian restaurants and prata shops because I like Cheese Prata and I can safely conclude Al-Ameen cheese prata @ Bukit Timah is S-Tier. Not B-Tier, not C-Tier but S-Tier (although somedays it would be just A-Tier). I came here many times just for their tasty cheese prata.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112398814868208116571/reviews
