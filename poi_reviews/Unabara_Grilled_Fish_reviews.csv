Wesley Wong,3,"This Japanese restaurant in Leisure Park offers a quiet and relaxed dining atmosphere, even during weekend lunch hours. While this makes it a good option for those looking to avoid the crowds, the food itself leaves much to be desired. The dishes are fairly average, lacking the depth of flavor and authenticity one might expect from a quality Japanese eatery.

One disappointing experience was the ramen egg, which was unfortunately spoiled when served. However, the situation was handled well by the staff. Without any hesitation or need for complaints, they promptly replaced the dish with a fresh bowl, demonstrating excellent customer service and attentiveness. Their professionalism and willingness to rectify the issue added a positive touch to an otherwise underwhelming meal.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107433449088212182977/reviews
Kate I,2,"My family was excited to try this place since we love fish, but unfortunately, it fell short of our expectations. Even the salmon tasted off and lacked freshnessâ€”I ended up dipping it in soy sauce with wasabi to mask the flavor.

The Chicken Katsudon didnâ€™t look appealing; the color of the batter suggests the oil might have been reused too many times ðŸ«£. They were generous with the eggs, though. The saba was just okay, but overall, it was disappointing.

On the bright side, the service was good. However, this will probably be our last visit.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114524568615530680412/reviews
Melissa Leong,5,"Grilled yellowfish was excellent and my husband enjoyed it very much. My halibut was a bit plain and tasteless, but the fish was fresh. Like that the unagi came in 2 pieces, tasted pretty good too. Service was warm and friendly from the ladies. Overall, we enjoyed the food.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113345730471940578660/reviews

may young,5,"We just came back from Unabara after a very satisfying dinner.
My family has been patronized Unabara Grilled Fish ever since it opened at Leisure Park Kallang. The casual dining restaurant serves very good quality food with reasonable and affordable prices and excellent service.
The manager Mr. Mirza and his team are very friendly, polite, pleasant, sincere and helpful.  We all enjoy their service!  I believe good people, good food and friendly service are the main factors keep drawing us to patronize at Unabara.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114193972318946071277/reviews
