Sen Sui,5,Early 11:30 gathering with friend. Be able to enjoy early bird discount. Roast duck is a must. Sauce is good. Ordered half duck. Soup is not bad. Fried vegetable is a bit pricy but that's how they make money. Side dish should not be charged. Dessert is interesting but a bit too creative to me.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117846252490074784755/reviews
Jessie Lim,5,"We have been here many times. This time, we ordered the signature menu. As always the food is delicious and portion is good for 8 pax. The roast duck is an all time favorite dish. We tried the yam pork ribs for first time and it was so good. The yam was well cooked, soft and ribs were easily deboned. The deshelled cereal prawns were a hit with the kids. The stir fried vegetables with lime hits a spot with all young and old. The spinach tofu gets everyone excited once it is served. We will always go back again to Dian Xiao Er.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118195429969822729709/reviews
Ars 3276,3,"Food was good as always.
Very crowded and service was slightly above average due to the crowd.
Had to remind afew times for certain stuff etc bowls of white rice not served after.
However we felt duck was not as good as our past experience elsewhere.
Overall was ok for us.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114029124935079806014/reviews
Poh Qin Yeow,5,"The roasted duck with dang gui is very surprising good! Must try.
Their menu offer set meal, you can choose which package you want then order how many head(pax), to avoid waste food.
The tofu is in green, it’s delicious but it’s in green I cannot accept, make me think of this is a pandan toufu? Haha
The yam pork in clay pot is delicious too, looks pale and tastless but it taste good!
This restaurant suitable for lunch and dinner session, suitable for friends and family meet up.
The crew are all very friendly.
Spend more than a certain amount, can get a free gift rubber ducky.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113851674572807749225/reviews
Patricia Yeo,5,"Have not been to this outlet for a long time. They have relocated just slightly further down the same stretch of restaurants.

Food are still equally good. Love all their dishes, especially the duck with Dan Gui sauce.

Also like it that they have flower tea added to the menu. We ordered the Grape and Peach. Grape is super fragrant. The blossoming tea is pleasing to the eyes. The hot water is refillable.

Even though they were packed, the service crew tried to ensure that we are attended to and helped clear the table of empty plates or glasses as it can be very cramped for rectangular seating of 6 people.

Dian Xiao Er is still super value for money for family meals and celebrations.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106155978583921992243/reviews
