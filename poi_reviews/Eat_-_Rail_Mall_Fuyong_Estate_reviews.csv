Hatsune Miku,2,"I ordered a $6.80 laksa as shown in the picture. For this price, you get a hot beverage and your standard bowl of noodles. I asked for a teh C, and to be honest, it didnt taste very good. The noodles weren't much of an improvement either. Most laksa have a spoonful of sambal chilli in it to enhance the broth flavors, but we have none of it here. No egg either. What you get are 3 small cockles, some fishcake, 3 small pieces of tau pok and a beancurd roll(豆腐卷). Like most mediocre laksa, the broth isnt lemak enough and the absence of sambal chilli is a disservice to the customer. For once, I have to agree with the google ratings. The food here just isnt good enough. The tray return corner was also swamped with trays, and the staff did not bother to clear the area. The fact that it was 2 am in the morning did nothing to appease my displeasure in standing there looking like an idiot. For once, I contemplated on leaving my tray on the floor. Unless you are dying of hunger, this isnt a good place for you to be in.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109198790780321411397/reviews
Zann Loo,1,"Had the chicken chop curry rice ($5.50) and it was terrible. It’s the worst curry I ever had. They thicken it and the texture was disgusting. The curry also had no flavour. Chicken was small too.

Dry minced meat noodle ($5.30) was quite bad too. The noodles were overcooked and soft. Picture showed lard but it didn’t come with it. Soup is very salty too.

Chili was kept inside, had to ask for it. Staff attitude was not great.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117576178053754062287/reviews
Ming Hui,4,"I think Eat! Is one of the most standard places for mee pok kind of food. We tried it at railmall. Now, the venue is abit lacking cuz it was hot even though there was suppose to be air con running.

The food was alright. We ordered mee pok and a platter of the fried items. I think overall the food was alright. It wasn't something that will blow you away. But the whole setting is a little underwhelming especially considering how other outlets along the stretch of railmall is like.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108198322351045531056/reviews

Peter Chua,1,"Firstly, I didn’t see any option for online delivery when I placed my order.
While I was ordering, the staff were busy handling takeaway orders.

Secondly, a bowl was handed to me, which I placed on my tray. However, I was later informed by the staff that the bowl was meant for the next customer, even though their order was placed after mine.

Thirdly, I received only one bowl of soup instead of two. The staff then started preparing takeaway orders, leaving me waiting for so long that I eventually decided to proceed with my meal. To make matters worse, my second bowl was left sitting on the counter.

There was clearly a lack of communication between the cashier and the staff, as the cashier seemed more focused on taking additional orders.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117320083836989480538/reviews
