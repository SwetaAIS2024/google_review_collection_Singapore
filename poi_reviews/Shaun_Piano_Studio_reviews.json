      "text": "Shaun had been a wonderful teacher for my 3 children for over 2 years.  Thanks to Shaun my daughter found way back to playing and my boys fell in love with the piano.  Shaun was always able to find the right pieces for my children to keep them interested in playing and never pushed styles which would make them feel like piano playing is a chore instead of a fantastic skill to have for life.  Shaun was able to prepare my children for a very successful ABRSM examination and I believe piano playing will always be a part of my children’s life.  Shaun is very friendly, patient and knows how to find music which will make piano practice fun. We miss him and can recommend him very highly.",
