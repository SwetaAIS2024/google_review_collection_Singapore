Roland,2,"A disappointing visit begins from the queue waiting to be given a table. The server saw us, but they continue with their own discussion while I waited at the door for at least a good 10 minutes.

Ordered their highly recommended dishes on their menu, but again ended up with disappointment as Fried Tofu Minced Chicken w/ Gravy was very salty, despite given feedback, the server only commented that they will feedback to the kitchen.

The rest of the food is also average, the pandan lime drink can also skip, as its only have mild taste of pandan and two small lime inside.

For future diners, do opt to sit outside instead of inside the eatery as the table inside can be very cramp and the staff can be very loud during their communication, which affects dinning experience.

Not a place that I will choose to visit again given the experience.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103766504321573171977/reviews
Simon,4,"I recently visited Lotus Thai and tried their Pig Trotter Rice. It was absolutely delicious! The dish was perfectly cooked, with the skin, fat, and meat melting in my mouth. The flavors were rich and authentic, and the texture of the meat was tender yet firm enough to enjoy. The portion size was generous and it paired wonderfully with the rice.

The service was also great, friendly and attentive staff made the dining experience even better. I‚Äôll definitely be coming back to try more of their dishes. Highly recommended for anyone craving authentic Thai flavors!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115909260120880990078/reviews

Dan Lin,4,"Food‚Äôs pretty good, and while it may cost a little more than Thai restaurants located in the heartland areas, this place is air-conditioned, has better seats, and more kid-friendly.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112581484236511629366/reviews
