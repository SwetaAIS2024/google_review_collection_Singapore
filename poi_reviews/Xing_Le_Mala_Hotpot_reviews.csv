Zuriel Mamba,4,"This mala xiangguo popped out while searching for meal nearby. They have several meat options that looked good & decided to fill my container with some of the proteins.

Ordered extra spicy for mine & about 10 mins my order was ready. Returned for additional chilies when realised it could be more spicier. With a smile the cook acknowledged & Stir-fried  additional chilies for my order. The  seasonings were alright, n their prices are higher than serval of the nearby mala xiangguo.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100097027827819745483/reviews

Xavier Tan,2,"Food used to be ok. But getting saltier and saltier. And the usual staple like tin foil grilled fish, no longer available. Not sure what‚Äôs going on.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106885978605096751111/reviews
RCSC,4,"Ordered via foodpanda. Spent $29$ on this portion with 1 rice. Flavour wise, it is a decent mala. But their zhong la is tooooo spicy. More like da la instead. Could not finish it as it was so spicy. Drink water until full already.

I like that they cut their ingredients very thinly! Especially the pig intestine and beef. Intestine was not tough to chew. Beef was nice and tender, surprisingly.

Will order again!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101381356185028377091/reviews
Annie Heng,5,"My favorite stall! I love their Ëæ£Â≠êÈ∏°and È∫ªËæ£ÁÉ´very delicious! Their promo set before 5pm is really worth it. They don‚Äôt give you lesser portions like other stall. I like the regular cook and lady assistant there, they know what I wana order when they see me ü§≠ they are friendly and nice.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103943798403384585564/reviews
