BABY GERM,2,"Honestly, it's a quick fix, but don't expect authentic Korean food. The saba fish was decent, though a bit too oily, and the kimchi soup tasted strange and bland.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112868994757778796482/reviews
William,4,"Staple and affordable Korean food that feels quite homey. The owner / staff was pretty friendly. The shop feels like a food court.

The grilled pork and beef in the hotplate was good. The veggie pancake could be better as it was a bit oily. The kimbap is not bad.

For the price that you are paying, I think this place is quite value for money.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114916696399917166666/reviews
Hiang Ar,3,"Food: A must mention is the Kimbap. The rich fragrant of the sesame oil helped to enrich the taste. I find it comparable to those I had in Korea. I would strongly not recommend the japchae as I have an ultra hard time chewing the glass noodle. I felt that I would choke on it if I didn’t eat it properly. Hence, it led to my mouth muscles being sore from the constant chewing. Additionally, the noodles are very tough to split. The sauce in bibim noodles isn’t helping the noodles being tasty. The side dishes -kimchi was extremely sour. The anchovies were really tough to bite.

Atmosphere: The shop layout is like a canteen. There a drink stall at the front of the shop and the Korean stall is at the back. I wonder if they are related to each other as you have to place your food and drinks order separately. You may find a table before placing your order. The collection of food and drinks are self service and you have to clear your trays after your meals. The shop can be quite noisy at times as the cashier communicate the orders to the kitchen using a microphone.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101185220797498251612/reviews
Ken Wong,5,"The kimchi soup is amazing—rich, flavorful, and perfectly spicy! The kimbap is also worth a try. A great spot for comforting Korean food.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104876919036679221749/reviews
Cheryl Lee,3,"Food is not bad here though it looks like a deserted cafe. I was quite surprise, quite alot of people walk in to takeaway or dine in. Their soup are of a very big portion, good for sharing, pancake is not crispy, beef is worth ordering, fried dumplings are yum, scrambled eggs taste normal, side dishes are free, only for 1 though! Worth a try if u are near this part of orchard! Cashier has a black and unfriendly face btw..",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107813037784059923389/reviews
