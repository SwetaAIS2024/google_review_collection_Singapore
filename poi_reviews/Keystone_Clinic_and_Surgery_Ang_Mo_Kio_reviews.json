      "text": "I was recently involved in an accident at the gym. While bench pressing a 40kg barbell, it\nslipped from my grip and landed on my chest, causing significant pain. As it was a Saturday and my usual GP clinic was closed, I came across Keystone Clinic by chance.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived, I was met with professionalism and genuine care from Dr. Kay Pang and the staff member, Yanna. Despite it being close to their closing time, Dr. Pang went above and beyondâ€”personally calling the X-ray centre to ensure they stayed open for me.\n\nAfter the X-ray was done, I was surprised and grateful to receive a personal text from Dr. Pang with the results and further advice. I truly appreciate the attentive follow-up and compassion shown throughout. It made a difficult experience much more manageable, and Iâ€™m very thankful for their exceptional care.",

Unfortunately I forgot to ask for their names, one is a Malay lady and the other is a Chinese lady. They provided great recommendations to me and chatted well with patients. The three of them make a great team and they gave off happy, professional vibes. Because there is a female doctor, I was totally comfortable to get my Pap smear / HPV test done here. Thank you!",
