Shi Leng Teo,5,"Food was fantastic. In essence, simple traditional dishes made very well. Waitress who waited on our table was enthusiastic to recommend dishes suitable for both young and old and she was spot on. The family enjoyed the dinner ðŸ˜Š $320++ for 8 pax which was worth it for the quality. Downside is that we were seated next a table of avid drinkers who could share their conversation from across the table occasionally.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112843488529122468117/reviews
Dennis Teo,5,"Have an enjoyable time having dinner after Tree Top Walk. We enjoyed 3tdpw dishes albeit the Claypot Rice and Volcano chicken were on the high side.

Especially loved the curry fish head and Ireland Fat Duck. The fish was smooth and curry texture just nice. Not too thick not too blend. Fat duck skin was crispy and the meat juicy and tasty.

If you know what to order this place will definitely be a delight for you. Plenty of whisky selection too.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107054927604244602176/reviews
Botak,3,"We thought of heading to this nostalgic restaurant for old times' sake and 'The Famous Restaurant', in our opinion, was famous in our minds for the wrong reasons.

The food was really superficial. In fact, some kopitiam had better tasting dishes,  and the price came out to be nearly $300 for 7 of us.

Though the service by the waitress was fantastic,  the chef was really stubborn to insist that the fish we ate had no fishy smell. All 7 of us tasted that awful taste, yet he insisted that it was normal.

It's definitely not worth a second visit. Might have been famous in the past, but definitely, the standard had dropped.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100060791396189603978/reviews
Brandon Lee,5,"Came here for lunch on a quiet, lazy Saturday afternoon.

Ordered the dishes recommended by previous patrons on Google reviews.

All the dishes were excellent, only the KL hokkien mee was slightly overcooked. Noodles too soft for our liking. But the wok hei and taste was spot on.

Would come again to try other dishes.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111058138352724401189/reviews
Kenny Mok,3,"Overall, quite good. Duck a bit dry.
Service wise, if food not available, have to inform us, instead of another dish.
Worth a try!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106588984542467332490/reviews
