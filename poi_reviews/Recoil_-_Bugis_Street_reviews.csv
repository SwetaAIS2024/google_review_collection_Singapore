karthik raj,5,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent Service from miss Isabelle!

I had an amazing shopping experience at recoil, thanks to miss Isabelle! She provided outstanding service with a warm smile, making my visit truly enjoyable. She never disappoints in bringing more and more stylish designs and made sure the shirt I chose fit perfectly and suited me well. I really appreciated her advice on colors that complemented me, which made my shopping much easier. Her attention to detail and customer care were exceptional. I will definitely be coming back! For her attention on customer service l. Highly recommend!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104939349747401662934/reviews
Doraemon,5,"I've been a loyal Recoil customer for years, ever since I first discovered their store in Bugis Street.  I was immediately drawn to their trendy designs and the quality of their clothing.  Their shirts, in particular, have a great fit, and I love the way their cotton feels.  It irons easily and doesn't wrinkle as quickly as some other shirts I've owned.

Kitty and I have made Recoil a tradition for our Chinese New Year shopping.  We always find stylish pieces that we love. This year, we snagged a few new T-shirts and I even picked up a shirt for the festivities.  I was also impressed by their suit sets.  They're so well-priced and stylish, and it's great to find a complete outfit for a reasonable price compare to a tailor shop.

Recoil keeps things fresh with new designs every year, and they always have fantastic sales, especially during Chinese New Year.  We even became Recoil members a couple of years ago, and we've since upgraded to Gold Members.

The staff is very friendly and helpful, although they can be a bit pushy during peak seasons like Chinese New Year. It's definitely busier during those times, but the selection and value are worth it!

If you're looking for couple wear with your partner, Recoil is also a great place to check out. They have a wide variety of matching or complementary styles for couples.

One thing to note is that most of their T-shirts are oversized.  So if you're someone who likes to wear oversized tees, this is definitely the place to come.  However, you can also get smaller sizes if you prefer.  Kitty and I usually go for extra small, which is typically equivalent to a size Medium for us.  If you want a more fitted look, just go down a size from your usual size.

Overall, I highly recommend Recoil if you're looking for high-quality T-shirts, stylish shirts, or affordable suit sets. They're a great option for trendy and stylish clothing at a reasonable price.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112665277904119154671/reviews
KasperxP,5,"One of my favorite places to shop since pre-COVID, this Store offers timeless sleek designs. The quality is good and prices are reasonable.

The Staff are well-trained and approachable.
I'm hoping they have Jogger Pants with two back pockets.

They offer a wide range of products from Caps, Belts to Tees and Pants.
Definitely worth adding some pieces to your wardrobe.

PS: Don't be like some establishments that have no standards yet expect a 5-Star Review. LMAO",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114210666729042004471/reviews
