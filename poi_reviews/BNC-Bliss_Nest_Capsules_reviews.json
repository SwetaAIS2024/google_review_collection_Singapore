      "text": "Was around  area and decided to check out this very unique \"bubble\" tea place, as I have been curious about it for some time. If we can call it \"bubble\" tea, then they have the most extravagant toppings in the form of bird nest!\n\nWhat caught my eyes was how they use real fruit for their fruit tea. The pink lemon was manually pounded, and went onto a shaker machine to shake it thoroughly with the tea.\n\nThe last step was to insert the bird nest capsule, hence the name BNC. The inverted capsule released the bird nest as the tea level in the cup went down.\n\nIt was a very interesting combination of tangy fruit, smoky tea and delicate burd nest toppings. Overall I quite like it. May bring friends next time.\n\nThe staff are friendly and helpful, sharing that the business is a local one, not one from overseas franchise.",

      "text": "I have walked past this place many times and always noticed the friendly staff offering sample drinks without any form of hard-selling. I never paid much attention previously, as I am not a fan of bird’s nest.\n\nThis time, I was roped into ordering and decided to try the Sakura Jasmine tea at 25% sugar. The tea was flavourful and unsweetened. In hindsight, I could have easily gone for 100% sugar to match the sample drinks. Thankfully, the bird’s nest itself was tasteless and added texture to the drink, very much like the pearls in BBT.\n\nPrice-wise, it is a bit steep if you are thinking of it purely as bubble tea, but perfectly reasonable if you see it as a bird’s nest supplement. Definitely worth a try for both bubble tea lovers and bird’s nest enthusiasts alike.",

      "text": "Absolutely love BNC Bird Nests Dessert & Drinks! Their Peach Blossom Jelly Milk with Bird's Nest is my top recommendation—smooth, lightly sweet, and prepared with nourishing goodness. You can even get it warm, which makes it perfect for women during their special period.\nWhat makes this place truly unique is that every drink includes 15g of premium bird’s nest, making it both a treat and a health boost. Plus, they’re the first in the world to offer bird’s nest bubble tea—so innovative! If you’re looking for a refreshing yet nutritious drink, this is the place to be. Highly recommend!",

Their bird’s nest desserts and milk teas are so light and refreshing, with just the right amount of sweetness—no heaviness or artificial taste. I love how each bite feels nourishing, like I’m treating both my body and my skin at the same time. It’s such an easy (and yummy) way to enjoy bird’s nest daily!",
