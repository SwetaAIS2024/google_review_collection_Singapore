      "text": "The vibes here are pretty fun! It looks like you went to a real Korean restaurant. I mean, it is a Korean restaurant, but we are in Malaysia, right? So for me, it's like I'm not in Malaysia ðŸ¤£ whatever. While I wouldnâ€™t necessarily come here for a romantic date (heh), I definitely recommend grabbing a group of friends. Never have I had a more pleasant meal. The staff was so polite and helpful, going above and beyond to make us feel welcome. We had a great talk, and thank you for that. I will definitely come again to taste other dishes. Oh yeah, the kimchi! Damn it, I almost forgot about it. Anyway, the kimchi totally met my expectations. I almost want to ask them for the recipes, haha, or maybe we can minta sikit untuk bawa balik. Kidding ðŸ˜‚",

      "text": "The Korean restaurant at Sunway Big Box Retail Park is a great choice for a cozy and flavorful dinner, especially if you're in the mood for authentic Korean cuisine. One of the restaurant's highlights is its signature spicy stir-fried chicken grill, which is prepared right in front of you on a large pan at your table, adding an interactive and exciting element to your dining experience.\n\nWhile the menu leans towards spicy dishes, there are also milder, non-spicy options available, making it a suitable spot for families with kids or those with different spice preferences. The one thatâ€™s stands out is the \"cheese fall\" â€“ a rich, gooey layer of melted cheese thatâ€™s served in the same pan as the grilled chicken. The combination of the savory chicken and the indulgent, creamy cheese creates a satisfying flavor thatâ€™s hard to resist.\n\nOverall, the restaurant strikes a good balance between bold, spicy flavors and more approachable options, offering something for everyone. Whether you're a fan of Korean street food or just looking for a fun dining experience, this spot is well worth a visit.",
