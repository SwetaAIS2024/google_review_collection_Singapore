      "text": "[St John Jurong Centre is a satellite training centre of SJS. The main centre is the headquarters at Beach road.]\n\nI was an associate first aid and life support trainer with St John for about a decade. Was, because I've finally convinced myself that if I want to keep my sanity in check lest I end up like some of the people working there, it's best if I parted ways on my own accord. There's so much going on in my mind to even think of where to start.\n\nIf you're a prospective trainer, there are many other places where you can start these days where there's less headache, and where business and training is conducted in a fashion that is more consistent in the century we're living in. Go Google First Aid Train-the-Trainer and pick from three or four choices available today.\n\nOh what am I talking about? Of course you knew that!  That's why Singapore First Aid Training Centre (SFATC) and the Singapore Red Cross (SRC) have been churning out trainers like clockwork while St John can't even make up their mind when they'd like to conduct their next Higher First Aid. I don't say this in jest. Just check out their website. 2019 HFA!? Are you still waiting in the last decade while this decade is 30% through?\n\nIf you're a prospective learner looking to enrol in a first aid course, you're in better luck. There are dozens for you to choose from. Go to the Singapore Resuscitation and First Aid Council website, click on 'Directory' and you'll be able to see every single registered first aid training centre in Singapore. Give any of them a call to check availability. There are bad apples out there as well, but that's just something you'll have to do your due diligence.\n\nSt John boldly promises but utterly underdelivers. That has been a trademark of theirs for years. It's basically an oligarch where who's who makes all the decisions, screw the rest. You'd occasionally hear about the 'good ole days' (it usually begins with, \"Last time ah...\") and how St John was 'very busy with so many classes' and 'people queuing up (sic) outside to enrol for class'. Nobody simply wants to admit it. The organisation is in steady decline. It's a miracle I stuck around despite my mum and dad, who are trainers as well, leaving.\n\nI have simply had enough. I've seen enough rubbish. I've heard enough excuses. I do not advocate burning any bridges, but this is something I've decided to do with this organisation. St John will live on in my family as a punchline whenever we need a laugh as it always has been.",
