      "text": "Another fav hangout for my family! We usually get the curry fish head (Curry is delicious without being too spicy at affordable price of $27; cheaper than their Fish Head Steamboat), tofu and vegetables. Today we were surprised to see that their claypot tofu portion were a lot!\n\nUpdated: Went back again and tried the steamboat. Honestly very average only, nice soup but the fish boiled until the meat meh.",

Anyway this place has been here for the longest time despite the multiple change of hands for the other stalls, this is the only survivor that is able to withstand the changes and obstacles for two decades. Popular dishes are the usual fishhead curry , sweet sour pork, prawn paste chicken ,hot plate tofu and the sorts. However for me i like to go for the over-rice dishes w their soup of the day. Dont ask me why, i just like it. If you are here one fine day, dont hesitate to pop by and give it a try. I believe they open till late 11.30pm. Thank me later",

So good you might forget your mother’s name.\n\nI also ordered ginger and onion sliced pork 姜葱猪肉 on a hotplate, and it’s pretty good. Kids favourite - cereal chicken; they finished the cereal and showed thumbs up!!\n\nDouble boiled soup - diff soups available everyday so go for it!!",
