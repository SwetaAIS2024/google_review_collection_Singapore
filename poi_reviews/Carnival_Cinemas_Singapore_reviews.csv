Benedict Correya,4,"Carnival Cinemas offers a good movie experience, especially if you're into Indian or regional films. The auditorium is quite spacious, which adds to the comfort during screenings. While the seating could use some upgrades for better comfort, it’s still a decent setup for the price you pay.

One of the highlights here is the affordability—not just the tickets, but the movie snacks too. It's one of the few places where you can still grab popcorn and drinks without feeling overcharged. The overall atmosphere is casual and welcoming, making it a good spot for a relaxed movie night.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113292377967743781974/reviews

Dr Reviews,4,"A huge cinema hall for those interested  in watching Indian cinema.

The cinema hall itself is huge and clean with toilets for gents and ladies within the cinema hall.

Snacks are not expensive.  Both salted and sweet popcorn is available. Not to mention the decent samosas. Chilli sauce and tomato sauce for those interested are available in self serve press bottles.

Staff are attentive, polite and friendly.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112747621045786494145/reviews
