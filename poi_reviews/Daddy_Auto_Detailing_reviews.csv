Gaia Media,5,"First time. I went to Daddy Auto Detailing to get my motorcycle washed, and wah, I really have to give credit to the two guys there. They took their time and did such a solid job—really very detail-oriented. No shortcuts, no simply sapu and finish. Every part of the bike was properly cleaned, and you can see they really care about doing a good job. Took less than an hour, but the quality was tip-top. If you want your bike to look clean and shiny like new, I highly recommend this place. Good service, friendly people, and really worth it! I ride an ADV bike and they really cleaned all the nooks with a brush. Step by step. Small areas at a time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114398714970458981404/reviews
aira abdul,4,"The Daddy auto detailing shop provides excellent service, with friendly and accommodating owners and staff. I opted for the polish and wax package, which was reasonably priced. Since my home is not too far from the shop, they even offered to pick up and deliver my car once the process was complete. The results were impressive—my car looks clean and shines beautifully!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107232170192073227117/reviews
Haikel Mifzal,5,"I had an amazing experience at this car wash today. I initially came looking for a quick wash, but after seeing the results on the car in front of me, I decided to go for the premium wash instead — and I’m so glad I did.

Three hardworking staff handled my car, and they did an outstanding job. Their attention to detail was impressive, and it was clear they took pride in their work. My car looks spotless, both inside and out. Definitely worth it. Highly recommended!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111208147808076547296/reviews
