Despite i have appointment later at this clinic, was told to reach at the time i called which is half an hour earlier (right now) because they have slot NOW. No need travel time ? As i told her earlier on the phone not nearby , couldn't make it if earlier than appointment time . dont know she even use her brain when she talk. If you want to throw your bad temper in calls, please quit your job. You are not the boss , you are just a worker . Even a boss can't do whatever they want .\nI will not come back for this clinic . Thanks to your old lady receptionist name Tina (her fake name probably) .",
