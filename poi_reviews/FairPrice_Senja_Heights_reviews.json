There is a fresh seafood area, with poultry meats and even sushi which is hard to find in neighborhood Ntucs! You can definitely find more exotic items and the place is quite huge. The supermarket will definitely help the residents nearby. When checking out, the staff was really kind and friendly. Nice cozy FairPrice.",
