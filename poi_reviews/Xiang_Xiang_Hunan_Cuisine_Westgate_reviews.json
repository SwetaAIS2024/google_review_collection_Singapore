It's really a rice stealer.\nBetter to come in a large group so you can try more dishes!",

      "text": "I had a fantastic dining experience at Xiang Xiang Hunan Restaurant in Westgate. The food was excellent, with a variety of flavorful and well-prepared dishes.\n\nThe steamed egg with prawn was incredibly silky and smooth, a perfect comfort dish. The sour and spicy fish was packed with bold flavors and just the right level of heat. If you’re not a fan of peppercorn, you can request for it to be left out. The stir-fried cauliflower was crunchy and well-seasoned, while the eggplant with century egg was a unique and delicious must-try.\n\nOn top of the great food, they offer refillable tea and even have free-flow ice cream and snacks, which is a nice bonus. Service was attentive and efficient, making the overall experience even better.\n\nA tip for first-timers: sign up for their free membership to enjoy exclusive member rates. Definitely worth a visit if you love Hunan cuisine!",
