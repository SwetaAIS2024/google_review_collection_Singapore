Clement Ng,1,"Not recommended..when comes to prices its better for you to do your homework before leaving your bike.. prices are not transparent...I did changes for my fairing of my bike ,steering replacement and wanted to do a major servicing for my bike since they are doing my bike ,so when comes to price asking before proceeding the boss wasn't providing transparency. In the end, quoted 3 times higher then what market has offer comparison with those much more bigger player...anyway my scooter major servcing belt replacement only cost 165 to 200 and this shop quoted me 450 and I did it at other shop at 185 sgd.. no integrity..",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116067463936488916351/reviews
Ganesh Janarth,1,"Very Very Expensive shop! Once I visited because of my motor break down. They diagnosed and found CID and starter rely were defective. And they quoted for those parts almost 3 times of actual price I could get it from parts dealer in Singapore, in addition to that they also imposed me labor charge for the parts.  I told them the pricing is too high!! but they informed that we don't like to repair and ask me take back the vehicle. Due to time constrain, i ended up in repairing my motor at high pricing. My motor was not able to start, they used the scenario to suck money from me. Before you go to this work shop think twice. Otherwise they will suck your money.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109353983663854881787/reviews
