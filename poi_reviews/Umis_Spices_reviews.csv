Asyura Hamli,5,"Those who gave 1 star mainly for the price, you must be living in 2010. Please wake up and have more knowledge of rising costs and rental in Singapore. This shop has the same average price of any other nasi padang I've been to.

Anyways, I was really craving nasi ambeng/nasi padang, and they totally fulfilled my cravings for lunch today. The sambal belacan tops it all, delicious and authentic. Devoured my lunch in less than 10 mins hahahha. Ask for less rice if you're particular, they give quite a big portion for everything.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100459441737940243409/reviews

Ridzuan Azmi,5,"Was surprised to see the low reviews for this shop. The dishes were good especially the lemak ayam. While most nasi padang stalls would have red in the meat but this one was white throughout and tender.

The price is reasonable. If you think it’s expensive then don’t eat out and just cook your own food instead of giving 1 star reviews for the price LOL",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108492923408435428118/reviews
