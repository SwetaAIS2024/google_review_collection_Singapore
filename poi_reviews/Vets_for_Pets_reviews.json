      "text": "As i have a few cats, I am a frequent visitor to Vets for Pets. My regular doctor when i visit is Dr Carol as she is very attentive and patient with us. I made a last min appointment for my cat today and was allocated to Dr Stephanie Chan which was the total opposite and a nightmare.\n\nFrom the beginning, her tone was very rude, rushing, and insulting. When we were trying to understand more about my cat’s diagnosis, she insinuated that my family was not able to afford the treatment by saying things like “you got money ah?”. Instead of providing us with alternative solutions to care for my cat, she just told us to go home and see how it goes.\n\nShe told us about our cat having gum infection, but did not give us a solution or medication. We had to ask the nurse when we were making payment for the consultation and other medicine. When we questioned, she just made a passing remark to say that my cat’s gum is infected and there is no cure but only to have a cream to reduce swelling.\n\nFor those who are thinking of visiting the clinic, i do not recommend looking for Dr Stephanie as not only you will not have any answer to your questions, you will also get look down on by her.",

      "text": "Brought a 2 months old stray kitten a few months back. It was 30 mins to their closing time and they have already closed all registrations. Yet they took the effort to take a look at the kitten. Upon realising the kitten was completely drenched (we found him when it was pouring), they offered to dry the kitten. It was a pure act of kindness. Even tho the kitten was fierce and attempted to ‘attack’ the nurses and doctor, they were calm and very soon took control of the situation.\n\nThey then decided to register him as a last patient and thanks to them alongside all their checks, my kitten is home with me now! I am not sure if the staff remembers the kitten that I brought to them but if they do I would like to show them how healthy and grown the kitten is, after two months!\n\nThanks for all the kind efforts. It really wasn’t gonna be easy finding another vet that is not A&E at almost 8pm. Thank you from ‘buggers’!",
