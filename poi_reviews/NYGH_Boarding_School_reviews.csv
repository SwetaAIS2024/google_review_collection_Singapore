Azaria Wang,1,"The experience in NYGHBS still haunts me after so many years. Undoubtedly the environment and the rooms are nice or rather at the standard. But the regulation and staff management is ridiculous. During my time there, the staff were bigoted and imposed their own standards/ beliefs to others. Despite obtained approval from one staff, it can be very easily revoked by another. If you are looking for some place to stay, I would not recommend this place at all.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104452735450156399672/reviews
Abby Lou,1,"I really don’t recommend this boarding school to you if you are study in an international school in Singapore, you will suffer from discrimination.

Staffs in canteen are unfriendly and rude, my daughter had no appetite to eat more during her period, she just want to have a small bowl of dessert, but the staff didn’t allow her to take it because she didn’t take the main, so that evening she didn’t have anything to eat then. But in fact, there is no such rule, they just want to make difficulties to someone who is new, especially when you are study in an internation school. This happened in August 2018.
The security guard outside the gate is very responsible for her duty, but is also unpolite towards the international students and their visitors.

What is even more unreasonable is that they required students to pack and remove all their stuff in the rooms and take it to a storage room on the ground floor before xmas holiday, but actually your room rental fee was also need to pay. My daughter’s flight was at 9:00am, so she had to leave at 7:00am. The storage room was not available before the office hour, but she was required to empty all her belongings before leave, this forced her to pack all her bed lining, pyjamas, slippers, brush and every thing may need at that night. She then used her backpack as pillow, her jacket as blanket. Every time I went to Singapore to vist her, she was sad and cried as I leave, becasue she didn’t want go back to this hell, after half year, I find another hostel for her, then she was fine to continue her study in Singapore.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114245673656355539935/reviews
