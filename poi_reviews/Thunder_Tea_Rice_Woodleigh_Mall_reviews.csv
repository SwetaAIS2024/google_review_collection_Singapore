Isabella chen,5,"Ordered grab from here. Ordered large with extra veggies and tau kwa. Portion wise, it’s definitely worth it. The large is not just more rice, it’s more rice and more veg. In fact rice and veg/tofu is almost half half, very good value I suppose. I ate it over 3 meals. Not greasy. Nice and crunchy. Good option for healthy vegan food.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108183653579425218635/reviews
Kelly L,2,"Food is good but depending on which staff serves you, you will get a good or bad customer experience. I was served by a non local staff who ignored my call a couple of times. Then when she took my order, she didn’t look me in the eyes when she asked if I want white or brown rice. Then she let out a huge yawn while keying in my order on the system. And throughout, not a single acknowledgement or smile. There are somethings called service and basic courtesy. Which she obviously has none. This outlet has a lot of problem with their staffing it seems. Always change staff, and they are never that interested in making sales. Management, if you read this, please hire and teach your staff how to provide basic service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109159503058914537230/reviews
Ming,4,Tried a couple of times. Pretty good thunder tea rice. Ingredienta were fresh and nicely cooked. Tried the chai po egg and tangy chickpea sides as well. Decent but the chickpea tasted more spiced than tangy.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109226628464118431877/reviews
Tywald,5,"I am not a fan of Thunder Tea, but the other dishes are nice. The price is affordable, the main dish portion is good. I can say main dish 50%, rice 50%, I order the basil chicken, taste is good, and the salt dosage is low.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115392557524528648281/reviews
w s,4,Ordered the Thunder Tea Combo with Basil Chicken (recommendation was brown rice) priced at $11.50. I felt that the Thunder Tea rice was really good just by itself and there was no need to get the Combo.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104487368145234849682/reviews
