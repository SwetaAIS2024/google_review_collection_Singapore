The place is a bit pricier than other JB massage spots I‚Äôve been to, but for the level of care and quality, it‚Äôs still reasonable (though locals might find it a bit steep).\n\nMy masseur, 23, was amazing‚Äîso skilled and thoughtful! He was completely in tune with what I needed, applying just the right amount of pressure. He even served me tea during the session and a dessert afterward. The ambiance was peaceful and quiet, making the whole experience even more relaxing.\n\nThe only small hiccup was the front desk staff, who came off a bit rude when asked for more details about the TCM massage üòï",
