The unprofessional staff washed the boiled eggs with cold water so that his hands don’t get “burnt” as what he told me. Then when served the eggs were cold so I complained, and then another staff overheard this made very sarcastic remark that the eggs are cold because I took my own sweet time finding the change , this is damn rude ! Instead of apologetic , they simply ignored my complaint that the eggs were served cold . Will never patronise this place ever again !",

Food quality is good, consistent and service is very prompt and friendly! It can be very packed during lunch due to the limited space available. Various e-payment modes available.",
