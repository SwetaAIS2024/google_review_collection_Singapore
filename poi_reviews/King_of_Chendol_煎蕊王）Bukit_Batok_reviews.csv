W Lim,1,"Standard has dropped tremendously. Use to love their chendol. Bought takeaway option and upon reaching home, realised the ingredients were all pre-prepared and ice just dump on top. Coconut milk all frozen and cogulated.

Last time, even takeaways are freshly prepared.

Kabuto4698,5,"Chendol is an absolute delight for anyone with a sweet tooth! The perfect combination of shaved ice, sweet coconut milk, and palm sugar syrup creates a refreshing and indulgent treat. The chewy green pandan jelly adds the ideal texture contrast, making each bite a little burst of joy. It's a comforting dessert, especially on a hot day, but also perfect for any occasion. The layers of flavors—sweet, creamy, and just a hint of salty—come together so harmoniously. If you’ve never tried Chendol, it’s a must-try!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105221756222584558369/reviews
Kendrick Wee,1,"Looks good and certainly a good dessert option on a hot day! Tried. Not much queue. Taste was average. Red bean was more like red bean paste. Traditional chendol has a couple of atap seed. This one at $2.50 had none. Hence, I don’t think it deserve to be called chendol, let alone king of chendol.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115793547912532718349/reviews
W L,5,Ordered both the Chendol and Ice Kachang. Thick syrup and fragrance of gula melaka and thick red bean paste. Portion is just nice for after meal dessert. Suits my sweet tooth. Will return for more.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112664375142754063675/reviews
yuanting k,2,"Wouldn’t come back to eat. Too much red bean paste, very overpowering, tasted like iced red bean instead of chendol.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116562152326895918042/reviews
