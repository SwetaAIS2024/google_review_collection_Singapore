Kitty Hello,5,"As a family, we had pratas for the kids and daddyâ€”something simple and always a hit. Mummy ordered chicken fried rice for the kids too, but it looked like a bit too much, so she decided to save it for dinner instead.

She had the fish set meal instead. It turned out to be really spicy for her, but still very tasty!

We heated up the rice using the rice cooker, and it was only while eating that we noticed there were chicken bones in it. Thankfully, we didnâ€™t serve the chicken fried rice to our young kidsâ€”they couldâ€™ve choked on the bones!

Itâ€™s a terrible experience but the chicken fried rice did taste awesome!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108252522171137420524/reviews
Lin Zhi Yong,2,"The lady that takes orders and handles the cashier counter should be sacked.

Rude, inattentive, and always gets orders wrong.

Food is pretty good though.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104559497677873857322/reviews
