Devy Pribadi,5,"Nice food. We went here for lunch. Ordered thei sharing menu: Steamed Flounder in Hong Kong Style, Stir-fried Gong Bao Chicken Fillet, Braised Firm Tofu with Assorted Mushrooms, Stif-fried Spinach with Garlic.
Steamed Fish was fresh and then sauce was nice. Gong Bao Chicken was good and tasty, and the meat was juicy and not dry. Braised Tofu was nice too. The Garlic Spinach (forgot to take picture) was so nice and the texture of veggie was soft.
Overall the food were delicious and enjoyable. Service was good, staff were accommodating, atmosphere is nice.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827903087596800354/reviews
meowskyz,3,"Canton Paradise serves good Chinese food, though it’s on the pricier side. Service was quick, and while not all servers spoke English, everyone was friendly and helpful. We especially loved the deep-fried pork ribs and the crispy fried eggplant with pork floss—both were delicious! We were celebrating my friend’s birthday, and the staff surprised us with adorable piggy buns filled with custard. Overall, a great experience!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103717499800222823321/reviews
