William Lin,4,"I was recommended by a friend to have breakfast here at a traditional Kopitiam and try the Kaya Toast set with bread and eggs.  I should have probably read some of the Google Reviews about this place being CASH ONLY. I only knew this when I got to the front of the line to order. The nearest ATM was not that close, so I had to give this a miss this time. This review is based on reputation and I'll have to come back another day with CASH",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100537437524494981031/reviews
Vee Á•êÂÆÅ L,5,"Catching up with friend who lives nearby.
The curry chicken noodles was nice but the curry gravy is too little, I asked if they can top up for me, the guy said no‚Ä¶ my friend had curry chicken with prata‚Ä¶. I guess she loves it..

Was shocked to know the ginko nut bean curd is $4.20 per bowl but it was worth it I guess? Full of bean curd and it‚Äôs yummy too.. just little over the price ya?

Coffee shop with no air cond and some guys were smoking outside and you can smell the smokes‚Ä¶  I was perspiring and had to change  to the table under the fan‚Ä¶
Tables were were ok ok clean but not 100% clean as I spotted ants..maybe they should get pest control to fix that issue..

Still gave a 5* as I am still thinking about the ginko bean curd after some time üòÇ .. not sure if their other outlets are selling this too‚Ä¶will check out the outlets near my house..

Oh ya, didn‚Äôt have to Q and many tables / seats available as it‚Äôs 3pm on Sat..",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108165100612773637428/reviews
Mana Jalali,4,"Halal chicken curry, prata, ""french"" toast, runny eggs and black kopi. The prata fell short, maybe it needed more butter? I‚Äôve had much flakier. Overall we really enjoyed it.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100043813985138471150/reviews
Han Lee,5,"Really nice curry chicken and kaya butter toast! The kopi is Gao Gao!

What a flagship Killiney Kopitiam. Definitely better than all the franchises and have a lot of touristy stuffs.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115116918025714974988/reviews
Pui Cheng Lum,4,"Due to its location, you could expect to see alot of tourists for this outlet. The shop isn't very big nor it is conducive if you have infants

I recommend their teh, kopi and roasted bread with Kaya butter. Comforting stuffs! Their nasi lemak sambal is dark in colour - it was spicy with a little sweetness with it. This nasi lemak is same same but different than the ones in Malaysia's, I added otah towards it and I enjoyed it",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103360162876432321728/reviews
