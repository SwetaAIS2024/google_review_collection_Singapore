Nice place to have a gathering. We had our breakfast here and we were the first customer. If the shop can have some sound absorbing materials it will be great.

We had a mee siam with fried chicken and a meehoon fish soup. The fried topping on the soup impacted the overall taste and made it oily. The mee siam tastes good with the chicken also ok.

Nice place to revisit. The waitress was also very friendly.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104234572596322175340/reviews
