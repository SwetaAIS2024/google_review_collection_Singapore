ISETAN is the anchor here.\n\nI like the Foods Republic food court. Beautiful interior and good selection of food choices.",

Love how connected it is to public transportation especially Orchard MRT station, at the heart of Orchard Road. Will be back!",

      "text": "Wisma Atria's a great mall on Orchard Road, you know, the fancy shopping street in Singapore.  It's got a cool glass front and you can walk right into it from the MRT station – super convenient!\n\nShopping there's easy:  It's got five floors, tons of stores – over 100! – with a mix of local and international brands.  You'll find familiar names like Charles & Keith and Isetan, but it's not as fancy as ION or Paragon, so it's less crowded and more relaxed.\n\nFood's awesome too!  There's a huge food court on the fourth floor, plus some really nice sit-down restaurants and cafes.\n\nIt's easy to get around, and being connected to the MRT is a huge plus.  It's quieter than other malls, which is nice.\n\nOverall, it might not be the fanciest, but it's a really good place to shop and eat, and it's not too hectic.",
