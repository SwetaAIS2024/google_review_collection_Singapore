Michael Angelo,1,"Came for dinner
Food was bad, the fried rice had egg shells all over the place

Food came very late and streamed in one at a time with a large delay between each serving. Very bad dining experience.

The lemongrass drink is funky I highly do not recommend",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108728484215677676675/reviews
YM Tan,4,"Spicy Thai-Thai Cafe in Bedok presents a mix of flavors and influences, blending elements of Chinese Sichuan, Dongbei (Northern-East chinese), Putien, and Thai cuisines. This variety offers a unique dining experience, though the lack of clear demarcation between cuisines leaves the restaurant feeling ‚Äúneither here nor there.‚Äù The atmosphere is relaxed with a Southeast Asian or Thai vibe, which aligns nicely with its name, but the menu‚Äôs layout feels more aligned with a Chinese restaurant, and the Thai options are somewhat limited.

Despite these identity nuances, the dishes themselves are delicious. Portions are reasonably sized, making it easy to share and sample a variety of flavors. The food is nicely prepared, and every dish we tried was satisfying in taste.

Overall, while the setup may not appeal to those looking specifically for an authentic Thai experience, Spicy Thai-Thai Cafe can be enjoyed as a Chinese restaurant at heart, with authentic Asian cuisine as a supplemental touch.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105649192512753518764/reviews
B,5,"A place where there's chinese dong bei food, Thai food, and putian food, all in one. Great service by the staffs. Love the food, especially the Thai foods. The mango salad is sour and spicy üëçüèª and the fried dong fen is delicious. Definitely coming back again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103734571229186711116/reviews
M Foodie,5,"The fried rice was hands down the best. Tom yum soup was interesting, more spice taste rather than the salt or spiciness. Worth a try",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112717110085656087667/reviews
Aashmika Varma,4,"I WAS SUPER hungry after work and this place was perfect because their service was quick, and they were kind and adjusting enough to make a vegetarian version of their pad thai.

The ambience is sooo nice here and even though it‚Äôs right next to the road, it‚Äôs very calm and peaceful. The weather that day enhanced our experience too!

For a hawker like this, the prices were very reasonable.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104152931382854540911/reviews
