I love it. I would eat it everyday but need to control my calories intake. For house party I will recommend ordering the pork! Price is very affordable too! Uncle and auntie both very nice people!!",

Ordered the more expensive chicken, asking for thigh and drumstick - there was little meat, and whatever meat was given was full of bones, meat was stuck to bone, and tasted dry and old. Even the rice was stale, and cucumbers were bitter. Never ever ordering here again. Please be warned to not eat here if you enjoy nice chicken rice.",

The store sells Roasted and white chicken, roasted duck and etc.\n\nMy favourite will be the white steamed chicken. Taste really good and chicken is tender.\n\nThe auntie, I guess who is the store owner was friendly and cheerful. Usually give a good portion of chicken. The soup I think is not too bad, just that might have msg lol.",
