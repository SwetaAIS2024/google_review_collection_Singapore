Renee Liu,5,"I came here for a company volunteering event , out of my curiosity , I read the google reviews before I came, and the reviews of the parents and previous students put up here made me cry.
The school is for the special needs children and they have a very strict check in and check out process to protect the children.
The teacher to student ratio is quite high, you can see almost one teacher is paired with a child with special needs. Although I was here for only half day, I am very impressed with the patience of the teacher to the individual student with lots of care and love, you will imagine how hard it is consistently.
Here is a place full of angels and love.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106917043711097834165/reviews
