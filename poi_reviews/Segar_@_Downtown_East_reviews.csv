Hamzah Alsagoff,5,"From time to time when we crave a good family dining venue we gravitate and return to Segar at different locations as they continue to please everyone in the family. Itâ€™s just hearty and satisfying soulfood that hits the right spot for us. Itâ€™s been a while and we thought what better than to have our regular family dinner at Segar @Downtown East for iftar or breaking fast. Knowing itâ€™s popular with families we inquired first if it was possible to chope or reserve a table in time or closer to break fast. They were not only accommodative but the lovely young lady who served us kindly helped us to inform the kitchen to prep and get the food ready just in time as the muezzin call for Maghrib signalled it was time to break out fast. How thoughtful and kind. And of course the simple but empathetic gesture of leaving a small bowl of dates for our little family is not only appreciated but loved.

As for the food, it remains authentically delicious and good. Taking a leaf off their profile we are blessed that these two culinary experts came together as co-founders and good friends over the decades to bring us Segar. Paul Tan, a chef trained in Chinese Zichar cuisine from Kuantan, Malaysia, combined with Sulaiman Juahir, a Singaporean, trained in western cuisine, who rose up the ranks in the hotel industry to eventually become a chef, winning numerous awards and accolades in the culinary world in Asia. So we the customers benefit. With their love of great tasting food these two very different individuals hail from two different worlds of culinary tastes, literally, East and West to give us and provide only the best ingredients and cooking styles.

â€˜...With Paulâ€™s traditional Zichar homestyle recipes and wok frying prowess and Sulaimanâ€™s meticulous and precise cooking methodology, processes and quality control they embarked on this journey to create a Muslim Owned group of restaurants spanning over 15 years and countingâ€¦â€™

We took the special package meal set for two for my daughter while I went for their satisfying wok hei style hor fun which is best savoured freshly cooked straight from the kitchen. For my son, who doesnâ€™t eat vegs and lots of other stuff, thereâ€™s their signature fried rice beautifully cooked wok heiâ€™ed so to speak heâ€™s happy with. Of course we added extra dishes to complete the meal.

Be it Segar â€“ they have several outlets at various locations in Singapore â€“ or the other family favourites of ours called A Pohâ€™s Kitchen at Clementi for traditional classic Chinese round table family dining at Clement, we just love them all. We have not had unsatisfying food from any of their restaurants. They are all good. And we are forever thankful they are halal which pleases our blended family with Chinese roots in it.

Big heart hugs from us.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110350566909335567625/reviews
SL Wong,4,"This is a Muslim-owned Halal restaurant at downtown east that serves the usual tze char dishes. Very good. Most of the dishes are delicious. If anything that I felt was lacking was that the portions was slightly small. Other than that, it was good.

As a Chinese who eats tze char regularly, I think this is the closest you can get to Chinese tze char food that is Halal. I would come back to eat again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105996375849930329549/reviews
Salee,5,"Segar offers pocket-friendly prices with generous portions, making it a great spot for hearty meals. Their fish head curry is a must-tryâ€”rich, flavorful, and so good youâ€™ll want to slurp up every drop of the gravy straight from the hotpot. The Mee Goreng is tasty, and you can swap seafood for beef with a small additional charge.

One standout dish is the Tom Yum noodle soup, served in a surprisingly large bowlâ€”something you donâ€™t often see. Itâ€™s hands down one of the best Tom Yum broths Iâ€™ve tried!

Overall, Segar delivers good food and good service, making it a worthwhile dining experience.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111711720697734070033/reviews
Sten (Piqued Wanderer),4,"Not bad of a place. When we arrived there wasnt much of a crowd.

Lets dive in!

Food:
Food is tasty and maybe we were hungry since we jz got out from hospital ðŸ˜‚.

Service:
Staff were smiling, but just the server.. maybe they had a crowded lunch timing, so they kinda looked tired ..

Atmosphere:
Staff were resting around and didnt look that presentable actually. Maybe a divider would be more pleasant looking so that staff are not obviously resting at the eating area. Deco looked great tho!

All in all, felt like a humble place to go to. So ya, cheers!!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115011929186540431052/reviews
Yeo Choon Kuan (Jackson),4,"There seemed to be no system in allowing customers to be seated. As we ate in the restaurant, we saw people just walked in when they spotted empty seats at the table. No formal structures to tell customers to queue up and wait to be attended. They seemed short handed on weekends. The food is okay but minimum price is $10 before taxes and GST.  Right in front of the restaurant is the customer service booth. It is very convenient to pop over and redeem your carpark charges. They do not need your receipt but the digital receipt is good enough ðŸ˜ƒ",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105250364240796830392/reviews
