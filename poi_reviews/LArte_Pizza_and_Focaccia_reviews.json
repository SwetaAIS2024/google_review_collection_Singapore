      "text": "I had a great experience at this pizzeria! The crust is the star of the show—super crispy, perfectly baked, and full of flavor. High quality of their ingredients. However, I do wish the portions were a bit larger for the price($8 before GST for 1 slice). It felt a little small for what I paid, but the taste definitely made up for it. If you're a fan of crispy crust, this place is worth checking out, just keep in mind the portion sizes. Overall, still a solid choice for pizza lovers!",
