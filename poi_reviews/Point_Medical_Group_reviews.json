Although there were quite a few people for a Sat morning but the counter staff, nurses and doctors were all super lovely and the wait wasn’t too long. We finished everything quite quickly at the clinic and then went off to level 8 for the x rays. The staff made my toddler feel comfortable throughout. All in all, our whole family finished in around 2 hours :)",

      "text": "Was skeptical at first due to the reviews but still go ahead as they have an earlier date and the pricing is cheaper as compared to other DHA approved panel physicians. Please note that the center only accept booking through Whatapp. Another advice is to print the relevant documents for faster and smooth registration and processing. Otherwise, charges will be incurred if you need them to print.\n\nThe clinic staff are all friendly and helpful. The registration and payment are smooth, the medical check such as urine test are swift and minimum waiting time needed. The clinic have outsourced their phlebotomy service to third party company and the staff are very friendly and most importantly skilful!\n\nNext, I was attended by Dr Irene Ong who is a very patient and nice. She will explains and share with me the initial physical examination result which is very assuring for me.\n\nLastly, aside from the phlebotomy service, the radiology service (Radlink) is also outsourced and will be instructed to proceed to the lower level at same building to do the necessary scans. The clinic will clear the payment first before heading over to the radiology department and after that you can go home as that will be the last stop.\n\nOverall, the whole process is smooth and it is a pleasant experience for me. Kudos PMG!",

      "text": "NOT TRUSTWORTHY\n\nFor my visa application I informed the receptionist to get HIV, Hepatitis B & C testing. She said the result would be submitted directly to Embassy after 5 working days.\n\nBut it had not submitted until over 2 weeks. As follow-ups, I had to call them multiple times because they usually replied that clinic in-charge was not around. Sometimes they took my number but never called me back. All email links mentioned on their website had also been invalid. The valid emails they provided also never responded my enquiry.\n\nWhen I was able to talk, the staff on phone mentioned that the results had been ready and would be submitted soon. I also realized that different staffs used only one name “Angela” on phone.\n\nAfter nearly a month I received a call from clinic asking me to revisit for the 2nd time blood withdrawal as they forgot to test Hepatitis B & C. Then why did she mention all my results had been ready for submission during my previous enquiries? When I asked her supervisor’s email, she provided one which I finally found it out as her own personal gmail instead of supervisor’s one. Such a liar!\n\nI didn’t get the service equitable for the money I paid.",

Yes, they never pick up their calls but they are super efficient in replying via WhatsApp. The lady who made the booking for me was very friendly and she helped me make an urgent appt for the next day.\n\nWhen I reached, she already had the form printed out for me to sign etc. The other lady who took my blood pressure was also very kind as my BP was higher than usual (white coat syndrome) and she gave me the assurance that it'll be OK.\n\nThe dr who attended to me (I think it's dr Irene) was lovely too. And she tried ways to calm me down and in the end my BP was normal. She also explained her observations clearly to me.\n\nSo I really don't understand why they have 1 star reviews",
