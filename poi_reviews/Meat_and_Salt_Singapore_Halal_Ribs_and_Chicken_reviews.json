      "text": "After a couple of failed attempts to dine here, finally got the chance! Especially looking forward to it as they were supposedly the previous Charcos where I loved the beef and lamb ribs with the choices of delicious sides. Even the double patty beef burger with fries at an affordable price. Would drive (with colleagues in tow) out of my way just to eat at Charcos @ AMK back then.\n\nOrdered beef and lamb ribs, corn dog and spaghetti. Alas, to my dismay.. it was way off. The meat was tough and the sauce was mediocre. The sides were ok but not enough of a saving grace. Corn dog looked like boiled sausages with sauce and mayo.\n\nGood to try once so I know never to dine here again.",

Coleslaw was awesome too!\n\nI saw a review here on the beef ribs which was bad. Indeed it was! BUT why I'm putting a review here is due to the fact that, I gave a direct feedback on how tough it was to chew to the staff and he was very sincere to rectify by forgoing the charge.\n\nBut I insisted to pay as it's just business and hope that others will not suffer the same fate. In the end he gave a discount.\n\nI believe they'll be better next time and I'll try their beef ribs again!",
