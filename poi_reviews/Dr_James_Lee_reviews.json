I chose him as he is patient and approachable. Every concern was explained in detail and he always provides a well-balanced view. My fears were allayed as he provides several solutions without being pushy and insistent.\nPost-surgery, Dr Lee continues to provide excellent service with his positive and assuring ways. Till now, I am able to contact him if there are any health-related concerns.\n\nThe nurses and the service staff at the Astra Women's Specialists by SMG clinic are very helpful,  professional and prompt in replying to my requests.",

      "text": "I consulted with Dr James Lee at Astra Oasis Terraces, Punggol. He is a very patient and friendly doctor, amiable and approachable. Waiting time can be quite long up to 2 hours at times, but I’m alright with it because I know he gives every patient his listening ear and it’s going to be the same when it’s my turn to see him. Every concern will be addressed and he always provides well balanced view. We followed up with him from trying to conceive until we gave birth and post partum follow ups. Dr Lee is very thorough and experienced and doesn’t force his views on you. His team of nurses are very efficient and customer oriented too!\n\nThey will inform how many patients are before u, and If waiting time is too long they will inform us to reach the clinic later via phone call.",
