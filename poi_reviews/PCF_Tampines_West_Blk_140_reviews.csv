Jonathan Tan,1,"First visit to the school to let the teachers and principal to evaluate. Being a 3 year old kid, it's very natural for them to be active and noisy. Received a call few days later saying that they don't have slot for kid with special needs and ask me to reconsider. (I keep reassuring my kid is normal but the person keep asking me to reconsider, repeating more than 3 times. It very obvious they want me to cancel the enrolment) Without understanding deeper you already deem my kid with special needs. I really think you failed as an educator for being such shallow and judgmental. Better stay away from such place especially this outlet as the whole bunch of teachers including the principal doesn't have the heart to run a childcare.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117155523558662366210/reviews
