Sherry Baker,5,"Great variety of Malay dishes! Super delicious! 😋 Authentic old-school dishes like ""sayur lemak turi keledek"", ""paru lembu sambal belado"", which are hard to find & come by unless you visit those ""ulu kampong warongs"" in Malaysia. The ""sambal belachan"" is super fiery! Proceed with caution! 😝😜🤪

They have beef bakso noodles, the usual culprits like lontong, mee siam, mee soto, soto ayam, mee rebus etc.

Of course, you should try the mee soto with extra bergedil. 😋😋😋

Y'all must try it, yo!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117615120160249975025/reviews
