EQ Xavier,3,"Ordered an egg soup as I am wanting something warm on a cold day. The soup has eggs, pieces of soft tofu, some minced meat, vegetables inside. This comes at $6 for a bowl, it's pretty average taste. Next is the salted egg pork chop, there are about 5 pieces of meat which comes at the price tag of $6.50. I would say the portion is consider lesser than average. There is not enough sauces to be mixed with all the rice. Taste wise there is some chilli padi thrown in so I would say it's also average. Overall it's a normal casual zichar store who those who stay nearby.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105533019712721928126/reviews
Benson Heng,2,"Have been patronising this store for awhile now. Although the food is decent, the service is far from acceptable. Just pure rude when taking order. And when the food came, they placed the food diagonally across me on the table beside me (there were two tables combined together). It‚Äôs not my first time facing such attitude but it‚Äôs definitely my last.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109502110535479218021/reviews
Joey Tan,5,"Great food with good service. Ordered sambal fried rice, salted pork rib and BBQ stingray. Fried rice is not spicy and tasty, kids enjoy it very much. Salted pork ribs and BBQ stingray are also highly recommended. See almost all other tables ordered fried prawn balls, will definitely come back again to try it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103562749714113432825/reviews
