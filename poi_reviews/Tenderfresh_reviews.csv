J,5,"Bought couple times from them! Tried their chicken cutlet spaghetti üçù  and cream of mushroom spaghetti which was decent & yummy! Food always cooked on the spot so need to wait 5-10 mins. Chicken wing was yummy and salty!!!! Omg love the skin, fried nicely and it‚Äôs was hot~",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108836346505805335103/reviews
R R,2,"This place used to be pretty good with deliciously cooked chicken at a reasonable price. However their basic set has now gone up from $4 to $6.5. I get that there's inflation...but there's also shrinkflation. The portions have also shrunk and the chicken are no longer as well cooked. Most of the time, they taste bloody. Standard and quality has fallen big time. Really sad about this because they used to be pretty good. The nice uncle and auntie who used to tend to the counter don't seem to be there anymore and they were friendly and attentive. The staff there now sometimes just ignores you...",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100101899664551710450/reviews
Merlin SG,2,"Some days the fries is hot and good.. Some day it's cold (not even warm) like today, when fries are cold it taste really bad.. Need to find some way to keep fries in it's hot/warm edible state.. I bought at non peak hour 11:20am. Eat at 11:30am. Bun is not fried properly and cold as well. Luckily the chicken cutlet is warm. Service staffs are helpful most of the time.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105190302021140765635/reviews
Dolly Sim,1,"Highly disappointed. Bought a 3 piece meal. The size of their drumstick is the same size as the chicken wing drumstick. I know there is inflation, but I don‚Äôt think you should cheat yr customers this way.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113098566010983966327/reviews
