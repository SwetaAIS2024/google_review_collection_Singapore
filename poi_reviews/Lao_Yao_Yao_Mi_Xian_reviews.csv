SuperShy Gel,4,"Decent thick rice noodles. Generous portion. Might even be suitable for sharing.

Soup base is not too oily and heavy. Great for slurping.

Long queue during lunch hours!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104772022056749613637/reviews
Vanessa Tan,1,"Ordered mala xiang guo 麻辣香锅from the same shop. Total was $18 mostly vegetables and mushrooms and some slices of beef

It took about 10 to 15 minutes to prepare and it was not hot. It was lukewarm at best. And mind you, i ate it immediately after it arrived because i was so hungry. How can you serve food that is not hot? So i requested to refry it because it was not hot. Lady at the counter was judgy probably the first time she has heard this??

And once again, to my amazement and the chef’s professional skills, it was still lukewarm??? HOW????

Consider this the best way to waste your money. You can eat the mi xian from the next stall but i would 100% stay away from eating mala here

Worst mala i had in my life so far",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110679538561876302414/reviews

V Yao,4,"Haha, my friend recommended this place. I really like the rice noodles! This crispy pork with pig intestines is so delicious! 8 yuan for happiness! But the environment is just a very ordinary food court. I will patronize it again next time if I am still nearby!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108906482480642082712/reviews
