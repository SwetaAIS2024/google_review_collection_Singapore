Chun,5,"A niche high performance tennis academy with an experienced and technically competent team led by Coach Alex.  The coaches are clearly passionate about the game seeing how committed and nurturing they are, taking a genuine interest in the child’s overall development (tennis and beyond).  They also actively engage parents as partners in developing the child’s game.  Thanks to the coaches’ unwavering dedication and support, my son and daughter have seen their game raised by several notches since they joined ALC 4 years ago.  Without any hesitation, I would highly recommend ALC to any aspiring competitive player.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106724418599572525173/reviews
