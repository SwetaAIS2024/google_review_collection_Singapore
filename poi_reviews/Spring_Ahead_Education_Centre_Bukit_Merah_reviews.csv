Mani Gta,5,My daughter has been attending Spring Ahead education center and she absolutely loves the center. Her teacher is amazingand her teaching program is great. My daughter has started words and sentences in a very short period of time. Through the teacher's classes and lessons my daughter is very confident in picking up a book to identify the words and read. With the one to one time with the teacher she is learning tremendously fast. Great teacher -great education center.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110729170824861631393/reviews
