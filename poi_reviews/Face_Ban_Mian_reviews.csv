감귤맨TV Orange Man,5,"Very Nice soup taste ~!
Make me thought Korean fish soup very deep taste !!

I add more dry fish and chili sauce!
I recommend this way !!

Dumpling also full inside !! So i can taste enough

I recommend set menu if you dont know what you eat.

Worker is very kind and service rate is nice !
Plz keep this service quality.

I will try other menu if i visit here again.
Maybe 100% i will visit next time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116848468021520726806/reviews
Chris J.,2,"Have tried other outlets - this outlet’s dishes are poorly prepared and staff attitude is very poor as well. Often get orders wrong as well. For this price, other stalls are more worth patronising.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100057718070601765740/reviews

K Ken,1,"Worst experience ever. Ordered the normal ban mian and 2 normal dried version.

Was charged additional $3 dollars extra as she already cooked and will not refund, especially so when you paid up first.

Never patronizing this stall by the lady helper. Have attitude problem.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115032770151225892763/reviews
Claudine Teo,1,"Terrible terrible service. Not recommended. Similar to the others that have commented, the service attitude is atrocious. I order soup ban mian to takeaway and the noodles was not packed separately. When questioned, the Chinese lady said I never request. I see all other grab orders were packed separately. She even argued with me that they have been doing this le not packing separately for many years. I just went through the facebanmian website which indicate that all soup noodles are packed separately BY DEFAULT! The service staff are simply cutting corners.

Btw, The face ban mian website do not have anywhere for feedback. That also shows they do not care about customer feedback.

I would suggest customers do not patronise them. We deserve better! Money better spend elsewhere.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117283563512747920634/reviews
