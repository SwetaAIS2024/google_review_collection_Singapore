Arthur Chen,5,"I’ve been really pleased with my experience at this family clinic. The receptionist was polite and handled my check-in with care, making sure everything was in order without any hassle.

The nurses were attentive and took the time to go over details of the medicine, though it could get busy at times.

Dr Tan Yan Yuan stood out—professional and focused. He listened to me and addressed my questions thoughtfully, and did not make the appointment feel rushed.

Would return and recommend.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101551006650291762633/reviews

Marcus Siew,1,"Very lousy, went 3 times but still cannot recover and getting worst. This Dr Tan keeps suggesting to buy other products not covered in the health plan and gives very poor medicine which are ineffective. Very disappointed.

Follow-up after clinic replied - He mentioned that additional are excluded but he keeps selling those expensive stuff and not giving advice to procure some normal usage outside. More interested in selling products then trying to access the sickness and getting the right medicine. He keeps saying it is improving when I told him it is getting worst and non of the medicine is working, he totally ignore it and never once mentioned to quickly come back if it don't work.

If I decline my treatment I wont be going 3 times to this clinic and even if 3 times, he dont even bother to find out more nor think of other solutions, just keep selling his products.

It wont be 3rd opinion as it will be the 4th visit, it is not free you know and I have no idea what time this 3rd opinion will be in.

Angelica Vien Cruz,1,"I came to this clinic for a mandatory MOM blood test. Unfortunately, the nurse who drew my blood punctured a vein, leading to substantial swelling and bruising. The bruising lasted for two weeks, and I needed a follow-up appointment to check for infection. I'm still recovering three weeks later.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109456415570950407604/reviews
Camelia,5,"By far the best clinic I've ever been to with such an efficient workflow system. Fantastic queue management as well. Too bad the clinic assistants have a tiny counter to work with, but if not, everything about this new clinic is great. Both Dr Yuen and Dr Tan are very patient and caring - always ready to answer any questions you may have.

Apr 2024 edit: Dr Lee Jing Kun is very patient and caring. In fact, a lot more empathetic than Dr Tan. I've been visiting this clinic since it opened, and now with my LO too. 10/10 will recommend making an appointment and visiting Dr Lee if you can",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107411580076799082085/reviews
