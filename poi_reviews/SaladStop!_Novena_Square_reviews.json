I reckon it's because I placed my order just before closing time, and the rice may have been sitting in the pot too long and got burnt. Thankfully, the other ingredients were quite tasty. What a shame--it could have been a great meal.",

      "text": "Used to eat this few years back and reminds me of the days where I couldn't grab a decent lunch and had to do quick takeaways at Salad Stop. They have closed down quite a lot of branches so it wasn't easy to come by, and took the opportunity to try again when I saw it at Novena Square.\nGone are the days when you still can pick free toppings. I actually asked for it and they told me there are no free toppings anymore, and gone were the days where I could spend less than $12 but now it costs more than $20!\nSome of the items in the menu have also gone and replaced with new ones, so I decided to try Jeju Bap rather than the usual Jai Ho.\nPretty nice and friendly staff had a short chat with them. Food was of quite generous portion still was very filling after finishing the wrap. Taste of the pumpkin soup hasn't really changed over the years, but still preferred the days where we used ground black pepper instead of the powdered one.\nExpensive but still pretty decent and a healthy option to choose.",
