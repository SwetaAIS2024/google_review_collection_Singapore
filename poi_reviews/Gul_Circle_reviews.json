I was on the last train and overshot my stop, ending up at Gulf Circle past midnight without a train back, so I asked the service counter where to find the bus stop.  Charles stepped out however and accompanied me to the stop, even waiting for me to board the bus. He did so as he knew how dangerous it would be for a young girl like me at night. I felt extremely safe that night and grateful for his accompaniment. Thanks Charles and all the best to you!",
