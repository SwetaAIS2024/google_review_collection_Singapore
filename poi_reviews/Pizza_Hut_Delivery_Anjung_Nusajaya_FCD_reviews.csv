C M,1,"Worst Pizza Hut I have ever encountered in my life.

Ordered two pan pizzas, one was burned to a crisp, the other was undercooked. It was like they were trying to balance their mistakes across two different pizzas and ended up messing up both.

The worst thing? The response to a complaint about food quality and safety was that it was still edible and no returns or refunds were permitted ðŸ˜‚

For this level of quality and service they should just close down and fire all their staff.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105067591892033074764/reviews
jia x,1,"What we ordered here was different from what they delivered, so we called them and asked them, saying it was our problem. The question is, we have been waiting for more than an hour, why do you still make mistakes?",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112208314522444488071/reviews
Matt Yazer,3,So this place is not even a restaurant for you to eat dine-in. It's more build just for the a delivery order. Space is super small . Give you 3star because the spaghetti Bolognese were not just right for me. And the garlic bread is awful omg I cant describe it.  Service is fast thou and the environment is full of odour from their oven . Floor is  clean but its too small for a restaurant .,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100348811894655993780/reviews
DR. NNID GAMING,1,"Order takeaway directly at the counter but still get order wrong, my sides got changed, my garlic bread missing. While waiting, I keep seeing the employees do their job badly, throwing the boxes, slaming things.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107020959133010531715/reviews
Jumari Rubaih,3,"Pizza Hut entry. The place is a 15 min drive from Tuas 2nd Link . There is a barber shop, minimart, Islamic Warisan showcase, and carpark parking is a breeze. Touch and go auto reload is also available. Pizza is average and services are so so. For those that are on along the way could grab a bite there for support.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103558306886604392536/reviews
