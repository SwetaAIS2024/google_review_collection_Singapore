erin,5,"My son started attending Tinkerland childcare Centre in July, and we’ve already seen so much improvement day by day. A special shoutout to Lisheng Laoshi—her dedication, warmth, and passion for teaching have made a significant impact on my child’s growth and confidence.

We’re truly fortunate to have her as his teacher!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108145288726912231796/reviews

張Young Soon - YS,5,"My boy have been attending class at Tinkerland (Jln Pari Burong) for more than 6 months now.

Although he only attends 2 hours per day, I can still gradually see improvement to his social skills and recently keep hearing him singing ABC & 123 while he is playing at home.

Thanks 🙏🏻 to all the teachers at Tinkerland for their patience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102496270911801132044/reviews

The teachers are very nice and friendly. Additionally, we can closely communicate with various ways, such as in person, via WhatsApp, and via other communication app. Thank you very much!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114686765397256190903/reviews
