Swati Pai,5,My son loves going to playgroup every day. All thanks to the teacher Salina and Liyana for such a wonderful playful and comforting environment for the kids! They send regular updates of all the activities and are so patient and kind. We have truly seen our son Vihaan thrive :),2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107387318663038410058/reviews
Nirmani Karunarathne,5,"Ms.N Karunarathne -M of baby Okith.

What a great class as always this morning! I know the kids always have the best time at ‘Star Tots’ (E. asks every morning if we are going!), but I also find myself calmer and more focused after spending time in your playgroup! I am saying it all the time: if anybody needs a great address, this is our favourite class ever! My baby speaks about the class with such enthusiasm and joyfully. We love the playgroup! It’s welcoming and feels very communal. We love the structure of starting and ending. Teacher Salina is a mindful teacher/host; she is very present with the children and the parents and offers her skills in a loving way.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109429807249294085744/reviews
