Matilda Lim,5,"Oysters are super fresh. There was two kinds of oysters in that platter, French  which was more briny and Irish which was sweeter. Lumpfish caviar and shallot vinaigrette are included in the platter.

Crabcake and clams was on the salty side. Caviar tart was great but have to work through the creme fraiche slowly. Wish the lobster roll had chunkier filling though",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104279112810113355814/reviews
Faye P,5,"Absolutely love The Oyster Cart! Came by during their happy hour oysters all night promo and got the 12+6 pieces deal ‚Äî you're getting premium quality without breaking the bank.

The oysters were incredibly fresh, with a fantastic selection of Irish and French varieties that hit all the right notes: briny, nutty, and sweet. Every piece was perfectly shucked, and you can really taste the difference ‚Äî they only serve live oysters, never frozen, so the flavour and texture are always on point.

Will definitely be back again (probably too often). Highly recommend for oyster lovers or anyone looking for a chill night out!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114865130830747952227/reviews
Wang Poh Peng (Ric Wang),5,"Quiet cosy place for good oysters. Strongly recommended to try their fresh oysters!

Esther,5,"Amazing oysters! My husband said they were the freshest and tastiest he's had in Singapore, ever. Much better than significantly higher end restaurants with double the price tag. The lobster and duo crab / prawn rolls were to die for - well balanced dressing and super fluffy brioche. All the seafood dishes we ordered were outstanding. The caviar tart is a must try. Overall we felt that there was a lot of care put in to each dish and the ingredients were very fresh. We loved the balanced acidity in their dishes as well. Free corkage is üëè Truly good value! We had no issues with the pace of the service as well, but do expect a slow and relaxed meal. The food, the company and the drinks kept us well occupied. Will definitely be back!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110588032754306869427/reviews
Fridolin Blumer,5,"My go to place for best quality of oysters here in Singapore. Whenever we have a celebration, I turn to Adam and his Team at The Oyster Cart for mouthwatering oysters. Their delivery service is top. The oysters are nicely shucked and come with a lovely basic sauce. You can also top up with special sauces. Best of success guys and to a next occasion!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111903704517291393608/reviews
