Wong Wei Jian,5,"Tried the meatball soup and braised pork rice combo. Rice was decent, though not spectacular. Soup, on the other hand, was memorable. Very tasty, which also meant the radish was infused with flavour. Meatballs were substantial, had a good bite and incorporated mushrooms for additional flavour and texture.

Menu is rather extensive - would return to try their other dishes",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108660908041980866676/reviews

LULU EVOX,4,The uncle looks unfriendly and no smile.. but I give a try and order tabao.. when reach home and open up to eat.. Fuyooo.  it has So Much Meat!! The MEAT is more than rice. Oh My GOD.. I order the Signature Mix Combo.. rice absorb  the sauce is damn good. I would not said is taste better then those I eaten in Taiwan but I would said this is really value for money.
