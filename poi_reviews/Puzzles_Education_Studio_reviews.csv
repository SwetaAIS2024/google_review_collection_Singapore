Sarah Foo,5,"Denise is very patient and kind when teaching, and she also tries her best to cater to our skill level when conducting classes. Being able to ask her questions outside of class, and book extra consultations definitely helped me with my understanding of math!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102738034184613146594/reviews
Nikolay Stefanov,5,"I havenâ€™t been in this class, but I know that the teacher is amazing ( Denise ). Ever since Iâ€™ve watched JianHao Tan she was one of my favourite characters . I bet she is one of the best teachers in all of Signapore. And I hope in the shows you get back with JianHao ðŸ˜†

Edit: I am so sorry for the misunderstanding. I rated it 5 stars but I gave it 1 star. Anyway I support every step of Deniseâ€™s career. I hope you accept this as an apology for the misunderstanding. And thank you that you are going to tell Denise about the comment. Means a lot.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118391365130956753695/reviews
ashley tey,5,"although iâ€™ve only been there for less than a year, itâ€™s been an amazing experience.
Denise is patient and kind and sheâ€™s willingly to go the extra mile for her students, she never leaves anyone behind and will always check on our well being and progress, making the experience very heartwarming:) she truly is passionate about her students and it really shows when she goes above and beyond for us. Nearing exam season, she never fails to make herself available so that we can have consultations with her even though it could be late into the night. she also makes the learning environment very cozy and allows us to learn in a relaxed space without any pressure or stress. iâ€™m truly SUPER SUPER grateful for a teacher like Denise and iâ€™m really excited to continue with her for As ðŸ’ªðŸ’ª",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102185122140160267167/reviews
