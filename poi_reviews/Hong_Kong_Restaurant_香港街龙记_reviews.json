The kam heong fish was good, it was fragrant and spicy. But I would consider asking for fish fillet instead of fish head.",

The taste is ok but the bee hoon texture is quite hard and chewy.\nThe Ëã¶ÁìúÁÇíËõã I think not bad as well. Even thou today the chef didn‚Äôt cook the taste evenly.

Ingredients are not generous enough. Xinzhou meefen is a pass. Not enough taste. Charsiew cut too small for a good taste. Lemon chicken is too hard. Too much batter. Sauce is just passable.
