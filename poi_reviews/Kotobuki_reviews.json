The sashimi is exceptionally fresh, and the ambiance is authentically Japanese, which enhances the dining experience. However, there was a disappointing moment during our visit when some of our meals took 45 minutes to be served due to a kitchen oversight. While the quality of the food is commendable, the service could use some improvement to ensure a smoother experience for diners.",

They forgot about the dipping sauce for my tempura but quickly serve me one when I asked for it.\nThe set lunch is value for money, while the ala carte is a little pricy given the location and the restaurant is in needs of renovation.",

Overall, the food was average, not superb, The rice is not Japanese rice.\n\nThe service was good, except for the fact that the online ordering system wasn't working. We waited for quite a while for our order, only to find out when we checked with the waitress. It would be better to remove the QR code for online ordering.",

The menu is impressive, providing private dining spaces perfect for large groups, which adds a special touch to the dining experience. While the air conditioning may struggle on particularly hot days, this does not detract from the overall quality of the food and service. I'm giving it five stars because I believe the current Google rating of 3.9 undervalues what this place has to offer. Highly recommended for those who appreciate good food in a comfortable setting.",
