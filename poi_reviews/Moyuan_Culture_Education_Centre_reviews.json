The teacher we met once even asked kid erase the whole drawing when he was finishing it soon in the end class, as she just found the wrong drawing when parents picking up. I donâ€™t know why she didnâ€™t  guide during the class to avoid redrawing.Then I got to know she was busy at her own business, even leaving long time. Besides, they would make mistakes on attendance report and fees are always interested month by month.",
