Even with doctors memo, the school always fail in following instructions. Doesn't remind the students or parents of an important exam coming up. Which end up the students to lose the marks and drop to NT level. And they also will not rectify their mistakes. Only give reasons. Please for your child's own future. Don't choose this school",
