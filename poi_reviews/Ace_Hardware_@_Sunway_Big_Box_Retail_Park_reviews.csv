burasakIsMyFav,4,"This store has a lot of US hardware and household products that are rarely found in local shops. Prices can be a bit high, but the sales are worth checking out! I scored a great deal today—mason jars that cost RM18.80 each on S****e were only RM44.97 for 12 after a 70% discount. So happy with this find! Definitely coming back to hunt for more rare and imported items.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108220409995858603041/reviews

Mark Trickett,3,"Lots of stock is only displayed in American sizes. No indication about metric sizes and when I asked the staff was told to use my phone.
Also, still no Bells of Uranus after asking for the last 2 years.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103036486023273967173/reviews
