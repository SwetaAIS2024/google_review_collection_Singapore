      "text": "The service is top-notch. We came in during a stormy Saturday evening without a reservation.  The tables were all booked except for the al fresco ones, which easily get wet.\n\nThe more senior lady staff, upon seeing us struggle to make a decision whether to eat outside or make a move, told us to come inside before doing some calculations and making a table available for us. Even though this meant that we could have eaten slowly and disrupted the reservation party, they did not mention it or push us to speed up.\n\nThe same kind lady, even had great initativeness and spotted a cooler bag we had and asked if it was a cake she'd like to help us put in the fridge. ðŸ¤—\n\nWe made our orders, and all came out fast and super tasty. Favourite was the calzone! Will be back! And do remember to make a reservation!\n\nTaste:\nBeef Ragu Calzone 5/5 (Omg The onions and ragu! ðŸ˜‹)\nCheese baked bolognese penne 5/5 ðŸ¥°\nMeat Lover Pizza 4/5\nIced chocolate 4.5/5",

      "text": "Place is situated just at Concourse along Beach Rd. Not difficult to get to.\nWent 2 weeks back for a Friday dinner when it was raining heavily. Small cozy little space with just a few seating capacity.\n\nGot a starter, side and pizza to share for 2 person. Food portion was good. Just right for 2 persons to share. Mozzarella Salad was fresh and came with thick slices of mozzarellas and tomatoes, taste was okay. Truffle fries was fragrant and portion was really good. Pizza was nothing too spectacular, wish it could be better!",
