LP Pua,4,"I ordered six coin prata with standard chicken curry (without the chicken) for $3.50. The curry was thick, which I liked, slightly spicy but not overpowering, and paired well with the prata. The prata was beautifully presentedâ€”crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside, making it quite enjoyable. However, the kopi-o gao kosong was disappointing as it tasted diluted and lacked punch.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews

CK C,4,"This eatery recently took over the unit vacated by Cheval/Chi Bao. Apparently, it was a tenant about six years ago. The menu is impressively diverse, consisting of Chinese Zi Char, Western food and Indian cuisine. Staff was friendly. I only had a teh halia, which was not bad. Overall, a cosy (and interesting because it is beside a swimming pool) environment to have a meal.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Jon Peng,3,"Price of Food is on the high side but portion is above  average.
Fried rice is tasty.
Prata is crispy but the internal is a little undercooked.

Teh halia is not using fresh ginger juice. Won't recommend to order.

Aircon dining area  is available but the food smell lingers after u finished dining .

Outdoor area is very warm.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112666739737001299012/reviews
