Dale Mac,3,"Not one for me unfortunately... but alright if you're in the area...

Standout item was the Lo Mai Gai; which comprised of well-seasoned chicken and evenly cooked flavourful glutinous rice.

The Char Siew Bao had a heavily sauced filling (favourable to a lot but not me personally) which was heavy on the ""sweet"" and low on the ""smoke"".  Bao wrapping itself was not dry but too thick for me.

Average items were
Big Pork Bao, Pork Belly Bao (which was well under seasoned in my personal opinion).

Sub-par was the Siew Mai (absolute no-no for me).

Service, which i have read can be ""rough"" from other reviews, was fine.

Anyway, not one for me, but do give it a try and decide for yourselves ‚úåüèº",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113950514812482140406/reviews
T,5,Kong ba bao super shiok! Char siew bao has an interesting smokey flavour. Tried a Jing gua bao which had orh nee inside. Saw some of the staff making the siew mai in the shop. It had a lot of spring onion inside.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111209296856160298490/reviews
Val,5,"Pau skin is thin and good amount of filling.
Got the big pau, char siew pau and kong ba pau. Can taste the charred bits in the char siew pau, only downside is that it is a little on sweet side. Kong ba pau is good, meat is braised well.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113494734916497257063/reviews
Eileen Lee,5,"Char Siew Bao & Kong Bak Bao really sedap. The char Siew has this smoky flavor & the Kong Bak meat was not too fat or too lean so you don‚Äôt feel jer luck. I don‚Äôt fancy kong  Bak but theirs is nice.  Big Bao & tau sar Bao was normal. Lo mai Kai rice is soggy, too much spice added for our liking.
Lady Cashier was in ok mood today  maybe no long queue that day. Spent abt $80 for 3 families
Saw some houseflies on the Bao left near the steamer without cover. Pls do something

Lastly hope the cashier can do proper better packing . She must squeeze all the Bao together in the box until the skin sticks together so messy",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103055330593788965155/reviews
Stanley Pang,4,"Pillowy buns. Braised pork bun is sweet salty and savory.

Fan choy was too salty for my liking.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101763161466007280569/reviews
