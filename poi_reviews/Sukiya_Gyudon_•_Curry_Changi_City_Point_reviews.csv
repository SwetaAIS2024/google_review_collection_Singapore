Jack,3,"Food was served pretty quickly as we were one of the first customers. The medium gyudon that we ordered is frankly quite tasteless. Have to add plentiful chilli flakes and pickles to work. Egg was too cooked and so were the rice mushy and clumpy.
Yakiniku XL is much better very generous beef. However the egg was again over cooked the egg yolk was solid and rice was overcooked as well. See last photo. Very good value always but it's a shame as we have had better at other outlets. Not sure if it's because we were the first customers of the day?",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288565584051666357/reviews

Xingzhou Xiang,4,"cheese curry is fine. But in my own opinion, if cheese heated more and melt will be better. Maybe I'll try next time～",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117499354045149127797/reviews
Loy,5,"Always come here after a late work around 8pm.
My favourite pick would be the spring onion Gyudon, well balanced taste! Food is consistent and tasty.

Would pick this place anytime rather than the expensive mediocre kopitiam in this mall.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111485556176212901757/reviews
