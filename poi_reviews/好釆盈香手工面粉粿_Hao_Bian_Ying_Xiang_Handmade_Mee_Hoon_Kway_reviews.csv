Ben Tan,2,"Read past reviews and decided to give a  try.

Overcooked noodles ended up soggy.
Soup is bland, not flavourful enough
Staff(uncle) uses bare hand to grab vegetables to put into saucepan. He could have wear gloves or use tongs to handle ingredients. Lack of hygiene.
Not worth to return. Below average",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108719498087648557812/reviews
Rach,5,"Dropped by for a bowl of piping hot and generous serving of ban mian soup, after reading a few rave reviews here. Added minced pork for more meat and it was such a filling and satisfying meal👍🏻. I love banmian 板面 so much and this did not disappoint at all💯. Noodles were springy and qq😍, soup was light but really flavourful without being too salty - I wasn’t thirsty after finishing my meal. Cleared my bowl. Will definitely come by again for this! At $3.50 (+ $1 for more pork), it is simply worth your money😊

Cherise,5,"Came here to try my childhood food! Located pretty near, we came here at around 1-2pm on a weekend  and there wasn’t a lot of people!

Ordered the soup and dry Mee Hoon kueh and I’m surprised at how fast the service is! Mee hoon kueh is very chewy and thicker than the ones I eat in other stores, portion is alright but if you order the dry one might not keep you full

Will honestly come here again to eat :) really affordable ($4 a bowl) and good!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101940937697478513279/reviews
We the Flyers,5,"ABIT hard to find this place, but worth it. Yummy bowl of Mee Hoon Kway! Hand made (like the messy square pieces haha) Got a bit of budget to add prawn and cuttlefish was a good choice! Think I was lucky heard it was sometimes have nia. Thick skin ask uncle spam anchovies and brown brown thing (garlic?), He whack only haha. Siok!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101399085005977585252/reviews
Yourries Cahya,5,Hidden gem in the West for mee hoon kway. Hand torn and not machined sliced. Right amount of chew and not undercooked! Simplicity at best. Highly recommended.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100892102344180678278/reviews
