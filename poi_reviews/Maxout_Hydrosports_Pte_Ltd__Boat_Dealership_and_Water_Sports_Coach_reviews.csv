Candice Teo,5,Awesome experience and vibe wakeboarding and wake surfing with Ryan! Sunsets are pretty amazing here too with no rollers.

John Poh,5,"Maxout is the West-side Gem for water sports...  It has great vibes, perfect enclave on the western tip of Singapore.   Home to riders both OGs and Newbies.  Great getaway from city living. Go feel it for yourself

I met the Maxout crew in 2001 when i first got curious about wakeboarding. Ryan n his mates showed me how wakeboarding culture is meant to be. .  20 years later,  I am still loving the ride..  Carpe Diem.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103056872476974053873/reviews
Nadiah Wong,5,"Been taught by 4 different wakesurfing teachers over the course of 2 years and by far, Ryan is the best in being meticulous and detailed in his feedback! He could spot what part of my body to adjust as I was surfing, which was super helpful. He helped me finally be able to stay with the wave and ride ðŸ¤™ðŸ¤™",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110649734493582153106/reviews
Kerry Massarella,5,"Spent the morning with friends learning how to wakeboard with Ryan. It was such good fun. He was supportive, helpful and was able to differentiate to the needs of all of us on the boat. With his advice and careful guidance, all of us where able to get up on the board and have lots of fun! We tumbled lots but he was able to guide us back up and move us on really well. I would thoroughly recommend this company. They are responsive, reliable and super friendly. We are definitely coming back for more!! Can't wait. Thank you for making four girls very happy today. You are awesome!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107827634386594808274/reviews
kay tuck Tan,5,"One of the true pioneers of wake boarding in singapore, Ryan is the only coach out there with in depth riding experience in wakeboarding, wake skating, wake surfing and cable skiing.

Ryan has always been able to communicate to me what needs to be done, in ways that I can understand. And that is a mark of a really good coach. He has a great understanding of the line tension and wake dynamics both behind the boat and at the cable park, which I find Invaluable.

One of the best decisions Iâ€™ve made wakeboarding was to ride at Maxout.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111596258486519650343/reviews
