C,5,"Dairy Farm Nature Park is a peaceful retreat on the edge of Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, offering a mix of easy trails, educational features, and scenic nature spots. Once part of Singapore’s early dairy farming heritage, it’s now a popular spot for nature lovers looking for a quiet escape.

One of the highlights is the pleasant walk from Car Park B to Singapore Quarry — a gentle 2km route through lush greenery that ends with a tranquil view of the former quarry, now a calm wetland with a sheltered deck. I’d rate the park a 5 out of 5 — serene, scenic, accessible, and a great way to enjoy nature just minutes from the city.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
Roy Alexander,5,"Lovely peaceful walk with my dog. Parked in Car Park A and walked up to the Singapore Quarry. Got to see the monkeys on the way, love them! A good chill walk and not too far from the car park to the quarry. I'll be taking my dog back for sure, and the camera!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107575494834202792123/reviews

iReview . One million views / month,5,"If you are driving there, start your walk from Carpark A and cover the Wallace trail and then head over to Carpark B where you visit the 2 quarry.

There are moderate, but long slopes that can be tiring. Those areas are not covered, so if you the 11am-afternoon sun hits you, it can be very bright and hot. You will need a cap.

You will see monkeys, monitor lizards and at some point snakes and wild bore. Pls ensure you know what to do and not provoke them. (There are signs around for you to read)

It’s a lovely 5-6km walk.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115802337066515884011/reviews
Florence Leow,5,"🌳🌳☘️🌾🌿 My husband and I have been to Dairy Farm and Wallace Trails many times over the years.  It is truly refreshing to come and walk here in the early mornings at 7am.

✅️🌾🌿 The trails and pathways are well maintained. It is an easy to walk trail. Interesting flora and fauna to look out as well.

☘️💮 This is a very good quality park and trail walk. Good for small children too ( to educate them on the trees and plants).🟨🌷 Good for whole family exercise walking too.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews
