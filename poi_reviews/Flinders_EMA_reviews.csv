Sakthi Balan,5,"Went for SPUM (international recreational diving medical certification) since I was heading to Europe over the holidays.

Dr Kevin U Chan and his team were very thorough and efficient with their tests. I was very pleased I was able to receive my results and do the various test within the same day and receive my digital medical card the next day. They were able to expedite the various tests in a timely fashion.

Do take note the unit is located at Novena Medical Centre 09-32 which hasn’t been update yet.

The total bill came to just below 200$ and honestly it’s very inexpensive considering the number of tests and effort that it does take including a urine test, chest x ray, breathing test, hearing and sight test, balance and physical examination.

Being an ex diver - Dr Chan was able to give relevant and useful tips for divers, both experienced and amateurs like myself. Highly recommend visiting his clinic.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106800158764693674141/reviews
