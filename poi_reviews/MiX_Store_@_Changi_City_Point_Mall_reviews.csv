Wenn Hong Chong,5,"I had just landed at Changi Airport, feeling hungry and craving a snack. So, I decided to take a walk around Changi City Point Mall, and that’s when I came across this trendy global snack store. The store’s vibrant interior design immediately caught my eye, with shelves packed full of snacks in various colorful packaging from all around the world.

Curious, I stepped inside to see what they had, and the thing that stood out to me the most was a large bag of Sweet Potato Chips. It was affordable, and when I tried it, the taste was sweet, crispy, and not overly greasy—just perfect! After picking up a few more snacks and a drink, I headed to the self-checkout counter. It was user-friendly and straightforward, making the whole shopping experience seamless.

Overall, the store has a wide variety of trendy snacks from different countries. If you're a snack lover or just want to try something new, I highly recommend checking this place out!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115892273158196641124/reviews
