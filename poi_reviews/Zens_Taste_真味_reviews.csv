Edward Wong,5,Paid $4.50 for fish soup and rice. The fish slices were thick and fresh. The soup was flavourful and it had the 扁鱼 taste. Thin slices of bittergourd were included in the soup but they were not bitter. Service was quick even during lunch time. Having a bowl of good fish soup at such faraway corner of Singapore (Tuas) was really an enjoyment!,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110173188680901424865/reviews
