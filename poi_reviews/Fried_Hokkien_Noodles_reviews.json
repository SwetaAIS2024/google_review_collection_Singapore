Broth not so fragrance, lack egg fragrance as well. 2 prawns was ok, sotong almost invisible but white sio bak is nice. Chili is ok too.\nPork lard is given on demand only. And uncle seems very unwilling\n\nWasn’t impressed with their queue system.\nIf u need to take more orders. Just walk down the line and take a couple more orders. Splitting 2 lines makes new customers confused. Some went queueing at the ordered line.\n\nBut I guess it will be my last visit unless I need a quick HKM fix within walking distance\nI could travel a little further for Blk155 Yong Heng or 777 or neighbourwok.",
