Not willing to explain or share anymore other informations, worst experience ever in Singapore banking industry! So sorry for the guys working behind the counters, I didn’t even have a chance to talk to you.",

However, I was amazed by the guard  who had helped me and prepared me with everything and got me all set. Then I was waiting and not expecting to be served soon, thus to my surprise, within 15 ~20minutes, it was my turn then. The nice clerk said I need to provide my STP in paper print, which I didn't have, and the guard and the clerk just assisted me on the internet and got it done in about 5 minutes and I was told I could come back and collect my card in 14:30. Everything went super nice. At 15:00, I went back to collect my card after some paper work signing. I have to say all procedures are smooth, sound and effiecient. So just come over and open your account and enjoy staying in Singapore while using the card.",

      "text": "Got the Zodiac card quite many years back and have been mostly a satisfied customer despite overzealous scam prevention causing card to be blocked with almost every other Google Pay transaction. Till today it still offers the highest unlimited cashback (1.6%) with minimal exclusions. However, I have recently pivoted to the airmiles-camp and this is where it went downhill. I called in 2 weeks ago to cancel the Zodiac card but yesterday I logon to ibanking only to find the card still active. I reached the outlet and got  a queue number at 2.01pm, waited for more than an hour before my number was called. To my dismay, I was informed they couldn't process the cancellation unless I had a physical I/C (Singpass isn't accepted). So I made the trek back home which is 4 MRT stations away and back to the bank. Worst still, they need a whole month to process the cancellation. Other banks will send a confirmation letter informing of the successful card cancellation but not ICBC, they said to me \"try logging on to ibanking a month later and if it fails, it means your card has been cancelled\".",
