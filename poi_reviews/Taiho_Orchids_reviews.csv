Janice W,5,"My new favorite nursery in all of Singapore. What a cool home-based business. Julius and his mom are the most hospitable of hosts; they are so patient in showing you around and are knowledgeable — and passionate! — about every pot they they grow. The prices are reasonable AND they take CDC coupons. Thanks, SG government, for lifting up your small businesses.

(Ask Julius’s mom about the white tea grown at their family farm too — it’s superb.)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108226280737500856616/reviews
