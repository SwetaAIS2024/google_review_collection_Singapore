Jowe Chu,5,"Beautiful experience. Had the dim sum set menu. The dim sum is delicate and perfectly seasoned. The Peking duck is divine, thin crispy skin with a layer of fat, wrapped in perfect skinâ€¦ absolutely perfect. The grouper thick fish broth is delicate and has the freshest fish Iâ€™ve ever tasted. The prawn with crispy rice is served with a chili crab style sauce â€¦ v creative and perfect. The fish noodles and Canadian lobsters were such a perfect pairing with flavorful broth. Dessert was a medley of pastry and fungus soup with apricots.

I was so full and satisfied I could hardly walk. ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

Catherine Tan,4,"Visited on 26 January 2025 and had an overall pleasant dining experience. Most of the dishes were well-executed, but the seafood fried rice was drier than expected due to an excessive amount of fried rice crisps, which overpowered the dish.

The barbecue platter, while flavorful, felt pricey at $68. Given the cost, I expected a more substantial portion or a standout element that would justify the price.

That said, the service was excellent, with attentive and professional staff who enhanced the overall experience. The ambience was also top-notch, making it a comfortable and elegant place to enjoy a meal.

Despite the minor disappointments, I would still recommend Summer Palace for its quality offerings and exceptional service. However, I might opt for other dishes next time.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107940738886750131191/reviews

Eve L,5,"Amazing food at Summer Palace. One of the better Peking Ducks Iâ€™ve tasted. Newly renovated, very modern and posh setting.

A special shoutout to Jeremy for his very warm & kind service to my family. He was prompt in all our requests, our tea cups were never empty and was always seen wearing a friendly smile.

It was my brotherâ€™s birthday, so they presented longevity buns as a thoughtful gesture.

P.S. Iâ€™ve already made another booking to come back here next month for a birthday lunch!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104657386364620273686/reviews
Manggo Dennis,4,"It was my first time dining here, as we gathered to bid farewell to a colleague. The restaurant has an upscale and elegant atmosphere, making it a perfect choice for special occasions.

The food truly lived up to expectations, with some standout dishes that left a lasting impression. I especially enjoyed the èŸ¹é»„é¦’å¤´ (crab roe buns)â€”they were perfectly crafted with a rich, flavorful filling encased in a soft, fluffy bun. Another highlight was the åŒ—äº¬çƒ¤é¸­ (Peking duck), which was beautifully roasted with crispy skin and tender, juicy meat, served with all the traditional accompaniments.

The service was impeccable, with attentive staff ensuring we had everything we needed throughout the meal. My colleagues and I left feeling satisfied and happy, both with the delicious food and the excellent dining experience. Iâ€™d highly recommend this place for anyone looking to celebrate in style or enjoy a luxurious meal.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106922719154752432927/reviews
