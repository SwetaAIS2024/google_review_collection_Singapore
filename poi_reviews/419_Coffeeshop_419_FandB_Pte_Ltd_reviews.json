Just the one stall sells from pork noodles to prawn noodles laksa and even porridge.\nVery brightly lit and many patrons. Down side, the drink stall takes only cash in the night.\nThere are other stalls worth a mention but opens till 930 or 10pm\nWestern food is awesome as well as the roasted meat rice. The wanton mee is great.",
