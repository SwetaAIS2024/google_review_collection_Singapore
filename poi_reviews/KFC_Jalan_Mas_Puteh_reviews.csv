Gator,4,"A cute little KFC outlet located in a shophouse. There were only three tables to sit a maximum of 12 pax inside the air conditioned restaurant. Two more tables of 4 located outside the restaurant. Though small, we always managed to find seats to dine in easily. The taste is expected of all KFC outlets. Tried out some new items on the menu like the mala chicken and ondeh ondeh egg tarts. Both were good and we could accept the taste. But these days, dining at KFC is no longer cheap. Thought the prices have increased substantially. Parking lots right outside the restaurant.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
Rebecca Pham,5,"The sauce coats each strand of noodles perfectly.  Zinger chicken adds a savory depth to the comforting dish. This warm and inviting meal is perfect for a cozy evening. The combination of chicken and noodles is truly a classic.

Benjamin Song Ta Tay,1,"Used to be a decent delivery place
When you order directly using kfc app
Now they either changed driver or something
The pandago driver will go all over the place
So far went to Kent Vale and Westside 33
Not sure why kfc decided to do this
Itâ€™s not like Starbucks delivery
So it can take forever to come
Also called customer service
And they didnâ€™t even know it was not delivered yet
So I really wonder about this store
So late until donâ€™t even know if the chicken is still safe to eat
Next time just order from grab or panda directly
At least they are more responsible and will be honest",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100419867609259415620/reviews
