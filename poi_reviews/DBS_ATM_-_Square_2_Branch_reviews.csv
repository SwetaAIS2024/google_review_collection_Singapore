Matthieu,5,"I went to this branch a few times and must praise the service staff for their kindness and empathy. Yes, it does takes a while to be seen; this branch, like many others, is patronised by elderly folks who need more care, patience and time to decide what to do; the service staff always to their utmost to guide them as I‚Äôve witnessed numerous times. Kudos to them üëç.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103357856146290577661/reviews
Remi Kanji,1,"I feel like this branch is quite inefficient.

There are 3 people at the front reception and it seems their main task is to tell you why you can‚Äôt get service. You have to explain your reason for an appointment to them multiple times. It‚Äôs an irritating process - and could be replaced with self service queuing.

More than that, they don‚Äôt take feedback. SME banking is not available at this location (it should be available at every location). If you require us to come down in person for certain services, these should be made available at every branch. Otherwise put it online. The service in question I wanted was simple: to open a fixed deposit account.

What is the point of having so many staff if their purpose is to make sure you don‚Äôt get service? It would be nice if you hired people to be customer-centric. Instead of having 3 bouncers preventing customers from completing their errand efficiently, why don‚Äôt you assign one of them to work on SME banking.

Hope you can hear my feedback dbs.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116561792499337524442/reviews
