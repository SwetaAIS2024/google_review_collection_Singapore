Richard E,4,"This is a great venue if you like craft beer (see photo to see what was on offer when I visited). The beer is not cheap, but if you want cheap go to a Hawker Centre and buy a few mass produced cans.
The burger was very good too.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115295534526453989960/reviews
Mark Tan,4,"Druggists—what a bold name for a bar! Nestled in an old shophouse, it breathes new life into the space with its mix of vintage charm and punk-inspired vibes. The fusion of old and new gives the place so much character.

I loved the laid-back atmosphere. It's casual to the point where water and cutlery are self-service, adding to the relaxed, no-frills vibe. Their selection of craft beers is solid, making it a great spot for beer enthusiasts to explore new flavors.

The food menu is quite innovative, with quirky options like otah pizza. While I give them credit for creativity, the taste didn’t quite hit the mark for me. That said, Druggists is still a fantastic place to hang out, relax, and enjoy some drinks with friends in a cool, unpretentious setting.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111684394902487136193/reviews
Marc Ha,4,"Love the laidback and unassuming vibe of this taproom. The bar food is decent with the standard options like burgers, pizzas, fries and other sides. Love that they have options for meat eaters and vegetarians. I had the fried tofu burger with 老干妈 sauce. There is indoor and al fresco seating here.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116047651430201692498/reviews
