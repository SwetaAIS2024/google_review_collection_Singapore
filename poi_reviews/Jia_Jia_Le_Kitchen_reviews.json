The worst part is, when I reach home only to find that one of the veg (fried bittergourd) was already spoilt, it became sour and sticky. Damn irresponsible for a food stall to serve spoilt food for consumer. Definitely not gonna buy from this stall again!",

But when coming to payment I saw on the register they put it as fish and charged me $5 instead the price for the actual dish. Total for the dish came to be $6.50 for some curry chicken and pork. I confirmed with another staff that the price is correct and he said is correct and got me some extra pork and initially only 3-4 slices.",
