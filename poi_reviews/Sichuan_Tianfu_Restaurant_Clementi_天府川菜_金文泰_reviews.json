We ordered Godmother Chicken, Tianfu Twice Cooked Pork, Dry Fried Long Beans, Scrambled Egg with Green Chilli Peppers, Sichuan Fish with Pickled Mustard Greens and Vermicelli, Hot and Spicy Chicken, Yangzhou Fried Rice.\nFood were nice and tasty, except the pork belly has a bit of gamey taste, so was a bit unpleasant when we eat it. Otherwise the rest were okay.\nPortion was a bit small, so it’s kinda pricey.\nThe restaurant is not too big but the environment is okay. Service was okay too.",

The person in charge actually took the time to chat with us, understand our preferences, and suggested dishes that turned out to be perfect for our taste buds. What really sets this place apart, though, is the service. It honestly feels more genuine and attentive than many of the bigger, more established restaurants. Our teapot was always refilled without us needing to ask and this small simple gesture can show how much they care.\n\nThe warm friendly smiles from the staff just made everything feel even more welcoming. It’s rare to find a place where the people and the food all come together so naturally. Will definitely be back again and will also recommend this spot to anyone who appreciates good food and truly heartfelt service.",
