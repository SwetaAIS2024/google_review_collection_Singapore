Nicholas CONRAD,1,"Terrible experience trying to work with ShaftTech. Attempted to purchase a bearing, and they offered to deliver on Monday, between 10 and 5. I received a call on Tuesday at around 4, saying that the bearing would be delivered on Wednesday. I provided a phone number and specified that it could be used to contact me through text. On Friday, while in class, I received no less than 13 calls about the delivery of my bearing, none of which I was able to pick up. It is now Saturday, the bearing has not been delivered, and the only number that called me that picked up when I called back was the delivery man, who said that the office was going to ""contact me"", but that the office was closed until February 11 (today is February 2, I placed my order for the bearing on January 24). I need the bearing by Monday, and since this very disappointing company is unable to provide even the most basic of services, the whole project grinds to a stop.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112188481813486310978/reviews
Daryl Koh,5,"Brought a broken ball screw to the ShaftTech team on a friday, they managed to come up with a solution and fabricate a replacement lead screw on Saturday. Managed to stick to the project schedule thanks to their efforts. Deeply appreciate their help, definitely will come back again.
