      "text": "Audrey provided excellent customer service! Very friendly and always sharing what she will be doing ahead of time making it very comfortable. She was very careful about my needs of my hair as she highlighted and toned down my already processed hair. My hair came out very nice and I was satisfied with what she had done. I would definitely come back to this place for my hair needs. The facility was well kept. Price is reasonable. I also like the fact that you don‚Äôt have to put down a deposit to make an appointment and they accept credit card, which is a huge plus!!! Thank you so much!! ü•∞",
