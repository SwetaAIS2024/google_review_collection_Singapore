Nat Nat,5,"Food
All the breakfast, teatime snacks, and canape are finesse, delicious, and tidily placed. Love them!

The waiters are quick responding to your needs, even when there were so many guest. Amazed on how organized & fast they are, from those who accepting guest upfront until the “cleaners”.

Ambience are great - fresh flowers on every tables, spotless clean after previous guest, great placing/organized on each type of food.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103971965718054974238/reviews
Nicole Kim,4,We decided to check out this lounge to grab a drink since all the rooftop bars at MBS had 1+ hour wait. The service was pretty slow and took a while to get our drinks. We also decided to order light bites to share. We did enjoy the live music which the artist came by and chatted with us for a bit. Would recommend if you just want a cocktail while at MBS.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118129559408373781633/reviews

Reiy Teo,4,"It’s a lovely lounge to unwind and enjoy a chill night with music and live performance ie singer and pianist collab.
Came solely for the Jo loves afternoon tea and we were seated at the high sofa chairs section. This gave us some privacy for those who just want to relax with no eyes looking at you randomly as there are many seatings with normal low sofas or dining tables.
This lounge provides buffet tea for the hotel guests too. So it can be crowded.
This bar also serves up wonderful range of local flavour infused gin by Singapore Distillery. Good for gin lover. I really enjoyed Singapore sling infused gin on its own.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109149125082922838736/reviews
Tugce B,5,"Sipping on a cup of great Black Samurai Coffee, we were immersed in an atmosphere filled with positivity, surrounded by people whose energy lifted the entire space. As the rich aroma swirled around us, the soulful music played, drawing our attention to the stage. We couldn’t help but marvel at the beauty of the voice that captivated the room, leaving us mesmerised.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102304650942412839766/reviews
