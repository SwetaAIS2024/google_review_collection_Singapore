Mikail Yah,4,"Found out by chance. Their chilli dry noodles are awesome. Totally different from all other mainstream fishball noodle.

Meepok n meekia could be more firm imo but still acceptable as the chilli somehow makes up the difference. Might be better for some to order the kway Teow or mee dry. Similar to old skool prawn noodle.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114771121650386125948/reviews
LULU EVOX,5,Caught my attention by the long Q. So give a try.  First appearance looks normal and noodle looks very dry but the fish ball looks big. Strange at sight because their mushroom was place in soup and not on top of the noodle.  But to my surprise the mushroom taste damn good. Very strong marinated that the mushroom absorb. Fish ball texture was very good. üëçüèª. Soup was really tasty too. ( don‚Äôt have the thirsty after makan ) The pork lard was the most crispy I ever bite and have the aftertaste of char kway teow sia. I was shock and amazed üò≥.  Abit oily but not big issue for me lah Just don‚Äôt scoop the oily part. For $5 portion is very good le. Another warm comfort food. üëçüèªüëçüèª will sure come back eat again.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107012020161541736403/reviews
Jasmine Chew,2,"Overrated. I ordered chilli and ketchup kway teow. Though the noodles are well coated with the sauce and chilli, it's kind of tasteless and bland. Ah Ma Chi Mian noodles are way better than theirs. Totally lack of umami flavours. Won't try again. Sigh.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108151874693490315524/reviews
Sean Goh,5,"Chance upon this stall selling Mee Pok inside the teck ghee square Market and food centre.  There was already a queue when I was there. The noodle starts from SGD$3 onwards.
I ordered the SGD$3.50 portion and it comes with the standard minced pork, sliced pork, fishcake, fishball as well as braised Mushroom. The portion is pretty generous and the soup was very flavorful. The noodle was nicely cooked as well, and the portion of the sauce was just right.
Highly recommend this stall for Mee Pok lover.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Elijah Ong,5,"Went to try to due to the reviews. The queue is long  not because the noodle is good but the owner takes his time and to chit chat too. So perhaps this is an illusion that the noodle is good so people queue for it when if working at the normal pace, wld have been much shorter. The noodle is good but my friends and i found it a bit oily. Will I come again? A resounding no from my kaki. It's nothing exception. It's just as good as some good kway teow noodle. And it's certainly not thaaaat good that deserve the long wait.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107570044839093227619/reviews
