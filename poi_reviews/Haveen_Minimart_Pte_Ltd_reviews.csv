YaYa's RainbowWorld SurprizeSurprize,1,"Haveen Minimart is a place to buy normal stuffs. But it seems every evening around 7 - 8 pm, the lady has several friends to entertain that she does not care about the buyers. Indian lady who is quite tanned and short. She always says there's no more Winston Classic and the customer has to guide her with the directions.
