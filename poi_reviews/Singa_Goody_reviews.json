You can top it off with   chilli, ketchup or mustard that are placed at the side of the counter. Another plus is the price. $1.50 For a hotdog bun. Inexpensive yummy snack.",

My mother order the oyster noodle soup. The soup was literally a strong soy sauce based soup. Would probably not come back here again",
