His thoughtfulness, patience, and incredible attention to detail make every experience exceptional. Fabian has consistently gone above and beyond to accommodate all my bouquet design requests, no matter how intricate or unique they may be. Each arrangement he creates is a stunning work of art that brings joy to any occasion. It‚Äôs rare to find someone who puts so much heart into their craft and cares so deeply about their customers‚Äô satisfaction. Thank you, Fabian, for your dedication, creativity, and kindness. You‚Äôve made every special moment even more beautiful!",

      "text": "Fiore Dorato is my go-to florist any time I need to send flowers to a high value relationship. I patronize them regularly to buy flowers for my wife, work situations, and other important occasions like congratulations or condolences. They are extremely responsive and reliable (they follow my requests predictably), and have always found a way to deliver on time, even on short notice. My wife always remarks that Fiore Dorato's flowers last longer than other high end providers' do. Their flower arrangements are amongst the most beautiful of any provider, but what makes them stand out is the customer service and willingness to work with me. As long as they keep it up, I will continue to be a loyal customer. Pictured is the latest bouquet I ordered from them: beautiful, exactly as I specified, and on time.",
