When I ordered food and requested for it to be heated, I was told they couldn’t. I had ordered donuts and waffle in the morning—how can they expect kids to eat cold food early in the morning? Cold and dry straight from the fridge. It's worst then i just buy from a petrol station. When I asked for a plate, the staff handed it over reluctantly, as if it was a hassle. Overall, the service and quality were poor. I won’t be coming back.",

I saw one seem like a manager ( female ) openly turn on her phone speaker watching some stuff for a while. If she is not the staff , then perhaps employee shall be empowered to do something about this .\n\nI come here often but today is really bad . They played HOUSE / Techno music in the morning , imagine you come here for coffee fix you end up having headache having to listen to the pounding music in a supposed to be relaxing coffee shop .. is this part of the branding ?",

On top of that, the staff were unfriendly and acted arrogantly when we asked if we could add more banana syrup to our Banana Spanish Latte. This isn’t the level of service we expect from Zus.",

Each morning, after dropping off my kids, I stop here for a cup of coffee to start planning my day.\n\nHowever, I’ve noticed the barista’s attitude is consistently cold—just a nod, without conversation, and it’s been this way every time.\n\nSuggest that management consider additional customer service training, especially on creating friendly, welcoming interactions.",
