Dee Cee (The Dead Cockroach),4,"The $4 roasted duck noodle is good. The duck meat has a dang gui fragrance to it. It's not strong, but it's there. The noodles are springy with a bite. The sambal is umami. Soup has a homely ikan bilis flavor to it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114499637556582554619/reviews
MNG,5,"A little gem tucked away in a non-descript coffee shop in Teck whye.

The danggui duck was tender and held a whiff of its medicinal flavor and a balanced sweetness.

The noodle was well executed with a bite to it. The accompanying sauce was balanced and complemented well.

Pricing is reasonable for its quality and portion.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews

Super Fragrance,4,"Order duck rice with crispy pork belly. Total of $5 (4+1).

Pros
Taste
Fantastic taste of both Dan gui duck and pork belly. Very distinction Dan gui not masked by chili. Very flavorful pork belly

Soup. Sweet more than savory but works.

Rice and sauce. Sweet sauce and hardness of the rice was just right (on the harder side)

Con
Toughness of meat. Both duck and pork are really not tender. Luckily pork was fatty and duck was thinly sliced.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105892392413528737906/reviews
