The price is very reasonable. I can always count on the Kiwi (now Rucksack Inn) as an inexpensive place to rest my head, and they've never let me down.",

Bit like a neglected house, broken ceiling tiles, cockroaches in the hallways, dirty toilets and usually empty soap dispensers. The rooftop garden had definitely seen better days and after a few days there I began to wonder if anyone was actually managing the place, apart from the front desk staff, who were very friendly and accommodating..",

It wasn't that far from the airport too, It was a blast staying here. Fully recommend it! The room 5 years ago feels like more of a dormitory though because of the bunk beds, I dont know if anything changed nor this place is still open",
