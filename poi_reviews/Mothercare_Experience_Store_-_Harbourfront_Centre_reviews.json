Really spacious with many offerings, nice for our active kid to explore too. The staff Mr Nong Chin Wei was absolutely helpful and professional, I’m glad we met him as we asked about a jogger we were really keen in. Grab payment option available too which allows instalments.",

She did a very detailed explanation of all the different functions and how it works. Comparing pros and cons for us. A very good insight of the products. Thank you! Indeed a good experience.",

Picked an item that states buy one get one free (also clearly states the lowest priced item is free). But she still insisted that I have to get the same brand. So where does the lowest priced item is free applies to?",
