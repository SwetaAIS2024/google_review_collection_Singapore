      "text": "I came to TLM in April 2021, after numerous futile attempts at various hospitals in seeking pain relief for my feet and knees. I was offered operation Option by hospital specialist to ‚Äúeliminate‚Äù the bunion pain on my left foot. I was also told that I would need a 6 month recuperating period followed by a series of physiotherapy exercises to re-strengthen the leg muscle that would be lost its strength during the aftermath surgery period.\n\nUncomfortable with such invasive surgery procedure (and no guarantee the bunions would not come back after surgery as advised by the doctor) and fearing a long term serious consequences and possibility of wheelchair at later part of life if the pain was left untreated, I made a last attempt to visit TLM after seeing the advertisement in newspaper.\n\nAt TLM, my feet dimensions were taken (to the extent of toes-length) and moulds were taken both at standing and lying down positions. Prof Michelle Li Ming explained to me how incorrect walking posture could lead to misalignment of our body‚Äôs interlinked-complex-bone-muscle-tendon-system, which in long term resulted in pain at the feet, knees and even hips. With the data of my feet and toes, a pair of custom-made shoes and insoles were made specifically to correct my feet and toes conditions. She also taught me some exercises to help speed-up the recovery process.\n\nDuring the first 1-2 months, I was surprised I could actually walk from Queenstown to Chinatown without feeling the pain that I used to experience. After 6-8 months, the bunions at both my left and right foot have virtually disappeared.\n\nIt took effort (exercises, walking 1-hour minimally a day) and discipline to correct the posture. I would say I am now very much healed but I would continue the therapy to completion.\n\nIf you are suffering similar pain like me, I strongly recommend TLM as it has proven working well for me. It is non invasive. Not only the pains are generally eliminated, but you will also find yourself walking right in posture, overall physique improvement (toned and slimmer body) and improved overall health, if you would faithfully work on the exercises taught by TLM.  Overall I feel more fresh and energetic, and also less prone to falling sick even during the Covid era.\n\nThank God for such restoration!!üòÑ",
