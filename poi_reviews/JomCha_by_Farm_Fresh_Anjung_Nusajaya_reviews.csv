Kimberley Howarth,5,"This is a very sweet and cheerful looking cafe and ice cream shop. The staff here is absolutely lovely. She was very friendly and smiley, makes you feel very welcome and happy to support this business. They have a small menu of sweet treats but all very nice. They use Farm Fresh fresh milk, but they also have vegan options without cows milk. There is also a retail section at the back selling Farm Fresh products. I ordered a kurma milk with brown sugar boba and it was delicious. Happy to come back again to try other drinks and ice cream or yogurts.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114957590885643931784/reviews
