sean lee,5,"I came to live with my child for a month. At first, rather than traveling and going to a new church, I only planned to hold services at the main church online. Then, I went there with the intention of giving it a go, but I gained strength from the good church members and the pastor's words, and my child met a friend at Sunday school, and it has been a happier month.
When I went to school with my church members on weekdays,
I also do rounding.
The child also goes to play on the soccer team.

jw white,5,"The pastor's words were good, and he was quite interesting..^^ The deacons also took good care of me, and I was very grateful. I was so sorry that I couldn't even say thank you because my child was sick.
I'm leaving this post in the hopes that you'll see this post. I am a mother who brought 2 elementary school students (boy and girl) and 1 girl from kindergarten. (I helped a little with meal preparation..^^;;) Anyway, although it was small in scale, it was a service with great grace.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107954000145496259614/reviews
