Luncheon meat bun and coffee cost around $5.50, the bun is crispy, and the set is quite filling. Most of the time the bee hoon will be sold out quite early, so need to be there early if want to eat.",

Curry Chicken taste similar to what we have at homeüëç, but the Chicken Chop Hor Fun was so-so. Still a pleasant dining experience. Kitchen oblidged to more pork lards when we requested for our hor fun. Help yourself to sambal and belcan chili. (Take what you need, dont waste).",

One of the staff seems to be ill as kept coughing when she was standing at the counter waiting for her food / drink. owner should provide mask if their staff are ill. I had to walk / detour to avoid her coughing to my food when I go collect at the counter üòÇ\n\nIt's co sharing space with Song Fa Kway Chap hence you can enjoy different cuisine at one place. The salted chicken (@$9.20) was abit hard and seems like overlooked or was frozen, for it price its definitely not worth it. Maybe next time just order coffee breakfast set instead to avoid disappointment.",

However, be prepared to wait for around 20 minutes as the kitchen is understaffed with only 2 people working at a time. The place is decorated in a vintage style. Overall, if you're looking for a quick meal and are not too particular about high standards or time constraints, this place is suitable for a meal.",

Prawn paste chicken ($8) also tasted well, just kinda small and abit dry. Chicken chop hor fun ($7.50) quite nice overall. Larva egg ($1.70) not bad, but sunny side up the York is fully cooked so not as great as it looks in the picture when ordering..",
