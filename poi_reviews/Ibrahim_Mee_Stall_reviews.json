I asked for Maggie Goreng with sausage, was served with mee goreng with sausage instead, and claims I’m the one who said wrongly.\n\nHe proceeds to cook Maggie goreng for me but picked out the sausages and egg from the wrongly cooked plate and threw it into my Maggie goreng.\n\nWorst of all, the food was tasteless and was charged $6.50 for it. Didn’t even finish half of my plate and didn’t bother putting a pic of it here because it was that bad.\n\nNever order from this stall unless you want to have terrible food and an argue for fun.",
