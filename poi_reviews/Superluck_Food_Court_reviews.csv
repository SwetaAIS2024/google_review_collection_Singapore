Garry Lew Your Estate Advisory Realtor,3,"Visited 08 Feb 2025 Saturday morning üåÖ. The following sharing are based on our unbiased personal opinion and experience

Happened to be in the neighborhood after marketing at sheng siong next door. Small coffee shop with less than 10 stalls. Diverse variety of food choices from Economy rice, roasted stall, western food, tze zhar stall, Muslim/ Indian food and drink stall.

Lontong ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê
Not the best I had. The rice cake is factory made and lack of flavor and doesn't soak up the gravy at all. The curry sauce was average and the ingredients was generous. Overall just tummy filling but craving not satisfied

Duck noodle ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê
They use the thin kwey tiao and the dark sauce was overpowering. Duck meat was average.

Kopi O ‚≠ê ‚≠ê ‚≠ê
Below average. Lack of coffee fragrance.

W.M. LIEW,3,"Typical neighbourhood kopitiam in a newer part of Bt Batok.. Not a major food court so the choice of makan shops are somewhat limited but at least there is good multiracial representation here.. Chinese, Malay and Indian varieties of local food are on offer, including a zhi char kitchen of sorts. So far I have only tried the nasi lemak and laksa.. Both decent... I like the latter a tad more as the laksa gravy is super thick and lemak.. Hahha what an irony... üòä 3.5 stars",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108054733791350792229/reviews
Leonard Lim,4,"Bak chor mee had a good balance of vinegar and chili üå∂Ô∏è kick.  Liver was fresh and not overcooked. Springy al dente mee kia noodles.

My wife had the Roast Duck rice from the stall next to it.

Both deserve 4 üåü considering the price. Much better value than the newly opened koufu in the mall across the street.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101173751535810787329/reviews
