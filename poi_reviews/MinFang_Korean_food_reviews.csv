Dennis Lee,4,"Always like the Korean food at this stall in Foodmore.
The lowest priced Saba fish set so far. Only $5.80. Comes with soup, kimchi and rice.
I would add some sides like a piece of chicken cutlet for additional $3.
Can't find a better deal than this.
Saba s cooked just right. Fish meat s juicy with a smoky bbq flavor. ðŸ˜‹",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106359297351013893921/reviews
