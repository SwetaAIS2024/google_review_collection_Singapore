While he is knowing that it is a merging lane, he continued to sped up while my vehicle is clear infront.\n\nHe is not apologizing nor feeling in wrong.\nThe attitude is really terrible while this company is in forwarding services, they should ban this driver from harming more people on the road of his reckless and dangerous driving!!",
