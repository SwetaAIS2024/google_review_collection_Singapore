EQ Xavier,5,"Stylish shopping center located in the heart of Orchard Road, Singapore. The mall offers a unique blend of high-end fashion, luxury lifestyle, and artisanal boutiques.

The interior design is sleek and modern, with plenty of natural light pouring in through the glass ceiling. I enjoyed browsing through the various stores, which ranged from international designer brands to local specialty shops.

One of the standout features of Mandarin Gallery is its dining options. The mall boasts a range of upscale restaurants and cafes, serving everything from fine dining to casual bites.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105533019712721928126/reviews

Karen K,5,This mall is attached to Mandarin Orchard hotel and has a lot of high end retail outlets as well as a myriad of restaurants ranging from affordable brunch places to pricy wagyu omakase.
