Angela Y,5,"Super value for money Hot Bur Bur Cha Cha ($2.80) that comes with Gula Melaka and a generous serving of bouncy chewy colourful sticky jellies. Do note they sell hot bur bur cha cha only on Fridays!

The Tang Yuan ($2.50 glutinous rice balls) are also well done, swimming in a hot bowl of dried longan sweet soup.

They are closed on Mondays. And opens till 7pm.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111027343433283791729/reviews
