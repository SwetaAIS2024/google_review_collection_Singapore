      "text": "I have been a patient of Dr Christopher Chan since 2017. I have a treatment-resistant mood disorder that is very complex. It took many years of continuous effort from Dr Chan and I (as well as other doctors who played a role in my care) to successfully stabilise and treat my condition. Throughout this journey, Dr Chan has consistently been patient and encouraging regardless of whether I may have been difficult to deal with during my episodes or if the nature of the situation demands a lot from him. He has taught me the value and importance of a good patient-doctor relationship. The rapport and trust we have built up allows me to comfortably share issues with him even if the topic is heavily stigmatised.\n\nIn his private practice, I like his willingness to take charge of my care or to take a backseat and act as a second opinion. I value his transparency and his willingness to divulge what he is thinking to me, which I find is rare among doctors. I appreciate that he empowers me to make decisions for my own care by using his expertise to guide my decisions. He presents what options are available to me and what are the costs and benefits of each option. I also trust that if I were to become extremely unwell and needed him to make decisions for me, that he would always act in my best interests.\n\nSome feedback would be that sometimes clinic staff would need to speak to me about my medicine or the cost of it, but because the clinic is very small everyone can hear the conversation. I personally am not that bothered but I recognise others may take issue with it.",

He always take the time to explain things to help me to understand the treatment process and the options available. He has played an essential role in my recovery, would highly recommend!!",
