Kelly Fong,5,This shop is in coffee shop situated in a quiet neighbourhood. It would be better access via car as parking is excess. We order 10 pork satay. Nicely barbecued and wonderful taste. Most importantly reasonably priced at 70 cts per stick which is rare nowadays. Will revisit definitely if I yearned for satay.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101396460096653890690/reviews
Michelle Hew,5,Unrated delicious traditional satay!! Rare to find such handmade satay. Tried the pork and it was very tender. Goes really well with the special sauce too. Uncle was nice and friendly after u get to know him better. Be prepared to wait during weekends unless you pre-order in advance. Will continue to support him whenever I'm near the vicinity ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüèª,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105019791956127704568/reviews
