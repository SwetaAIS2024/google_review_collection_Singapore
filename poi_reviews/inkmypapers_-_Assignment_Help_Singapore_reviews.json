Though the article may never be published ever (it's a personal project), I've gained insights for writing that I never thought I'd get.\n\nIt's a little expensive for proofreading, but get the complete editing with the comments (the 2nd option, not too sure what their name is) if you want the full value. For a Singaporean service, not too bad.",

You guys might find it expensive for their services but with a guarantee Bs or As grade, I rather why not spent this money, instead of hiring some garbage service from Carousell, HAHAHA.\n\nI can guarantee they are really good as I have been with them more than a year already and I have recommended them to some of my colleagues where they also find them very professional and discreet.\n\nSo just go ahead and contact them if u want a Bs or As.",
