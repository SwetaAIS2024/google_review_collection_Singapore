Gwen Gjy,1,"I had a disappointing experience with the customer service. When I returned to exchange a damaged product(The damaged product was a pack of frozen chicken with a hole in the plastic packaging), the staff was not apologetic and made it seem like the issue was my fault for not checking earlier. During the exchange, she repeatedly emphasised the need to ""check,"" even though I had already confirmed that I did. The tone and attitude were unhelpful and lacked basic courtesy. Also, just to point out—the frozen chicken packaging had a hole in it, which is quite concerning. It really makes you wonder how the hole got there in the first place. I am definitely not returning to this FairPrice ever again.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107404812570752521075/reviews

Melissa Tan,1,"Just got a bottle of water, proceeds to hide it out of vision, didn’t even bother to said “put coins in the machine” as not all ntuc w cashier has that system in place. I wonder is there something that eludes that kind of human touch these days. Alittle kindness goes a long way",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113049115763709872764/reviews

Elson P,5,"I recently visited your store and was assisted by one of your cashiers, Wendy Lim. I wanted to take a moment to share my feedback.

Wendy Lim was friendly and professional, which made the checkout process smooth and pleasant. She greeted me warmly and handled the items with care, which I appreciated. Her efficiency in scanning items and managing the payment was impressive, and she maintained a positive attitude throughout.

Overall, it was a positive interaction, and I look forward to my next visit. Thank you for the great service!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100253934134046839334/reviews
