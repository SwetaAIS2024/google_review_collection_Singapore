      "text": "One of my wall switches at home suddenly started burning with sizzling sounds and smoke emitting from it. Our insurance company sent us an electrician from SOS to look at it. The electrician came. It's a short and fat, non-bespectacled man probably in his thirties. Although we greeted him and welcomed him into our home, he acted rude and dismissive from the start for no particular reason.\n\nHe started dismantling my switch from the wall, with parts and wiring exposed. To understand the problem as to why the switch spontaneously started burning, I mentioned to the electrician I had smelled something burning and asked him which part of the switch did the burning start from. It seemed a fairly reasonable question, but instead of giving me a straight answer like a normal person, he responded, \"我拿给你，你过后可以自己闻得够咯。\" (I give you the part, you can smell it for as long as you like.)\n\nUtterly rude and unprofessional.\n\nThe whole thing cost $130 (100 for labour, 30 for the part). Just FYI.",
