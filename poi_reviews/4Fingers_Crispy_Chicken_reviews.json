So addictive that I wanted to keep on munching even though I was very full!\nAnd I didnâ€™t know they had maki! So delicious!\nAlso stoked to try their new Banana Choco Balls, such an indulgent treat!\nOf course their wings and drumlets were as tasty as I remembered!\n\nðŸ“£Check out my IG @samlivestoeat for more detailed foodie reviews! ðŸ¥°",

      "text": "I waited for my food for like 45 mins. The order screen is quite confusing. The shop is crowded because of some weird event. I donâ€™t get it why the event food must come first and not prioritise other customers???? Photographers and staff are standing so close to me, not giving me any personal space. The photographers hogging the tables too when itâ€™s peak hour. And for what? They donâ€™t even care, just want to take their photos. I feel so claustrophobic. Some of the food didnâ€™t appear on the QR code but the event got the food. Is this how you treat your customers fairly???",
