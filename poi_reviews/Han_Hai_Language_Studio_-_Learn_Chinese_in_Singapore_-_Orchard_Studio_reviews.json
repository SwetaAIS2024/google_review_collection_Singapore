      "text": "During my exchange in Singapore, I had an amazing experience learning Mandarin with HanHai Language Studio. I‚Äôd like to thank my teacher, Timothy ÁéãËÄÅÂ∏à, for the incredible lessons each week. He teaches with great patience and is always approachable, creating a very supportive learning environment. What I appreciated most is how he brings each lesson to life by explaining the cultural and historical roots behind Chinese characters.\n\nHe often shares useful phrases and idioms beyond the textbook, which have helped me in day-to-day interactions and given me a deeper perspective on Chinese culture and values. You‚Äôre not just learning how to speak Chinese, but you‚Äôre also learning how to think in Chinese. Every lesson felt meaningful and enjoyable, and I always left feeling inspired to learn more.\n\nHighly recommend HanHai to anyone keen to learn Mandarin in a way that‚Äôs both practical and culturally rich!",

I very much enjoy my classes with Rosa Yang ËÄÅÂ∏à and look forward to them every weekend. She teaches me real world scenarios and gives me tips on how to speak like a native speaker.  She also gives context as to the historical reason behind certain characters (Ê±âÂ≠ó).\n\nI highly recommend Han Hai Language Studio.",

All their teachers are very skilled and kind. They know how to teach to kids to make learning interesting and fun! And they have always been very flexible in case of changes in her schedules and make up classes. Also the environment is very nice and welcoming!\nTheir holiday camps are great as part of the learning is in class and part done by trips to museums or art exhibitions, which my daughter found both interesting and fun.\nI highly recommend Han Hai Language studio!",
