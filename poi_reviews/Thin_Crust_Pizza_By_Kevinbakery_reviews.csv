Casey Choo,2,"Honestlyâ€¦. Really wanted to enjoy this little hidden find.

Pizzaâ€™s are homemade but thatâ€™s really the only good thing I can say about it. Can imagine itâ€™s a nice hangout/convenient spot for residents to get their pizza fix but other than thatâ€¦ will give it a miss.

Price isnâ€™t that wallet friendly either for the portion size",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100224926434403251689/reviews

Chris New,5,"A great find indeed along Meyer road, located inside the Makena condo. Kevin is very friendly and offered to customize the pizza to my boy's preference. The pizza is definitely cooked on the spot and we had a good dinner. Will definitely be visiting often in future to try the other items on the menu",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108767966830652226270/reviews

It was a mistake to have only ordered ONE 12 inch, think we should have gotten at least 3 ðŸ¤£ If you are collecting the pizza, the shop is inside a condo (can't remember the name).",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109951020749464689457/reviews
