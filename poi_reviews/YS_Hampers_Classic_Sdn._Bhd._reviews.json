I email and left message to them to request for a refund or exchange but never reply.This is unacceptable and it is impossible to for me to give this hamper away to my friend as a CNY gift.\n\nSaw a lot of people comment and complain on their official FB fan page these few days, either hamper damage or never receive the hamper after made order. Also they are facing the same issues, not able to reach the seller via email, whatsapp and call at all.\n\nBad service and irresponsible seller! Never order hamper or any products from them anymore!",
