Alex Tang,5,"Your friendly neighborhood Thai food stall.

Friendly service and good value, managed by Thai people so it can be as spicy and authentic as you like it to be.

If you have a favorite dish that's not on their menu try asking them if they can make it!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118111441003615868570/reviews
Jerald Chew,5,Extremely impressed with how affordable it was for high quality authentic Thai food in a coffee shop! Portions were generous too. Dishes are prepared by a Thai family (itâ€™s a family business). Definitely deserve much more recognition and I wish them a successful business,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111437477989206530356/reviews
