Leo Tan,5,"Craving for some economic bee hoon and found this place online. We decided to give it a try since it was not too far from where we were suppose to be going.

Surprisingly there was no queue when we got there at 12.30pm in a Saturday. We ordered up some economic bee hoon with different ingredients.

Everything tasted amazing! It was not too oily like some places. The best part was the chilli, it is a bit sweet and went very well with everything.

Iâ€™ll definitely recommend this place for a quick and cheap meal.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107339982934488251920/reviews

Daniel Ng,1,Fantastic owner uncle but current batch of workers working without him present is horrendous. The queues are getting longer and the food worse. Hope that uncle will be back to bring things back to order like the past when it was truly great food at economical prices and friendly staff rather than aunties whose behaviours reek of things meant for the toilet bowl,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110856999232931666605/reviews
Scott Pilgrim,3,"It's decently better than way a lot of place, like way a lot. It's only worth traveling if you are from Tampines perhaps Pasir Ris too. I really like the fried chicken, there's something in it makes it special. *** When you ask for Chilli, make sure you really love the Chilli cause the aunty will dump the whole Chilli onto the noodle and not on the side. Carrot Cake is not bad. Nasi Lemak too.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106786746608830252415/reviews
Tay Kah Jun,4,"Black Carrot cake taste ok but the texture is very soft n soggy. Beehoon taste good, Chicken wing is crunchy but nope to the hash brown. Overall good enough to come back again for the beehoon.

Definitely better than the likes of tamp hub and the market area near TP. Price abt the same as outside",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108326889639735226314/reviews
