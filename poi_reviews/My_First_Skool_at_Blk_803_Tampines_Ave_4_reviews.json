      "text": "I can‚Äôt express how thankful I am to the Teachers and staffs over at MFS TM3\n\n1. Quality of Teachers\nI would say, from N1 to K1 class, all teachers we‚Äôve met, are all top notch teachers.\n\nI love how each day my childrens comes back to school and tell me how much fun they had,and¬† what they learnt.\n\nTeachers that we had crossed path with are really nice and full of patience, they are also sensitive towards the kids emotions too.\n\nCommunication is always 2ways. üëç\n\n2. Learning progression of my child in the centre\n\nI would say, my childrens had improved so much especially in terms of malay/english/chinese. We hardly speak mother tongue language at home, but my childrens learnt so much, that they could understand, speak and even sing malay/chinese songs.\n\nOnce again, would like to thank everyone in this centre for keeping our kids safe!\n\nThanks to the Principal Ms Nur, TC Norfa,Wang laoshi, TC Iffah, Huijin Laoshi, TC Hazizah for their hard work taking care of my childrens and other kids too! Really appreciate it. ‚ô•Ô∏è",

She kinda snobbish and pretend you don‚Äôt exist even though she already saw you. Rude unprofessional proud preschool principal. Racist! She knows which class but pretend not to. There‚Äôs no other teacher there so I passed some stuff to her but the way she replied and pretending she just saw me but she already did lol Wah can give her a best actor award. I hate this kind of fake person. I think she had an issue with us that she can‚Äôt get over it.",
