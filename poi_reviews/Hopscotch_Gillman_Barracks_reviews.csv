YL Chen,5,"Pleasant environment for a chill evening. Had the Roasted Duck pizza, Chilli Lobster Linguine and the Pangium Beef.

Pizza was crispy and flavourful. The Chilli Lobster sauce was spicy on point, satisfying yet it doesnt sweat you out. The Pangium Beef was super tender, the meat was so soft that it melts in the mouth!

For the cocktails, my partner and I had the White Sands and the Wish Upon the Lantern. Super intriguting experience, with the White Sands being an edible cocktail and the interesting short ""performance"" by sending our wishes through burning.

Highly recommended for those who are looking to chill for the evening after a long day of work or over the weekends with friends!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111513667657898252261/reviews
MG MG,5,"The place was really empty when I was there on a weekday afternoon. So I Wasnâ€™t expecting much on their set lunch. Furthermore the set lunch was really really affordable. Donâ€™t mind Travelling all the way to try because of the price. It turns out to be the best decision. Their entree was amazing and the mains were so good itâ€™s so value for money. Apart from the fish and chips that is a tad dry, but the portion certainly make up to it",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115282280073844943922/reviews
Puvanesvaran Nadarajoo,5,"Why haven't I been here sooner...
Reasonably priced drinks for happy hour with interesting cocktails that taste good.
They do need to work on the storytelling part tho. Cocktails are visually appealing, but there should be more depth to the explanations.
Had mostly the fried stuff and pizza, which was good.
Live music performance and the football table were a big plus too!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103460475460490919855/reviews
P,1,"Pathetic place.

I made the reservation and I asked for AC room. It was confirmed.
When I arrived after 20 min as I told them my table was gone. We had to seat outside. Bad customer service at the start.
Food portions are very small. Duck was small size with two baby potato's and tea soon of salsa vegg. For this price you expect more. Other meals were also small. Just put more potatoes and veggies please!
Three adults left to McDonald's because we were hungry and we didn't have time to get another meal.
Was it worth it? No definitely not. For this price I will go to way better restaurants.

Lots of fun experiencing the creative presentation of each drink!

They also have an extensive menu of delectable mains and bites to choose from! Everything is good and we particularly enjoy the Ribeye Steak, Beef Bourguignon, Pork Ribs, Grilled Octopus and Portobello Mushrooms!
