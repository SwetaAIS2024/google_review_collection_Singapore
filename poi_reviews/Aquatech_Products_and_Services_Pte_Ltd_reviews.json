In the three months that they were contracted to maintain the pool weekly, they failed to show up five times.\n\nAnd when they did bother; their people did shoddy workmanship. For example: putting a pool railing back on that stuck out into the pool (see second photo). They didn’t clean the filter until I insisted, and that was disgusting (third photo).  More than that though, we switched companies and the new company tested the water — two weeks after Aquatech’s last visit, the pool was showing both acidic and high levels of chlorine. They had just dumped chlorine in.\n\nYou do not want to use them.",
