Anselm Ng,4,"Visited Mel‚Äôs Drive-In on a Saturday just before noon. The diner had a great retro vibe, and to our surprise, there was no queue at that time. Service was quick, and the food was served promptly. The tandoori chicken burger was a delightful twist‚Äîflavorful and satisfying. The sweet potato fries were crispy and paired well with the meal. Overall, a fun dining experience with a nostalgic atmosphere, perfect for a quick bite during your Universal Studios visit. Would recommend stopping by!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117956627539037508278/reviews

Anthony William Mitchell,2,Great atmosphere but honestly the food was lacking. The burger was a ok but not very tasty however the fries were cold we had to get them changed. The chicken nuggets and milkshake were good but I wouldn't recommend eating there. There are better options in the Park such as the pizza for the same money.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106434697547579569797/reviews

Mohammed Sufiyan,5,"A very uniquely pleasant restaurant deco, clean and a nice place to end a tiring day of activities with the kids over at the USS.

The staff over at the cashier, Amirah was very attentive and helpful, to assist us getting a baby chair before we even asked for it!
A small gesture that adds the first experience to our USS trip a wonderful one.

The kids love it here!!!

I personally love the tandoori chicken burger.

Pricing can be more affordable.
And maybe in future, they can have drinks included too in thier set.

Overall, a good place to dine with the family.
Keep it upüëçüèºüëçüèº",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103676761584976791991/reviews
