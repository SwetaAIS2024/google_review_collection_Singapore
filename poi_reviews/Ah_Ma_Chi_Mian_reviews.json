Under my prediction, 3 of our orders were wrongly cooked. We ordered 3 ketchup sauce noodles but it came with black sauce and the food is very oily. We can feel that Fu was impatient and rude to us by using his eyes to signal and make us guess what we should do next. I wanted to feedback so that the management can do proper training for the staff.",

      "text": "Came back for 2nd visit. The liver is cooked consistently!! I like the liver, cooked just right. Glad I asked for chili to be separated from liver, don't really like the chili paste. Noodles in flavourful dark sauce is tasty, springy noodles. Pleasantly surprised they gave a bowl of soup. Overall satisfying meal, will return for second visit. Generous with the lard, but it is not crispy/ turned soft. Guy at the counter taking order is friendly and efficient. Thumbs up!",

The queue was exceptionally long as counter staff appear to be new, and struggling to take orders promptly. Eventually, I became a victim to bring back home 4 packages of pork liver noodle. When I unpack the noodles, I became the happiest person since I am the only one in the family that eat pork liver. You can imagine the sulking expression on my family member. Hahahaha ðŸ˜† ðŸ˜…",
