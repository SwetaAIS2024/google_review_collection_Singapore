uma s,5,"We were looking for a fun, immersive preschool where the kids were learning through play and experience.From the first moment we took a virtual tour of the school, we knew it was the place that we wanted to send our child.We really appreciate the energy and enthusiasm of the teachers who are also very responsive and professional, on top of being loving and caring!The school is also big and there are lots of places for the children to play. My son loves the school and the teachers and is very happy to go to school every day!

I would definitely recommend Twinkle Kids for all preschoolerüòä",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116475473091938637460/reviews
