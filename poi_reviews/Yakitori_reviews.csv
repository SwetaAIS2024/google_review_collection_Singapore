Chengmiao,1,"Food quality was bland, Mushy and tasteless. The beef Don was a soggy mess of overcooked rice and unseasoned beef. Weird aftertaste as well. The yakitori sticks were all overcooked and bland, with little to no seasoning on it also

Service was poor, staff were rude and condescending during order, and was very pushy and annoyed when I just tried to put in an order

Overall the experience left me with disappointment and a half finished bowl of food which I could not stomach anymore. Coming from someone who'd eat anything to clear the plate, this food was not enjoyable in the slightest

Would give 0/5 if possible, need to work on their food and their poor customer service",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101112844856384888832/reviews
R,1,"Worst stall in Tampines Hub by a far stretch. Chicken yakitori was hard, udon miso soup was sour which means it was a few days old and he served the yakitori in the udon which means the marinade is gone.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100928524923295735936/reviews
