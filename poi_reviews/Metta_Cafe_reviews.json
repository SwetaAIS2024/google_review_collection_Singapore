Tried the bread and vegetarian bee hoon, it is pretty good value for money. Only gripe is service only starts at 730am instead of 7am but you are welcomed to sit in and wait. It’s spacious, air conditioned and there’s a small gift shop stocked with products designed by the students & alumni.",

The entire place is air-conditioned, clean, neat and cosy and most importantly, without the strong kitchen smell that many air-conditioned restaurants possess. There is a wide range of wonderfully cooked and reasonably priced vegetarian food available.\n\nHighly recommended!!!",
