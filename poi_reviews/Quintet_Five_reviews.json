Food tastes fresh. The truffle flavoured mash, mushroom soup, salmon and pork ribs were a hit with the family. Second time having the salmon and it’s really consistent in taste and quality. Thanks guys!",

Had a good deal after Eatigo discount. Overall not bad although I felt the tomato sauce in beef ragu was a little too sweet for me and not meaty enough, although pasta was sufficiently al dente. Had wanted to try the beef striploin and bacon cheese burger hut both were sold out when we went for dinner.",

We will have our Friday dinners there, food is affordable and nutritious\n\nWe had a family party and decided to engage them for their catering, they were super accommodating and catered their menu to our fussy needs.\n\nThe portion was huge and everyone enjoyed themselves, the mini burger, the chicken drumlet adobo was amazing. Their sides was also very generous - highly highly recommend\n\nIs such a hidden find in Bukit timah plaza",

Quite a few unique dishes for a seemingly small cafe.\nAlso got a $8.90 cake plus coffee deal, good for that one-two hours waiting for your kids to be done with class.",
