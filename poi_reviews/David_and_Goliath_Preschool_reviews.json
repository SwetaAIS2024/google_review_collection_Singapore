The school hold morning assembly in a large and high ceiling hall, with music and movement. Very frequently, the teachers take turn to play piano while leading the singing during assembly. I think this is excellent start of the day for all children. My children behaviour improved after we changed to this school.\n\nI have no regret putting my children to this team of teachers in this good environment.",
