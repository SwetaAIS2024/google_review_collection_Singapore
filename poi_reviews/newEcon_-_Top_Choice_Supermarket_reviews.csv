Lydia Haviar,2,"I went to pick up Shopee parcels to this location just to find the store assistant to be rude! Once he throw me out saying that the strollers aren’t allowed inside. Well I can’t leave my child outside unattended. Second time he just refuse to give me parcel saying at 10am. Sure, I understand only if he could say “we’re sorry but we’re opening at 10”,which I obviously didn’t know as when I asked another shop assistant  she said they open at 8am! But hey as expats in Singapore who are we to be polite! Rude rude rude!!! I will have my parcels to be send there just to go on his nerves again",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110962449412799962193/reviews
Nicholas Kua,1,"Went to collect a Shopee package here for my elderly mother on a hot Sunday at 1pm.
Shop assistant was bloody rude:
1) Told me bluntly to go collect parcel at the side.
2) Did not help assist with finding the package. I had to search for it myself for half an hour; there were so many bunched up together
3) When I put some parcels at the side because of the sheer quantity of parcels, he rudely told me off to collect and put back into where it was originally placed
4) worst of all, he placed the parcels in the wrong category (my mom name starts with C, and he placed it in the K category instead of A-E category)
Overall, I had to search through 3 baskets of parcels( A-E, F-J, K-O)
Lousy service and bad attitude, leaving a bad impression.
Would recommend people not to select this location to collect packages. Suggest Shopee find other drop-off locations!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106864623219615685761/reviews
Luke Chen,1,"I tried purchasing an item from them through Lazada and I did not receive a response after a week after making full payment in excess of $200.
