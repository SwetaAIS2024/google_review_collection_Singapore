Edwin Sim,4,The ceiling is very high with lots of gigantic ceiling fans to air up the place. Very clean and spacious setup at the Food court. The Buangkok MRT Station serves this mall.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101573409211772718775/reviews

Rena,3,"Physically the mall looks big. It is spacious,  unfortunately the downfall is without aircond. shops and restaurants have AC. I tried few times eating at the so claimed ‘biggest hawker centre’ . But Each time I felt made the wrong choice. Outside weather already hot. Look forward to a cool mall but not in Sengkang Grand mall. It's hot with poor ventilation. I pity those stall holders and wonder how they deal the such condition daily.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115389312456657562987/reviews
