Ordered cereal chicken and a 3 egg spinach with two rice n two ice tea cost $43 plus but that’s not the worse, the chicken tasted like cardboard marinated and deep fried with cereal and the spinach veggies was blend and tasteless ! Shameful to serve and lack pride totally tobe running a restaurant! One of the worst I have tasted",
