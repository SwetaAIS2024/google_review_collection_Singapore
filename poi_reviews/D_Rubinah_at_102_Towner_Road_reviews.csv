L Chen,4,"Had egg plaster prata with teh tarik.  Teh was great, well balanced tea /milk combination with tinge of sweet tea flavour.
The texture of the prata, was “tough”, not the soft fluffy kind that I would generally enjoy.  However, thumbs up the prata for not greasy at all.  May be back to try their other menu.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114020236834462400270/reviews
