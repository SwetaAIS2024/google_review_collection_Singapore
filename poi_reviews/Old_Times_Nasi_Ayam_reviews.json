      "text": "Had my first Mui Fun, eating in at Bukit Panjang Food court. It was delicious, the rice was fried with egg for texture and flavour. It had squids, fishcakes and prawns. A week after, went back to tapau Mui Fun, since I was in a rush. I was a bit disappointed cos the rice was just plain rice, garnished with fried onion and chilli. Its not as nice when I first had it. Also bought Hokkien Prawn Mee, it was ok. My guess is, never tapau, just sit in to enjoy the food.",
