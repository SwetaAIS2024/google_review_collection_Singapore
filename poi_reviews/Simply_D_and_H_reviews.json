      "text": "I came here twice, ate twice here. Located in a coffee shop, seats are not much but still able to dine in despite too many beer drinkers around so I think may not be compatible for Muslims to fine in at. The best option is to takeaway food.\n\nSaw many bad reviews but fortunately for me, I enjoyed the fried rice, the food was good. No issues for me. Not bad, hidden gem in Yishun actually. Hope they can relocate to a better location, away from beers and so since selling halal food.\n\nWill definitely patronize again. Thank you",
