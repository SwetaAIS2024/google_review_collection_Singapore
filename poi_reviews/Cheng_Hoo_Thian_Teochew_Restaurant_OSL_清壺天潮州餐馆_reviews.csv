Samuel C,5,"Authentic Teochew food.

All dishes we ate today is to the point !  I am impressed that each dish and item has its special sauce to go with and the waitress will introduce to you when they are delivered to the table.

Everything is freshly prepared and plated nicely. The service is top notch too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106659919852585441534/reviews
L Teo,4,"The good old-fashioned food was quite good..braised goose (not easily found these days), their 3-dish platter with prawn balls, pork in jelly bricks n unique ngoh hiang, pork ribs (ordered by number of ribs preferred), bamboo shoot kueh, ornee with water chesnut, etc.  For the adventurous, you might try their goose liver, n kuay teow fried in egg yolk n looking like chye tow kueh. They served the food with porridge as well..

Service was quite good, too, as they tried to highlight the uniqueness of their many dishes.  We were quite in danger of ordering everything they introduced!

It is an old Teochew restaurant, going back to 1930 from their signboard, located below a hdb housing block.  I think the restaurant shld expand just a tad, as it felt a little bit tight inside.  The chairs n boxes near the dining tables did not help.  Nonetheless, the food is worth an experience n booking ahead is good!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110242017748576410660/reviews
Matthew Lee,3,"Paid a visit here as wanted to dine here for Chinese New Year. Visited on a weekend afternoon and it wasn't really crowded.
Had a look at the menu and the variety was pretty limited. It doesn't look like a typical menu and most probably was for Chinese New Year period. Limited items to order and the prices didn't look cheap. Took a while before deciding on a couple of dishes.
First the prawn ball came and it looked kinda pathetic. It tasted okay but the size of the prawn balls were rather small.
Then we had the house special 2 Goose slices. Again the portion was measly for a $60 price tag. Supposed to be good because this is what Teochews are good at, I would say I quite liked the dish as the braised goose was so soft and tender. I expected the crispy goose to be tough and but to my surprise it also maintained the softness even after frying it.
The fresh scallops and broccoli was decent nothing fantastic but the highlight was probably the pan fried kwey teow which is also a Teochew specialty. The noodles were very well fried and there was this wok hey which made it pretty outstanding,  and not to mention this dish is not very common to be found.
Didn't really enjoy the service while we were eating the staff came and shoved us the menu and asked us to order desserts. Came  back quite a few times while eating and finally we decided to get each the yam paste. Another Teochew signature dish, this was also my favourite and it's quite unique from the ones eaten elsewhere with the special sticky sauce with chestnuts made it exceptional.
Most of the dishes were okay, bill was slightly on the high side, and service could be improved.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109397825257995094119/reviews
HC L,5,"Old school Teochew restaurant. Why didn’t we discover this place earlier? Finally found our long lost favourite Teochew dish: Crayfish with onions and eggs! And their version was fantastic, the crayfish was cooked to perfection and they were meaty. The eggs and onions have wok hei and slightly spicy (with sambal chilli). That’s not all- we found goose here! Other famous Teochew restaurants in Singapore serve only duck because of the government ban (Avian flu) Only Hungarian geese are allowed (don’t ask me why) in Singapore. And so they served the goose here in 2 flavours. Being so used to the braised version, we were sceptical when they offered the deep fried version. CHT proved me wrong…this version was delicious. Tender and full of flavour, we were bowled over. Let me shorten this essay: all dishes were yummy. I particularly liked the oyster omelette. Glooey inside and crispy outside. Also the meat ball soup. Was it beef? The beef ball had the bite to it where you can’t find if it was factory made. QQ, surely you can bounce it off the floor. Chye por kway teow is a must in any Teochew dinner. Here, they made it clumpy until the texture was like carrot cake. I preferred the dish to taste like noodle but dining companions loved it a lot. Finally, I felt that the yam paste here was the best I’ve tasted in Singapore, ever. The yam was so fine and syrup was thick. Only complaint was that the pumpkin was too little. Lastly, there were 6 of us all adults. For each dish the portion was about just a bowl full. For example a piece of crayfish each. A small quarter of omelette each. So the smaller portion were complaints in other reviews. For me, it was alright. We get to taste more dishes…and we’ll definitely be back for the starters and desserts. Oh, service was great with the woman captain. She was friendly and patient to explain the dishes. And all the dishes were served fast despite the crowd.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105381120259821237733/reviews
Ryan Chew,4,"It's my first time in this venerable restaurant allegedly founded in the 1930s. Decor is very retro/dated. It was not even half fun even on a Sunday evening. Food wise it was more than I expect. The longevity steamed buns were served warm and they were fluffy and the stuffing(lotus paste) had just the right amount of sweetness. Chilled crabs were of a decent size and were full of roes. Suckling pig was the least impressive of all the dishes. To me the pig was not served fresh off the pits so it affected the crunch of the skin quite a bit. Steamed pomfret was surprisingly steamed to perfection as I was always not happy with the doneness of pomfret in other teochew restaurants. Two standout dish were the Bombay duck(a fish) omelette and yam paste with water chestnut and tangerine peel. The omelette was fried perfectly and the taste and texture of the Bombay duck worked so well with the omelette. Yam paste was of good viscosity, the water chestnut provided a nice crunch and the tangerine peel added a zesty bite to this old school dessert. Service wise the staff were very attentive and obliging. All in all a very enjoyable birthday dinner",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117598885708884203580/reviews
