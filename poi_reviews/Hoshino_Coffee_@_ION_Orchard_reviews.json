      "text": "I had the beef curry omurice and it was DISGUSTING. The dish came 15 mins after the first one and by then my mum's food is no longer hot.\n\nThe egg on the omurice was just an enlarged egg white. Compared to your menu where the egg actually looks like an egg, it seems like the chefs made it out of egg white instead? And to my horror when i cut in ITS LITERALLY FOAM?? It literally tastes like im eating foam. And after that my dish was flooded with WATER thats probably from the egg. How can you call yourself a japanese establishment when your main dish omu rice tastes like this? As expected the egg white tastes of nothing.\n\nDish was also served on a chipped plate.\n\nFrench toast was the saving grace. My mun also commented that her dish which was the curry pot was not bad too.\n\nI am thoroughly disappointed, wont be returning again. Google reviews are low for a reason.",

Ordered the Omu rice n teriyaki chicken steak with salad (100g) lunch set and “Hoshino” spaghetti with eggplant, shimeji, bacon n sausage, and the mini soup (Homard Bisque). Had iced coffee with milk n sugar. Prefer this to the hot Hoshino coffee, as this iced coffee has a strong taste n really has a kick. Not a fan of iced coffee n this is the only one that satisfy. Swee Ling is very friendly, n also observant to notice that we needed to change seats due to weak mobile signal. Thanks to Swee Ling n the little girl assistant Clarice for the service.",
