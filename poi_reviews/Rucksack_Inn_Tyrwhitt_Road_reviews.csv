Debasis Bhattacharya,3,"Everything good about this place EXCEPT the staff at reception, especially the elderly lady who talks rudely and does not bother to even listen to guests.  She keeps threatening guests with fines for not following rules even before reading them out.

They had a power outage one full day but didn't even bother to acknowledge the trouble guests had to face in the hot summer and did not bother to provide alternative arrangements.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115034384817007370554/reviews
Faeka Ansari,3,"It’s my first day here, and so far, things have been quite decent. Rooms are average, services average, location is great.The female staffs are rude and were not particularly nice, neither accommodating when I requested a bed location change.

The room has lockers (not great quality) , water is available, and there’s a coffee spot. The shared bathrooms are j fine condition, though there’s only one dustbin in the whole washroom. They do provide hair dryers, but there are no tissue papers in the washrooms, which is a bit inconvenient. also the floors are always wet! plus no shoes allowed!!!

The women-only squad rooms always seem to be fully booked—I’ve been trying to get one for over a week now. The mixed squad rooms, on the other hand, are quite messy and not the best experience.

There are no curtains around the beds, so there’s zero privacy.

Overall, it’s an okay place so far. I’ll update as I experience more.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101524928319157632689/reviews

Laura Nielsen,2,"Noicy neighborhood, but close to food options and shops like 7eleven.

Beds are uncomfy, rock hard - no curtain for privacy in the bunkbeds, and only celling lights - no bedlights, so if you need light, you would use your phone or light up the whole room.

Baths need an upgrade - showerheads can’t even hang on the wall, and the plaster is falling of of the insides of the showers. One door is missing to one of the shared bathrooms.
There is nothing to dry your hands with in the toilets/baths",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100068341926625626378/reviews
Ishaan Thapar,3,"The place is good for budget travellers and clean. But I would like to highlight that the reception staff is extremely rude and avoids helping in most of the cases. Also, I would specifically like to mention here that the Chinese Malaysian guy working in the night is one of the most rude people I have ever met.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110721917743426142987/reviews
