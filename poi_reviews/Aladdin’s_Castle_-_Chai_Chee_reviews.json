      "text": "I am very surprised with tonight's experience. I had an craving for Naan and Garlic and we ordered 5 pieces with 2 recommended curry Butter Chicken and Kadai Chicken. And yes we finished everything. Savoury and hits the right spot! The Butter Chicken is so well cooked with vegetables and the Kadai Chicken is so flavourful! We ended up tabao our Tulang Merah home cos the Naan is so big! Yes the price is a bit steep but each curry serving is good for 2 too! Will definitely recommend all to try in this small Chai Chee town centre!",
