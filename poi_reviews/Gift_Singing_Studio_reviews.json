      "text": "From my 12yr daughter:\nLynn is an inspiring teacher. I had been attending her private vocal sessions for a year and a half. Before that, I enjoyed singing but i did not have knowledge about the techniques and lacked confidence. I was shy and afraid of performing in front of others. Teacher Lynn made special arrangements so that I was able to improve not only my singing skills, but also my confidence. Sometimes, I might not feel very well during the session, Teacher Lynn promptly informed my parents and took care of me. Thanks to her help, I landed a spot in my secondary school’s choir CCA. Now, I feel more comfortable with singing in front of people. Overall, I think Lynn had been a great mentor to me and I would recommend her to anyone who would like to take their singing to the next level.",
