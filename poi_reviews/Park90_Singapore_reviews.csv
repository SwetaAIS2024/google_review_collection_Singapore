Amumu S,5,"Spent wayyy too many nights here, service is amazing (wine list is even more awesome). Donâ€™t know where else to go when I want some wine park90 is the place. Except the fact that itâ€™s in a hotel lobby everything else is perfect ðŸ˜† wouldnâ€™t say too much about the food, but check out their wine list. Will always be my all time favorite",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103884059461746252800/reviews

Elna Tan,5,"Tea lounge by day, wine club by night. Opens to public with a better rate for members. Great place to appreciate curated wine & champagne selection with a food menu that features lounge setting bites and substantial dishes to fill the stomach from the F&B establishment within the hotel. A comfortable spot for sundowner wind down to late night hang out.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104513226543032200659/reviews
Charis,5,A really nice and quiet place to bring a date. The atmosphere was very romantic. Wine prices were reasonable. We got a brunello at $130 and the Hokkien mee was amazing and they were so nice to split the portion into 2 for us. We also got the cheese platter which we couldn't finish. Overall I would definitely come back again!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114600726145980904216/reviews
Ivan Loh,4,"Classy and intimate place to enjoy a large selection of premium wines. The dim lighting and small capacity make it an ideal location for a fancy date night. The service was really good. Attentive and friendly staff. However, for a fancy wine place, I felt that the sommeliers could have been more knowledgeable and descriptive with their wines. The food menu is a combination of trimmed down menus from the hotel's restaurants, so there'll be something for everyone. Our bill for a party of 5 worked out to around $800.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114542374982525257775/reviews
