m,4,The outside of the building is so classy so I expected that the inside was as nice as the outside but the inside was normal. It was so crowded and there are not enough spaces between seats. Staffs were nice and friendly. I couldnâ€™t find a Singapore mugs or cups or tumblers. Maybe there are many tourists come here so those Singapore designs were out of stock.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105550892012784714702/reviews

Florence Leow,5,"ðŸŸ©ðŸŒ¿ Starbucks
86 East Coast Rd, #01-02
(Katong Square)
Singapore 428788

ðŸŸ¨ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ This is a beautiful Starbucks nestled in a heritage conserved building. The building was formerly Joo Chiat Police Station.

ðŸŸ¨ I did a takeaway ( æ‰“åŒ… dabao) of the Lemon Meringue Cheesecake. ðŸŒ¿ The cashier and other staff were all very cheerful  friendly and polite.

ðŸŸ  The cafe was super crowded & packed to the brims. I had the Cafe Latte but sorry, forgot to take photos. ðŸ˜…

ðŸŸ¦ The cafe is sited just next to 112 Katong mall.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews
Kell,3,"I like that this outlet is spacious and the male barista who's usually there is very friendly and chirpy. Food and drinks are standard Starbucks fare. However, as a person who has the ick for lizards, this place can be quite a nightmare. The few times I have been to this outlet, I've been greeted by a huge one at the table near the windows. In broad daylight too. At lunch today, it was rather busy, so I had to sit at the corner at the long table facing the wall and the amount of lizard droppings there was unbelievable. I almost gagged. Either nobody has been cleaning this up or the lizards are dropping it like it's hot faster than they can clean. Very unhygienic. I highly recommend the management to look into taking care of this problem. Honestly, this is the one thing which would prevent me from getting my cuppa there. No lizards please.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105879006512975472296/reviews
