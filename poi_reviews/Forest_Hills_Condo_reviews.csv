Jaycer,5,"Resort style and very peaceful and quiet with nice greenery. The pool is big enough to swim laps. The Springleaf MRT is about 10 mins walk. if you are a person who loves nature, the condo is close to springleaf nature park with nice cafe and park connection that you can go jogging and cycling. There is a nice reservoir, Singapore Zoo & Bird Park within 15 mins bus journey away. If you love to hang out, there are many restaurants, cafes and eatery within walking distance. Unlike crowded urban with tall buildings and shopping malls, this place is relaxing and chils. It is like living in a modern village.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111378470226549487714/reviews
