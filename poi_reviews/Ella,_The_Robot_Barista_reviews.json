So you can make that option to get something yummy.\n\nFood:\nBasically its just drinks and there are alot of choices here. Coffee is not bad as it did taste similar to cafes. Well, our love is coffeeeeee ü•∞\n\nService:\nNot much of a personal touch..\n\nAtmosphere:\nIts great to have a machine that serves latte at the hospital but it would be better if there were some seats ready as well.",

      "text": "It‚Äôs located in Sengkang General Hospital. Use it like any vending machine; select your coffee and make cashless payment. I used apple pay. The ticket will be dispensed and indicate which window you would get it from. You can watch how the robotic barista makes your drink through the screen. To take, scan your ticket and the window will rotate to open. So cool! And the price is reasonable. Think it cost me $6 for a flat white with a pump of caramel.",

I walked up and a very nice guy (sorry, I didn't get your name) introduced me to this machine wonder and explained it's coffee flavours to me, guided me on the app and on how I can purchase my first cup at 50% off patiently! I took his advice and opted for a flat white and my, am I impressed to say the least, it has a beautiful aroma, balanced acidity and a good body with creamy milk! It's gonna give the big boys a run for their money!",

      "text": "We had a good experience ordering our first coffee from Ella, The Robot Barista, the night before. Since we are visiting at Sengkang General Hospital again, we decided to get another cuppa the next day but the robot arm got stuck and stopped working. We called and Whatsapp their staff via the QR code provided and my goodness, we were pleasantly surprised by the efficient and friendly service. Shane (via Whatsapp) and Davis, who came down in less than 5 minutes fixed the robot arm and received my drink in less than 2 minutes, after. He even offered another drink on the house as a thank you for being patience. AMAZING SERVICE! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",
