      "text": "It‚Äôs Xmas season and the place has nice merchandise. The salted caramel chocolate cake was divine. We ordered the strawberry cake but it started to ‚Äòmelt‚Äô and become soggy. When we raised it, the crew offered us another piece of the same cake. We were uncomfortable as the mannerism from one of the Malay guys was abrupt and he looked upset too. We did not want the same strawberry cake to prevent risk of eating another soggy cake. They then exchanged it for a salted caramel cake. Overall, I‚Äôve always had a good experience at Starbucks here but the attitude of this staff was a turn off as he was not mindful",

He is always smiling, very enthusiastic and passionate about what he does and would even bring my drink to me if i am busy with other matters. It indeed is a pleasant experience at Starbucks Downtown East when Marlon is on duty. Thank you for making my experience there a great one !",
