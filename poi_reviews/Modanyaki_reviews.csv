Doreen Luah,4,"Dropped by an okonomiyaki shop at Takashimaya for a quick bite and tried their modanyaki. It was pretty decent overall—drizzled with tomato sauce and mayonnaise, giving it that familiar sweet and tangy kick.

What I really enjoyed were the fried eggs and noodles; they were flavorful and well-cooked, adding a nice texture to the dish. Not the most mind-blowing okonomiyaki I’ve had, but it hit the spot if you’re craving something warm and comforting. However, their takoyaki doesn’t meet my standards.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115013917741354521755/reviews
Di Di,5,I forgot what I ordered. It brought back memories more than two decades of memories. The serving is really huge. It most probably will take two to finish this. The cabbage has been parboiled. There is a slice of ham. The noodles are well seasoned and it is topped with a scrambled egg with teriyaki and mayonnaise.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews
N Y,2,"The noodles were relatively dry and not flavorful enough. This is far from typical Japanese cuisine standard, hence the marked down. The price point is still considered reasonable and salvaged one star. All things considered probably won’t eat from here again.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105633440650460007544/reviews
tiv,1,"Their yakisoba tastes really bad now. Just bought and tried, noodle is bland and has a super sour taste to it. Not sure what went wrong. I used to patronise them a lot because of the good price and quality but I think this will be my last.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116748579144459718418/reviews
littlebitofnoms,4,"Generous portions, prepared fast, and the modanyaki is good. The thick noodles are chewy with a nice bite and the sweet and tangy sauce combined with the creaminess of mayo is the highlight! Worth trying and it’s pretty fun watching your noodles get prepared on site.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105189557995353438074/reviews
