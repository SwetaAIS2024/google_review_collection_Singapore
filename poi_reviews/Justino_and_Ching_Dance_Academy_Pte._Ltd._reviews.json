      "text": "I have been learning latin dance from JCDA for many years, and I enjoy dancing there as it brings me happiness and at the same time release my stress from my school work. The teacher there is very patient in teaching and professional. The teacher taught me to be more confident, perseverance and prepare me from competition. I wasn‚Äôt confident in myself previously, after they taught me, I became more confident and trusting myself that I am able to reach my goal in competition. So, I do recommend people to come and learn, there is no age limit and you don‚Äôt have to worry that you have zero basics as they will teach you patiently.",

      "text": "Teacher Ching is very detailed in her teaching. She focuses a lot on techniques to help students achieve stronger dance foundation. I‚Äôve been taking lessons with her to prepare for my competition and she has prepared me well, helping me to look more refined on the dance floor. She also hears my concerns on what I think I‚Äôm weak and want to improve eg my arms and arms styling and she finds the best ways to help. When I watch my practice or comps vid, I can see improvements. Will definitely recommend JCDA if you are looking for kind and patient coaches üëç",

He‚Äôs able to breakdown the steps and things like weight shift in an easy to understand way. I don‚Äôt get that from other instructors.\nAlways looking forward to attend his classes!",
