Edwina Pariwono,5,"Great selection of food and drinks with three halal stalls available. Must-tries include the Kimchi Paper-Wrapped Fish from the Mala stall and the Nan Ru Pork from Dynasty Fried Porridge. For halal options, Crave serves up tasty Korean-style crispy chicken.

Nice vibes, plenty of seating, and a live band at night adds to the lively atmosphere.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110865738734976473001/reviews

Nick,5,"SUCH A COOL PLACE! Look at me! This is the life. Chicken wings, live band, and really nice windy place! Do visit in the evenings from 7.30 pm onwards. There is a different live band everyday. The Saturday one is good. The crowd is singing along as I type this. So cool!

Cravy Korean chicken wings is really good. Love their Osaka flavour. They even provide gloves!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103527161898281171382/reviews
Kai,5,"Catered to the attendees from the expo events. This place offers different varieties of cuisine which surprisingly good quality üëçüèª but of course the price is definitely not budget friendly.

Ordered the sio bak and char siew and taste damn good! The skin is crunchy but not hard. Damn good! The thai food is legit good! üëçüèª soup is flavourful and the minced pork rice with the runny egg is very good! Well seasoned but a little tad spicy.
For the roast pork by Iskina Cebu, the skin is tough and portion is pathetic...  it is a very disappointing dish actually. So big no for this stall.

Otherwise the place has lotsa seats and well planned Q system to prevent long standing queues.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117612273412230021726/reviews
