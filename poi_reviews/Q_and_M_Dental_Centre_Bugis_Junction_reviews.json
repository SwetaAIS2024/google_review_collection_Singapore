Dr Maria Sherilyn was very skillful in her works and explained clearly every step from grounding down of the tooth to fixing the temporary crown while giving constant assurance. Both of them were very professional and thoughtful while making sure I was comfortable throughout the whole procedure.",

      "text": "I had to do a filing urgently so I popped into the nearest dentist. I always hate to visit dentist, but I was so lucky to meet Dr Edward Chun was on duty. Dr Edward was so patient, warm, friendly, assurance, attentive and helpful. The last few visits I had to do more complicated matter, Dr Edward was so gentle and caring. He always let me know when his next move and what he will be doing. Constantly checking with me if I'm ok. Even the nurse was so sweet that she actually was calming me when I had a injection. One of the rare time when I visit dentist without having any fear. I feel so relaxed and confident with Dr Edward. I want to highly recommended Dr Edward to anyone who needs a very good dentist.  Thank you Doc. My last few visits, all the receptionists and nurses are very nice too.",
