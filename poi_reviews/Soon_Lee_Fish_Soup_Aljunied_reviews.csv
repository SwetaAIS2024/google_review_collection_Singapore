cse1217,5,"Soon Lee Fish Soup Aljunied is one of the best fish soups I have eaten. The queue is long, especially during lunch hours, but it's worth joining the queue.

The slice fishes are really fresh and thick. The soup is nice. It's very nutritious, too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116495992746370870847/reviews

Ong Willy,1,Honestly their broth is full of MSG And which explained that their soup taste nice. Felt damn thirsty after having this meal and had to keep drinking water to quench that thirst. Definitely tasted better one elsewhere. Will surely be my first and last time. They don't accept CDC vouchers too.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109288222774561093638/reviews
