Nandhini Nandy,5,I have been using Costume City for the 2nd year to rent theme costume for my company's D&D. They have excellent choices and staffs are super friendly and accommodative. Gives us suggestions and don't mind trying out as much as we want. No rushing. Would greatly recommend if u have any costumes to buy or rent.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114296105537554488910/reviews
Benjamin ‚ÄúSantaBox‚Äù P,5,"Was sourcing for costumes for our event when I happened to find Costume City!

The staff there are very pleasant to work with and the variety of costumes is aplenty!

They import quite a number of costumes from overseas but rest assured the quality is there!

Prices and deposits are competitive too, cheaper dare I say.

While it was initially difficult to find costumes online because of the lack of a proper catalogue, the only reason for that is really because of the variety of costumes they have!

If you want to rent costumes for events and such, I would recommend Costume City!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111477856586867138674/reviews
