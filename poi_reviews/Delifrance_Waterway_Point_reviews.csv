Amos,5,"Had a wonderful experience at D√©lifrance Waterway Point. The food was fresh and satisfying, but what really stood out was the exceptional service from Chris. Instead of just calling out my order at the counter, he personally brought the food to my table with a warm smile‚Äîsomething you don‚Äôt often see at casual dining spots. That small gesture made a big difference and really elevated the whole visit. Kudos to Chris for going the extra mile and making customers feel genuinely valued. Will definitely be back!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103800206493798530961/reviews
Nurjannah Purba,5,"My favourite place so far, the foods are delicious, and service just nice, but excellent today, because one of them very professional help me to take initiative make payment of mine sort of 90 cent from $50.90 of my bill. After I returned back the amount of 90 cent plus a bit more for his sincere help, he returned me back the balance of my money. It's such a good person with a good heart. I really appreciate. Thank you Chris @ Waterway Point Delifrance. I am your customer n always comeback for the good atmosphere üòä",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111905827652465650456/reviews
Sneha Babu,5,"Splendid service by the staff on 30 April 2025. Helped me decide on the item to buy (Tahiti Pizza - Veg and Hawaiian Style), and was accomodating to my request to heat up the pizza for a longer time. Space is small, hope they can expand into a bigger place!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105522300513183650503/reviews
yazami halim,1,"Disappointing Service at Delifrance Waterway Point

I‚Äôve always enjoyed visiting caf√©s around Singapore, but my recent experience at Delifrance Waterway Point was unfortunately one of the worst. The service was cold and unwelcoming from the moment we stepped in. The staff stood behind the counter, expressionless, offering no greeting or recommendations. There was no effort to promote any ongoing monthly specials  or bestsellers‚Äîsomething most caf√©s do to engage customers.

What stood out even more was the poor attitude of the team. The male crew member or manager simply stared blankly at us, offering no assistance. But the real letdown came from the lady at the cashier. I politely asked if my cappuccino could be made with low-fat milk. Instead of answering my question, she dismissively replied, ‚ÄúCappuccino comes with milk.‚Äù Clearly, I‚Äôm aware of that‚Äîas someone who frequents caf√©s, I was simply asking if low-fat milk was available. Either she wasn‚Äôt listening or was trying to act smart.

To make things worse, she opened the fridge and showed me the milk they use‚Äîwithout even clarifying if it‚Äôs regular or low-fat. If you don‚Äôt have it, just say so. Don‚Äôt make a show out of something so basic. This lack of product knowledge and customer understanding was disappointing.

Delifrance should really look into training this outlet‚Äôs team in basic customer service. Compared to the warm and engaging staff at the Sengkang General Hospital outlet, the Waterway Point team falls far behind. The Sengkang team knows how to greet customers, recommend items, and make people feel welcome‚Äîsomething this team urgently needs to learn.

Honestly, this experience makes me think twice about returning. No surprise the outlet was nearly empty, while your competitor just across the way was bustling with activity. It says a lot when a newer brand outshines a well-established name like Delifrance. Time to catch up.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113284150546438754025/reviews
