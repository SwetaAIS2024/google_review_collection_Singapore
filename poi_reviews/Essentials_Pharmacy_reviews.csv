Brandon,5,I can see why this is the highest rated pharmacy in the area. The customer service is unmatched. Staff show true compassion and caring.

Truly grateful for their care whilst I‚Äôm in my state of sickness.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113903499644488704042/reviews

Frederic Maetz,5,"Amazing üëç service and extreme kindness of the people here in the shop. They took time to advice me very well. They even offered a trade in of my diabetes device to monitor blood sugar that was not compatible with the reading tablets in singapore. They offered me another system monitor for free in replacement of my old one. I just had to buy new local tablets.
