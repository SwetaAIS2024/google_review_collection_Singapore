Restrooms are the best this part of Singapore.\n\nReally, which station's cashiers answer the phone. Well, this one did. Not once but three times.\n\nWe needed to check the availability of something (almost life and death to me). And she saved my day.\n\nNever pumped Caltex for decades but today, I filled up full tank. And will definitely come back again.",

I've been in an accident twice and went there to wash the blood off my injured hand but the staff will immediately tend to my wounds with first aid. Prices are the same standard everywhere. Just be careful of the u turn when coming here as it's near a bend and oncoming cars might not see you clearly.",
