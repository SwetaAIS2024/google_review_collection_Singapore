Amanda Cheong,5,"Dr Cheong is kind, empathetic and she will answer to your questions in the moment honest manner. You may need a few months before you get results. She will suggest the most basic steps needed for your skincare routine, and if you stick to it, you will see your results. Also, the best part is, she doesn't sell any of her expensive treatments or products unless you ask for it, or if it's absolutely necessary. My acne and old acne spots have healed tremendously with some basic products.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112964581443046373052/reviews

My skin was terrible from all the wrong skin care. My confidence killed itself from having such massive breakouts. She advised me to stop everything & starts anew (while taking meds). Took me a year, but it’s so worth it!!! My skin looks so good, and with such simple steps. Super informative, non commercial & super kind!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115796530706686413923/reviews
Yusma Kuswadi,4,"It was just a week left for my wedding day and I was worried about unwanted acnes on my face, then my friend told me about LL Cheong Skin & Laser Clinic in Singapore. The services on offer at this skin clinic were just superb. The dermatologists at the center provided effective treatment for my skin problems. All the treatments at the clinic were done keeping in mind the sensitivity of my skin.

The services offered at the clinic are cost-effective and delivered the finest possible results in minimum time. I therefore recommend LL Cheong Skin & Laser Clinic to all those who want to effectively cure pimples and acne problems in Singapore.",10 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111095574543318382144/reviews
