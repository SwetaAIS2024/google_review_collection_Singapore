The day was really engaging, full of useful tips and enriching practical learning.\n\nThey know their stuff and also shared a lot of helpful advice on the kind of soft skills that are necessary when you're actually out there teaching. A great experience, felt well-supported and came away with a lot more confidence and enthusiasm thanks to them.",

These role plays were very closely related or mimicking real life situations during coaching.\nOverall, it was a very rewarding experience.",
