I informed him I needed my passport photo done in a day, and he was very accommodating to my request, taking only 20 minutes w editing, etc. I highly recommend this place if you want to get your passport photo taken. My photo came out beautifully, He’s fast and efficient not to mention he’s really friendly!!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115061629980520611810/reviews
Joy Lee,5,"It’s so difficult to find a good photo shop these days. But LK is definitely one of the best. The owner is kind patience and friendly. Even when it’s a simple passport photo, he goes the extra mile to make you look good. It’s a wonderful experience compared to the clinical staff who doesn’t care, at the other shops I have been to.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109266811252611679493/reviews
