Flo Yeow,3,"Random bus stop in the middle of orchard road, right opposite Scape and Orchard Cineleisure. I say it's random because there's no shelter nor anything connected to this bus stop, which makes it quite a pain to get to if you're stranded and need to get somewhere. Beyond that, it's also that confusing bus stop where buses split between the road behind Ngee Ann City / Wisma Atria, and the main road. Vs the previous stop at Somerset. So you'll need to be mindful of these things.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
