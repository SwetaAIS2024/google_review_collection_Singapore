      "text": "Been going to Time TCM since 2023. Lily has been my 推拿师父 from the start. I been having neck, shoulder and lower back pain due to work nature. But after every tuina session by Lily. I felt so much better and can sleep well at night. Lily was very specialised in her tuina. If i got any area that is more painful then usual she will help look into it and put more focus to it to help me relieve the pain. I been to several other Tuina tcm places but non was as good as Lily. Thumb up for Lily's skills and advices on how to take care of my health. 张医师 was very good in her specialise. She helped me and my sister with accupunture.",

If you have PA or any coverage that can allow you to claim TCM this shop highly recommended. I have mild stroke resulting in my hand being numb and they lowkey fixed it.",

      "text": "I had an exceptional experience with the therapy services here. The therapist demonstrated incredible skill and a deep understanding of my condition, tailoring the treatment to address my specific issues. I visited for relief from lower back pain, shoulder pain, and some inner body tension, and I was amazed at how effective the therapy was.\n\nThe therapist took the time to listen to my concerns and explained the approach they would use, which made me feel comfortable and confident in their expertise. Their technique was both precise and intuitive, targeting problem areas with just the right amount of pressure (tuina), accompanied by other treatment such as acupuncture, guasha and cupping.\n\nAfter the session, I felt a significant reduction in pain and tension, and I’ve noticed continued improvement in the days following. I highly recommend this place for anyone seeking effective, professional, and compassionate massage therapy.",
