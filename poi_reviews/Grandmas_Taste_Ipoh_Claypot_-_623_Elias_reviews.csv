Me T,1,"Bak kut teh had barely any taste, ingredients were a bit sad, what you see in the pics are as is, no hidden ingredients underneath. Curry was decent. Overall I'll blacklist this place and won't return",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108574826620835359575/reviews
Darren,1,"Hi guys, let me be the 1st person to review this store. It is a new store and the food tastes average and the bat ku teh costs $9.5 with rice which is bloody expensive. Guess what's the best part, it provides only innoki mushroom, 3 slices of pork belly and 2 mini meat when i take away. Absolutely garbage and trash! Highly recommend u to try the bat ku teh at the top with air-conditioned. This is the 1st time and last trying.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109978737325132432353/reviews
