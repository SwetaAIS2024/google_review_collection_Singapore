Flo Yeow,3,"It's a clean MRT station. It's also extremely well connected to all the neighboring malls, sheltered, easy access, etc. Lastly, there's also the bus interchange that will bring you further to other parts of town.

That said, it's unfortunately extremely crowded, all times of the day. Especially during peak hours, you'll want to either avoid, or factor in extra time.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews

Francis Pang,3,I think this MRT is okay. There is 2 shopping mall in front of it. And there is a hawker centre as well. The only bad thing is that the MRT Station will be crowded during weekday peak hours. You have to wait for around 3 MRT trains before you can board on one.,8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113012214306912309633/reviews

Vicq,5,"Beside the Clementi MRT station are the Clementi Mall, Grantrall Mall and the HDB blocks as seen in the photos. Bus interchange is situated on first floor of Clementi mall so convenient to switch between MRT and buses.  There are four exits and the frequently used two exits lead to Clementi Mall and shops beyond Grantrall Mall.  There is a 7-11 in the control station level together with the DBS and UOB atms.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106473378023729080154/reviews
