LIM CLARK,5,"I had bought the LED frame from poster hub when they were still at Esplanade shop and recently the led no bright .
Brought down my LED frame to their shop at Tampines yesterday (04-05-25)and owner Dennis assisted me to change to a new LED power adapter and redo the wire harness which really appreciated and even help to clean the frame which was 7 years ago lol.
Really good after sales service .
Highly recommended to anyone around the world to purchase poster from them.

Gelli Rico,5,"I got the exact same poster I was looking for from this store! It's my first time to have a ""chirashi"" and it made all the experience so meaningful for me. I'm a huge fan of Attack On Titan and I was so happy that I discovered Poster Hub SG.

I do recommend folks to visit their showroom as they got tons of pretty prints in wide range and various categories and sizes. The place is cool too and the staff accommodated me very well. I had a fast and smooth online purchase and fun overall experience!! Will definitely come back for those Japanese anime film chirashi!!

Ms. Suchi Singapore,5,"I was passing by 1 Tampines North Drive 3 and I came across this biggest poster collection in Singapore, and possibly S.E Asia named @Posterhub.sg

I had a pleasant experience there.

üèÜDo you know that Poster Hub specialized in Art, Decoration and Collectible merchandise?
