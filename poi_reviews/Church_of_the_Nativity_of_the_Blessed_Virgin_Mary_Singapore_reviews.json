      "text": "Was recently at the church for the wake of my aunt. One of the parish priests dropped in to pay his respects, which I thought was a lovely gesture. Could see from the people coming and going from the entrance next to the funeral parlour that this is a vibrant church. This is confirmed from the many posters around the church publicising their current activities.\n\nWe were mistakenly informed that the sunset mass was at 515pm and wondered why the church was so quiet at 5pm. It was full by 6pm when mass started! The choir was amazing. Sound system perfect! The warden in charge of our area was wonderfully welcoming, greeting everyone with a cheerful smile.\n\nThis church is beautiful inside and outside. I wish i had the time to walk the garden and pray the stations of the cross. I wonder also why the pews in our section were so long, taking in about 14 per pew.",

Just outside the church is an altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary where anyone can light a candle and just sit comfortably reflecting any time of the day. Yes, round the clock place for reflection and prayer and is open to anyone.\nThe Church has a very beautiful architecture inside. A good parking space is available. They also provide rooms for gatherings, teachings and fellowship. I truly appreciate the availability of water fountain for both cold and warm water. The Church have masses timings and each has wonderful voices of choir to sing.\nThere is a feeling of home and warm welcome whenever I come here and gentle wardens to show available seats. A feeling that always makes me want to come back again.",
