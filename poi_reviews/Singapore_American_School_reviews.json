      "text": "School has not care of others. especially the traffic has caused an issue to Woodgrove residents. They engage the traffic control but the officer can still let vehicle to stop at road side, or even a turning point where caused the jam to residents who also need to sent off their kids to and off school. Has called many times feedback, with pictures for a year. No action at all. such a International school with big compound yet all vehicles came to jam up residents here with no reason.\nImagine i need to wait for them to in, then u-turn out one by one? Just a 1mins turn back home yet can wait more than 10-30mins?\nThis is worst than driving at CTE.\nImagine such big school yet can't even let cars drive in for drop off? Even our Singapore local school will not even block the road for that long. So why such international school has the privileges?",

      "text": "Spoiled students (treat you terribly if you’re not good looking or outstanding at something —huge rat race, especially if you’re in the wrong group of friends). Lots of uninterested and extremely biased teachers who love to power trip and have huge favourites rather than actually teaching subject material and beyond (expect for a few bright spots). Huge lack of school spirit while there is a lot of bad school food (sodexo is terrible and Hoe’s catering is much better). Most of admin (especially the deans and student council) is also clueless and students who leave the school often don’t come back because of the toxicity they breed and the fact that they don’t listen to student input. Overall an expensive school that doesn’t provide value for money.",
