Dragontiger05,1,"Please advice the tall girl wearing scarf to properly do her work cause everytime i buy from there, she is rude, customer service very bad, keep mumbling and not doing her work properly. Been there a few times and she is always pushing her job to others as i can see. Will report this to your hq if this girl still doesnt change her work attitude. Very bad.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113766821033034714005/reviews

Chin Yee Chong,1,"Liho junction 10, lousy CS! Worst CS ever!! Wrongly packed my order to the next customer, he came back to return my drink. Your staff (the short Chinese girl!) just repacked it into another bag, not calling my number, no apologies and display the next customer’s number on the screen. I continue to wait to see what happens. Still nothing! At the end I had to be the one to ask her if that’s my order and then when she said thats mine!! Seriously??!???!! Additionally, the previous customer had gone with the drink, just repack and gave it to me?? And that’s your standard?????",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106016265746792498318/reviews
Edward Wong,5,"Paid $5.70 for a large cup of no. 76 Passion Roselle Smoothie with Konjac. The drink was refreshing given the hot weather. Although it was 50% sugar, it was still too sweet. Service was great as the lady at the counter waited patiently for me to choose my drink. Then she was also friendly in guiding me to redeem the Far East mall voucher.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110173188680901424865/reviews
