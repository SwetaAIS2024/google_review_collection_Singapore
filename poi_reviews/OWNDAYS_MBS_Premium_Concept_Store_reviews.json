      "text": "Visited the OWNDAYS MBS Premium Concept Store on 4 April around 1pm for the first time—but left disappointed. I booked an eye test to check for glasses prescription and included additional remarks to include contact lens, yet only the latter was done. Although the optometrist did his good job in finding a contact lens prescription that fits well, the overall experience was lacking.\n\nDespite mentioning several times that my spectacle frame was broken, no one followed up or offered help while I browsed frames as they packed my lens order. I asked if my prescription would be saved to my profile for online ordering— the lady staff said she’d check but didn’t, and proceeded to cash out instead.\n\nLater, I found the recorded prescription in my account didn’t match what the optometrist told me. When I asked how to get my glasses prescription, his response was simply “subtract 0.25 from each side.”\n\nPoor attention to detail despite me being the only appointment customer at that point. Definitely not the service I expected from a flagship store. Won’t be returning to this MBS outlet.",
