fenghua qi,1,"As an alumni of Raffles Design Institute, I must express my disappointment with their customer service. It's evident that the school prioritizes profit over student support. Despite high tuition fees, the level of service provided is inadequate. Potential applicants should carefully consider these factors before enrolling.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100211186730657378576/reviews
Melissa Aw,5,"I’m currently writing this review as a student doing a postgraduate program.  Indeed before signing up for the course I was surprise to see many negative reviews about the student services. After 6 months, i decided to write my personal experience. There is always someone in my case Ms Sue (aka ms Kaur) who always helped me in person over the counter. However, further processing or red tapes might indeed take much longer time for example a month to resolve such as ‘graduates referral fees’ or student ID cards for library facial recognition access etc. On the other hand; invoices or receipts or internal feedback systems are very much immediately available online for the student portal for access.
Administration aside; the program provided here are of industrial standard and will be applicable to the working world. In fact, i have a few classmates who continued many years in this school from diploma to masters. My lecturer Mr Jack Liew is knowledgeable and prompt in response. Class size is small about 15 and its very appropriate for consultation. I seriously hope that they will keep this size as I felt it conducive for learning. Coventry university also recently in oct-nov did a review with us students gathering feedback about Raffles as a partner. Therefore, my impression was that processes for self-checks and improvements are in place. Hope this will bring better experiences for all in the future. Please keep this up Raffles.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107701735181442278856/reviews

Mila Mille,1,"Raffles College of Higher education doesn't have anything of an international school. No training is given to the teacher to understand the student diversity. The treatment of students is far from a priority. It goes from insults, bullying and yelling to passive aggressive attacks. Students and teachers are given the freedom to mistreat others without consequence.

My experience at Raffles was left without any help from the management team who was more concern by an unfounded potential legal threat then they were to fix major problems in their institution. You should considered more then twice if you want to study there or to enroll your children. Please, look at their Glassdoor page and other review platforms before you make a decision.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114545164217394951472/reviews
Andrew Wong,5,"I recently applied to and was accepted into Raffles College. My education consultant Ms. Gaya has been super helpful, considerate and patient. Thanks to her the entire application process went smoothly; from course application up till student pass stage, and even after the course had already started, Ms. Gaya continues to provides prompt communication when needed. In addition, all of my design teachers have also been very insightful and understanding. I am looking forward to a great learning experience with the team at Raffles College!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114058775070010996935/reviews
