Notable landmarks here include 3 condos, 1 mall, 1 hawker center and numerous eating places.\n\nPeople come to Kovan mostly for the food or to catch a bus to Tampines. It's tough to enter the train here during peak hours, as it's right smack between two concentrated places.\n\nThere are 3 exits at this station and the toilets are above ground. There is also OCBC ATM.",
