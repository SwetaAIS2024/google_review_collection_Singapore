      "text": "Skewers, Salted Egg & Seriously Good Flavours\n\nTucked along the ever-busy Jalan Kayu, A Kitchen delivered a memorable dining experience that ticked all the right boxes‚Äîfrom amazing food to a cozy and comfortable setting.\n\nWe kicked things off with the skewered beef and lamb‚Äîsucculent, smoky, and perfectly marinated. Each bite was juicy and tender, with just the right char that brought out the full depth of flavour. Skewer lovers, this one‚Äôs a must.\n\nThen came a showstopper: the salted egg pumpkin. This unique dish was a beautiful balance of textures‚Äîcrunchy on the outside, soft and sweet within, and coated with a rich, creamy salted egg yolk sauce that was indulgent without being overpowering. Simply addictive.\n\nThe eggplant dish was packed with flavour and aromatic flair. Soft, silky slices of eggplant were fused with garlic, spring onions, and chives, giving it a fragrant lift and a savoury depth that lingered deliciously on the palate.\n\nAs a separate dish, the squid came stir-fried with lots of onions and red chillies. Despite the visual heat, it was mildly spicy, making it incredibly moreish without overwhelming the senses. The squid had just the right chew and soaked up the flavours beautifully.\n\nThe restaurant itself was warm and welcoming‚Äîbrightly lit with woody decor, giving off cozy modern vibes. There were ample seats, with a choice of air-conditioned indoor dining or fan-cooled outdoor tables.\n\nService was smooth and efficient, thanks to a well-staffed crew who kept everything moving comfortably.\n\nAnd the best part? Taste: 10/10. Every dish delivered. Waiting time was only around 8 minutes, making the whole experience even more impressive.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre here for the skewers or something a little more adventurous, A Kitchen at Jalan Kayu is a hidden gem that‚Äôs definitely worth a visit.\n\n#sedapinsg #shiokytai #supershiok #shiokinsg\n\nApril 2025",

      "text": "We ordered three types of skewers, a beef fried rice, and a grilled eggplant for two pax. The beef fried rice, priced at $6, was a generous portion and tasted good. The grilled eggplant was smooth and melted in the mouth but was overly oily, almost soaked in oil. Among the skewers ($1 each), we particularly enjoyed the Special Marinated Beef and Pork Kebab but would skip the Beef Kebab on our next visit. Service was friendly and efficient, and free water was provided. With plenty more dishes to explore, the ones we tried was around 4-star rating.",

      "text": "Chanced upon this place when I wanted to eat mala. What caught my attention was the price of the skewer, $1 each.\n\nThe portion of the skewers are generous, so are the dishes. The lamb skewer is super good, the special beef skewer is too spicy for me. Fried egg and tomato and the grilled long beans is a must order when I eat there.\n\nDefinitely heavier on the flavours but I love it. Always leave with a full stomach and a satisfied taste bud üòã",

They have a fridge of liquor and drinks as well as ice and glass cups at the side for self service. Only charges gst and no service charge. Suggest to go earlier to beat the queue during dinner time over the weekends. Allow cashless transaction.",
