Keep it up Luckin!\n—————\nI paid $7.80 for a fizzy grape Americano using the app, but when I came to collect the drink, I saw that the price advertised on the board was $6.40. Which means that I was over charged by $1.40.\n\nThe barista explained that we should not refer to the board as the reduced price was only if you had a special voucher in the app (nowhere was this stated)\n\nIn other words, the menu pricing is deceptive and the real price for someone trying to purchase the drink is more expensive than the advertised.",

When I questioned the discrepancy, the staff explained that the lower price is only applicable with an in-app voucher.\n\nNot every customer will have or use the voucher, and displaying a discounted price that requires a voucher is very misleading.\n\n𝗘𝗻𝘃𝗶𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: 𝟯/𝟱\n\nPublic seating which I appreciate. The seating area often has an unpleasant smell. Admittedly, this seems to be a mall's issue rather than the kiosk’s responsibility.\n\n𝗖𝗼𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗲: 𝟱/𝟱\n\nThe coffee itself is enjoyable, which is why I’m giving 2 stars instead of 1.",
