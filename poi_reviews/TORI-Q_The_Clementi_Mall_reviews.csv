Dylan Li,3,"The skewer options can vary as one of the ones I wanted wasn't available and they weren't particularly hot when I got them, but they tasted ok. I liked the deep fried dumplings though. Not the biggest fan of the seasoning on the rice as I got tired of it by the end.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115227455027475284936/reviews
Gator,4,"Had lunch here with the kids. Ordering process was easy, just choose whatever you want in food cabinet, has the option to add them to a plate of rice. Their sauce was sweet and savory. Meat was grilled to perfection without being too dry. Economical in my opinion as well considering the quality of their ingredients.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
Alvin Choo,4,"Have been eating their Set A for Saturday dinner for quite a while now, when I'm too lazy to leave the house. It's totally serviceable and at 9pm, there are also not many other options available. The soy sauce, pickles and proteins come together to make an enjoyable quick meal.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
Louis Chua,5,"First time ate in the stall in Clementi Mall. Usually will just do takeaways. The customer service is quite pleasant when my wife ordered. They are ok to add additional sauce onto the rice when my wife requested. The food is is comfort food. The rice servicing is generous and I love the pickles although having some takuan will really be awesome. All the grilled stuff that we ordered tasted great even though we just had dinner at Eng Heritage. The place is small but no one seems to be eating in, so we had the whole counter to ourselves. Will definitely be back.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117782437474545961841/reviews
