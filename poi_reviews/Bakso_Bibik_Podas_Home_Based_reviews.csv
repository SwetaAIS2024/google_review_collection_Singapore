Joyce H,5,"Friendly and warm service by lady boss herself! While they normally do takeaways, our party of 2 were offered a lovely table setting. Soup was a little salty for my taste but the bakso and meat was generous and the sambal was shiok spicy and fresh. Thank u for your hospitality!:)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109453883379370118404/reviews
