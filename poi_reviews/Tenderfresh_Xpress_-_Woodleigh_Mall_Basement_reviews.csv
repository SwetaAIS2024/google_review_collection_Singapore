Loh Soon Shan,5,"Just discovered Tenderfresh Xpress at Woodleigh Mall and loved it! The Brioche Chicken Sausage Roll is a flavor explosion with its juicy sausage, tangy sauces, and spicy jalapeños. The Truffle Beef Rice Bowl and Salmon Rice Bowl are equally delicious and packed with fresh ingredients. Plus, it’s halal-certified! A hidden gem for a quick, satisfying meal. Highly recommend checking it out!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114194136783291087444/reviews

Zanne Goh,5,"I was planning for a picnic last weekend and I decided to buy the sausage rolls from Tenderfresh Xpress. I got all the 5 flavours.
.
. Black Pepper Sausage Roll $6.50
. Cheesy Sausage Roll $7.90
. Jalapenos Salsa Sausage Roll $6.50
. Sriracha Sausage Roll $6.50
. Yellow Mustard Sausage Roll $6.50
.
Almost all the flavours are spicy except the cheesy sausage. So I got two rice bowls as well. The salmon rice bowl ($10.90) and the truffle beef rice bowl. ($12.90). The rice bowls come with turmeric rice, lots of corn and edamame. I enjoyed them a lot.
.
My favourite flavours of the sausage rolls are the cheesy and the mustard. Its a place to go for delicious and fuss free takeaway meals.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100440808348603157604/reviews
Shawna Lim,4,"Can give the brioche chicken sausage roll a try if you want something different from the usual fried or roast chicken. The Jalapeno Salsa Sausage Roll was my favourite: tasty and flavourful. Ordered the rice bowl too, if will be great if I can choose the style of the egg coz I’m not a fan of onsen eggs.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104998866997771855288/reviews
