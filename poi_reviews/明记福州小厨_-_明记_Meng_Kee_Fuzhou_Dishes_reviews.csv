Visited them since they were in Owen road.
Yummy Á∫¢ÈÖíÈ∏°Èù¢Á∫ø, noodles, fish maw soup, etc
They shifted here a few months ago to this is new coffee shop, quite clean and nice, ample parking too.

MingKai Chin,5,"Ordered the usual red rice wine chicken with mee Sua (S$8) and the Lor mee (S$5).  It's very good, it brings me back to my younger days... Lor mee portion is good for 2 paxs.  The food is served to you at your table...",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117391482583827868481/reviews
SSN 91,5,Nice foods. Feel like home cook. Nice crabs & prawn . Fresh & taste really good. The red glutinos wine pork belly also very nice and taste really nice and value for money. I am sure will come back again.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105150841967475178844/reviews
Nahshon,3,"For a Tze Char stall, it is generally quite average. The sliced fish with onions is very underwhelming. The salted egg pork is much tastier and very well fried. We also ate some Prawn Paste Chicken, which is probably the tastiest of all the dishes we bought. Serving portion is quite small and hence not the most value for money compared to other Tze Char stores in Singapore. It is slightly more expensive (i.e. 8 prawn paste chicken for $10, but other stalls are selling 10 for $10!)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117146047820211346341/reviews
Enoch C,5,"Black pepper crab - a little bit sweet but at a great price point.
Cereal Shrimp - highlight of the meal. Excellently crispy and very buttery. Totally delicious.
Great chili clams also with ample sauce to go with white rice.

Well ventilated outdoor covered seating area of around 20 tables or so.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107870422306028854608/reviews
