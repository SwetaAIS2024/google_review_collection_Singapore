      "text": "I can‚Äôt speak highly enough of my guitar coach , Chester. He has been incredibly patient , focusing not only in techniques but also on building my confidence. I am now much more confident with chord changes. What I really appreciate is his extra help in singing too. I‚Äôve never been particularly confident in my voice, but he takes the time to find the right key for me. This has made a huge difference in my ability to sing and play simultaneously, something I never thought I‚Äôd be able to do. He‚Äôs also very creative when it comes to rhythm. Every song we work on is layered with unique rhythmic patterns, which has made me far more versatile as a player. .I‚Äôve been under Chester‚Äôs coaching for over 2 years now and I can honestly say he‚Äôs been a game-changer for me. Playing the guitar is never boring for me anymore. His teaching style is patient, thorough and tailored to my needs, making the process both enjoyable and effective.",
