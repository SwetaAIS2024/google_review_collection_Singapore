Derek Wong,1,"This branch removed the price checker for unknown reason. To make matter worse, so many items are without price label (especially items in the ground floor bread/cake area). How would customers know how much they are paying? Horrible service.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113099601110524171199/reviews
rudy ridwen,5,"In the south of the island, there are 12 NTUC FairPrices – Alexandra Retail Centre, Telok Blangah St, Depot Heights, Brickworks Estate, Lengkok Bahru, Alexandra View (Artra), Bukit Merah Central, Havelock Rd, Tiong Bahru Plaza, Kim Tian, Silat Ave, and VivoCity Xtra. In my opinion, the best is VivoCity, followed with Bukit Merah Central. Bukit Merah has a few things going for it 1) comprehensive range of products, 2) most times without crowds, 3) convenient parking, 4) Unity pharmacy.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115639235466606138532/reviews
