      "text": "A good learning environment and teachers' teaching are very important. Like many parents, I took my child to a few kindergarten to take a look. Only this kindergarten is different from the others as soon as you step in. Its educational policy and philosophy are different from other schools. The principal is the founder of this school. She supervises students and teachers in the school every day. She knows the operation of the school very well and is very strict about everything, which is also part of why I like this kindergarten. She is very experienced. When you don't know how to help your child, just approach her and she will be happy to guide you. Her teaching methods are very effective. My child looking forward to school every day.",

      "text": "We found The Little House Montessori after my girlâ€™s preschool closed down. I am impressed with Ms Katherineâ€™s beliefs and way of running the school. She conducts regular parents coffee sessions to share and discuss on various topics on our kidsâ€™ education and behaviors. I also experienced first-hand, her quick diagnosis and suggestions whenever we sought her advice throughout my kidâ€™s journey in TLH. Even though Iâ€™m not a first time parent, I must say I learnt a lot from Ms Katherine and her strong team. Very impressed with the low turnover rate of the teachers and the love and dedication that the teachers showered on the kids. Out of all my kids, the one who attends TLH is most willing to try to speak Mandarin at home, thanks to the schoolâ€™s way of learning.\nThere is a lot of emphasis on parents and school mutual support which I believe is necessary in educating a child. My kid is already saying that she wants to go back to her school as and when she can when sheâ€™s in primary school next year as she misses her teachers and friends! Thank you TLH!",

      "text": "TLH is truly a preschool with a difference. We were sad when our son's previous school closed and we had to find a new school for K1. However, it turned out a blessing in disguise because we found TLH. Despite visiting 12 other well-reputed preschools, I'm so glad we chose TLH.\n\nMrs Katherine, TLH's founder and principal, has a strong vision for the school and how it runs. She is also the most on-the-ground principal I've seen! From being at the gate every morning to welcome the kids, to teaching them, and engaging parents at dismissal/coffee mornings I'm assured her high standards are kept. One thing that struck me when I first walked into the school was how the kids were calm, happy and engaged. I see the philosophy of the school in every aspect of how it is run. Even when I've faced challenging behaviours with my kids, Mrs Katherine has given me advice from her extensive experience and tried-and-tested philosophy.\n\nMrs Katherine and her teachers also make the effort to know each child individually. During parent teacher meets (and throughout the school year in fact), they share insights that would only come from spending enough time with my child and interacting with him meaningfully.\n\nMany schools claim to develop the child holistically. TLH truly does this and in unique yet effective ways.\n\nMy son's previous preschool never brought up his gross motor skills as a concern. At the first parent teacher meet with TLH, they told me it needed working on. I was initially in doubt as I saw him to be adept in the area, especially as we invested time in outdoor play every day after school. However, besides daily outdoor play, TLH also has the most creative races/obstacle courses that train different muscles. A year later, my boy started martial arts outside of school and surprised me and the coaches with his agility. When I asked him why he was so good at the exercises, he said it's like what they do at TLH!\n\nThey have weekly cooking sessions where the kids are given the chance to do everything themselves, even when cutting, grating and stir-frying! Since then, my son started having an interest when I bake at home and independently helps me out.\n\nMy son was exposed to science experiments in TLH too. On multiple occasions, he was able to explain how something worked when even my older P2 daughter couldn't. Again, he would cite TLH as his source of knowledge ðŸ˜„\n\nI find some preschools charge exorbitantly, and I really don't like how that is amplified during the usual year-end concerts. For TLH, I've always felt their pricing was reasonable, whether in term fees or add-ons. They do not charge extra for their year-end concerts, but instead make it a team effort, where the kids and teachers create the props, costumes and backdrops themselves. That said, if you are the sort of parent who likes perfectly polished concerts likened to watching The Sound of Music on Broadway, this may not be for you. Instead, we look forward every year to performances that allow kids to be kids, and are planned, practiced and performed with much ownership from the kids themselves.\n\nOne common misconception about montessori schools is whether kids would be able to transit to mainstream primary. My son who is naturally not the most studious, has had an easy transition into Primary school. In K1, he used to not be able to concentrate on work for longer than 10 minutes. He is now able to concentrate and finish 4-5 pages of homework, and still go on to study for tingxie. He is able to follow the structure of formal schooling yet have the confidence to answer questions when he wants to.\n\nJust in case this is all sounding too good to be true - we as parents get no benefit out of writing good reviews for the school. It is testament to how much we love TLH. Mrs Katherine and her team have been a God-send for our family! Thank you, TLH!",

The excursions were fun and our gal enjoyed every single one of them.\nMs Katherine also was quick to advise us on our gal weakness in understanding some of the math fundamentals and advise us on what to enforce on during at home.\nThe teachers here are also caring and most of them haven change for the past 3 years.",

      "text": "I have experiences of 9 preschools, and this is a unique one, separating itself from the rest.  I agreed with Katherine children philosophy generally, but the culture will be thrown into confusion when kids enter rather rigid Singapore primary school system.  Most preschools dislike outings yet this school is able to organize around 12 outings a year, illustrating the effort over comfort.  There are still some cons but this school scores the highest in overall reviews of the 9 preschools.",
