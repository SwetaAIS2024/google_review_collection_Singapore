Ivan Ageev,5,Cozy atmosphere with great music selection. The food was good with pizza being a discovery. There is a wide selection of craft beer so if you’re interested you won’t be dissatisfied.

CP,5,"If you have a liking for burger and beer, and looking for a place to chill, then this is the spot to head to. I am quite delighted by the quality and portion of the smash burger and it comes with hand cut fries which is not so common as most places just serve shoe string fries. It is very hearty and satisfying with a glass of beer.  I have been back a few times and enjoyed other food on the menu and the relaxing ambience.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861923464679544218/reviews
Pink Bicycle,5,"One usually doesn’t expect great food at a pub, but you would be so surprised to discover that this place does amazing comfort food. Their pizzas are far better quality than most hyped up ‘trending’ pizza places. And their  smashed burger and buffalo wings are super yummy. A real gem and a chill place to hang out.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110225918018730477161/reviews
Vicky Chen Tan Hui Ying,5,Great neighborhood bar. The Sunday roast is hands down one of the best in Singapore with proper Yorkshire pudding and beef. Beer selection is great and service is amazing !,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116536878852015520222/reviews
Andrea Olivia Tan,5,"Cosy, laid back atmosphere, excellent food and warm and attentive service by staff (Jan/Tom/Charmaine) - this place is a true gem in the East! We had the free flow of alcohol (beer/wine/housepours) promo and Sunday Roast (we had lamb & beef) which were delicious and super great value for money! The roasted potatoes are simply TO DIE FOR! This is a place we'll absolutely re-visit!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104951276950825333976/reviews
