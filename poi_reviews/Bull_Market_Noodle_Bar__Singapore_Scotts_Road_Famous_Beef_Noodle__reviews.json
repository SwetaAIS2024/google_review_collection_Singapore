They take pride in using only premium ingredients to serve the best quality at reasonable price making it accessible for everyone to try. 💯 👍🏻 my only complaint is the plating/presentation can be improved. 😊",

O.M.G.\nWho even does that…\n\nOn top of that, I also really enjoy their highball with Laphroaig whisky. It had a really nice smoky, peaty flavour towards it.\n\nThank you chef & owner Abel for whipping our awesome dinner up. We will be back for more.",

      "text": "They have a limited time 1 for 1. promotion on their A5 Hokkaido Snow Beef, 🥩 Bull Charge Noodles (U.P. $28) till 7 june when you show @foodkakis video. Located near Outram Park/Maxwell MRT,  they pride themselves in serving the legacy of Singapore’s true food heritage, reimagined through the lens of affordable luxury ✨.\n\nYou need to try two of their famous beef noodles:\n\n🐮Bull Charge (Soup)\nA5 Hokkaido Snow Beef Shank, OZ beef tendon, NZ beef tripe, wagyu collagen broth, flat rice noodles, cilantro, beef chilli aioli\n\n🐄 Bull Market (Dry)\nA5 Hokkaido Snow Beef, wagyu collagen sauce, sago vermicelli, scallion, beef chilli aioli.\n\nUnlike other beef noodles which uses ordinary grade of beef, they use A5 Hokkaido Snow Beef 🥩 which is considered a rare and highly sought after delicacy! The A5 Hokkaido Snow Beef has a luxurious, buttery flavour and melt in your mouth texture 🤤.\n\nWe also tried their Merchants’ Fish Soup 🍲 and the Prawn Mee Race 🦐 which we also enjoyed very much! This is the place to chill and dine while enjoying a modern take on a variety of local food with great company ☺️.",

From the creative finance-themed concept to the warm atmosphere and, most importantly, the incredible food, this newly opened restaurant delivered exactly what I look for in a dining experience.\n\nI ordered the signature “Bull Market” dish and was blown away: the wagyu beef was tender, the noodles perfectly cooked, and the broth rich and flavorful. Chef/owner Abel was incredibly friendly and shared the story of his family’s culinary tradition, which made the meal even more memorable. While I don’t live in Singapore, I’ll definitely be back the next time I’m in town.\n\nOne final note: I believe older reviews may be for a different restaurant previously at this location—don’t let them deter you from trying this gem!",
