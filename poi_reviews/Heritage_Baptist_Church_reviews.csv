Bernard Ng,5,"I have been attending Heritage Baptist for a year now. This is a mission focused and biblically grounded church. The Pastor is a friendly, humourous and profound teacher. Many of the members faithfully attends the Wednesday night prayer meeting at 123 Lor 1 Toa Payoh. The men's fellowship is held once every month on Saturday and the attendance is good. The best part is that the church also runs a Bible Theology School twice a week on weekday night.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109320486085398781213/reviews
