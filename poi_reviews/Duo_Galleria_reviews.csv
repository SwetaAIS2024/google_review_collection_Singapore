Iain Laslett,5,I have been away from Singapore for 4 years and have returned in December 2022.  It continually amazes me how this city/country never ever stops.  It constantly punches above its weight and has built many new building over the past 4 years.  This is just another example of yet another superb individual architectural building.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112887046504403632048/reviews
Flo Yeow,4,"Fengshui master says that people who work here are very hard workers, because of the beehive design surrounding the office building. So if you are, good luck.

That said, it's very conveniently located right above the MRT station, with many dining options below and around the building. It's also surrounded by many after work hangout spots, with Haji Lane being a short walk away. If you're driving, it's also right by the ECP entrance so it's very convenient for people staying in the East as well.

The area is definitely still developing, but after they are, it will be interesting to see how the entire area will feel like with residential and commercial, all blended into one.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
