Joe Soh,4,"Central Siam Cuisine offers a simple and comfortable Thai dining environment. The waitress was friendly and efficient, although there was a slight wait for the food.

The boat noodles featured a rich and flavorful broth with tender meat and well-cooked noodles.

The crab meat omelette rice was also enjoyable, with a fluffy omelette containing a generous amount of sweet crab meat served over fragrant rice.

Overall, Central Siam Cuisine is a good choice for straightforward and tasty Thai food.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102905388784843472647/reviews

Govin Kumar,3,Average taste. Crab portion was too little for $14. Didn't stock up on 100 plus or Sprite canned drinks although they're on the menu. Had to order minimum of 2 mini boat noodles. They offered a free item for giving Google reviews which might explain the high ratings,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110603761876858656766/reviews
