The teachers are committed.  Curriculum is 'SMU' style: faciliated learning, not the top-down approach. This may not be suitable for every parents but it works for us.",

      "text": "Grateful for all the teachers and staff in YWCA Outram. My boy came from a previous school where he had bad experience from a classmate and didn't like the environment much. We had a hard time sending him to his previous school even after a year of attending there. So it was so surprising for him to not complain school just by attending few weeks. We saw how he came from this timid boy to someone who looks forward meeting his teachers and friends. We saw how gentle and caring the teachers are and since the teacher-child ratio is small, parents are rest assured that teachers can offer better attention to our little ones. Teachers and staff have been in the school for few years already, it goes to say that its a healthy environment there as well. Thank you to all the teachers who helped him regain his confidence in attending school, Teacher Shellyn, Zu Laoshi, Teacher Michelle, Teacher Kai, Yin Laoshi and Teacher Margaret. ",

The curriculum is very interesting and the kids look forward to attending school. We also receive regular updates from the teachers regarding the kds performance and behavior. Highly recommended.
