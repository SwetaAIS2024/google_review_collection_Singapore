Yellow Bear,5,"Sells Asian / Chinese Vegetarian food with vegan options ( do inform the staff if you do not want eggs )
Food contains no alliums.

Though the stall looks like a typical Chinese vegetarian stall, I think their vegetables curry is one of the best in Singapore, flavourful with just the right amount of spiciness and sweetness. Will definitely choose it again the next time I go.
Price is reasonable too with friendly service.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489311735261065689/reviews
Yeo Abby,5,"The vegetarian beehoon!! Amazing üòç love the curry vegetable, beehoon taste mildly seasoned with less salt and oil which is good.

The mock goose and Mock char siew is fresh with no weird bean taste.

All in all very value for money!

Will come back again!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103568134139839906471/reviews
Alan Chua,4,"New stall that replace Huay Jin Vegetarian. Much more variety as compare to Huay Jin. They have Laksa, Mee Rebus and normal Zar Char like hor fun, fried rice and so on....

Normal vegetarian food price. Example a normal plate of Vegetarian Mee Hoon cost around $4.

Same standard as of Huay Jin just that their curry veg can be cold at time.

If you are nearby and need a vegetarian food fix, can try ah.....",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117653286306526326601/reviews
