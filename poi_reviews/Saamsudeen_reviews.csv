Liza Angwin,1,"Make sure to stand in front of the stall and wait for your food. They will always FORGET due to overwhelming orders.
Their food is good hence why by midday they are shut. But that is also why they dont take customer service seriously. Ppl will always buy regardless.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106512699409182244809/reviews

Victor Chua,1,"Bought 3 kosong pratas (2+1)for takeway. Then decided to eat one of them at the hawker so went ask for a small bowl of curry but stall refused to give??!!!! Saying 2 pratas can only give 1 curry? 1 prata kosong is $1.10 yet they refused to give even a small bowl of curry??
Anyway, will never return as stall assistant was very rude.
If they can only give one curry for every 2 pratas then they should indicate as there is no minimum pieces of pratas needed. Very selfish and money minded hawkers üòè",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107140069147357421405/reviews
