Winnie Low,5,"The school looks welcoming to children with colourful and vibrant lightings. My child felt comfortable even on the first visit while the manager, Linus was briefing us on the school curriculum. Linus was also very helpful and attentive to our needs and concerns. Overall, it’s a great experience and we’re looking forward to first day of school.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117061841946764965325/reviews
Sharifah Mariam,5,We went for a tour @ Playfacto Waterway and I must say the staff is very attentive in our query and when we are explaining on our concerns we felt on other student care. The instructions and explanations he gave was very clear and we can see he is very calm. We are very pleased to have our child under his care.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105325848916694094258/reviews
