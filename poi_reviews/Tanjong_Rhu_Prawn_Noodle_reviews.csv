Super Fragrance,3,"Ordered $5 pork rib noodle.

Noodle : average
Soup : good
Prawn : good
Pork rib : mixed

Noodle texture isn't particularly outstanding. But with all the sauce mixed it taste great.

Soup is well flavored goes well if you dip the noodle in.

Prawn was fresh and devein. Reasonable size. But only 2.

Pork rib is a mix. Generally very tough but some with fats are delightful.

Overall it feels very home cooked. Like what your ah ma will cook for you. Personally I feel it is okay maybe a bit tame in umami. Definitely on the lighter taste side.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105892392413528737906/reviews
Larktiss,4,"Prawn & Pork Ribs Beehoon Soup ($6) & Prawn & Pork Ribs Dry Beehoon ($6) reasonable¬†for the ingredients, though some might expect a stronger broth for true prawn noodle lovers.  Solid choice if you‚Äôre nearby, but not a ""must-travel-for"" prawn mee.

Joy H (Joy),5,"Favourite Prawn Noodles in Singapore! Even nicer than the famous ones I‚Äôve eaten. Or at least I like it more than the famous ones.

‚ù§Ô∏è Personal favourite is Á±≥Á≤âÈù¢Âπ≤ (Bee Hoon and Yellow Noodles, Dry). Some of my family members prefer the Mee Kia, dry. When you order your noodles dry, it will come with a bowl of soup that is refillable if you dine-in.

The prawns and noodles are cooked just nice. üíØ Uncle ever saw my brother move the prawns from the noodles to the bowl of hot soup so he could mix the noodles up and uncle came over to tell my brother that he cooked the prawns just nice so try not to soak it in the soup for too long or the prawns might get overcooked. Some hawkers can‚Äôt be bothered about the food served once they have already received payment but seems like uncle here has standards! üëçüèº

Stall is in the same coffeeshop as the famous Tanjong Rhu Pau and looking at the lack of crowd when the Pau shop is not opened, this prawn noodle stall is still a hidden gem and underrated.

Stall is closed on Wednesday and because of the lack of crowd, they are closing the stall on Tuesdays too it seems and maybe even Mondays in future if the lack of customers continues.

Coffee shop has limited seats so if you want to dine-in you might want to go around 11-11.30am. Soup would be even tastier by this time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108084027697259530214/reviews
