Chastin Lim,4,"This connector links cyclists and joggers from the Punggol Waterway to Pasir Ris Park. It consists of one stretch along a small road and another stretch along a large canal. There is a traffic light crossing between both parts so do observe traffic rules! The connector is next to forests and can be quite empty at certain times, so I recommend going in at least pairs if one is not confident. There are no shelters along the connector (there are only some park benches) so please check the weather status before entering as you do not want to get caught in the rain!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109041173782637092112/reviews
