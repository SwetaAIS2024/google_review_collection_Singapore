Seah Jia Hui,3,"Fml the price increase like no tomorrow. Inflation rate 10%‚Ä¶ few years ago, it was $4.5 for small bowl, now it‚Äôs $4.9. The staffs here are also not very generous with their portion. Lunch time queue waiting time can get up to 30mins. Take away add $0.3. I would recommend to just get the eat in bowl if you are going to seat somewhere near northspine.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109933240025657790273/reviews
Lisa K,1,Drove all the way here on a sat coz our friends were raving this place. When we enter only one customer. 3 serving staff. The lady with specs seem like she had a bad day. As it was my first time here she seem impatient and sounded like she want to end work asap lol when i ask her about the menu and where to choose etc. Food was normal nothing special. Not much variety as well. Not worth the travel lol! The service make it worst and im not stepping foot in anymore. Regrets! :( my sat brunch~,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114858882587357013921/reviews
Cassia A,4,"Not a bad healthy option. It says $4.90 on the board + $0.30 for takeaway, and mine was $6.90. Not sure where that price came from.
The vegetables taste fresh. The lettuce is just romain so nothing too substantial. The rice is a bit oily.
The tofu was good but there wasn‚Äôt much of it added.
You choose a few sides and a main. The base is salad and rice or pasta. I think that‚Äôs how it works‚Ä¶
No credit but they take cash.

If you‚Äôre looking for a healthy option on campus with lots of vegetables, try the Yong Tau Foo in south spine (fine foods).",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117662481746295955146/reviews
L N,5,"Very affordable and healthy lunch -  Regular bowl of 1 main with 3 dishes. I chose 4 dishes instead because I wanna skip the carbs. There was a variety of sides, ranging from vegetables and mock meats. I chose broccoli, cucumber, corn and add on with scrambled eggs. The portion was generous and the vegetables were well sauced.

I‚Äôd definitely return for lunch another day.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103858917494616500833/reviews
