Both are good and prices are acceptable. Service staff is friendly and helpful. As it‚Äôs pet friendly, we get to admire lots of cute puppies and dogs.",

Pomodoro pasta and tuna tomato pasta (not pictured) are nice, too bad they ran out of mochi pasta so they used normal pasta (we were informed beforehand). Chicken steak served on hotplate is nice but pricey. Highlight of the meal was the Little Fuji dessert. Nice place to chill though, very spacious. Not crowded on Sunday night. There is free plain water. Staff are friendly. Will return to try their breakfast which staff mentioned is nice.",
