Rike Toyip,5,"It takes a village to raise kids, and I am glad to have the teachers and staff of Julia Gabriel Preschool Mountbatten as part of my village. Not only they are compassionate and nurturing, they are also highly capable in delivering the school’s wholesome curriculum that really helps my son grow both academically and emotionally. With a small class size, the teachers engage each kids meaningfully. My son is always excited to go to school every day and comes back home happy.

Also would like to give a shout out to the school management for being open-minded and receptive to parents’ suggestions to improve the school environment. Appreciate it!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104427200159891450185/reviews
Kate H,5,"My kid in K1 is looking forward to going to school which is the most important fact that I appreciate. Curriculum wise, it definitely benefits my kid’s developments in academical learning and social skills. My kid’s teacher Ada and Zawiya are professional, well-connected with students and very helpful. Car park can be crowded during peak time but manageable to find the parking lot.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107514553987321394057/reviews
Veron K,5,"Our toddler just started school at Julia Gabriel Mounbatten from Jan 2024 and it has been enjoyable for her. She enjoys going to school on most days and excitedly shares with us about school at home. Her pre-n teachers Nurul and Yang ying are very caring and attentive, the level of detail they put into understanding each child is really amazing - for example during PTM, the teachers will tell us our daughter’s likes and dislikes in detail, which we felt that only teachers who genuinely care would be able to do so. :) We also like the clean environment, brightly lit classrooms, outdoor playarea for the kids. It is also heartwarming to see teachers being able to recognise kids from other levels and know each child by name - it gives a very homely and friendly vibe. The weekly school updates thru the app also helps reassure us that our daughter is enjoying learning in school. Importantly, the school listens to our / our daughter’s needs and feedback, and takes action on them quickly, which we really appreciate. Thank you to the wonderful teachers and staff at Julia Gabriel Mounbatten for making school so fun for our child! :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117985499126510168427/reviews
Johnny Fung,5,"Never regretted a day changing my little one to Chiltern house or now known as Julia Gabriel Preschool. Fees are on a higher side, but it is worth every cent. We do not have to worry about teacher not giving any attention to the LO. Teachers are very caring, nurturing, and has been very patient with every child. They can remember every children's name even though they are not the teacher of the class. No need to worry about rough kids / picking up bad habit / language from other children as the teachers are able to control the class with the small ratio. And because the environment is rich with languages, I can see big differences in my LO in terms of speaking and and change in attitude in a short few weeks time. Coming home with new vocab and proper speech always amaze us.
On top of that, I do not need to send my LO to other enrichment programmes anymore, bacause they have Projects, Mandarin Programmes from Chengzhu Mandarin Centre, Drama class from Julia Gabriel and also music, sports and movement - enrichment covered. I get to spend the precious 2 days weekend with my LO for other outdoor activities.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113038058904920189780/reviews
