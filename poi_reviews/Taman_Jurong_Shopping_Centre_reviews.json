There are 2 food courts here and traditional bubble tea shops and snack shops as well. Car park is in the basement with beautiful plants basking in the natural sun. Kids running in the designated playground.",

Not much people walking around but it's bustling in the morning due to the close proximity to the market and food centre next door.\nThere are 2 food courts, a supermarket and a variety of shops offering different service and products for all needs and wants.\nThe only shop with the best business is the 4D LOTTERY. Who doesn't wanna get rich??! üòÖ",
