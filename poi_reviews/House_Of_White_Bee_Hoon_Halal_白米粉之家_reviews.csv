Jardin Jumat,5,"First time having here.

Highly recommended their Signature White Bee Hoon. It's tasty. A must try for those dine in here.
For the ppl talking about flies, kinda cant be avoided as the area is near the sea.
Bonus point is, sea view look nice, like east coast feeling.
I would gladly dine in here again.
The waiters was friendly and professional. This is based on my experience. Ty for reading my honest review.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112123481625988110362/reviews
Jay BuBo,5,"Ordered Signature and Mala Bee Hoon as my first time customer. Very nice. Can't really pinpoint what exactly makes it really nice, but it was good for me. Even the Mala has the kick but isn't that numbing so it was easy to the stomach as my breaking fast meal.

Did an online order and picked up at the selected timing, and it was all ready. Still hot.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105183675068816630550/reviews
Cherrie Lc xx,4,"Atmosphere was nice and tables were generally clean! However, it took an eternity to be served our drinks. Drinks were only served when we were almost done eating our food (and we had to remind the staff of our order). The food were also lacking flavour, could do better for the price.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110525195239164666336/reviews
