Saumyadip Das,5,"It was an amazing dining experience. The foods and drinks were really good, got the good essence and vibes of India staying in the heart of Singapore.
Some days back I have done a birthday photoshoot also in their community hall, it also went really well and in an organised way.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100023427484851454854/reviews

Kiku C,4,"Quiet little hidey hole with very serviceable Punjab cuisine. If this had been the first punjab cuisine I have ever tried, this may even have ended up being my favourite. Marking this one for Valentine’s Day or CNY - when you need to eat out but don’t want the crowds.

The saucing for each item we ordered was excellent. I felt this place did the veggies better than the proteins and I surreptitiously ate most of the palak paneer and saag makhani.

My only gripe was the butter chicken- it was dry and fell apart easily, even though the sauce was great.

The tandoori chicken was succulent and Smokey.

Service was impeccable on a Sunday evening?? They offered to change our plates after the starters and kept topping up the crackers until we stopped the one waiter.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111576133645197837621/reviews
Jk l,5,"It was our first visit and we were glad we took up the recommendation to give the restaurant a try. Some of the dishes we had included the pakoras, aloo chaat , chicken tikka, mysore mutton, prawn masala and paneer. The naans and jeera rice were really good too.Complimentary and refillable sides like the papadums and onions were also provided. For deserts, we had the gulab jamun, rusmalai and kulfi. The favourite was the kulfi (home made ice-cream). The masala teas were also flavourful. We visited on a weekend evening and had a good dining experience. The service was top notch too with staff patient with our queries and requests! We will definitely visit again for the quality of food and service rendered.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104073403253877964253/reviews
