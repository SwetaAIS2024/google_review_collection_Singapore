Genia Wee,5,"Joe & Dough, interestingly, some of the menus are not available. Not even bottled mineral water.

Though the MAC & Cheese, Tuna Sandwiches, and the cakes ordered turns out pretty good üëç

Sunday Brunch Gigs was a great idea to bring family outings and friends gathering üòÄ  especially Cosplay and Animes exhibitions happening at the same time.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106921928178103212550/reviews
Gemma R. Foo (The Fiction Magnet),5,"Tucked at the corner of Kallang Leisure Park,  I really like the quiet atmosphere at Joe & Dough. The layout is spacious and there is when a window view.
I‚Äôve a particular liking for the Chai Latte which tastes fantastic. It has just the right amount of spices and cinnamon, topped with some sugar. Barista, Shureen is lovely and attends to customers with a smile - which brightens up my day! üòä",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115101870367179449127/reviews

Brina Nash,1,"I agree with all the other 1 star reviews and wish I had read them before visiting this place. Breakfast was expensive for the quality of food. Cold, pre-made, airplane food type dishes (watery scrambled eggs, soggy vegetables, rubbery sausage) . When we complained and asked for refund, I was told by the staff ‚Äúit‚Äôs fresh, we just made it yesterday‚Äù. I had to explain to the young girl behind the counter that ‚Äúmade yesterday‚Äù is not fresh. They‚Äôre serving overnight cooked food and charging $17 for a plate for breakfast. Always wanted to try this place as it‚Äôs near my house, but I‚Äôm never going back again.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103459064161911184048/reviews
Sue Chamberlain,4,"I normally find coffee in Singapore far too milky, even when I ask for less milk. But this morning I was lucky to enjoy a great double shot latte at Joe & Dough at Leisure Park Kallang. Not too milky. Strong rounded coffee flavour. And enough volume to enjoy a good cuppa. Thank you Shureen (barista). Great coffee.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108685854158621640734/reviews
