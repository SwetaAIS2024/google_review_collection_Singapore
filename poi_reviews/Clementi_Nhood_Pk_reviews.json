      "text": "This bus stop has served the maju camp army personnel since time started. Its shabby right now without a doubt, but hey, after a day of tough tough training, when u see a bus stop, u will definitely know the day is done and u r going home. Unfortunately, lots of smokers coming out from camp and u always almost 100% will smell their second-hand smoke. Besides that, it is situated extremely near an extremely busy road thats virtually a 24/7 movement. Exhaust exhaust exhausted. Guess what tho. Luckily buses here come at a relatively fast speed so that u can just GTFO from here. In terms of bus selection, we have a plentiful of buses that allow u to do a quick -stop tactic. That is, u can quickly take a bus to ngee ann, 2 stops, then virtually alight to walk over to the other bus stops whereby variety is then limitless. Or take the downtown line. Sweet too. All in all, a decently placed bus stop that evokes memories for all local men. Lets train hard. 2 stars.",
