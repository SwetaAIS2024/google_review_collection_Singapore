MrA,4,Brought my mum for ART and PCR tests. Everything was very orderly. The Indian doctor and his staff were very helpful and courteous despite their hectic schedule. The entire duration took 45 minutes but it‚Äôs understandable. I think this clinic deserves a thumbs up! üëç,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112008289267740134602/reviews
