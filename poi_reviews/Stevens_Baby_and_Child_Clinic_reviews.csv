Cee,1,"We rushed our child to the clinic after he displayed a worrying symptom of being unable to turn his neck. Throughout the diagnosis, Dr Steven displayed an arrogant and condescending attitude. Prematurely (mis)diagnosing the symptoms as a very likely case of meningitis, he quickly recommended admission and the immediate use of a risky and invasive procedure that requires drawing spinal fluid. He dismissed us when we questioned further on the use of other assessments such as X-Ray. With courage, my husband and I took the decision of seeking a second opinion with another hospital.

When we left the clinic, Steven's attitude was simply bad and unprofessional and did not display the slightest medical concern for the patient. Instead, like a pushy salesperson, he tried to use scare tactics to retain us and was highly agitated when we insisted on a second opinion elsewhere.

Fast forward. All's good. It turned out to be a case of a lymph node infection which was resolved through the use of antibiotics.

It was quite an ordeal which I hope other parents would not have to face.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115230094664548550161/reviews
Anton Wong,5,"I bought my two children, mother-in-law and wife to see Dr Steven Ng because my children were on their seventh day of fever. Dr Steven Ng was very patient and gentle in his explanations and thorough in his preliminary investigations, and does not recommended excessive investigations that are not necessary in his opinion. He deserve 5 stars.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117607080840719516058/reviews
Dominic Yeo,5,"Our Son is now 19 months. Dr Steven Ng has been his pd since birth. When he came for ward visits, he took time to explain all the issues and problems we had. Putting us as first time parents at ease.

When we go back for our son’s check-up and injections, Dr Ng always take time and make sure all our queries are answered. He is very thorough and patient. Dr Ng is a doctor who cures ailments without over-prescribing medications.

When our son wasn’t feeling well on a Sunday evening, despite his busy schedule, Dr Ng answered our call and gave us guidance.

We would highly recommend Dr Steven Ng.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114956397305953974087/reviews
