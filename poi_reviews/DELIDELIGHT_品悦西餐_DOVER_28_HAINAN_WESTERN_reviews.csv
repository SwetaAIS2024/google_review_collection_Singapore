Moly Po,5,The service at Fatty's was very good last night. It has changed a lot since I last came here. The taste is also good... I will come here often in the future. Keep it up.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101084901925856568708/reviews
shervon,1,"Daylight robbery at this stall! Ordered salmon pasta for $7.90, look at that slice of salmon!! Went to ask stall owner and he acted like it was normal and said it’s minced salmon?? Never heard or seen of a western stall selling minced salmon and THIS thin?? There was also a piece of hair in my pasta… (no it’s 100% not mine as my hair colour is blue). First and LAST TIME HERE OMG",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118015134989231614032/reviews
Adrian Jin,1,"The last time I had the beef burger was several months ago, came back today for lunch & ordered my usual. The patty changed from actual minced beef meat to this compressed, sausage textured patty with lots of Mala flavouring. I took a bite out of it & gave up the entire burger completely.

The pricing is really fair for a western stall, but I would rather prefer a skinner patty made with actual minced beef than whatever this is.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113915479368583285102/reviews
Khris,1,"I went down today at 9pm not even closing time, the two workers ignored me completely. I stood for awhile to get their attention but they pretend I didn't exist. So what if you have many online orders or whatever, I finally asked are you closed?!?! Again ignored no reply whatsoever, not even a Im sorry we are closed or too many orders etc Never seen someone so rude in F & B line.

Also just less then 5 mins after I walk off to order other food I saw them serving a American woman wow like hello what is this!?! Too much.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107929259884691110714/reviews
Rodson Chue,4,"Original Post - Pretty sure I ordered Hainanese Pork Chop with Fried Rice. It sure looks like a regular Pork Chop which is supposed to cost $1 less according to the menu. When asking the server about the oddity, they said something along the lines of ""You can choose your sauce for Hainan Pork Chop"", ah yes and why wasn't this mentioned during the ordering? Very disingenuous. Food still tastes pretty good but they should review their service staff.
Update -Approached their staff regarding this issue on another day and was compensated with complimentary Hainan Porkchop Fried Rice",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110557991810192405120/reviews
