Despite the oversight being on my part, your team showed great empathy and professionalism — reviewing my situation, escalating the case, and keeping me updated throughout the process.\n\nI am truly grateful that my appeal was approved and that an extension was granted for me to redeem my gifts. I deeply appreciate the effort that went into making this possible.\n\nThank you once again for going the extra mile — it made a big difference.",

      "text": "I would like to give a huge shoutout to Jeremiah, Cassandra and the team in SingSaver. I had missed out the email for my gift redemption and they tried their best to help me appeal to extend the redemption period so I can claim the gift.\n\nIt did take a long time for the initial gift redemption email to finally come from the time I applied for the card (6-7 months) but this is understandable and can't have overly high expectations as its a free gift.\n\nThe appeal process took a month and every time I followed up, the team was quick to reply me, assuring me that they were following up on my case. So to the rest of the people who have encountered a similar situation, please be patient with the team who is helping you, they are doing their best too.\n\nThis gives me great confidence to continue using SingSaver for all my credit card applications. Thank you Jeremiah and Cassandra!",
