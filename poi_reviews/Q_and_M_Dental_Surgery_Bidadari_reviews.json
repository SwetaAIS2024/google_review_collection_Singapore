Dr. Janelle was super thorough and explained everything clearly, which I really appreciated. They use this cool iTero scanner that gave me a detailed look at my tooth and gum health—way better than any regular x-rays I’ve had before. I left feeling really confident in my dental care. Highly recommend Dr. Janelle ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️& this place if you’re looking for a great dentist!",

      "text": "Dr Janelle attended to me for scaling and polishing. I was running a little late from work into their closing hours (so sorry about it) and that didn't stop her from being patient and gentle with my teeth. She took time to explain what was going on with my teeth with the AI scan (super cool btw! It's a quick scan with some lights flashing and you have your teeth on screen in the next 3-5min) and was logical with advising if braces was needed. No unnecessary pain and bleed during the scaling and polishing too. Will definitely recommend! She managed to cleared off my coffee stain on my teeth too!",

She takes time to explain to me when I have doubts and clarifies my options.\n\nSaw her for scaling/polishing, dental filling, root canal, and crown installation within the span of a month.\n\nI’m usually quite finicky about dentists but I am glad that our neighbourhood dentist is one that suits my needs.\n\nThe outlet is clean, quiet and usually easy to get appointments which is a plus.",
