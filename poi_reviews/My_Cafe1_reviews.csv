ChongHong,5,"Food is nice! Not alot of people when we went there.
There are some old Chinese music playing which was nice as well.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112988116466913799541/reviews
Y L,1,"Food is terrible. Tasteless and pricey. Portions are tiny. Kaya toast and Nasi lemak extremely overpriced and tasteless. Barely any kaya on toast. Size of chicken is pathetic.

Coffee is so bad too. Bad burnt smell.

Ordered soft boiled eggs. More than 15mins still not served. Asked staff about it and he said they forgot about the order…

Restaurant has a weird odour too.

Would give zero stars if I could.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112352833899787632239/reviews
Gator,4,"Came over here to buy some drinks and snacks for the family who’s having their nails and hair done at a nearby salon. The restaurant wasn’t really packed when I visited. Saw some very interesting dishes like the Hakka chwee kuay and ordered one to go. Reasonably priced at RM6 for a large slap of the chwee kuay. Ordered a Kaya and butter toast as well and a coffee and an ice mixed coffee and tea.

The toast wasn’t outstanding, just like the ones I made myself at home. But the chwee kuay was nice. Though we would have preferred it hot. The toppings had a pretty generous shrimp bits which went very well with the plain chwee kuay. The drinks were very local which we liked.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
P Tan,4,"We like the quiet atmosphere. The menu has been renewed and our favorite chwee kueh has been removed sadly. Coffee is nice and the char kway teow is not bad. Prices are not cheap, maybe too many Singaporeans visiting. Many choices of eating around the area so can shop around.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113673698424359108428/reviews
Peng Wan Choo,5,"Very nice, great food with cosy environment. Mixture of local Malaysian cookings with some western food. The offerings are quite authentic, definitely a place to try out when you’re nearby. The lamb pot and wantan noodles are my favorites.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100134547157445087044/reviews
