Bryan Tan,5,"Very friendly and courteous stall owners, food is priced reasonably and most importantly tastes so good! Must try for their chicken wings - crispy, succulent and nicely seasoned, nasi lemak was quite alright and bee hoon is a must try as well! not too salty - pair their wings with bee hoon and youâ€™re already set! Recommended for anyone looking for good juicy chicken wings for breakfast/lunch.

They open from mon - sat, 6am till 2.30pm!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106911212120550834163/reviews
