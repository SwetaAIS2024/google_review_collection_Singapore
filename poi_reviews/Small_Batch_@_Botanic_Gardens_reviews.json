      "text": "Good brunch spot and friendly service! You can pick and choose the items for your board, perfect for those who want more protein. Food came relatively quick given that it was a busy PH. Nice aesthetics in the cafe, lifting up the mood. However, given that it’s close to nature, there’s a few creepy crawlies and insects flying around. The spot we were seated at was also pretty hot and humid. Would be great if they could provide fan or indoor air conditioning as some seats might not be well ventilated. $59.84 for two people with 1 board, 1 pasta and 2 drinks which is not bad.",

Scrambled eggs and breakfast roll were also cooked perfectly. Not too dry or too runny. French toast had the right amount of sweetness. A proper brunch spot, would recommend.",
