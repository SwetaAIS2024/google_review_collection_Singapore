But nonetheless I add my raw egg into my bowl as they poured the boiling soup into it (problem solved).\n\nNoodles dry can be with dark sauce or the usual ketchup, chilli and vinegar.\n\nÊãõËÅòÈù¢ $5.50\nSoup was good 4/5\nMy Mee Pok was a bit overcooked 3/5\nSauce for noodle was very normal 3/5\n\nFishball is the standard bouncy type 4/5\nFish fritters was interesting for me as I‚Äôm still trying to figure out if it‚Äôs a hit or miss.\n\nBut I love the pork slices and minced pork 5/5 as the were very tender and nicely velvet.\n\nOverall can eat, not bad.",

I ordered a pack of dried fine noodle with dark sauce take away. My grandchild tasted and there was chill sauce added on. I requested for dark sauce only. I think, the staffs were not attentive and half awake. Is dried noodle with chill sauces a norm in Singapore locally ?",

Returned home to see no fish at all and only 2 slices of pork ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Not the first time, previously decided to let it pass as it was such a hassle to drive back, park the car and get back a few dollars, but today was the last straw! Returned to get back $6. Not because I am stingy but I rather donate to people in need than to be cheated. Lack of integrity is the reason why I am not returning to the stall. Hopefully they don‚Äôt prey on the old folks.",
