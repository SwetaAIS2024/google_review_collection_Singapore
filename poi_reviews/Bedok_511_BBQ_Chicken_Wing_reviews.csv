A T,5,"Tried many times and this time gotta take photos plus lighting is good üëç.  Yummy flavourful tender chicken wings BBQ to perfection. Chilli is nice as well. Satay was also fantastic, just look at the fats.  Pork and chicken satay both are tender.  The satay sauce is so smooth and delicious.  Best of all to me and my Laogong. So not need to go elsewhere. Our favourite stall!‚ù§Ô∏è",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110290698573319690288/reviews
Jason Soh,4,"I've only ordered the chicken wings so this review is based purely on the chicken wings, not the stall. Anyway, the chicken wings are just average, pretty normal. However, the chilli sauce that came with the chicken wing is awesome. It tastes slightly more sourish though, so it's up to personal taste.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113133934501923551074/reviews
Leon Kwang,4,"OK, didn't come here for the bbq chicken wings, I ordered them to fill time for Eng Ho fried hokkien noodles wait.. and it turned out really good.. especially the bbq chicken wings.. great flavour and perfectly cooked (inside and out). The pork satay was OK.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116326892362989736040/reviews

üçú Food wise: Great taste for the satay and chicken, nice bbq flavour and awesome sauces to go with it. The glaze on the food was just mesmerising.

Each of the satay skewers was generous pieces of pork, not those thin or half pieces, they were fully packed skewers! The peanut sauce that came with it was quite nice, taste of peanut chunks and was sweet. It was quite filling and satisfying to eat the Lontong too!

Chicken wings were pretty good, nice grilled taste, and pretty spicy but savoury chilli sauce. Squeeze that lime either on the chicken or the chilli sauce for a twist in taste!

‚ú® Ambience wise: Hawker centre!

Edward Wong,3,"Paid $7 for 10 sticks of satay and $2.80 for 2 bbq chicken wings. The chicken and mutton satay tasted average and the mutton was hard. The gravy was average too, without much fragrance from the peanuts. The chicken wings tasted slightly better. Service was slow as there were many orders.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110173188680901424865/reviews
