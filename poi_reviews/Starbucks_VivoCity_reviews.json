      "text": "The Starbucks at VivoCity is a perfect spot for a coffee break while shopping or enjoying the waterfront views. The store is spacious with plenty of seating options, both indoors and outdoors, making it a great place to relax or catch up on work.\n\nThe staff are friendly and efficient, even during busy hours, and the coffee is consistently great, as expected from Starbucks. I particularly love the outdoor seating area—it offers a nice view and a relaxing atmosphere.\n\nThe only downside is that it can get crowded during peak shopping hours, but that’s expected given its prime location. Overall, it’s a cozy and convenient café that lives up to the Starbucks experience!",
