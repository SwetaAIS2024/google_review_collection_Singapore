Viv N,3,"Ordered mee goreng chicken, prata egg, teh halia.

Mee goreng is too spicy & salty with only 3-4 slices of chicken, is different from the usual Indian food shop which will give a piece of fried chicken chopped eg drumstick, wing or thigh. Gave up after eating only 1/2, too spicy and salty.

Prata egg looks good come with dhal. Yet to eat at this point of review, will update

Teh halia is the saving grace to this meal order. Awesome tea.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100602279284871368905/reviews
Josh Lim,5,Mamaâ€™s Corner replaced Nineties. Tried it for the first time and we loved the mutton briyani and the coin prata. The rice for the briyani is good for 2 pax and the coin prata is crispy yet dense and tasty. Enjoyed both.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100606910212221946176/reviews
Dinesh Kumar,1,"The place does serve good food, but the cost is too high. I spent $1.50 for machine-roll chapathi, which is too high.

EDIT: The staff are nice and kind. My preview review was to gain attention of the management.

P.S.: I'm a daily customer eating breakfast and dinner there. I was paying just $1 for a chapathi until yesterday.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111243684466500236348/reviews

Narengautham Govindaraj,5,"Mama's Corner offers a wide variety of food. It may look like your average neighborhood food shop, but Mama's Corner is anything but scrumptious food! I tried their Chicken Fried Rice and Coin Prata, and I instantly fell in love with them. To complement my Main dishes, I ordered Milo Dinosaur as well and I will tell you, it was one of the best Milo Dinosaur's I have had. Well of course it would need a bit of refining, but props to them, overall their service, food quality and drinks were all great .",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100606809530056047583/reviews
