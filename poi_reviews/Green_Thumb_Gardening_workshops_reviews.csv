Claire Claire,5,I loved this workshop. Everything was well explained and you walk away with your own set of planted seeds to continue growing at home to nurture with your new knowledge from the class. Fantastic ðŸ˜Š,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102257527335629815077/reviews

Malini Samai,5,"This is an amazing workshop. Anna has really put in a lot of passion & effort in teaching how to grow our own kitchen garden,  organic vegetables & greens without any pesticides or fertilisers. Anna explains everything beautifully with lot of her own experiences from her childhood and patiently details the minor steps that will go a long way in growing healthy plants.  Itâ€™s not only about gardening, but also about recycling, reusing & how to be gentle on our Mother Earth.  I really wish lot of kids can also attend her sessions, so that our next generation will not lose the value of utilising our resources ethically.
I found the session meticulously well planned. My daughter also attended the kids workshop and was very happy about her learnings.  She started appreciating every little thing on earth. I highly recommend this workshop to everyone, irrespective of the age group !",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101593096038931176940/reviews
