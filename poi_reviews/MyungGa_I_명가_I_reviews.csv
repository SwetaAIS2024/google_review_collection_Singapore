Master Ji-Ning,4,"Really solid Korean restaurant with huge portions — definitely great value for the price. You get a lot of food, but the food is a bit mid. Perfect spot if you’re hungry and want a quick meal. The service was really quick and I didn’t have to wait long before getting my meal.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113014652293741710718/reviews
Em woo,3,"Went there because I always saw that it is very crowded so we had to try it!

They had outdoor and indoor seatings, we took the outdoor seatings as indoors looked very cram and dark.

We ordered a seafood jajang for 2 pax and the portion size was HUGE!! However, though the sauce was tasty, the noodles were slightly overcooked and was quite mushy. Not the bouncy jajang noodles type. The sauce had some seafood (prawns, mussels, octopus) and lots of potato and onion.

Also ordered their yangnyam fried chicken. That was really good, chicken was fried very well and sauce was sweet and a little spicy and well coated. Chicken meat was very tender as well.

However overall bill was very exp. For 2 pax, it was $75. Slightly overpriced for Korean food.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106219834003454494418/reviews
Perlyn Teo,2,"They have another outlet nearby - Myung Ga II, so you may want to try that instead. This outlet seems to be cooked by a non-korean, and has no korean taste at all. Yukgaejang is a big disappointment. I gave 2 stars for the kimchi banchan that tastes korean, and generous portion. Will never return to this.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114038111473522194640/reviews
Davide Russo,2,"This place is ok. I have been to Korea twice and know what real Korean food is, my wife as well and we were both rather disappointed especially for the price that is being charged.

We had the seafood pancake (which was way too dough-y and didn't have much seafood, the big plate of squid in chill sauce which came with noodles. The seafood pancake was about $18, and the squid was $36.

The place itself is quaint, small, and casual and service was good and friendly. Would I come back? No. There are better Korean places in Singapore for less money.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100029601377077286312/reviews
Kevin Ang,4,Not the first time eating here. It has its fans and usually very crowded during meal times. Everything is quite delicious and has a more home cooked taste. Seating is mostly in open area outside the main restaurant.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111247294128726535324/reviews
