Launching a new hashtag #️⃣: #AUHFCVendingMachines

Amidst a fast moving pace in our society + Self Servicing Kiosks at your convenience 24/7, this trend had grown to be hippy, trending + on-the-go kind of Beverages + freshly squeezed Orange juice on the spot to Coconut 🥥 drink to Food + Flowers 🌹 + daily necessities. 😮 🤩 👍 ⭐️

Some machines even packed with never seen before items, including hot serving food 🥘 or meal set on the go; seeing is believing with photos and video 🎥 too !

Even one machine can whip out 300 drinks of your own fancy choices to make ! “What the Cup ?” … it is ! 😯 😱

Here, at this mall, there is no less than 20 of such self service kiosks located inside the circumference of the mall, for your picking + app based on/ on-line payment so the card/ NFC mobile 📱!

Truly it’s a breeze and U have to be in it to know more … I had my latest trendy but Old School Kopi Gao Siew Tai @ $0.99 for a cup and takeaway 🥡 too !
My latest on-the-go drink ☕️! 😅😜

Go, check it out ! Like & Share please 🙏🏻

Seah Jia Hui,5,"A place for students (aka slaves) to print their poster for presentation. Managed to print A1 for $10 at Ben Print. Happy to see feastables in a vending machine outside the mall (notice me Mr beast). Sadly, tastes like cheap chocolate but overpriced at 4 bars for $3.50.

Meanwhile, the mall is un-navigable. Worst floor plan ever seen (image attached). No escalator in the mall btw.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109933240025657790273/reviews
Jeffrey Tan,2,Lots of Parking lots -$2.35 for less than 30 mins. Not much people in mall. Stalls are all quiet. Went to STORE ART SUPPLIES to stock up the “Super Dough”. Not only very little stock in the store plus the “long hair” guy is very rude and seems doesn’t want to serve at all.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115082416335156694137/reviews
Ravi Anantha Ramaiah,5,"Nice little mall with good eateries and convenience shops. The best ones are Teng Bespoke vegetarian Japanese restaurant and “Let’s Play”, the best place to buy Tomica toys.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102063616425420583170/reviews
