James Bartholomew,5,"Friendly and helpful people whom work there.  Blessings on the people. Now application all done in digital. The lady who assisted me, she usually the only person in the office so far as well as the reception officer(she). Without both of them helping me on the digital bank statement, I would not learn a new digital way in my mobile.  To me, I'm very grateful. I was disappointed and sadness that my application not approved,  whereas my friends whom applied got approved even they have more than a hundreds thousands in their account and im having a pressure of paying my outstanding loan from HDB and monthly bill to settle, yet my application was turned down, really hopeful that social service officer Noriliza can help my case.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109142802627956069816/reviews
Angus Ng,1,"When someone apply for the financial assistance is because they really need help. Instead of showing empathy and understanding, your officer literally do not bother about this. And your officer whom I spoke to is very rude, always interrupt my conversation instead of listen finish to the whole conversation. I will never have any faith in government anymore!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111769860764557143021/reviews
