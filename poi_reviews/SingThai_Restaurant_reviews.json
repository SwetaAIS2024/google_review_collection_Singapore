The owner/staff are super nice, and the service is top-tier.\n\nFood 🍲\n\n🔥 Tom Yum Soup\n🫳🏻 A bit on the salty side.\n👍🏻 Very sour, which suits the soup well.\n🫳🏻 The clear version wasn’t spicy—lowkey sad for spice lovers.\n\n🦞 Basil Seafood\n👍🏻 Sauce was flavorful and tasty.\n🫳🏻 The egg was very oily—would be better if they drained the oil before serving.\n\n🐷 Basil Pork\n👍🏻 Great overall—solid flavors.\n\nService 🛎️\n👍🏻 Super friendly and welcoming.\n👍🏻 Explained the design and theme of the place.\n👍🏻 Noticed we needed more space and moved the neighboring table for us.\n👍🏻 Saw we needed an extra ladle and gave us one without us even asking.\n👍🏻 Let us know about the set lunch options.\n👍🏻 Gave us a 10% discount—unexpected but appreciated!\n\nAtmosphere 🎶\n👍🏻 Aesthetic and well-designed space.\n👍🏻 Air-conditioned—nice and comfy.\n🫳🏻 Could hear chopping sounds from the kitchen based on where we sat—not a dealbreaker, but noticeable.",

      "text": "We ordered the Thai lime fish, mango salad and tom yam soup (small).  The mango salad was very generous - enough as a starter for 4 people.  The small soup was sufficient for the two of us.  The fish was fresh and the sauce was sufficiently sourish without being too sour, thanks to palm sugar, which also made the sauce richer in texture.  The only thing I would have preferred is for the lemon grass tea to have actual lemon grass instead of just a tea bag.  The iced green tea was fine - a bit on the sweet side but that was easily resolved by adding ice.  The owner did ask if we would have preferred it to be less sweet when we ordered but we wanted to try the drink as it was supposed to be served.  Overall, it was a pleasant dinner with pleasant service.",
