H Y,5,"Come to THAI FOOD!
Found the best Thai food and we drove all the way from horizon hills to pick up dinner here....Owned by a couple, place looks so clean, so tasty, not too salty, full of flavour.
Their mince basil fried rice is exactly the same as Bangkok with huge portion and delicately soft yolk fried egg.
Tom yum soup portion is huge with lots veges and chicken. The precious thing is even the chicken doesn't taste frozen. Pineapple fried rice looks so fluffy, without any dark colour or overly poured oil.

Eco botanic Thai food should come here and learn what is called Thai food!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107270330347304745876/reviews
Eugene Chung,5,"The chicken rice stall is the best i had. The boss really put a lot of efforts into making it in this business.
The soup he made always flavourful, you can found different ingredients in the soup. Which is a good thing, and not just salt and water.
The meat portion always outweighs the rice. Which I had to order extra rice just to eat the left over meats.
Overall, eating at his stall, is always a happy experience for me.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116112257621967441013/reviews
Ashwin Nazareth,5,"Cosy little hawker shop on the corner of the YOLO square, around the corner and a 2 minute from the sunway big box complex. Highly recommended for a late night snack and all food and drinks exceeded expectations and just tasted ""right"". Highly recommend the Rock Small Fry stall, tucked in the back next to the drinks counter.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105872678021159446910/reviews
Kah siong Kiu,4,Cheap and local food. Not amazing but like the rustic feel. The server from the drink stall is very blur and cannot communicate in English. Need to use finger point point then can understand. Sign signal is encouraged.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105477625310564294245/reviews
munchwithvienna,4,"It's a 24hours kopitiam with quite a wide variety of food. There's mala xiang guo, chicken wings, satay, tze char etc. We ordered tze char this time.

The wanton noodle, bbq chicken wings & satay close at 2.30am. However u still get those toast bread etc from the coffee stall.

Food was quite good at super afforable price. Especially the fried ikan bilis with onions (RM15) with a tad spice! They do sell beer if u like some.

Cleanliness was ok. There's indoor & outdoor seatings available. Take outdoors if u would like to watch TV. Quite a relax place to have supper late night.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111493889212305743241/reviews
