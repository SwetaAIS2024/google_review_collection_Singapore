Andy Jeffries,5,What a great place to stay very modern and very well appointed rooms. Best rain shower I have ever had the pleasure of being under. Very friendly staff. Good choices for breakfast. ABOVE all the  emerald rooms are real comfortable and a good size for a city room almost apartment size. Ps infinity pool overhangs the sheer drop with a glass wall and floor.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113105367324115909133/reviews
Ange,5,"Lovely hotel with robotic coffee at check in floor! Japanese furnishing which gives a zen feeling. Welcome fruits and nice coffee (Nespresso) and tea options. Housekeeping left a few strands of hair and a small puddle of water in the bathroom.. a little disappointing but overall is still a nice hotel, will come back next time!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100323792979823339313/reviews
junrong oh,1,"Disappointing Treatment by Lobby Attendants at COMO Hotel.  ( 29/1 to 30/1 stay)

I had high expectations for COMO Hotel given its reputation, but my recent experience with two rude lobby attendants has left me deeply disappointed. I had booked two rooms for my overseas guests and was waiting in the pick-up area to ensure their smooth departure. Despite there being no other cars or people in the pick-up zone, the attendants rudely approached me and told me I was not allowed to wait there.

Their tone was dismissive and unprofessional, and when I explained the situationâ€”that I was simply waiting for my guestsâ€”they showed no understanding or flexibility. It was clear that there were no other vehicles or congestion at the time, so their refusal to allow me to wait felt unnecessary and inconsiderate.

As a paying customer who booked two rooms, I expected better treatment and a higher level of hospitality. Instead, I was made to feel unwelcome and as though I was in the wrong for trying to ensure my guests were taken care of. This behavior is not reflective of the high standards COMO Hotel claims to uphold.

I hope management addresses the attitude and training of these lobby attendants. Hospitality is about accommodating guests, not creating unnecessary frustration. Unfortunately, this experience has soured my perception of the hotel, and I would hesitate to recommend it to others based on this lack of courtesy.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111891615063421048934/reviews
