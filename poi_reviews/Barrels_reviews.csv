Mike,3,"tl;dr decent taste, small quality and on the expensive side.

Pretty easy place to find beside paddy hills. This place have a bar and it is also an Indian restaurant, haven't seen this combo before. Taste is decent.

Lamb korma is very good, but has about 90g of meat for $19 (see pics)
Butter chicken is a bit too sweet for my liking and has about 100g of meat for $19
Chicken Biryani @$13.

The price to value for here not great, I think it is quite expensive for the amount of food you get.

Overall I would rate this place with the following:

Location: 6/10
Ambient: 8/10
Taste: 7/10
Service: 7/10
Price: 3/10",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113719386694804497709/reviews
