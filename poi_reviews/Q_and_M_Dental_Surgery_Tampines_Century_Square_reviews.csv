L J (Mrs Pauer),5,"Came in for wisdom tooth extraction and Dr Qayyum was funny, friendly and the vibe made me forgot that i came in with severe pain.
he explained my condition clearly and simple enough for me to understand. jokes were exchanged and overall it was less scary when your dentist had such positive vibes.
during procedure he was explaining step by step what he was doing and his demeanour was now more focus and i felt i was in good hand. Thank you so much for making the whole visit enjoyable. i do not want any more extractions but i would definitely come again for future dental checks .",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106220773318186635355/reviews

Cheryl Seet,5,"Doctor Erica, Asst Jenny and staff Alice were very helpful. I had some trauma of the suction and requested to not leave it in my mouth and they patiently and nicely acceded to my request. Alice and the other staff member also helped me with my multiple appt changes. I was surprised by a fluoride treatment at the end too! Love Q&M!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117892794370251178301/reviews
