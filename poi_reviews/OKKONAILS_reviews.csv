Joy Lee,5,"I’ve been visiting for years, and she always does an amazing job. She’s super meticulous, especially when it comes to detailed designs, and always customises them exactly how I like. I really appreciate her patience and how much effort she puts into every set. Highly recommend her if you’re looking for someone who genuinely cares about her work.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104609725921363368906/reviews
