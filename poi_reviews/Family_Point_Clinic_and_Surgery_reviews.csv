Sheniece Ng,1,"i was sick and wanting to see dr yang as he’s vv professional. when i walked into the clinic n asked abt who’s the doctor inside. the nurse just shut up, is it hard to just tell me it’s dr yang or whoever inside? the doctor inside was dr chee, im having headaches n cough. he just ask me open mouth, he just took a look like a freaking 1 sec, the ice cream stick just rested on my tongue for less thn 1 sec thn he threw it away. i was like did he even check? i say i needed mc oni but he forced to give me medicine and even medicine to prevent gastric. idk if it’s related or am i supposed to eat it to help my headaches. they also gave me etoricoxlb but i rmb this medicine helps but it’s not the best for headaches.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116185779805917127287/reviews
sakura siow,5,"Doctor Yang is a good doctor. Efficient and explain our symptoms well. My family has been seeing him for 20+ years. However, the locum doctors are consistently bad. Almost everytime we see any of the locum doctors, we have to either seek help elsewhere again or go back to see doctor yang again because the medicines given by the locum doctors don't work. For some reason, the locum docs seem to cost more too.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113740420257767880290/reviews
Azri Azrullah,1,"Dr Yang shamed my brother for his size and was exaggeratedly insulting him because of it. My brother went there just to get his feet checked because it was swollen but ended up feeling sad after the visit. Dr Yang, is not professional and not friendly, i really don’t understand where all these good reviews come from. It is not nice to fat shame your patient especially when the came to your clinic a proper consultation.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102880229107507250669/reviews
Tracy Lee,5,"Doc Yang is professional in his assessment and explains our condition well. He is also very quick but accurate in his assessment. Compared to the other doctors, a much shorter waiting time. Our whole family likes going to him and don’t mind travelling over to the clinic to seek his advice.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111797665201251856403/reviews
Du Shan,1,Dr seems experienced but the counter staff especially a short Chinese lady was very rude. She didn’t mind who comes first. She kept sending in whoever she knows and try to delay few like me. We asked about it but refused to answer. No queue number is given for her convenience.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111138819184356266515/reviews
