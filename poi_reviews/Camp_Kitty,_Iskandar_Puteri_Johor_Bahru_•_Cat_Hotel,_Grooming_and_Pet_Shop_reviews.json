      "text": "I boarded my two cats, Ollie and Ottie at Camp Kitty, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the experience! From the moment we arrived, the staff was welcoming, attentive, and truly cared about making my cats feel comfortable.\n\nOttie can be a bit shy and easily scared, but the team was so patient and gentle with him. Ollie, on the other hand, is more adventurous, and I loved that they provided plenty of playtime and enrichment for both of them. The facility was clean, cozy, and thoughtfully designed with cats‚Äô needs in mind. I also appreciated the regular updates and photos‚Äîthey really eased my mind while I was away.\n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for a safe, loving, and well-managed boarding option for your feline friends, I highly recommend Camp Kitty. Ollie and Ottie will definitely be visiting again and are already looking forward to their stay during Hari Raya! ‚ù§Ô∏è",

The place is clean, and the cats are well taken care of. The staff are also very friendly. I‚Äôve previously sent my cats to other places, but the service was not as good as Camp Kitty. That said, I do hope Camp Kitty can extend their check-in and check-out hours. Also, I really hope they will open a new branch in the Permas area, please!",
