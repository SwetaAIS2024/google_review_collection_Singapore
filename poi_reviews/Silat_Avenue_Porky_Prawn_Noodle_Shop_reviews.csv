Candy Chock,3,"Ordered 4 bowls, (no 1,2,4,5). Prawns were cut in half but they were decent. Not much prawn noodle taste so good for those who like much milder taste. Love the pork liver as it is juicy. She took time to cook so its good. Shows a certain care to the dish she is making but overall not the best prawn mee for me. For the livers, its worth. For the prawn mee… i think … i find one better elsewhere",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116174707560054642690/reviews
Bee Choo Cheng,3,The noodles is cooked just right and the prawn is fresh. The pork rib tastes ok. The broth is very flavourful. Only thing is there's houseflies flying around.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107028407430947755113/reviews
