The back one carrot is non-sliced to smaller piece like the old school style. Hence, bigger piece means less effort, means taste is not up to expectation. The person who cooked this dish is a middle-age auntie. Maybe she is a freshie in cooking this dish.\n\nIn short, theres is no wok hey at all. it's not worth the visit to this Carrot cake stall.",

Personally love the black carrot cake best as there is a great amount of chye poh that complements the sweet sauce, although all dishes are great too. Me and my other family members gobbled up everything within 10-15 minutes haha.\n\nIn general across all 3 dishes, all were surprisingly not too oily, sweet nor salty and there is a rather good balance of flavours. My elderly grandma also loves it!\n\nAll in all, hope to try it again (on-site)! Cheers!",
