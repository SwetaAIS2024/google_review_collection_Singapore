Canopus Mel,1,"Mislabeled promotion. The 20 for $5 for limited time become normal price. Either that or the cashier put the wrong items because she assumed I didn't see the promotion board. This ruined the experience even though its a small amount, people bought snack for fun. What's fun is that when feeling cheated. Hope other customers become aware.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114681361616849351239/reviews

Writing Snorlax,5,"On 25 Mar 2025, around 9:50 PM, I visited Scarlett Fresh @JP and was using the express checkout when a cashier (whose name I regretfully missed) stepped in to assist without me even asking. She worked with such incredible speed, scanning and packing my groceries in a flash. Her proactive attitude, helpful nature, and efficiency impressed me. I truly hope her efforts are seen by her employer and recognized to be a valuable asset to the team.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107864160951566572971/reviews

Angelina Angle,5,"This 思家客Scarlett China supermarket actually is located in Choa Chu Kang Lot One Mall beside Choa Chu Kang MRT and LRT station and Bus Interchange. Because it is not registered in Google Map so I posted at here. It is located next to Raffles Medical Clinic.

Visiting here is because wanted to buy 甘源综合豆果B套餐 Mixed nuts individual mini packs. It have frozen items too. Snacks, cup noodle, dried goods, etc... Remember to bring your own recycle bag as it will charge 10cents for a plastic bag",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100373202779329959919/reviews
