Huang Jia,1,"SingPost called and mentioned the goods will be arranged to delivered on a certain date. But failed to do so.

When called the customer service at multiple times, received different responses.
Morning call was told not to worry goods is arranged for delivery.
Afternoon called and asked again, being told the address is wrong. Which is wrong because the new address has been updated 4 days ago over the phone with SingPost.

Evening before 6 called and check with them again, they mentioned they need to check with relevant team why is the goods not being delivered and seeking my understanding.
And I requested to give a follow up call before 6, before they end operation, and guess what no call again.

Parcel was late, and arranged for another round of delivery, this is the experience with the SingPost.

They can‚Äôt do anything but just ask us to wait, because they can‚Äôt do anything.

I hope this is not what it supposed to be.

This is definitely a bad and bad service provided by the SingPost.
Finding excuses. If you missed the plan, means you missed it.
As a customer, I don‚Äôt accept. + it is not the first time.

On the next day I received my item. But it‚Äôs already after so much drama.
Thank you SingPost for doing such a Great job.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101868052281050025773/reviews

J C,5,"Went to this branch to send parcel to my son in UK.
Didn't really understand there are many controlled measures, but the staffs in the branch is so helpful and friendly to brief me on every aspect. To ensure my parcel could arrive safely.

Kudos to Mdm. Veerehma, she was really professional and always thinking of customer interests. Despite went through the hassle to help me to understand the self-help apps and pre-registration processe, so that i could save time and trouble should i send another parcel in the future. She was really thoughtful and not just trying to serve customer according to the SOP.

Great job!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103746222501117375336/reviews
Mel Choo,1,"Was here to collect the HPB fitness tracker. Tended to by a stern lady with curt replies and not a smile on her face. Thought since my husband was there he could collect one as well. She told us to register on the app first, which we did on the spot. However the earliest slot was the next day morning. Since we were already there, it didn't make sense to come back tmr so I asked if we could select tmr's time slot and collect today instead. Was met by a curt ""No"". And she also said this tracker is given by HPB and not them (suggesting its not her problem, too bad...) Rather taken aback by this kind of (non-existent) service, we decided, forget it and just leave. We don't stay nearby, not going to come back to this place. No wonder tons of trackers rotted in the warehouse - collection is a pain and the post office staff doesn't care.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116716324134104804133/reviews
