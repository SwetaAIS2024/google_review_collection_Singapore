Aliyah Mysha Mulyadi (Beattyss),5,"Hi, I'm from Class of 2024 and I had a great time in CPS. I'll remember Mr Zaki, a great Science teacher and the stories that he shared( If you're in his class, please watch his videos ;) ). I think they're gonna add another facility next year so watch out for that. They have wellness Wednesdays to help stretch and share gratitude. That's all i have. Hope you join our school :) !!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109013304865677206480/reviews
