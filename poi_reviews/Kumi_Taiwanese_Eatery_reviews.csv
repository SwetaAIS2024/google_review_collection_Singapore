Wendy Tey,5,"Recommend their kuabao because itâ€™s so juicy and the meat literally melts in my mouth. Their fried chicken and braised minced meat bento is really good too! I have been here for many times and will definitely keep going back for their food.

The dining area is shared with other restaurants so it can get a bit busy during lunch time but so far we are able to get a table for two people.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108154000113957468251/reviews

Keng Cheong Tan,5,Decent and affordable Japanese Taiwanese grub in an atas food court setting at Margaret Market. The dons were well done and flavourful. The chicken soup was herby and chicken well-seasoned. The mentaiko fries were a great complement and our meal (dinner) was satisfying.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102762619432424724330/reviews
