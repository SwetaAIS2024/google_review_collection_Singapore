      "text": "A true testament to share with regards to my child‚Äôs improvement.\n\nWe previously attended the weekly Saturday class in 2022 and that was when Mert enjoyed Teacher Fion & Teacher Sandy‚Äôs classes, that was also when he first fell in love with phonics and started a love for reading.\n\nWe felt that his interest cannot be wasted down the drains. Initially we had some difficulties with our jobs schedule thinking if it‚Äôs worth it to leave office during lunch hour to pick him. We then took a risk and made a decision that we could never ask for more.\n\nWe made some changes to our schedule and switched him to weekday classes and that was when I truly see vast improvement in my child. From a boy who doesn‚Äôt enjoy Chinese at all, doing homework and reading to a boy who grew to love doing homework (and asking for more), recite Chinese poems / songs and a love for reading is truly amazing, beyond words that can ever describe.\n\nWithin a short period of three months and we missed about 6 lessons, this boy shown a great improvement a lot in this school, he can write his Chinese name, Chinese poems , songs, read short sentences, grew a love for maths. We are indeed thankful and grateful to Teacher Sandy and Teacher Fion for being so patience, kind and understanding.\n\nRisking our lunch hour to see my child‚Äôs improvement in learning / build a strong foundation to prep him for p1 and to be able to spend time with my child - We can risk the lunch hour anytime, truly worth it!\n\nWe truly recommend any parent to send their child(ren) here!",
