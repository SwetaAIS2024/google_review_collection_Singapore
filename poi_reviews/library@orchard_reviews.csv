Olivia LZ,4,"I visited the Orchard Library before it closed for renovation, and I always loved its calm and cozy atmosphere.
The modern design, quiet corners, and wide selection of books made it a great place to read, study, or just take a break from the city.

Though it’s temporarily closed, I’m looking forward to seeing how they improve it. Hoping the refreshed space will bring back the same peaceful vibe—with even better facilities.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111575454013833516207/reviews
