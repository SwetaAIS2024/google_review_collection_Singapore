vin takahashi,3,"Reach there around 6pm, the place is almost full house, luckily there is still seat for 2 of us. We order their signature milk powder pork ribs, prawn paste chicken, seafood tofu and kai lang. Food is serve within 5 mins. The taste for the milk powder pork ribs is unique and nice. But the meat is a bit hard. There is no special chilli sauce for the prawn paste chicken. The seafood tofu and kai lang taste normal. Don't feel any special on their food. Price is resonable. They accept CASH only. No cards payment. Ample parking available. Beside is the wet market,  inside have posb ATM machine and toilet.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116463078793901301735/reviews
Ron Yang,5,"Delicious, value for money. Very local vibes, open air, without air conditioning place. They only accept cash.

The quality of food was very decent. One of the better Zi chars around. Try the pork ribs and fried prawn paste chicken wings. The fried rice also tasted great!

I would recommend this place. Thumbs up!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104960568279362160422/reviews
Wong Tze Shin,1,"Ordered a curry fish tail medium and price was $55!! Nearly fell off my chair!! No complaints on the fish and sauce.. but the vegetables inside like the lady finger, brinjal and long bean is totally tasteless and hard. Order HK kailan also price i think $14. Taste is ok but also on the high side to be honest. 2 bottles of water chestnut and luohan guo costs $5.. it's totally a rip off and scam. Suggest go the other opposite Zi char better. This place is Overhyped!!!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101703859562004353841/reviews
illusorydoll Eileen,4,"The fried rice is fragrant and rice is defined.
The spinach & eggs is decent
The butter pork ribs should change name to milk powder pork ribs. It wasnâ€™t buttery at all but loaded with milk powder. However, the pork ribs were tender.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108751945590041472358/reviews
Iris Tan,3,"A bit disappointed with the food. The vegetables were overcooked. Wanted to try the coffee flavour meat, quite tender but nothing special. dry Horfun got wok hey taste.
