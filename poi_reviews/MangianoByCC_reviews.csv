J S,5,First time trying this restaurant last Saturday. The food and service were superb. The manager and staff were very friendly. I wasn‚Äôt sure of the wine the manager recommended and he offered me to taste the wine before I ordered. Wow that was very nice. The wine he recommended was good. He also recommend the special of the day was the chilli soft shell crab pasta. Yummy. Overall we had an awesome dinner. It was my friend‚Äôs daughter birthday and they provided us with a complimentary birthday dessert. So sweet of them. Many thanks for the great service and will go there again.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101183888342125382709/reviews
Aloysius Ng,5,"Great dining experience at Mangiano. Was there to celebrate my friend birthday.

Reservation was made easy

Wasn't the easiest area to locate due to many construction work along the road, blocking the shop houses.

Wasn't crowded on a friday night. If you like a place to enjoy and chill, this will be a nice place for now. Reservations is recommended as it is not a big biggest place.

The food was great. Highly recommend the pizza üçï risotto with seafood. Ingredients is fresh, spot on. I'm just a little disappointed with the Beef Bolognese not the best of all.

Overall was a very nice experience üëç service was very attentive, sharing with us what is good or special of the day . Will be back for more.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105055344290269465547/reviews
Jacob TAN,5,Food here is great. Love the pepperoni pizza which has nice crust and yummy toppings. The spaghetti frutti de mare is so tasty and comes with lots of different seafood. The steak is tender and flavourful. Their house beer is light and fresh tasting. Perfect for our warm weather.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
Benjamin Sim,4,"A friendly neighbourhood Italian joint. Expect service to be personable and attentive. The slow cooked lamb-shank had only a slight hint of gaminess, and the tomato-based sauce is warm and hearty. The Spaghetti Srigolare is served smoking hot- almost every other table gets a portion so it‚Äôs worth a try. The wait staff are proud to recommend food and dessert options. Will be back for the home-made pastas and pizza üçï",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103987333962497841910/reviews
Maycia Hong,5,"Cozy Italian place for catch up with friends. Pleasantly surprised that Pepperoni pizza, Scallop Aglio e Olio and Fruits de mer pastas were outstanding. Truly enjoyed ourselves, will be back again paired with wines.

Rating:  2 star
2nd time for dinner but rather disappointed. The food is very different from what had the first time at lunch. Calamari and chicken wings were dry and overcooked. The five cheese pizza tasted frozen and dry. Crabmeat pasta is soggy.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100431621895525705597/reviews
