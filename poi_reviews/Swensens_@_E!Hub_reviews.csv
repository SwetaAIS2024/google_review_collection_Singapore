Rachel,5,The service is excellent and the staff are attentive. The food is reasonably priced and was served quite fast despite full house. The Dry Laksa Pasta was very good! Will definitely visit this outlet again.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113627080134185123125/reviews
POL MAO,5,"The restaurant was amazing as I was able to get my food on time and the waiter, Raphael was very kind and friendly as he helped us order the food and drinks and understood us along the way. This is the best experience that my friends and I have ever had in a restaurant. Thank you to the chefs and the waiters for cooking this food and especially Raphael who has given us the best experience eating here in this restaurant.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100172838301630828595/reviews
Clarence Ow,5,"Came here for the 1 for 1 sundae after dinner. Needless to say, great quality as always.

As the promotion is rather new to us, the staff patiently explains everything about the promotion, such as the $10 baked rice promotion does not stack with the ice cream promotion but will stack with the free drink promotion.

Not gonna lie, this is very confusion, but kudos to the staff for putting these points across.

Swenson's is one of the restaurant that make me feels that i do not pay service charge for fun - The free plain water. It is a cheap and simple complimentary that would make the whole meal much more pleasant.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112234615480628100933/reviews
ZX Soh,2,"Something's wrong with the their tablet app checkout. I added a grilled fish to my cart without confirming my order. Somehow, it vanished from cart, so I added the same item again with a roast chicken. End up we received 2 of the same grilled fish. The app clearly tried to scam our money by sending out cart items without our permission. Also the roast chicken we ordered was undercooked & still smells.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113106022533222081293/reviews
Izzuddin Tahir,5,"Food is always great as I frequent Swensen's at DTE. My personal favourite it's the mushroom soup with sourdough bread. It's a must try.

Service is 5 stars! We were attended by Razib, very attentive and always welcoming. When I bring my kid, he and his great staff are quick to offer the baby chair and baby cutlery even offering the soup of the day almost immediately.  Whenever you need something, they're always around and respond like a swat team. Fine dining experience! All the staff there make us feel like we're family visiting. We feel loved!!!!

Atmosphere is nice! Like a proper American diner! Lights are not to bright and you get that cozy vibes. Lovely.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100566226585422513562/reviews
