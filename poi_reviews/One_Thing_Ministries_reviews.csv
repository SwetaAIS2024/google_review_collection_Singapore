Sophia Lee,2,Both the Worship session and the prophetic session we attended (tried to) was not family friendly at all. There were two pages of guidance for having children in the prayer room which basically sounds like they donâ€™t want children there. I have attended IHOP rooms in the US and they were much more accommodating and friendly toward families.
