thenesh nesh,1,Donâ€™t ever send out parcel to be delivered here. They take their own sweet time or even days to update to item delivered. The staff or owner is also very rude when you approach him.

A A,5,"Tampines Optical also serves the community as a Shopee Collection Point. As far as I've seen, it has the BEST collection point service in Singapore!

Just show your collection PIN, and the friendly and well organised staff will get your parcels for you in an INSTANT.

If you DON'T want to be rummaging through 4 boxes full of parcels to find your elusive parcel, queuing to scan your parcels which may fail to scan -- you better collect your Shopee items here!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111023894101684791351/reviews
