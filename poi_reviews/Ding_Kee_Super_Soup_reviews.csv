JJ Lee,5,"Hidden gem indeed! Super delicious and tasty soup with lots of ingredients.
The best soup I had in Singapore! Lady and gentlemen boss are very friendly and courteous too. Highly recommended! My personal favorite got to be ÂçÅÂÖ® chicken soup and  peanut lotus soup. I had 3 more soups to take away as it was really good.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117243371771725433178/reviews
LP Pua,4,"Their Pork Rib Lotus Soup was thick, with the pork ribs being soft and tender. There was little to no cuttlefish, which I liked. Overall, it was a surprising find, and the food quality exceeded expectations.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Sylver Mini,5,"(1) Buddha jump over wall soup - Fantastic thick soup, came with lots of ingredients! A plump chicken thigh, fish maw rings, abalone slices, juicy QQ mushroom slices, & ard 5-6 pieces of dried oysters. (2) Yam rice was of generous portion - authentic old-school type, with big cubes of Yam, rice was fluffy & well-flavored! Very good value for money. Amazing flavors done just right, super earnest service by the lady stallholder, even offered free soup refills. Wed evening ~630pm, not crowded, weather was cooling off so overall dining atmosphere was acceptable. Tables are well spaced out & ceiling fans aplenty. Able to get parking lot quite easily. Didn't take pic of the soup, only the Yam rice. Will surely be back.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118352199448385101725/reviews
