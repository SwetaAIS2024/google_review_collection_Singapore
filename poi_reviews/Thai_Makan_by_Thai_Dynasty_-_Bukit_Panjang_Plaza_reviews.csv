rl,3,"Staff had his back facing the counter, so I had to call out to him before he noticed I wanted to order. Besides that, chicken tom yum was all right with tender pieces of thigh meat. Just wish the soup was piping hot.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105258380862622575819/reviews
Geri Ching,1,Food was disappointing. Ordered pandan chicken only to unwrap a small piece of overcooked hard and dry chicken meat that's not edible. Tom yum chicken soup flavour was ok but chicken used is stale with strong frozen chicken taste. Will never buy any food from this outlet again.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106207011733860039488/reviews

Karl Gan,5,"Delicious Thai food, good presentation. Order the Tom yum mama noodle to share for 2 pax. It is like the famous one in Bangkok. Lots of seafood and noodles. Spicy level is just right.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105103971515043428695/reviews
KH Sim,1,Chicken was not cooked thoroughly (got the raw taste). Staff insisted that it is the marinate and that it's fully cooked.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102213667023517988512/reviews
