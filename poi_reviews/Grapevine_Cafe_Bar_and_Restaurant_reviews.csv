A R-T,5,"Brought my family (8 pax altogether) here for a Sunday dinner. The food was pretty good, from the fish & chips and rib eye steak to the finger foods like the chicken skin and truffle fries. And the Connors Stout I washed them down with was a treat!

Too bad they do not have desserts (plenty of sweet teeth in my family!) but the icing on the cake was the warm and attentive service by Michelle, our wait staff. Truly Service with a Smile!

Definitely want to go back!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117945263201862639410/reviews
Insolen,5,"I've been coming here for the past 3 years mainly for the beer, always the IPA.
Having tried the food too, I can say the dishes are great too. Personal favourite is the chicken skin, light yet sinfully savoury.
Atmosphere is great on football nights when they screen live EPL games.
Staff is friendly and approachable too.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104070702719141299970/reviews
Steve Kyne,4,"Sort of a pub atmosphere.  The waitress was attentive and the happy hour meant a small discount on beers.

Food was a mixed bag with the truffle fries and meat lovers pizza excellent, the crispy chicken skin okay, and the nachos a sad joke (unsalted corn chips with a horrible commercial â€˜cheeseâ€™ sauce).",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105153019715372500482/reviews
C P,4,Nice place to hangout with friends. Calm ambience and bit dark. Lots of seats available. There are various food choices in the menu. Usually food arrives fast. Almost every drink is available here. There's a room for staff to be more nice.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104348885255859135653/reviews
ã‚¤ã‚¶ãƒ™ãƒ«,3,"delicious food, but sadly the place reeks of smoke too much. smoking area is too near the indoor seats and even sitting at the most inner table indoors, the smoke smell is just rampant. this was a pity given how good the food was, but we couldnâ€™t enjoy our meal with how often we had to hold our breaths. had to rush through our dinner and leave immediately.

probably would only come back for takeaways or if they can do something about the smoking area ðŸ«¤",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108863355468523327621/reviews
