Josh Kuek (#jkgourmets),4,"Saw many customers enjoy their Kway-Chap, looks good when I saw the real plate of duck meat with those pig related stuff.

My favorite was the ducks, so I try their duck noodles for first time. It really surprised me with the amount of duck meat and the flavor was really good.

The signboard and menu still showing the old pricing. Now everything has increased at least 50Â¢ each. Mine duck noodles was now $4 increased from $3.50.

But $4 is still a reasonable charged with their quite a large amount of duck meats, I will said is worthy. Will definitely come back again. ðŸ˜‹",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111255682252678932891/reviews
Alvin Mah,4,"Delicious kway chap at a very reasonable price. Probably the most value for money locally. The $4 set of kway chap comes with a big bowl of kway and a plate of pig organs including half an egg, tau kwa and tau pok. This stall has been here for a long time (more than 10 years?) and they have kept their prices despite the recent inflation. Definitely worth to support them when around the area.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101731562623200370370/reviews
