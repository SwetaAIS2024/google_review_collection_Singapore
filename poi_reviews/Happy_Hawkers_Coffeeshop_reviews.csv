Yw Z,2,Had to wait for 20 mins for the Mala. Worst is when I thought I was going to have a heart attack after tasting how salty the Mala is. Try at your own risk.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107177239536379491352/reviews
Lesley Shepherdson,1,"Junyi fortune fish. ÂêâÁ••È±º
Dabao the salted veg fish soup slices with rice.
The food items are clearly not cooked with thought. Rice which I paid for- not included was all lumpy and distasteful and this really ruined the entire experience.
The toufu noodle slices were literally dumped into the container and left there. They din even bother to stir it.
Definitely won't visit again.
Wasted $10 on this store.
The container for the soup I would rate that 5/5. Managed to have 0 spillage!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100552919573420611864/reviews
