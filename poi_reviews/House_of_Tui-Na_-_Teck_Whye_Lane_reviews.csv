Liang Chen Yeo,5,"A sore spot between my right shoulder blade have been bothering me for years. Came to this outlet to try their treatment after reading reviews online.

The treatment was extremely painful as the therapist tries his best to loosen the muscle knots around my shoulder and neck before the bone setting. After 3 sessions with them, I no longer feel the sore spot anymore. I paid $55 per session (not including the first consultation fee).

Their therapists were friendly and courteous as well.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107278920066571918332/reviews
coeur blanc,2,"And the therapist would schedule a follow up visit as soon as he finishes his tuina. U have no time to reject. Hard sale.

Also, the younger guy in the counter who watched video with loudspeaker on the phone throughout my visit there showed the ""我欠他一百万"" face. Uneasy experience.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110949216765890164616/reviews
