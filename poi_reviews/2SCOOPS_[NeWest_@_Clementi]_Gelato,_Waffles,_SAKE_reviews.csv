rachel rachel,4,"Kids always love to come here after meals. Kids order Biscoff and Oreo cheesecake with waffles, raspberries and Biscoff with waffles. Nice chill out place‚Ä¶ lady boss was very friendly. Allowing us to taste each flavour in order for us to make the best choice.
The bad point will be waiting time abit long, as there is only 1 waffle machine. üòÖ",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111697410452456303850/reviews
Zen,2,"Had this yesterday . Waffle taste good . Feeling the scoop of ice creams are to huge. Nothing special on the ingredients used for the ice cream . Taste more like commercial ingredients used instead of natural ingredients. Sweetness may be from gums or addictive sugar.  Overall , the work flow of the three staffs are not smooth and efficient. They can do better here as each table has to wait around 20 min to be served their orders.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100455622083832729881/reviews
Muse Dannyshow,5,"Nice chill out place in newest. Relaxing atmosphere.
No crowd at weekday afternoon, a couple, a group of colleagues. Also saw people takeaway ice cream and waffle back that are nicely packed separately.
Staff and owner (?) are friendly, come and try the different ice cream.
Nice selections (more than 10) of gelato and ice creams, ranging from classic to premium.
Quite a generous single scoop comes with a piece of cracker and sprinkles of biscoff adds a nice texture. üëç
Hot milo served in a huge mug. ‚òïÔ∏è
Can takeaway tubs of ice cream too.
Alcohol/sake/a few food items available as well.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115601602169765652109/reviews

Lynn Lim,5,"Found this little lovely place for a nice afternoon coffee. They serve waffles with ice cream as well. Ambience is great if you want to just chill and relax. Now they have latte at a special price of $3, and it is really nice. It will be even better if there are some cake selections to the menu for add on to the latte!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117325485872404551688/reviews
