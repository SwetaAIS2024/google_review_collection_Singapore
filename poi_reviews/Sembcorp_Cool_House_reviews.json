The garden was larger than we expected, and we were wowed by the huge variety of orchids there, some of which we had never seen before. If you have friends from overseas who would like to visit the Singapore Botanic Gardens but have limited time there, this would be the place to bring them to.\n\nHere are some photos taken at Sembcorp Cool House.",

      "text": "This hidden gem is probably one of the best indoor locations for pre-wedding shoots and outdoor shoots during a wedding day. In Singapore there are few places that you can go to that allow you to shoot a full pre-wedding or wedding day session without paying a substantial fee, but here for $5 you get access to the National Orchid Garden which has the iconic floral arches and of course the coolhouse itself, which boasts beautiful natural and architectural backdrops for photos. It's about 2 storeys tall inside, with a walkway that snakes from the upper to lower level. The lighting here is beautiful and the architecture combined with the wide range of flora here create such interesting compositional opportunities for photographers of every style. Definitely recommended for your next pre-wedding or casual photoshoot!",

It has a ton of orchids and carnivorous plants and you will probably have the whole place to yourself. A welcome place to cool off after a hot day walking in the botanic gardens.",
