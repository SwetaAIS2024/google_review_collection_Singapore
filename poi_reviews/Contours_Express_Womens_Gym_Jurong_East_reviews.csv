Noor Hayati,5,I love the place. Not afraid of men coming in. The trainers are friendly but how I wish there was another way to pay for the membership. It's not affordable for me. Maybe they could give a monthly payment.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114525918985887356025/reviews

Kelly Cheong,5,This is my 3rd year with Contours Express Jurong East. I like this gym because it is exclusive for women. I need not to queue for machines like other unisex gym. I love the coziness here too as all trainers and gym members are extremely friendly. I will continue to support Contours Express.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109625720866794735481/reviews
ChangHuey Toh,5,"Have been a member of this gym for nearly a year. It's a great place for someone who does not have the headspace to think about what to do next in their workout (as you can just follow the video while doing circuit training). There is zero judgement from gym goers as everyone is there just to workout in peace. No hogging of machines as the gym goers cycle through the machines during circuit training. Staff are friendly and very casual, no upselling of packages or any of that sort if you're not interested.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117044017901196634515/reviews
