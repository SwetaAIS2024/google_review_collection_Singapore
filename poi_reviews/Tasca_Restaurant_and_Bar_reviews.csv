Eileen,5,"More people should check this out! Pardon my photo quality but this Korean burger was so good. It had this crispy yet juicy chicken patty coated in delicious sauce, paired with a slice of cheese and some cold red cabbage(?) that was really refreshing. The flavours and textures came together so well from start to end.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111173224294069542976/reviews
