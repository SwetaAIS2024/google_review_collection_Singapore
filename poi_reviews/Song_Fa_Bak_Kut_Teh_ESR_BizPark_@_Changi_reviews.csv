Esther Loh,5,"Be prepared for long Que.
The service is not bad based on the crowd in the shop.
The soup is nice. I think the meat not much taste. Salted veg nice also.
But portion all very small and so I think the price a bit high for that.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113731489003917763911/reviews
Samantha Cheng,5,"I visited during my visit to concert at EXPO. It is about 5 minutes walk from the Changi City point and 5 minutes from Arena EXPO.

The food is great in taste. I really like the pepper spicy of the Bak Kut Teh and the fact that the herbs is not so strong in the soup (which match my taste perfectly ðŸ˜‹). The prok is super tender and juicy, strongly recommended!

The small portion is suitable for a young female. I think two girls can share a large size together. There is no set, you need to order everything separately (including plain rice, Cai Xin and everything rice.)

The environment is clean and relatively quite, the shop is not busy during my visit (5:30pm on Saturday).",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115484864970099645370/reviews
Poh Soh Lee,5,"Unlimited soup refill! Thatâ€™s the highlight of this shop.
Huge serving - for the most basic bowl, 3 huge pieces of spare ribsâ€¦ with chunks of tender meat.
Salted veggie is another highlight. Perfect to go with lots of rice!
Fast moving queue.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107301070285258783270/reviews
derek neo,5,"Song Fa Bak Kut Teh stands out as the best Bak Kut Teh in Singapore. The pork ribs were exceptionally tender, effortlessly falling off the bone. Both the Dou Miao and pig trotter impressed with their rich, savory flavors.

The service at this branch was top-notch, with staff displaying genuine warmth and politeness, making our dining experience truly exceptional.

Highly recommended for Bak Kut Teh lovers",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113015523826545524096/reviews
