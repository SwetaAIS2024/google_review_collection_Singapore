Whisky Dev,5,"One of the best whisky bars in Singapore.

A paradise for great independent bottled single malts.  The Single Cask are independent bottlers in the UK who offer their own wide variety of expressions, in this, their Singapore outpost.

I have tried a wide variety of their expressions and can say they have a great sense of experimentation that I appreciate.

The whisky connoisseur who is looking to experiment beyond the, often boring, distillery releases will truly love this place.

The novice whisky enthusiast will also appreciate the knowledge and friendliness of the team at the bar.

Apart from whisky, they have a small food menu that works well as an accompaniment to their offerings and they are also known to make some pretty good cocktails.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100566017429900964709/reviews
Mabel H,5,"Great service from the bartenders: knowledgeable, fun and always spot-on recommendations.

They also serve food and Guinness. Everything was good - halibut sliders were DIVINE, as well as the fried chicken. Guinness was solid too.

The community they’ve managed to build seems really warm and the place has a good buzz. Folks are happy to banter with fellow whisky-enthusiasts at the bar.

TL;DR don’t come here if you hate good food, good drinks and good people",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105306213378632174746/reviews
Melissa Chong,5,"This place is a total vibe if you're into whiskey and chill nights. The selection is top-notch—lots of interesting bottles to try, and the staff actually know their stuff without being snobby about it. Everyone’s super friendly and makes you feel right at home.

What really makes it special, though, is the atmosphere. It’s cozy, quiet, and perfect for reading or just unwinding after a long day. Think comfy chairs, soft lighting, and the kind of place you lose track of time in. Always a great place to unwind at.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112046234996275656699/reviews
Angela Hoi,4,"The Single Cask offers a cozy retreat for whiskey enthusiasts with an impressive array of options, making it a haven for whiskey die-hard lovers. During our visit, we ordered three whiskey flights and some finger food while discussing work. Unfortunately, the ambiance took a hit in the last hour of our stay due to excessive noise from some group of regulars, making it unpleasant to continue our stay. It's worth noting that the whiskeys here lean towards the heavy side with alcohol levels at 50% and above. Despite the noise issue, a solid choice for serious whiskey aficionados.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114900279388550722444/reviews
Tony Jen,5,"Definitely check it out if you call yourself a whiskey enthusiast. Good range of selections.

The Glenrothes Cask Ref. GR008A is the highlight of the night. It's the Taiwanese stinky tofu.

The Bunnahabhain 2013 Staoisha if you love a good peat and long lasting aftertaste.

Music could be better though, but that's subjective.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113198005808543692741/reviews
