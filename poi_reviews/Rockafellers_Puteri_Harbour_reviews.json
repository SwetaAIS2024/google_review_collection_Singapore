      "text": "I recently visited Rockafellers Puteri Harbour and had an amazing experience! The atmosphere was lively and vibrant, perfect for a night out with friends or just unwinding after a long week. The pub had a fantastic live band on Saturday night, adding to the upbeat and energetic vibe.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious! We started with the grilled duck breast, which was cooked to perfection - juicy, tender, and full of flavor. The salad on the side was fresh and well-balanced. The Beef Wellington was another standout - beautifully flaky pastry on the outside and tender beef in the center, accompanied by a rich, flavorful gravy.\n\nWe also tried the pizza, which had a crispy base and generous toppings - definitely a great choice to pair with drinks. Speaking of drinks, the cocktails were well-made and refreshing, perfect for kicking back and enjoying the music.\n\nOverall, Rockafellers Puteri Harbour is a fantastic spot for great food, drinks, and live music. If you’re looking for a place with a vibrant pub atmosphere and quality dishes, this is the place to be!",

I think he deserves a raise. As a student it is pricey but don’t judge it the whole experience was amazing. I am willing to come here again thanks to him and the amazingly good food.",
