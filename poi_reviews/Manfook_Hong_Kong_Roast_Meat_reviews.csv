인어,5,"Had dinner here today and the duck portions are so GENEROOOOOOUS! $7.20 for duck noodles or duck rice.
So full!!! Happy tummies for the two of us.

Also, don’t need to queue nor be packed like sardines cos this mall is good for a quiet meal!!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114995793431716380116/reviews
