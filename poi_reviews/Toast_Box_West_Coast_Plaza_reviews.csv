T greensake,4,"30/10/2024
Had 2 coffee and kaya toast ($6.40), was normal. Cashier was quick and friendly. She collected payment and made coffee singlehandedly, much appreciated. Relatively big aircon dining area within the mall. Tables were cleared fast for customers to sit on.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107525471936198024/reviews
Han Yu Tan,4,"I tried the roti with chicken curry, it’s pretty good. The roti is crispy, very flaky, which I like. The curry is really good! Very savoury, goes really well with the roti. The toast is good, soft boiled egg is alright. The chocolate cake I got wasn’t that great though, the cream isn’t good.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110231907823839530082/reviews
Wen Siew,5,"My usual order sandwich set in the morning.
Staff are friendly.
Coffee is nice, but there is a weird smell on the cup. I assume they washed the cup n used a wet cloth to cover. After all,  everything is fine.
Update reviews:-
The weird smell gone, coffee so much nicer. Staff as usual polite n friendly.
The girl who served me still rmb my order, which I came only once a while.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100106896148304301674/reviews
Michelle Lim,1,"ToastBox price has not only gone up but their unethical way of forcing customers to upsize are horrible!

I was told to top up $2 for large barley simply because their Asian Delight Sets no longer come with regular drinks. I asked the cashier why their menu board still stated the set, and the cashier replied no longer valid!  What????? No longer valid? Or simply want to earn more money? By charging additional $2 on regular to medium size barley!

$14.50 for the curry rice set!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110712163422700819742/reviews
Coco O,5,"It's a sizable toast box that opens early (there was already a queue at 8 am). The seating in the atrium feels bright and airy - very nice to sit.
They don't seem to have all menu items, eg there doesn't seem to be cheesy egg and ham toast",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101461615639083957237/reviews
