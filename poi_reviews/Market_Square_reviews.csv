Presila Sub,4,"There was alot of things like eatery places, cafe with food n drinks, clothes shop, wine shop, etc. One drinking cafe was so noisy they play darts, etc. Price of the drinks was ok. Another cafe is crazy happy hours end at 7.30pm n they want you to buy drinks from the tower. U must have a group not meant just for two persons. Very limited drinks they have not much options. There is Apollo banana leaf Indian restaurant too. U must go around n check it out for yourselves ok.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102712901355229343637/reviews
