      "text": "Worst customer service that I have ever encountered with Watsons staff called Serene.\nAt about 4:45pm, I was making payment at the self service kiosk, however I encountered a payment glitch. So I decided not to use the machine anymore and decided to bring my items to check out at the counter.\nHowever, the staff named Serene said something like this “Why, the self service machine cannot use?”. So I replied her I having some glitch or something, and I wishes to change the payment method to cash. But she keep insisting me to use the self service machine and she will help me use the machine again, when I clearly told her I wish to change to pay by cash.\nWhereby the self service machine cannot pay by cash.\nShe was not listening to customer request and insisted on her way. Not sure if she is doing this so she don’t have to trouble herself to help me scan and pack the items.\nI will never patronise this outlet again and very dissatisfied with my purchase and the customer service I received from Serene.",
