tan adam,5,"Stumbled upon this hidden gem selling authentic Ipoh fried noodles — the brand has over 60 years of history in Malaysia and is now finally available in Singapore!

Tried the signature 月光河 (Egg Yolk Hor Fun) and KL 大碌面, both were incredibly flavourful, packed with wok hei, and cooked to perfection. Easily one of the best renditions around.

The Salted Egg Pork Ribs were another standout — crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and coated in a rich, creamy salted egg sauce that was seriously addictive.

There’s a wide variety of dishes on the menu, but even just these few already left a great impression. Highly recommended for anyone craving authentic Malaysian-style zi char.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109188017494978942959/reviews

Drift King,3,Very average ipoh hor fun with raw egg. I find it bland though the chilli packs some punch with a clear tinge od sour amongst the spiciness. Overall a nice food court there though not cheap,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107097552708320713061/reviews
Clayton Chmiel,2,"The food is ok. Nothing special. But it's so incredibly slow. I've ordered twice, one when it looked busy, once when they looked bored. Both times I ordered here first, then ordered from other stalls, finished eating my food from the other stalls, and still had to wait for my hokkien mee. Not sure why it takes so long.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106419353423233392217/reviews
