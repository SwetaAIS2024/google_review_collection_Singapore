Yi Ling,4,"I'm not sure why the name of this coffee shop is called ""94 Eating House"" since there is no actual signage of that here.

It's an array of food options from tze Char, Chicken Rice, Ban mian, Western Food, Wan Tan mee and cai fan here.

A few famous establishments here, which seems to be the Western stall , serve the old school style of chops.

Ventilation is good even though there is only a veranda outdoor seating. So it's rather cramped.

I had the You Yi Ban Mian You Mian store, and I really loved the Pu Tian Lor mee!!! The meat is so tender and flavourful.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115707001285123682601/reviews
MC SM,4,"Recommend the FISH SOUP! Looks very plain and ordinary but the fish soup pretty flavourful. Can skip the Banmian and Heng Hua noodles etc, all quite average.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110245550123443528486/reviews
eatwithwelkin,1,"The entire coffee shop is smoking zone. There is no one enforcing patrons to only smoke in the smoking zone, which is the area near the carpark and has an ashtray on each table.

People just don't care and just smoke cigarettes across the entire coffee shop even though there are empty tables within the smoking zone.

If you want a cigarette free meal, avoid this coffee shop until they do something to address this issue.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113051260861199484535/reviews
celine andre,5,"This quite ban mian store, called You Yi Ban Mian You Mian, that sells Pu Tien bee hoon soup and very homely ban mian that is hand torn. Pork slices are wonderfully soft and aptly marinated.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101365807889433653375/reviews
Cy Tan,4,"Tried their western food.. it was not bad for a coffee shop standard, prices are affordable too! Where can u find a decent steak at $9? And such a big piece of chicken cutlet at $5+? The fried buns they serve are also quite fragrant, but slightly oily. We didn't managed to finish the fries though, as u can see the portion is really big!! Overall a happy meal and will come back again soon!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118262530980014909557/reviews
