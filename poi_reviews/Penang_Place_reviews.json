      "text": "An amazing find for Penang food. I love family owned businesses as usually they offer quite authentic native flavours and this place is a very good example of it.\n\nAmbience: Lovely decor, comfy seating and this place is really quite big. They have employed robots for table side delivery.\n\nFood: We ordered chicken satay, beef rendang, Sambal fried rice set with chicken and sambal fried rice set with breaded fish. Food arrived quite quickly. The fried rice set incduded fried rice, fried egg, prawn crackers, sautéed veggies and two pieces of fried chicken. All the items were excellent. Fried rice were flavourful with juicy prawns,  chicken was also v nice. Their peanut sauce for satay was really good. I liked it that they don't charge for water. Portions were also quite large so we had a very full and satisfactory meal.\n\nService: I wish I could rate them 6 stars. The girl who seemed to be floor incharge was serving with a lot of warmth. It was clearly evident that it was her family business. You rarely see this kind of service and diligent work from restaurant staff. We also customised one of our order and they happily did it without any fuss.\n\nPrice: Heavy and fulfilling dinner for 3 costed us SGD 74 which is quite reasonable given the quality of food, good service and nice ambience.\n\nOverall, excellent value for money. I am coming here again for sure.\n\nPS: Their CNY buffet priced SGD 43+ seemed to be very popular (and elaborate).",

      "text": "It’s heartbreaking to say this, but lunch at Penang Place at Suntec City was a letdown. This was once a spot we cherished, ever since we first discovered it at International Business Park in Jurong in the early 2000s. Whether it was the buffet or the à la carte dishes, there was always something to look forward to.\n\nBut today, the Char Kway Teow was over-fried, marred by bitter, burnt bits—almost as if the wok hadn’t been cleaned properly between batches. The Hokkien Prawn Mee had a rich, flavourful broth, but it was buried under an overwhelming tangle of noodles and beehoon — we finished the soup and left most of the noodles. And the biggest disappointment? The prawns—once sweet and juicy—were tasteless.\n\nIt’s a sad realisation, but this isn’t the Penang Place we used to crave. We won’t be coming back anytime soon.",
