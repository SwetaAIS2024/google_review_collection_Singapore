Mark Heng (Infosphere),3,"Wet weather today, so I thought some body warming soup is in order...

My #ChineseMuttonSoupExpedition took me to Kovan hawker centre tonight, to that stall I've eaten at many years ago but without any recollection. (Perhaps that's a strong enough hint not to try? ðŸ˜‚)

Anyways, I was served for the first time a much smaller bowl (@$7.50) -- Here I'm comparing to the usual bowl sizes seen at AMK Ave 10 and Jln Berseh outfits.

The first sip of the soup was nothing spectacular, though expectation was high to taste something herbal for once!

It tasted to me like a ""deep and dark"" concoction... I wouldn't term this herbal or anything close :(

There are strips of cut ginger and what looked like shreds of ginseng roots... Only time will tell if this ""herbal"" soup has any firepower ðŸ¤”

(After waiting 3 hours, confirmed no herbal effect from this mutton soup! Looks like I should pay a visit to Bkt Merah View next?)

Now, the meat pieces are rather pathetic, though there was enough to accompany a bowl of rice. Not exactly odds and ends; but certainly not choice cuts!

(Now it should be easier to understand why AMK uncle takes his time to cut and trim the mutton meat he dishes out in the hot soup...)

The meat is soft no doubt, but sadly not tender. And there's plenty of fat -- I'm not talking about the thin surface layers that may be hard to remove. What I had in my bowl was like 4-6mm thick fat!!!

Overall, this has been an average tasting Chinese mutton soup, with little hint of anything herbal. Won't be coming back anytime soon...

Donald-Eric Lim,5,"Not sure what all the negative reviews are about. Maybe they caught the lady on one of her â€˜bad daysâ€™.

The lady who served me was friendly and even took out the saucers for the chilli sauce for me without being asked.

I ordered the mixed mutton soup which came with a good portion of meat, innards, bone with marrow and soft gelatinous tendon and meat ball. All of these in a flavourful soup that didnâ€™t have any hint of gaminess that usually accompanies mutton nor was the taste of herbs overpowering.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104281366068087851174/reviews

Nigel Cheng,3,Mutton is quite fresh portion too little soup kind of blend though stall owner advertisement put up using quality ingredients but stingy thrifty on portion better wake up your brain to win more customers or risk losing them one by one,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102088341551471590295/reviews
Jacqueline Tan,1,"$7 (cheapest is $7) for a measly portion with very diluted soup. Stall owner very unfriendly, seems unhappy that we packet using our own container when they charge 10 cents for plastic bag, 30 cents for container.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113453772970020993265/reviews
