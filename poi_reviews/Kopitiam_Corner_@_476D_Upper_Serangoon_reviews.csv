Jacob TAN,3,"The ter kah peng here is not nice. The pork trotters is over cooked and the meat is disintegrating. The taste is also not flavourful. The service is acceptable.
The vegetable rice is better with a wide variety of choices. Taste is acceptable.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews

Pak Soon Lau,4,A very convenient place for a meal for the residents of the public housing in this area. Most stalls have a budget meal option.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107524637554500568527/reviews
Z N,1,"The Indian stall & Yong Tow Foo stall are always making errors in their orders.

Previous Indian food vendor was better, with more variety in their dishes. Now, they get their orders wrong half the time.

Plain prata: Quality is not up to standard, sometimes not done, semi-cooked.

Only Kopi drink shop is acceptable standard. Should not have Thai food but maintain Chinese zi char eatery.

This current Kopitiam is of average standard unlike previous Foodfare.

Please improve quality standard, not just increase price all the time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105632220738880257443/reviews
