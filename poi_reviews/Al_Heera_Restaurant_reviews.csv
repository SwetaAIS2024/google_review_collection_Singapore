A Lin,3,"The coin prata was particularly thick and doughy. Not at all nice. The gravy though is not too bad.
The maggi goreng was quite nicely fried, with lots of chicken meat and bones. But at $9, it should be. Would be nice to have more vegetables for a balance.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111356795897415529736/reviews
Kwong Fei Yee,5,The thosai is extremely crispy and has a good balance of spices the prata is crispy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside (highly recommend) and the spices in the curries are well balanced,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118030178376808365901/reviews
Goh Rayson,4,"Delicious mutton biryani with option for bone mutton or cut pieces. The rojak is worth a mention too, especially the sauce with chunky peanuts which isn't too sweet nor diluted. They also serve a wide variety of roti prata and murtabak which is not bad too. Will be back to try other items in their menu.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114486897715680960666/reviews
jianhao lee,4,"Mixed feeling. Im writing this review after my 2nd visit in a month. The first experience wasn’t pleasant. The customer service was so so, some orders were forgotten, and the food serving was too long. I was in rush as well and didnt enjoy the meal. Both visit were on a weekend morning. I tried again this weekend and the experience was totally opposite. Good service, food was served relatively quick. Taste good. Price might be higher than usual coffeeshops. Family of 4 (2+2). Pratas and drinks cost SGD 17. Parking might be challenging on peak hours. The prata standard deserves 4 stars.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107431589322877158256/reviews
Cheng Yi Phua,5,"Had prata, masala tosai, tissue prata. They are all awesome. The prata comes with curry and chili (not often used get these sauces In Singapore). Teh tarik is a must have here. Don’t expect 5star service, expect our local Indian Muslim restaurant service. My second visit. Would definitely bring my family back again. The only issue would be accessibility. Not much parking. Food wise 5 star.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116574672337996804794/reviews
