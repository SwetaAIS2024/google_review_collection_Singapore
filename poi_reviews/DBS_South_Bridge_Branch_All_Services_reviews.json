      "text": "I went on Wednesday morning regarding not getting OTP in my email to activate paylah.  I need to reactivate paylah apps becos I just change my handphone.\nThe counter staff checked and explained that the paylah system did not issue the OTP, and that their IT will get back to me.\nThe IT called on a Saturday 2.13pm.  Because it was an unknown number, I did not answer the call.  Then at 2.21pm, I received SMS \"With regards to your Paylah email OTP issue, kindly terminate & re-apply Paylah again. Would you like us to terminate it at our end so you can apply straight away after termination? Kindly advise. Thank you and have a great weekend!\"\nI replied to the SMS at 2.30pm.  But there is no reply.  Probably she has gone home, after a half day in office on a Saturday.\nWonder why the IT called near knock off time, and left before solving the issue? In so doing, the ticket would be recorded as action taken within 3 days and KPI satisfied?\nIt certainly wont be a great weekend for me.  I would have to bear with hopefully only another 2 days of inconveniences of no paylah, before the issue can be resolved hopefully on Monday.",

She helped me through with the process without any delay. DBS has a ‚Äúgem‚Äù within their staff. Wonderful and great service. Thank you Ms Emily. üòäI was told not to take any photos within the bank so I just got to do with the photos from outside the bank.",
