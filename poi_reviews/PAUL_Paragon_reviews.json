Cappuccino was bitter. Steak was tough and fibrous. Hash brown was soaked in oil. Only good parts were the egg n greens",

Unbeknownst to the dining customers, there is a live roach tickling pastries of its choice in the display with its feelers. Cafe is full house.\n\nI’m not sure if this is a sign of worse things inside the kitchen and staff are nonchalantly working alongside or covering up. There is of course the possibility of roach eggs that could’ve hatched in the shop or siblings of the pictured insect. Had to leave empty handed, sorry Paul.",

When I informed the waiter, he seemed unsure about the dish. Later, he brought the missing sausage without offering any explanation.\nWe also ordered a cordon bleu, which took around 30 minutes to be served. Not sure if this delay is normal, but it felt longer than expected.\nI was also dining with my 3-year-old child, but no cutlery or plate was provided for him. The lack of attention to service and details needs improvement.",
