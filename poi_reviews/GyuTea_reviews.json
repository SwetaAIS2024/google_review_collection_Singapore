      "text": "Lovely little drinks cafe outside RUD Karting. The staff is super cheerful and upbeat, she was such a bright and lovely person to talk to. Nice atmosphere. They sell alcoholic beverages too and vapes. At night they have shisha. They also seem to have steamboat and other bites to eat but I did not enquire further about those. I think drink prices are on the expensive side.... definitely Singaporean prices. However, you get a Buy 1 Free 1 deal if you bring your receipt from RUD.",
