      "text": "The double egg spinach soup and sugarcane juice are both must-try delights from two different spots! The spinach soup is packed with freshness, with the double eggs adding a rich, nutritious touch. Every spoonful feels comforting and satisfying. Meanwhile, the sugarcane juice is perfectly sweet and refreshing, an ideal way to quench your thirst and cool down. Both shops use fresh ingredients and provide excellent quality, making these two items unforgettable. If you’re in the area, don’t miss out on these delicious treats from their respective stores. Highly recommended with a full five-star rating!",

      "text": "Although an interim market and hawker centre, it's well ventilated with big fans every few metres, allowing for really good air circulation. It doesn't feel stuffy and warm, even in the middle sections. A decent selection at breakfast with a good number of stalls opened, and with about half closed that tends to open later and till night time. Carpark isn't much on its own, but the outdoor car park next to it is close by.",

      "text": "Always one of the places I would come for if I crave for fried stuff. Never fail to order the fried stuff and bee hoon if visit the place. Many stalls can be try but did not manage to try others. Chendol is my favourite dessert. There is one stall; Whampoe xxxx,  selling beancurd, soya bean drink, etc.  Likes their beancurd , smooth and silky.  Its besides the fried stuff stall. Must order the one with gingo nuts.  Ask for no sugar and mix with some soya bean milk. Heavenly.. We also ordered white carrot cake but not in picture. Bon appetit",

Although it is an interim, it was so built just like a permanent hawker center. It was clean and airy, with all the familiar old food stalls. You can find all the Singaporean local favourites here.",
