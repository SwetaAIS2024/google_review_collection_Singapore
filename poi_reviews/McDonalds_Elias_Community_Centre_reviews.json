I asked for a simple sauce (mayonnaise) with my hamburger, as I cannot take ketchup or chili sauce, but she kept saying, 'No ma'am, we cannot.' They have mayonnaise but won't give it to me, even though I was willing to pay for it. I'm not asking for it for free; I was willing to pay for any type of sauce, but she kept insisting that they cannot give or sell it! It was a terrible experience with the manager!",

      "text": "I have mixed feelings about the McDonald's at Elias CC. On the positive side, the service here is always friendly and prompt. The staff greet you with a smile, take your order efficiently, and get your food out quickly. I appreciate their positive attitude and speedy service.\n\nHowever, the restaurant could improve its cleanliness, especially by emptying the trash bins more regularly. On my last few visits, the dining area trash cans overflowed with garbage, making it difficult to dispose of my trash. Some tables also had crumbs and sticky spots that hadn't been wiped down recently. While I understand it gets busy, I think the staff need to be more diligent about keeping the restaurant clean for customers.\n\nOverall, I enjoy the friendly service at this McDonald's but hope they can step up their cleaning practices and take out the trash more frequently. No one wants to eat in a messy fast-food restaurant. With some extra attention to cleanliness and hygiene, this could be a great McDonald's location.",
