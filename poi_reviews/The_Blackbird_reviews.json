Service was on point, and the throwback 80s-90s beats? Absolute bangers. No cap, the crowd was def rocking their 40s, as one of the reviews said. The spot was totally off the MRT radar, but snagging a Grab or hopping on a bus home was chill.",

We got ourselves nacho cheese fries, fried chicken and regular fries along with the promo. The live band starts at 7pm. Then we got ourselves carbonara, a kids‚Äô menu of nuggets, mash potatoes and grilled broccoli. For 5 pax, the total came to about $290.",
