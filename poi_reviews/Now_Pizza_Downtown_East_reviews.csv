Jacob TAN,4,"I bought takeaway but the pizza sourdough crust was still chewy and flavourful albeit not hot or crispy anymore. Today, I tried the meat fiesta which was good but will try the other flavours in the future. I will also have the pizza at the kiosk the next time to compare whether any drastic difference.
They are using individual oven and can take  a long time to serve the pizza during peak hours.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews

Jessica Lee,5,"Love their pizzas! They are operating as a kiosk with a small area for customers to sit down and eat, which is great coz the pizzas taste best when theyâ€™re fresh outta the oven.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100560834945941691426/reviews
Gerard Lee,4,"Ordered the meat fiesta and pepperoni. The crust was worth mentioning, chewy and flavourful. Pepperoni was good too, I think they drizzled some hot honey on it. Meat fiesta would have been perfect if there was a punch flavour cutting through it, like a bbq sauce?

I would still order it again!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105781019210615902905/reviews
