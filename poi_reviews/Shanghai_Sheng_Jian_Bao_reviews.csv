Wong Teck Jung,4,"#1st review#
The stall prepares their dumplings and baos fresh every day. Today, I had the opportunity to try the following:
1. Xiao long bao - It was juicy and delicious. Definitely a dish I would order again.
2. Hot and sour soup - The spiciness was just right. Personally, I found it slightly sweet, but I believe locals would enjoy this flavor profile.
3. Sheng jian bao

#2nd review (two weeks later)#
Today I tried the spicy chili oil wanton and I really enjoyed it. The wanton skin was smooth, and the filling was delicious. Moreover, the sauce was flavorful and added an extra kick to the dish.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115500349786770672418/reviews
M Mmm,4,"Sheng jian bao is not bad, not the overly oily type. Seasoning is quite balance. Ordered Seaweed and black fungus was given a big one instead of small one. Taste wise was not bad prefer the black fungus over the seaweed. Will come back and try the xlb.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110088043357308799235/reviews
Les Buckley,5,"Delicious crispy and juicy handmade pork bao and juicy handmade Xiao long bao.
Bao 4 pcs for $6.50 enough for 2
XLB $6.50 for 5

Downside - Semi industrial food court with annoying “bell” to alert you to orders ready. Busier means more annoying",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114227995632187701280/reviews
阿宝,4,"First time bought Sheng Jian Bao from this stall was way back in Oct 2022…. They tasted really good & 4 pieces were really not enough!

4 months later, I went back to the same place but this time I was a bit disappointed…. The bao is not as crispy like before & there is also lesser “soup” inside the bao…

& the 口感also not as good as before :-(

The difference can be seen between the pictures…. 1st two were taken in Oct 2022 & 3rd one taken in Mar 2023…",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews
