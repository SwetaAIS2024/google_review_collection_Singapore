Cendol taste alright but the red bean inside is sour and rancid ! I will not patronise again ðŸ¤® OMG I had diarrhoea after that and on medication ðŸ’Š",

So I had a beef brisket fried rice that only has fried egg on top.   1 STAR. So Disappointed\n\nTiga Rasa Beehon ($7,70): taste ok but soooo spicy. All I can taste is the chilli like wet sauce.  2 stars.picture attached\n\nSadlyâ€¦ maybe Iâ€™ll try other dishes but for those 2 items I bought, I will never buy them again.",
