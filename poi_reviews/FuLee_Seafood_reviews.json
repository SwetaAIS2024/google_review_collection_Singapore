White noodle and mui fan lack wok hey. Chicken is red inside. Hot plate tofu was bland. This place is in the middle of nowhere also... Won't come back again.",

      "text": "Fu Lee Seafood, located at Blk 81 Marina Parade, is a gem worth discovering! I recently had dinner at this coffee shop and decided to try their Fu Lee Seafood offerings. I couldn‚Äôt resist the $12 promo for the Nonya Fish Fillet, and I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt! The fish was fresh, and the flavors were absolutely delicious. Additionally, the Crispy Shrimp Paste Roll was a delightful appetizer ‚Äì tasty and perfectly crispy. For mains, the Fried Bak Chye with Garlic provided a satisfying chewiness and crunch, while the Fu Yong Egg was cooked to perfection. What‚Äôs more, the prices were affordable and reasonable for the quality of food served. Importantly, every dish arrived fresh and piping hot, enhancing the dining experience. I‚Äôll definitely be returning for more of Fu Lee Seafood‚Äôs delectable offerings!‚Äù üêüüç§ü•öüåü",
