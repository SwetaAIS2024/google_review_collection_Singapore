      "text": "After 3.5hrs on the road with my 2-pedal-wheelers, this sweet version did it for me. The char siew is the kind I like, on a sweeter side, and has a good mix of fatty and lean layers. Noodles is qiu enough for me, and both the pickled green chilli and paste version has just the right punch. The green is crunchy and packs a nice enough kick, and the red one is savoury, flavourful without being too spicy! If your wanton fix is towards the savoury type, then give this a miss. But drop by for the char siew. Uncle Joe roasts them on the spot, with a charcoal brazier, no less. üòÅ",
