      "text": "An excellent pre-school for our son. Although we just moved to Singapore early this year and our son did not speak neither English nor Chinese, the teachers are really patient in teaching and caring for him. All the staffs are very warm and friendly. The curiculum is also very balanced in education and playing portion. They also have music, culinary and art school. The indoor playground and gym is the favourite place of our son. Overall, we are very happy and satisfied with MindChamps @ Dairyfarm and our son loves to go there, which is for us the most important thing.",
