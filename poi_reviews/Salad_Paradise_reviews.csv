Eli LLoren Clavero,5,"‚ÄòHad a late lunch near the office.  Today‚Äôs lunch was an intriguing mix of flavors and textures with a unique combination of ingredients. The cold red spaghetti was a refreshing twist, offering a nice, subtle chewiness that contrasted well with the crispness of the lettuce. The roasted pumpkin and sweet potatoes were sweet,  earthy addition, perfectly balancing the lightness of the greens.

The fruit salad added a surprising sweetness, bringing a bright and fresh element to the dish. The mushrooms added a savory note that paired well with the sweetness of the vegetables and fruit. The carrots were crunchy and provided a nice bite, while the roasted sesame sauce brought it all together with a nutty richness.

Overall, this salad is a great fusion of savory, sweet, and earthy flavors. The roasted sesame sauce is a standout‚Äîdeliciously creamy and nutty without overpowering the other ingredients. It‚Äôs a filling yet light option that feels both satisfying and refreshing, perfect for a midday meal. ‚ÄòHope I can try their tofu or other protein next time.  :)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104566624723505954770/reviews
