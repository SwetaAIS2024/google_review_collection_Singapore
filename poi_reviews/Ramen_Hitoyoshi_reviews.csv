Sam Lim,4,"The teriyaki chicken was a bit over-salted, but still decent. The Shisamo fish was nicely sized.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105223893774165215809/reviews
Reboot Myth,4,"Typical Tonkotsu Ramen shop with variety of ramen dishes and sides on offer. Good tonkotsu broth and choice of noodle thickness/doneness allows for some level of customization. Overall, it’s a treat, but the broth feels a bit too reliant on salt and the portions of soup is a bit low be the noodles.

The staff is helpful without becoming pushy.

Customers should take note that the prices quoted on menu are pre-GST. This makes the overall price of a meal a bit higher than most other ramen places. While the quality is also higher than most (it reminds me of the ramen from packed street restaurants in Japan), I’m not exactly sure that alone can justify the hike entirely.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101373338556402749381/reviews
Jayzelyn Joves,4,"Ordered Spicy Ramen all toppings, less salt, less oil, hard thin noodles. I can say that the meat was good! Not stinky and well cooked. The noodles have a hint of the alkaline taste. All in all will definitely go back and try the non-spicy.

The auntie-lady staff was lovely too and assists us warmly.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109583813441917861125/reviews
Joan Tjong,5,One of the best ramen in Singapore. When visiting family on holiday usually come to vivo and this is a good option to try! Highly recommend,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114698579649113862577/reviews
Wen,5,"Ramen here is comparable to what you will get in Japan. I’ve been here multiple times and it is consistently good. The only thing I would say to avoid is the normal chashu (1 long piece of meat). Apart from that, everything else I’ve tried is tasty (only tried noodle dishes). I really like the free beansprout as well, always dumping a large amount into my ramen for a crunchy texture.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102725575944024820487/reviews
