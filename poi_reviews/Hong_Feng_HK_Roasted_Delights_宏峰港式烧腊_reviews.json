      "text": "Extremely rude service — would not recommend\n\nI had a very unpleasant experience at this duck rice stall. I placed my order politely — duck rice with duck thigh and roasted pork. However the man serving me completely ignored what I said and instead raised his voice, rudely shouting, “What do you want?” I calmly repeated my order, and again he snapped, “We have duck, rice and noodles. What do you want?”\n\nHis aggressive attitude was completely uncalled for. I was simply trying to buy a meal and support his business, which seemed quiet at the time. When I asked if I could use my CDC vouchers to pay, he barked back, “TAKE IT OUT LAH,” in an even more hostile tone.\n\nTo the owner reading this — if you're wondering why business seems slow, this might be a big reason. Good food is important, but basic respect towards customers is even more crucial. No one wants to support a place where they feel mistreated.\n\nIf you genuinely care about your business, I urge you to take this issue seriously. The man pictured in the photo I’ve attached is the one who served me.\n\nJudging by other reviews, this isn’t an isolated incident. Totally unacceptable — I won’t be returning.",

Then I told him I wanted to takeout. He got angry and yelled at me. Why didn't I say it? I said I did. Then he packed it and threw the bag in front of me. I think he should learn how to communicate again.",

Taste is the best for their char siew and roasted pork is crispy AF.\n\nThe herbal roasted duck is so good that you cannot find it elsewhere.\n\nPrices are very reasonable and value for money. Never once disappoint. Eating it regularly at least once a week.",
