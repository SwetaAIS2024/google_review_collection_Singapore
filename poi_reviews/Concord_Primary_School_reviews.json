      "text": "During my 6 years of primary school experience was so fun, the school was big and even have a 2 ponds a big and a miniature pond. The experience could not get better with the basketball court,feild and ISH(indoor sports hall).The were many place to explore during those years. The canteens were often clean and the library had lots of areas to go to including a mini stage.I would usually go there every two weeks!Most of the cleaners and staff are very friendly.Speaking of that,the staffroom is big and has loots of rooms.Therte are many classrooms scaterred everywhere across the school and some even reach until level 6!Which seems fun at first but nope.Very tiring.But overall,the experience was fun and now i am in secondary school!
