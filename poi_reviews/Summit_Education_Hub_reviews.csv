M Z,5,"I had signed up The Ultimate Science PSLE Revision Program in Jan 2024. Over the past 9 months, my daughter and I had a rewarding Science journey with Teacher Kelle. We love the Personalised Q&A Support! She is always timely with her reply and clear in her written explanation. Her Science tips helped us to grasp the concept fast. Her handouts and notes are so easy to understand too. Irregardless of the end result, we would like to say a big THANK YOU for all your help, patience & guidance. We would definitely recommend you‚ò∫Ô∏è From: Mummy of AY",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110862452614394940736/reviews
J. P,5,"Chanced upon Teacher Kelle and Kainetik collaboration and decided to try it out. To our surprise, this is the best science class we had ever attended. Explanations and tips given were elaborated yet clear. The online videos gave us options to replay at our convenient time and our own pace. The Q&A support is amazing as teacher Kelle responds within the day and she is thorough in her explanation. I will definitely recommend students who are struggling with science to try out the online classes.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100420989118395616882/reviews
D R Taylor,5,"Teacher Kelle is one of the rare Michelin-starüåü teachers we have engaged! ü§© Teacher Kelle teachings are clear, concise and consistent. Her lessons are to the point, tips are 5-‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê worth and easy to understand/absorb. Answering Science Paper open-ended questions has always been a struggle. But just after 3 hours of exam booster sessions with Teacher Kelle, my son now knows exactly how to answer different questions on condensation/evaporation questions, circuit questions w 4Cs, plants reproductive system to name a few....  with much more confidence. Wow! Impressive!! Thank you Teacher Kelle! üëèüèªüëçüèªüôèüèª

Lolli Popcorn,5,"Teacher Kelle is a nice, patient and dedicated educator. She is always willing to share her knowledge and spend time out of class to help us if we have any questions. The relatively small class also makes it easy for the students to clarify any doubts. Thankful to my sis for recommending Teacher Kelle to me! My daughter‚Äôs Science grade improved by leaps and bounds.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111416868163194732978/reviews
