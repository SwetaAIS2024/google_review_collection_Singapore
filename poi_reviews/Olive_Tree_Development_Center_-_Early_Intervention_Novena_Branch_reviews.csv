Arys Divino,5,The Olive Tree team has been like our second family here in Singapore. They were very instrumental for each milestone my son had reached. Their early intervention program helped my son to be prepared in mainstream kindergarten. Mr. Chiu also spearheaded a support group for us fathers who are raising kids with special needs. This is very helpful for me to be more involved with my son.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113087664828351961401/reviews
