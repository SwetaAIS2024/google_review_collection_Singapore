Tze Kiat Lee,5,"Ri Sheng delivers really good steam fish! Bonus is they will clean and gut ur fish from our fishing trip!

Sambal sotong rocks! Sambal is way better than many bbq sting rays stalls.

What a local gem of zhi zhar!
We will be back!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109626649949906792276/reviews
KH Chong,5,"Been frequent this stall for years. Most unique dish is their Hokkien Fried Prawn Mee 福建炒虾面, no other stall has such flavour and it tastes delicious especially with their sambal source. Other zi char dishes are really nice too. It’s not easy to find the original style of crispy beehoon 香底米粉 nowadays. We often order their Prawn Paste Chicken 虾酱鸡, but with the recent craze of salted egg dishes, their Salted Egg Chicken 咸蛋鸡 is also much better and not as deep fried as other stalls. Call them to preorder if you want to take away or reserve a table!",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108028225713545630861/reviews
CCS,3,"Tucked into a corner inside a popular food court, it is easy to miss them. Which I did for over three years since I moved into the neighborhood.

Yesterday, we finally gave them a tryout and realized what we've been missing. That is, honest to goodness Chinese Zi-char.

Their menu is impressive, ranging from a simple $6 rice set (sweet and sour fish is good) to fish head soup for family of four.

We will certainly be back to sample the rest of their menu.  And we just need to walk there (7 minutes) without the need to drive to Pandan Gardens.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
David Wong,5,"Very nice Fish Head Steamboat and the Prawn Paste Chicken is exceptionally nice. The lady auntie is also very friendly and helpful. She even told us we can top up the soup if we finish.

It is a Zhi Char store located at the end of 1 of the coffeeshop. These 2 dishes is a must try.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117509461354450986725/reviews
Adrian Lim,5,"Bought zi char for 8 of us with almost different orders for each of us so had to wait, but was worth the wait. The hor fun has the wok hey that we love and the portions were pretty decent. Staff was friendly as well and gave you the family run business kind of vibes unlike other zi char places. Will patronize again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117826951350904805172/reviews
