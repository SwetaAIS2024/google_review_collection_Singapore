They even have an indoor sports hall so be it rain or shine, there is always ample place for children to exercise and enjoy.\n\nPersonally witnessed a few international kids who doesn't speak Chinese at all would start expressing themselves in Chinese after a few months later.  I believe that the Chinese speaking environment really helps to develop children's interest in picking up the language!",
