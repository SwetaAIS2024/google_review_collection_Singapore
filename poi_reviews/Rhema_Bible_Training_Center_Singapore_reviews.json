      "text": "This is my personal review based on what I have experienced after attending a series of modules. Firstly, I find their lessons were very helpful in my learning and understanding of the bible through the perspective of believers. Secondly, the topics and materials covered in the modules were very useful in our daily walk with God in today's world. Thirdly, the course structure offers great flexibility for individuals who wants to learn more about God and the Bible at their own pace; as many of the students are working professionals. Fourthly, the teachers and students who attended the courses with me  have been all so anointed and forthcoming. Last but not least, I received many revelations from the lessons and that really helped me out in my life. So I give it a 5 stars rating. The pics were from their open house and not the usual classroom setting.",

The word of God has become more real and I am closer in my walk with God now.\n\nVery encouraged not just by the word of God being taught but also moving in the Gifts of the Spirit in ministry.

I have what God says I have. And I can do what God says I can do through Christ. The modular courses are practical and have certainly equipped me in my Christian walk. Highly recommend the school to anyone seeking a deeper walk with Christ, to be like King David, a man or woman after Godâ€™s own heart.",

And when He rose He gave us the Holy Spirit so that we come alive in the spiritual part of us for we are spirit beings, children of God. There is nothing greater than God's love for us. Truly we are blessed to be so loved by God.",
