Eil T,5,"Dr Reginald Liew is very knowledgeable as well as patient and detailed in his explanations. He was also able to link to my other conditions (head, gastric etc. even though I hadn’t told him about them at first). I’m definitely very glad to be able to consult him. The staff at the clinic were friendly and professional in their service; one of them also gave detailed instructions (not every clinic does so) on how to take the medication. Great doc and clinic overall!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111727691108991967557/reviews
