Jez L,4,"Started with Doc Zena when we wanted to follow up for a squint of my gal. Her clinic is small but yet well equipped with the required various tech machines. Doc and her staff seem well trained in handling kids, toddlers till teens, that explains why we do need to wait longer on specific days where appointments are back to backs. Doc Zena gives good and realistic advice each time, allows the parents a good grasp of condition before taking next steps. Assistants are efficient and thus helps in the overall process.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111623614356778497628/reviews
Gareth Tham,5,"I've been coming here since I was P4 and I immensely enjoy my time here when I get my eye checkups. Dr Zena has always been very patient and caring towards me when checking my eyes. Moreover, I would like to commend the clinic staff. They are efficient and definitely get the job done, just like how I'm able to receive my new spectacles within a short amount of time. Dr Zena's clinic charges are also reasonable. Thank you Focal Eye Centre!

We have been there 4 times for Paediatric Vision evaluation of my toddler  son and our experience has been very positive. We were very pleased with the treatment plan and the outcome has been excellent.

The clinic is very child friendly and the staff is extremely patient with kids. The clinic responds to email queries for memo / documents very promptly.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103862055070506563228/reviews
