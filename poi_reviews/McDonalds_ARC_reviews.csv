Strawberry Pie,2,"Assessment:
Very easy to reach with various bus lines. Space is very good. No matter what time of day (even on weekends), there are always enough free seats. The staff is very friendly and hardworking.

Weekend Breakfast:
Free refills of coffee, tea or milk.

Disadvantage:
The coffee is almost tasteless and cold. Very poor quality. Also in a modern coffee pot that doesn't work to open.

Recommendation for breakfast: NO",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108698358209661703972/reviews
audrey,5,"Absolutely incredible service at the McDonald‚Äôs collection window! The young Indian worker (didn‚Äôt catch his name) was an absolute gem. Despite likely being exhausted, he delivered top-notch service with a warm smile and genuine care. He made our quick stop so pleasant and memorable. McDonald‚Äôs is lucky to have such a dedicated team member.. around 8:20pm++ 4th of May",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118202414105021142683/reviews
Vikas,4,"Good:

Coffee quality is not that great. It is often lukewarm. Skip this McDonald's if you want to have coffee or tea.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101905033524146898852/reviews
Low Jack,1,"Worst service here, do not select drive thru pick up from this branch. Even at 10pm, it took 10mins in queue before you can speak to the service operator.

Update: salad brought back without utensils and sauce. This reconfirm the fact that this branch is the worst.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107152384366175195091/reviews
Keng Cheong Tan,4,"Very spacious McDonalds that has many seats available especially on weekends. Quiet place for people to chitchat or get some work done. Seats are comfortable and there is Mc cafe available in the same premises for coffee and desserts. Hidden gem and quite accessible by public transport. In terms of crowd, I am sure weekdays is a different story though considering the number of offices nearby",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102762619432424724330/reviews
