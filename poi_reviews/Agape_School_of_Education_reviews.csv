Lancie,4,"I supplemented my French learning here for two years under a private tutor at the advanced level (B2~C1). It's a very unique and enriching experience that you can't get in many formal language learning institutions because they really get into not just learning the technicals of the language/rote grammar for exams but also the social, cultural perspective of it. Private lessons are very flexible/personal and student is in control of what they get from the lesson. You can tell that the teachers are very passionate and give their all into the student's learning.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118164709810475353286/reviews
nkcynthia,4,"The 1-on-1 lessons were super useful to practice french conversation and receive instant feedback, especially to fix awkward phrasing. It gave me more confidence to speak fluently to natives in France! The cultural points shared by the teacher like the Parisian bouquinistes (travelling booksellers) helped me better understand the french community. An immersive experience!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103702502809291887381/reviews
Nadiah Wieseler,5,The German Playgroup for kids taught by Teacher Anja is fantastic! She is a dedicated and creative teacher who uses fun games and individualised approaches to make learning enjoyable. The curriculum covers all important areas of language learning and Teacher Anja has a caring attitude towards her students. The kids are making real progress in their German language skills. I highly recommend the playgroup for any kids looking to learn German in an engaging and effective way.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118389952553276525131/reviews
jy Lee,5,"incroyable! Great and cozy studying environment. Had a great experience here learning French for the past 2 years after taking O levels French. I enjoyed the classes very much and have just decided to continue with Korean lessons too. 2 of my friends are also enjoying the lessons in the same class. Very glad to have chosen Agape School of Education, Singapore! Will definitely recommend this school to all my friends too!",11 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114361638380751230402/reviews
Marco Gavin,1,"As a native German Speaker, with our child having been learning German here for almost a year, I can confirm that this school isnâ€™t worth much. Kids are there not to learn to speak German but to prepare for exams. Cannot recommend this less.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110635654519853578310/reviews
