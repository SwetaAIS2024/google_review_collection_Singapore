Stephen See,5,"Did my purchase of 3 bean bags today. Was served by Daniel and Jenny, and I would say I am impressed by their professionalism and helpfulness that you can’t walk out of their shop empty-handed.
The beanbags are of good quality and comfy. Definitely would recommend them to my families or friends planning to get bean bags.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105135006355128175865/reviews

Rama Sethuraman,5,"Dropped by looking for 1 bean bag, they had many options which were so comfortable we left with 2! Very soft and good support for the neck and back.

Jay Ng,5,Bought a super comfy bean bag from Jenny. Very knowledgeable and accommodating to my fussy requests. She spent almost an hour to explain bean bags in great details no rush. Very well made with lotsa thoughts given to their design for both comfort and flexibility. That is what a bean bag should be! Love it. ⭐⭐⭐,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103167378158923796379/reviews
