It's still quite new and they're still experimenting with menu and opening hours, but flavours and ingredients are very good. Good range of saké by glass, and the set lunch is excellent value - definitely worth the small price upgrade to add various side dishes.",

      "text": "A little space at KAP with 7 seatings. Not a good dining experience as the space was v small and the other 5 patrons were being extremely noisy. The owner/ Chef were joining in the conversations which made it even noisier. The whole eating experience was also not pleasant as the owner/Chef came over a few times to ask if we wanted to add this ‘special dish’ or that ‘special dish’. Wasn’t the intimate Omakase dining experience I had in mind. The food quality was good hence the 3 stars though half the time we weren’t sure what was being served, except those ‘special items’ .",

      "text": "Unravel into the nostalgic King Albert Park Mall that brings about this lovely casual dining Japanese restaurant. Freshly minted after their move from\nJoo Chiat, Jimoto Dining offers affordable omakase dining to its patrons. Reservation was made on the day itself without much hassle.\n\nThe dinner with family were nicely ushered in by the service staff, as the restaurant was located on the upper level of the shop front. We ordered the $98 per pax omakase as recommended by the chef. We also ordered a bottle of sake for guilty pleasures during the dinner. Food were good and tasty, with a nice combination of chilled and warm Japanese cuisine.\n\nRestaurant service was alright and fluid, apart from the occasional walkie talkie communication between the lower floor and the upper floor due to the setup of the restaurant. To further note, the upper dining floor can hold only 7 patrons on each single session which is only for omakase dining. Still, the overall experience achieved were positive and given the cosy dining experience, it was appreciated that the restaurant didn’t give off that overcrowding and cramping feeling. Definitely recommended to anyone, craving good tasty Japanese food.",
