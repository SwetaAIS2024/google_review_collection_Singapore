Flo Yeow,5,"Not the best bus stops around, but it's as good as it can be, given natural constraints. As the primary public bus stop outside a hospital, I feel that they've done what they could to install a lift for the overhead bridge, sheltered walkway all through to what's possible, and having a clean bus stop, where people would transit buses to different parts of the island subsequently.

What's unfortunate is that it's still not fully weather proof, but it is what it is.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
