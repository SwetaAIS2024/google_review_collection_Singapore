Kevin Orquia,5,First time in Singapore and lucky enough to have found this local breakfast cafe. Their kaya toast was divine that we had to order twice. Coffee was also good but not outstanding. Will definitely keep on coming back here. We ordered their garlic bread too!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107528920384587500072/reviews
jingru c,5,"Their breads were all warm and crunchy, especially the loaves!

We would recommend the Kaya butter one and the egg cheese sandwich as well. The sandwich tasted homely and the eggs were fluffy.

Coffee and tea were decent!

Service staff were all friendly! Cute old school spot.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100872581967406615964/reviews
Vernon Sim,4,"Had my usual egg with cheese toast set that comes with half-boiled eggs and kopi/teh.  Bread served is fresh and hot. Their half boiled eggs are always aptly prepared,  no extra charge when you opt for Teh-C/Kopi-C, unlike places like Toastbox, Yakun.  Also,  the staff are friendly and nice.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100164627050109038435/reviews
