Glenn Thum,5,"Came here for CNY dinner and food left us impressed! The atmosphere wasn't like the typical Chinese restaurant, felt more like a coffeeshop but it was definitely cosy. But the food was delicious! Would highly recommend the kampung chicken and fried fish. Parking is quite difficult to find as the roads are really tight, you would have to try to find parking lots in the residential area around.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116677631184653136947/reviews
Denise Lee,5,Zi char dishes were generally tasty. Thai style sea bass was so worth it at $15.90! Steamed chicken was cooked well and yummy. Portions are good for the price too. Sweet and sour pork was slightly tough and more batter > meat. Not crowded on a weekday lunch.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100613858224644758681/reviews
