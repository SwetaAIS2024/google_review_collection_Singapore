However, I found the prices to be a bit high compared to other grocery stores in the area. Overall, I would recommend Cold Storages for those who prioritize organic and natural foods.",

      "text": "Bought their roasted honey chicken steaks and pork belly from their cooked food counter today. Requested that the counter staff cut the steak into 6 pieces as we are eating as finger food, he refused claiming cannot cut so small pieces , in the end he only agree to cut to 4 pieces which were quite large to serve as finger food and i had to cut again.\n\nReally wonder what's the difference in effort between 3 scissor cuts vs 5 . A few seconds more? Refuse to go the mile even when it doesnt take any extra effort. From the accent, he is obviously a Singaporean,  probably lots of job openings around.\n\nIn terms of food quality, the roasted chicken and pork belly were extremely salty , no taste of any honey sweetness, did they even bother to use any honey?",

Hanging around the stall for 15-20mins and the store manager Beth came. Let her took the order for another customer who came in later then me while I waited. She brought the customer for payment and never came back! Went to the payment counter to have someone to get her out so that I can tell her that the service at this store is unacceptable",
