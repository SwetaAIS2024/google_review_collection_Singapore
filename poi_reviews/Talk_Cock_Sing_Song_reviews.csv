Andy,5,"seen this joint around for a long time, especially if you drive.

friend jio last min and I was like okay, let's go, but abit apprehensive because I was under the impression the crowd more mature.

The Queen,1,"The passage way towards the toilet was full of smokers, despite in the building. Smokers crowding around a dustbin blowing the air out from a small window but but is really bad for non smokers when you need to use the toilet.
Sound system is good, the microphone was very compensating and catches your voice easily.
The waitress kept chasing you to drink. Had even took my beer for my friendâ€™s next table and they pour out so many glasses for nothing. Rude and no etiquette.
Avoid at all costs",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101982079102466941458/reviews
Zachary Lee,3,"Pricey for a KTV pub. $12 for a glass of coke is ridiculous. Ordered a tower of beer as well and it's obvious that it has been watered down. Basically a good place to play pool, darts and sing but you'll be sorely disappointed if you are seeking value from their beverage.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117360563654132934255/reviews
