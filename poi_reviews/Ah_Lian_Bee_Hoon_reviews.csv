Darren,4,"Mixed beehoon and noodles, with curry veges + taiwan sausage + chicken wing. Total $5.70. Noodles were great, but the beehoon was soaked in the curry gravy so I regret choosing the curry, though the curry vege itself was delicious. Sausage and chicken wing was normal. Quite overpriced I would say, and nothing outstanding.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116771157599704611382/reviews
Kathleen Gian,2,"Long hair female staff w bad n impatient attitude, not as if the stall has long queue today.  She asked if I want chilli but not clear, so I asked her to repeat n she got annoyed. Started bitching abt me w her colleague in while I was paying her. Foreign worker giving our biz environment a bad name...",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102393030120351539906/reviews
Selene Selene,1,"Food so-so. Different prices, sometimes chicken wing $1.50, then  $1.60, even $1.80. 2025 prices, within days of each other.

Absurd.

Rude service from all of them, even reminding them that food is dapao not plate, get scolded. Money thrown at you.

Even get scolding for their mistake. Tell them want chilli, they serve without. So asked for chilli, uncle angry. Auntie also. Same type.

The bullying 'service' turns your stomach.

Food not fresh. Beehoon and noodles sour.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117024332917819562322/reviews

Yang,4,"Ah Lian Bee Hoon($4.40)
A mixture of yellow noodles, bee hoon & kway teow with
- Fried Egg
- Otah
- Ngoh Hiang(Five-Spice Meat Roll)
The noodles in general were more greasy but heavier in taste. Yellow noodles were normal, bee hoon had its standard with bites of bean sprout but I find it lacks fragrance, as for kway teow, definitely the winner here among the three noodles, that slippery silky texture sinfully cover your mouth with oiliness is one not to be mess around, leaving a savoury note after each bite.üòã
Love Lian's sambal as their is spicier and wetter with bites of caramelized onion in it. Shiok.üòç
Just get kway teow and bee hoon can already.‚úåÔ∏è

2nd visit:
- Chicken Wing standard marination taste ok
- Cabbage with Dried shrimp and garlic
Still gonna conclude their stuff are oily but tasty.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103078870952547064508/reviews
