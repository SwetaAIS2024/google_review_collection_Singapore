Hax Mays,5,"It was my friend’s second visit as he loves kacang pool. I decided to get tahu goreng. At first glance, the stall’s menu is quite limited. However, I rather stalls focus on their strength instead of having many dishes but it’s not nice. Kacang pool was nice and flavourful. Spice used is slightly different but it worked for the dish. Tahu goreng here is also slightly different. Tofu is not fully fried and it’s still soft and served hot. Peanut sauce balance is just perfect. Not too spicy or sweet. I requested for more taugeh hence it looked “healthy”. Really enjoyed the light meals ordered around this stall.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115776232152336822036/reviews

Hanis Kamis,5,"I think this is my 3rd time there , if you guys are in Joo chiat complex, I recommend you to try their Kacang pool. Food proportion is just nice, taste is consistent. It's the place to go when you think of Kacang pool. Served hot with sunny side up egg, cut green chilli and french bread. Service is fast and staff is friendly.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106553553096402307861/reviews
