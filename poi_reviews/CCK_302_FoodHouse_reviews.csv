Mandy Kew,3,"Bright, spacious coffeeshop near the mrt. But the price for my ayataka green tea canned drink was ridiculously priced at $1.80☠️

Hokkien mee presentation is full marks but taste wise, it lacked wok hei. They were very generous with the ingredients even tho we ordered the small portion! Bak Chor mee tasted ok but only two meatballs…",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114457542148874180412/reviews

Soh Xuan Yi,5,"The noodle stall is something else. It's $5 and total worth it. The chilli has a unique taste to it. I would come back to eat again soon.
