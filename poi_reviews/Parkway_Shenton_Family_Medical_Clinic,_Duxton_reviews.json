The doctor (Mr Phua) is really nice and takes thorough time to discuss with patients, but the young receptionist at the clinic is very rude and disorganized - she is friendly to select group of people and rude to rest. She gave me appointment, called me to come earlier if possible and then I ended up waiting for 1hr+.",

Despite my repeated inquiries, she refused to assist by checking with the doctor, citing that she was “very busy now.” This lack of basic courtesy and professionalism is unacceptable, especially in a healthcare setting where patients rely on staff for clear information and support.\n\nThe clinic should prioritize training its front-line staff to provide better service and ensure patients feel valued, not dismissed.",
