I became emotional towards the end and was deeply embarrassed but extremely grateful for his kind and patient manner in handling the account closure.\n\nI also wish to express my thanks to the very cheerful staff on duty outside ( short hair with spectacles and a very big smile ) whom I didn’t get the name .",

      "text": "This 5 star review of POSB Square 2 Branch is a result of a POSB staff, Nix Liang's customer focussed performance, work attitude, problem solving abilities and professionalism.\n\nI had the pleasure of having Nix look after a rather complex transaction from overseas. Instead of shunning the difficulties in balancing the need to carry out his responsibilities as a prudent bank officer against completing my instructions, he clearly communicated what needs to be done on my end to enable him to carry out my request.\n\nNix's level of service closely approaches that of a 'private banker' based on my experience with him and I hope that POSB management recognizes his strengths.\n\nThanks Nix and thanks to your direct report/s who helped you with my transaction.",

She is arrogant, unprofessional and answer my question reluctantly! You don’t even have to greet me. Just don’t be rude and arrogant.\nAs a foreigner, I felt very disappointed with this kind of service. I paid $60 for 3 print out paper and still get this kind of service?!\nI think POSB has to train the staff more properly. This kind of staff is shame on your bank!",
