Pesto sauce is made in-house; and taste really fresh and nice!\n\nToday is my second visit, pesto chicken didn‚Äôt taste as good (not sure why, could be due to different batches of basil); and tried their mentai scallop pasta. Am amazed with the balance taste of the pasta, and didn‚Äôt get sick and tried when completing the plate of pasta. We finished off with a salted caramel coffee cake, and are surprised with the quality for the price it is at.\n\nIn all, would recommend others to here.",
