CK C,3,"This drinking place is quite large, consisting of the bar, sofas, high chairs and even two VIP rooms. Draft Sapporo (both lager and dark) was $6 for half pint and $11 for full pint, excluding service charge, during Happy Hour (11am-8pm). Very quiet, perfect for chilling on your own or chatting with friends. It doesnâ€™t sell food but I think you can buy them from the supermarket Eccellente.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Founder Media,4,"Wine Mansion a new quiet and huge seating space bar is opened up in a new commercial space beside The Centrepoint Mall. Spoke to the staff and understand they opened it 3 weeks ago. Got a good collection of wines for either to drink or buy for take away. Staff is very friendly and now Monkey Shoulders promotion is going on, where you need a scan a code and get 2 pegs of whiskey for free. Tried another mixed fruit with cranberry juice cocktail and taste was good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110334546460694982273/reviews
Ray Tan,4,Nice bar concept inside Hao mart. Similar to the Grocer bar inside some of the large NTUC fairprice. Serve a variety of liquors and draft beer as well. Not as cheap as NTUC but still acceptable,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118226053308108066808/reviews

Gargleblaster,5,The chap serving the place is five stars. Makes you feel comfortable and obliges all sorts of questions. The happy hour prices are very decent.
