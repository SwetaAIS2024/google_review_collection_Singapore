Andy Yxyz,4,"Chanced upon this restaurant to accommodate my children's schedule. Ordered the set comprising A5 Wagyu Beef & Black Pork at about S$249.90 for 4 paxs. The set comes with A5 Wagyu Ribeye, Wagyu Striploin, Pork Belly and Pork Collar. The steamed egg was also in the package. I found it strange why they asked how we wanted the meat to be cooked.

Alas, they served the whole package cooked to the doneness you wanted. The meat was of top quality. Each bite was met with succulent tender flesh fused with natural juices. The beef was top-notched and closed to perfection except it was not enough (and too delicious). Condiments such as kimchi and  was free flow. The lettuces were fresh (need to drain off the water).

We also ordered the cold noodles and bibimbap. All I can say is that you will not be disappointed. We spent about S$354.54 in total",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104762562539715536062/reviews
Cheryl,5,"Celebrated my birthday here and the staff were extremely attentive, from taking time to explain the free flow sides to each dish that came by and even helping my family and i take pictures and also clearing the table and bringing new plates and utensils for the cake. Special mention to Ryan who was extremely patient and made the celebration such an enjoyable one. Not to mention the food is great and we finished most of it and everyone sang praises! Highly recommended and encourage you to make a revelation before arriving, already looking forward to patronising again",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115062027100223341537/reviews
Liwei Chiang,5,"We like this place a lot. Although a bit pricey but it’s worthwhile for service and food. Staff was friendly. When we pointed out the chair was not clean, he immediately wipe it clean and apologised +++. Foods were served very promptly and equality reaching our expectation. Meats were all tender and tasty. Soup was flavourful. We will come back again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110831823629358579813/reviews
Kelley Lim,5,"A rare gem for authentic Korean cuisine! We brought our kids and ordered several dishes—surprisingly, every dish was equally delicious. The army stew was a hit with the little ones; it wasn’t overly spicy and came loaded with ham, luncheon meat, Korean rice cakes, noodles, and sausages—perfect for meat lovers. The cold noodle soup with beef was tangy and chewy, leaving the kids wanting more. The BBQ pork belly was another standout, with generous servings of lettuce, garlic, and chili paste—so good that even my pork-averse daughter kept asking for more. While the steamed egg was average, the free iced water and unlimited side dishes (especially kimchi!) were a big plus. Cleanliness was top-notch, and even the kimchi was neatly arranged—kudos to the chef! Hoping they’ll add iced buckwheat tea in the future to complement their BBQ.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106772937498732776624/reviews
