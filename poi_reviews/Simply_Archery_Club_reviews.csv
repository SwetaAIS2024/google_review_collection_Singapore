Shzrl,5,"Had a private event for kids held here during the school holidays.

The staff there were very welcoming. The coach was patient teaching the ways of archery. He even planned out 3 different archery activities to allow the kids hone their archery skills further.

Facility was sheltered & there was water cooler to rehydrate as well.

Thank you for the well-planned activity & kudos to the staff & coach for facilitating the event for us. üëçüèº",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101271227294867994383/reviews
