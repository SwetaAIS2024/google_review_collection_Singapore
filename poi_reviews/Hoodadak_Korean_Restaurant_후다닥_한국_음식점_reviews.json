Prices are reasonable for the amount you get. You know the food is authentic and good when majority of customers on a weekend are koreans :)\n\nThey provide homemade side dishes but you are only allowed to refill it for free one time! Free ice water as well.",

The soup was very hearty, ordered one pork soup and the other one I forgot which one. The BBQ pork belly was nice but for the price point it was a small portion. Guess come for the soup on a rainy day.",
