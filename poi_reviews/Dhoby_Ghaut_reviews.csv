Soo Hin Yeoh,5,"Located at the convergence of 3 MRT lines, you most probably get to anywhere in Singapore from here. It is connected directly to Plaza Singapura and Atrium @Orchad.

I have to say the signage and directions are a little complicated for those who are not great at reading maps.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115725392210756907778/reviews

Flo Yeow,4,"Probably one of the more confusing MRT interchanges in Singapore, and one of the more crowded ones. Given the many MRT lines that runs through here, you also get a wide range of people passing through, which sometimes can add to the confusion, especially on weekends.

That all said, it's clean, systematic, and connects to Plaza Singapura and the nearby malls. There are a lot of good options for a lot of things: shopping, dining, entertainment, etc.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
