The birds are tied by a short metal string on a metal bar. They can barely move. They are both showing an intense behavorial disorder and are loudly crying for help.\nI would never buy anything from these animal abusers. This shop should be cancelled or reported to the police immediately if nothing changes for the birds.\nGreetings from Emily, I hope you passed on my complaint to the shop owner.",

      "text": "Walking past this shop makes me fuming mad. It is raining and the poor bird was outdoor struggling and trying to bite off the metal chain that was chained to its legs. It goes to show how badly it has been treated and it can’t wait to break free. Owner’s response to other reviewers: “it is important to get natural and full spectrum of sunlight.” Yes it is important, but not the whole day????? You do know weather is so hot lately right? I could barely stand in the heat for 5 mins, and yet the bird has been out the whole time. If it is essential, maybe the owner shouldn’t sit inside the aircon room. Come on and work outdoors with the poor birds to get the natural and full spectrum sunlight (or rain) as you have mentioned.",

Mr Kan & Cola are very friendly and always ready to help lots of positivity and energy whenever i visit the shop. I started off with my first jadeite pendant. After wearing it can see some changes and improvement on luck even strike 4D twice last year. Just early this year got my second item sandalwood and also review of our annual fengshui. So far so good, things has been rather smooth sailing. Hopefully more people can benefit from it!",
