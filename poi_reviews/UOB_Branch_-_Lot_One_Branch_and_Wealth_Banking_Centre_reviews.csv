Andy 1888,2,Today afternoon just collect this card at lot one and the Malay lady staff attitude towards customer is not very good. I do not know this card need to stamp on every chop there and never explain properly. I have received a ball and the staff open it and never explain what thing I get. Anyway a very good experience at lot one uob. No wonder all the reviews at this outlet so bad.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104595916678881733731/reviews
Jackie Pangyarihan,5,I would like to express my gratitude to May Ng from the Lot 1 branch for being incredibly helpful and accommodating. Thank you for assisting in processing my excess payment after several months of back-and-forth with customer service. Your support is truly appreciated!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111651999476948409746/reviews
Tze Hui Low,1,"I really think UOB should station mortgage specialists at each branch. None of the staff could offer any advice about my partial prepayment for my mortgage loan and while I contacted the mortgage specialist a few days prior, I still had issues with filling up the form. On 11 Dec, I actually made 2 trips to UOB, just to correct the form. To top things off, I received a text message saying my application for partial prepayment of my loan was rejected due to a signature irregularity a day later. This means I have to make yet another trip to get things sorted. This is really very poor service on the part of UOB and I'm appalled by such standards. I will probably not take up any loans of any nature with them. I have been asking to meet or speak face to face with mortgage specialists for the past year as well, but was told they are 'backend staff' and that these 'specialists' will contact me. Yet, when I signed a housing loan with them, they were willing to meet up with me. A housing loan is no small sum and to be cast aside as a customer after the the deal is done leaves a bad aftertaste.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104035739123811637790/reviews
cupcake frosting,1,Horrible experiences at this branch. Waited close to 2 hours for a counter service on a weekday afternoon previously. Thought it was a one off incident. Seems like it's the norm. Went back again today to settle some admin matters. Was led through a few counters with the staff not knowing what to do at times. Avoid this branch.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107891843185666139941/reviews
