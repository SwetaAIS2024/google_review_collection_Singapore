Jessica Tong,5,"This place is so underrated!! We unintentionally passed by this stall because we grew incredibly hungry after shopping for 5 hours. Ended up ordering a combo roast duck and roast pork plate that comes with duck soup. YUM. The roast pork skin has a nice crisp to it and the duck was not super dry. The rice was such a nice complement to the roast meats, and the soup was tasty. I love me a good soup, even if it does come free with an entree.

Highly recommend if youâ€™re in the area.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108595599297352285374/reviews
Chun Teck Ong,2,"Have tried it before and not satisfied with the service and the attitude of the servers and cooks.  Felt they were not interested in the quality of the food and the servings.

Read more positive and decided to give it another try.

Certainly did not disappoint with the poor quality of the roast duck, char siew and roast pork.  Bony, chewy and texture felt as they have been left for long time with the oil already coagulating in the meat.  It tasted very gamey too.

Won't recommend this to anyone.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112866775739021960363/reviews

Simon Y,4,"Surprisingly good wanton noodle. The noodle is thinner than usual but very well cooked and tasteful for the dry version, the char siew are hk style which was thick cut and tender even though lacking char. Would have been a 5 stars bowl of noodle if not for their run of the mill wontons.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110316451866688483932/reviews
