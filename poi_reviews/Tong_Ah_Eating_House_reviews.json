The only thing that I found the best out of what we ordered was the Kailan. Also do note, they charge $0.40 per plastic container for dabao, so we got the plastic bag option instead",

      "text": "Some of the best breakfast I've had in Singapore. They specialize in kaya toast and we pretty much sampled almost every kind they offered. My favorite was definitely the ultra thing kaya toast, where they take one slice of bread, slice it in half so you have two super thin slices of bread, toasts it and then fill it with kaya and butter. And they do it twice, so you essentially get two sandwiches from two slices of bread. The crisp and char paired with the kaya and butter were absolutely divine. Their kopi was also delicious; strong and fragrant. We opted to have the french toast kaya toast at the end and while it's quite the novelty, it's probably not something I'd get again. I would stick with the thin kaya toast :)",

Coffee extraordinarily average. Cold 3/4  boiled eggs was a cold put off.\n\nThe dry throat after effect lasted 4 hours, with lotsa gas forming in stomach - from the eggs and kaya....\n\nSaw many foreign patrons and feel very sorry their experience of a local breakfast will be framed around this joint.\n\nConclusion - WAPO has a very very very low hurdle rate......",
