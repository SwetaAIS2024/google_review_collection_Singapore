Beatrice Ong,5,"Dr Tay is a knowledgeable surgeon who takes immense pride in his craft. As a young patient handling a cancer diagnosis, he has shown an incredible amount of empathy, gently guiding me on my recovery journey. It sometimes feels like he’s not just my doctor, but also my therapist! He cares for his patients beyond what is required of a medical professional, and truly exemplifies the qualities of a doctor. I feel cared for and comforted in his presence and under the care of his team. For anyone else going through gynecological issues, I would highly recommend him.

Front desk staff are also great, and shout-out to Dr Tay’s sister who takes great care of us patients!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104002813828071303819/reviews
LHL,5,"I have been under Dr Tay’s care for the past 2 years ever since my cancer diagnosis. I have to say that Dr Tay is an outstanding doctor and came highly recommended by many other medical experts and I can see why! From our very first interaction, he gave me and my family a very reassuring and calming presence and has really come to be someone we are so thankful for. Even though I ended up going to another oncology clinic (as my cancer isn’t a gynae cancer), I still chose to continue with Dr Tay as my gynae surgeon because I knew I’d be in the best hands. Beyond just being a super skilled and cautious surgeon, he has also been very encouraging and his EQ is really good which is appreciated too.

I am surprised by some of the negative reviews because their experience seems completely the opposite of what I’ve encountered. I would never hesitate to recommend Dr Tay to friends who need a gynae opinion. Although the waiting time can be a little long, it is really nothing in comparison to the level of care from Dr Tay. I’ve always felt I could speak freely/ask all the questions I had without feeling like he was rushing for time which is very crucial for patients!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116723119253898366977/reviews

bryan tan,5,"Accompanied my wife for a follow-up check up recently. I was impressed by the number of cards and plaques Dr Tay received from his patients.

Although I didnt receive any treatment from him, but a short conversation with him let me know that he is indeed the man the cards and plaques have stated. Patient, knowledgeable, explaining complex and difficult terminologies in a simpler manner for patients to understand. He’s definitely a gem.

Please do not let these naysayers of 1 star reviews deter you.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104632911289360286356/reviews
Ysabel Teo,5,"I am writing a review to refute the unjust (bad) reviews on Dr. Tay.
If you are considering seeing him, I hope you'll give my review a read.

Dr. Tay started off as a second opinion and has been the only gynae that I visit ever since. Since 8 years ago, he has been the same reliable doctor with the same exceptional professionalism.

When I had cysts in my early 20s, he told my mother that he will not operate on me unless absolutely necessary as I was young and he did not want to lower my immunity as a result. He advised me to seek TCM treatment first and he was right. After 2 weeks of TCM medication, I went back to Dr. Tay for an ultrasound and saw for myself that my cysts were gone.

A few years later I went back with new symptoms, which he based on to check for signs of HPV. A responsible doctor never makes a diagnosis without getting the facts right, so I don't get the bad review of him asking to do tests and scans because how else can a doctor accurately diagnose a patient?

True enough with his expertise and wisdom, it was HPV and I got treated immediately. Due to my own negligence (going back to work immediately after the day surgery, which Dr. Tay had strongly advised against), I triggered an infection and went to A&E past midnight. Despite so, he picked up my call and calmly advised me accordingly.

Recently I went back for a follow-up check and was given the clear that my womb is happy and healthy. He told me there was no need to see him for another year (again, it's not about the money for him)

He is always calm and collected, with a sense of humor, able to explain complex conditions in layman terms, and gives very clear instructions.

He has 5 (or more) staff working for him and yet you will never see any of them sitting around doing nothing. This just goes to show how busy of a man he is, and YES he does perform surgical procedures hence the emergency cases.

It seems he puts his meals on hold every day for his patients. Once I heard his staff say he's not had his lunch yet, another time when my mom asked him if he's had his meal he said they're people waiting for him so he can't do that right now and another was when I asked him myself. All 3 occasions were past 2 to 3pm.

Please do not believe any bad reviews you see of Dr. Tay.
Just let the mountain of thank you cards at his clinic do the talking.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101608550260815149937/reviews
