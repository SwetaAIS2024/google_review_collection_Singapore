Hassan,1,"One time I bought chips and they were stale. Lady behind the counter was chill.

One star. Stale chips are unacceptable! I was craving it and I bought a big bag. Money wasted.

Not sure about other items though.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101931557610076859635/reviews
