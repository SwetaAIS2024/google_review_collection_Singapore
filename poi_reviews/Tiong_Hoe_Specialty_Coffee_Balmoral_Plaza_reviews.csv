Alan Wong,2,"Had coffee on national day. Didn't know the 1-for-1 national day offer/conditions but staff didn't mention too. Filtered coffees served on takeaway paper cups despite stating having coffees in. Of the two coffees we had, one was diluted and had none of the remaining taste notes. I learned later that there was no more beans for this coffee. Overall experience was one feeling cheated, not the same as previous experiences at Mei Ling St or Vivo branches.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107323655083143287808/reviews
