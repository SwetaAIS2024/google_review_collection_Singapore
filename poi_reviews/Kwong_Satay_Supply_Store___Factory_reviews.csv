Stephen Seah,1,"Ordered so many times and this time is horribly disappointed. Ordered 300 sticks for 3 families because we love the satay and just a simple request to split the gravy to 3 pack but was rejected reason being saving the environment for reduce plastic bag. However, asked me to cancel order and split the order to 3 different orders so each order have their own gravy, make no sense to waste paper to print additional invoice and make additional orders. They rather want me to cancel order and reorder again and not wanting the split the gravy for my current order. Seriously disappointed by the operator, hope that they can be more flexible else when people want to make group purchases have to order one by one which is not an ideal way of doing business.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116047693247404868576/reviews
steven lim,4,"The building did a groupbuy and we ordered chicken and pork satay, which came frozen.  Once grilled in the oven, the meats were pretty tasty, especially with cucumbers, onions and ketupat.  They even provided a small pack of pineapple sauce.  The satay sauce, which nice, was not in sealed packets but were rather kept in plastic bags.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117434407303387249783/reviews
Lionel Lim,4,"Good price point and delicious satay especially the mutton and pork. Our choice of satay provider whenever we have BBQ at home. Their ketupat is good too, goes very well with the satay and sauce. The highlight is that they provide pineapple sauce with the satay sauce, this helps to cleanse the oil associated with BBQ.

Highly recommend for anyone looking for nice and affordable satay. The portal to order is easy to use and staff are prompt to response to your order.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109827044039049751842/reviews
JOcean,4,"Easy collection of satay here. The staffs are friendly. Satay is tasty, otah is better than average. Only drawback is that the Satay sauce/gravy is too watery.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108329577068431544730/reviews
Wee nee Tan,4,Chicken and mutton satay is well marinated and taste awesome but the satay gravy is too diluted. I opt for self collection. Friendly staff but driver is kinda rude. Payment can be done in cash or paynow. Overall experience is good.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108821061365109004896/reviews
