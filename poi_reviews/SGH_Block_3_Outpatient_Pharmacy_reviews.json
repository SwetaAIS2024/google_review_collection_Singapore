This is really unexpectable and there were only 10 people ahead of me in the queue. The management of the pharmacy should look into this matter. Moreover I saw the backend dispensing staff member chating with laughter and we have to wait 30 minutes to collect medicine!",

Is it reasonable to expect customers to monitor online platforms continuously, around the clock? This appears to be impractical.\n\nFurthermore, attempts to contact via phone resulted in a wait time exceeding 10 minutes, with no response. Does this reflect the standard of best healthcare services? This level of service falls significantly below expectations and may constitute a breach of contractual obligations.",

The call was quickly picked up by Melina, after checking, I realised that the medicine was prescibed by Outram Polyclinics, not SGH. However, Melina was still very kind to assist to check on the medicine instead of making me call Outram Poly. Thank you very much for the assistance.",
