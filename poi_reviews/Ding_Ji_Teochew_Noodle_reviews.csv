Geraldine Teo,2,Food is not bad but the lady staff on duty on Vesak Day morning was SO RUDE. She was on the phone and was so rude when I came to ordered. Didnâ€™t bother looking at me and taking my order and started cooking. I had to repeat my order a few times before she finally looked at me. She finally looked up at me when I was trying to pay and I had to call her 3 times before she responded.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115893362752161122303/reviews
"Yong Hui, Ronny Tan",4,"There seems to be 2 competing Ding Ji franchisees at the 2 coffeeshops (Blk 280 and 284).

The two stalls seems to sell different signature dishes (fishmaw noodles vs Chilli Banmian), although their base dishes (fishball noodles) are the same.

But this coffeeshop is hotter due to the lower ceiling.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112103854866816776797/reviews
Christopher Keen Fei,1,"Very unhappy, both lady staff was very rude. Asked for a bit more vinegar but gave excuse that they running out of it. Just read the others poor & bad reviews, found that these noodle stores mostly have very bad attitude staffs. The boss should get rid of such employees. Will definitely affect their business. For that, I will never eat their noodles ever again ! ðŸ˜¤",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100291456292015448009/reviews
Cedric Seet,1,"Very average bowl of noodles, honestly it depends on whoâ€™s cooking but recently the standard has dropped tremendously. Portions are small too. Soup has lost its original touch becoming bland

Update: ordered their dumpling soup for $4, which was supposed to contain 5 pieces, I asked if I was able to add dumplings at additional cost, they told me itâ€™s $1.50 for 2 more pieces. Which would bring it to 7. When they were cooking mine I asked again if they had added the additional pieces, they said yeah. To my dismay when I dapaoed it home, it only had 5 pieces again at $5.90. Dishonest and disgraceful really. Yucks boycotting it forever.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116120424406667932678/reviews
Tan Chee,5,"Their signature noodle is always my favourite. $5.30 and noodle comes with one fish ball, one meat ball, one wanton dumpling, minced meat, slice meat (about 3-4pcs), pork liver (about 3pcs) and one egg!! If you are craving for a bowl of hot noodle and nice soup, I would strongly recommend this stall. :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109929201530959294598/reviews
