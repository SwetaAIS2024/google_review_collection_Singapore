      "text": "Very affordable good food here along with drinks. I got the chicken cheese baked rice which is served with only multigrain brown rice, no white rice. To my surprise it was not dry, it was quite tasty with the whole top covered in baked cheese and underneath, a creamy sauce on the large chunks of chicken. Very worth the price for $6-7! However, did not get the drinks because they were way more expensive than normal drink stores (ice milo here is $2.60 compared to $1.50 elsewhere). The place is nice to sit at, it’s indoors and has aircon. The staff was not very nice, she seemed very occupied, didn’t really care about the customer and was rude to me when I asked if the bake rice could be in white rice instead of multigrain. After payment she simply tossed the receipt at me.",

The eggs are usually slightly underdone for my liking, though. The fried rice is pretty good too, with nice wok hey, I just wish brown rice was an option rather than the default.",
