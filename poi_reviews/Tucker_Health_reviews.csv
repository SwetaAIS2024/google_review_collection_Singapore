Keith Mernovage,5,"I've been using Tucker Health and Medical for my primary care and other issues where I've needed to see a specialist.  Since the beginning, they have been caring, compassionate and extraordinarily competent.  Without question this is easily the best medical practice that I have ever been to.  When friends back in the US tell me they are sick or have some kind of health issue, I half jokingly tell them they should come over for a visit and to make appointments with my doctors while they are here.  Dr. Tucker has really built a world class health care organization and the doctors and professionals working for him are absolutely amazing.  Thank you again for all that you all have done for me and my family!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100906881905548266026/reviews
Courtney Haley,5,"I have been seeing Dr. Sak for nearly a year now and I am so impressed with her and the service the staff gives. The staff is always prompt, courteous and professional. E-mails or phone call/messages seem to be answered within minutes if not a few hours! I have not had any trouble with direct billing in this office, as I see another patron had.  Dr. Sak is so genuine, seems to really care, and takes her time to explain everything thoroughly. I have never had a doctor quite like her! I feel confident in my health with Tucker Medical.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100158744057310753827/reviews
