Sam,5,"We are so impressed to see how well our child has blossomed in many ways—building confidence, developing social skills, cultivating an interest in art. All this couldn’t be done without the care, dedication and passion of the nicest teachers and staff at MFS at Blk 166.

The communication with us is also fantastic, ensuring we always feel involved in our child’s journey.

Thank you to all the teachers and staff at MFS at Blk 166 for your patience, kindness, creativity and making a positive impact on our child’s early years. We cannot thank you enough for everything you do!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112328787996810918517/reviews
