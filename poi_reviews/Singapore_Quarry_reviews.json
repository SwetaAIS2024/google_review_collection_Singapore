      "text": "Singapore Quarry is a tranquil nature spot tucked away at the edge of Dairy Farm Nature Park. Once an active granite quarry, it has since been transformed into a peaceful wetland habitat under the care of NParks, now home to freshwater flora and fauna, as well as occasional birdlife. The site reflects Singapore‚Äôs broader efforts to repurpose industrial spaces into green recreational areas.\n\nIt‚Äôs a pleasant and easy 2km walk from Dairy Farm Nature Park Car Park B, with paved trails leading through quiet forested surroundings. The quarry itself features steep rock faces, calm waters, and a sheltered viewing deck ‚Äî a great place to sit and take in the scenery. I‚Äôd rate it a 4 out of 5 ‚Äî quiet, accessible, and a rewarding slice of nature with a touch of history.",

Here, you can spot eagles, kingfishers and monitor lizards at times.\n\n‚û°Ô∏è There are an increasing bunch of macaques' ( monkey) presence. You need to be careful and not feed them, they can be aggressive. üü¢ Do not look at the animals ( monkeys etc) in the eyes for they will perceive it as a challenge.\n\n‚ú≥Ô∏è Overall, it is a nice park. ‚ú®Ô∏èüôèüèª It can be quiet at times, so do go with a companion.",

      "text": "Beautiful area, gets crowded on weekend mornings with nature photographers and bird watchers. If you are coming from the Rail Corridor there is a shortcut with a sign Singapore Quarry pointing up some steps and a bridge. This bridge leads to a narrow dirtpath which will bring you to the large concrete path to Singapore Quarry. Seems to be a much quicker route than walking from Hillview MRT.\n\nIf you liked this view I highly recommend Little Guilin, similar views but more quiet, and less of a walk to get to the quarry",
