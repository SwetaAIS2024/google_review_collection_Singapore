The potato pancake tasted like hash brown but way better than that. The beef rendang (I guess it's rendang), tasted so fresh & savoury. And I think the  sausages were home made, since it tasted dissimilar to normal processed-beef sausages available in the market and it was great though!\n\nI had this 10am today, and until now (6pm, while waiting for my return flight to KL), I am still full!",

Not that amazing but it was great.\n\nA bit pricey given that the other 2 halal stalls in this shopping mall is rather affordable.\n\nWhile I did enjoy my food, I’m quite confused with the concept that they’re trying to let the customers immerse in.\n\nNot sure if I’m in a very hip and cool cafe w the kind of interior they have cos it’s quite all over the place.\n\nWould come back if given the chance.",

      "text": "This cafe is found within an old shopping centre called Golden Landmark Shopping centre. A Muslim owned cafe which THis up really delicious and some not so commonly found dishes.\n\nYou find a seat across from the cafe counter and order at the counter quoting your table number. We came on a Saturday morning and nearly every table was occupied.\n\nWe tried their rosti which was well know in this place. There is a variety of additions you can add to the rosti including egg, mushrooms, chicken, salmon or beef. We chose to add the pulled beef. It was simply and yummy. Not too heavy compared to how some rosti can be. We also orders kacang phool. This came with crusty bread which you can use to dip. Highly recommend this dish. And if that is not enough, we also ordered their roti John to go. One of the best roti John. We can add cheese or deng deng to it. The deng deng roti John was really good.\n\nWould definitely come back to this cafe to try the other dishes.",
