Dr Nah and all his staff were professional, warm and helpful throughout the experience, and the results speak for itself. My eyes have recovered extremely well, and I owe them all a great deal of gratitude for it. Trips to their clinic at Suntec were always quick and efficient, overall a superb experience.",

I tend to get very nervous when something touches my eye, but staff was very friendly and assured me lots with the whole procedure - pre surg, surg and post surg consultation. The staff for the surgery even let me hold a stress ball and her hand during the surgery because of how nervous/anxious I was ðŸ˜…. My vision is perfect now, thank you Dr. Nah and team!",
