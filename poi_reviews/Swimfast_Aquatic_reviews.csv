Juan Jesus Villa,5,"We visited Swim Fast to observe how they teach and train children in swimming, and we were very impressed. They offer well-structured programs for kids from age 5 all the way to 17, with professional and experienced coaches leading the sessions. The coaching staff is highly skilled, and you can see their dedication to helping each child improve, whether they’re just starting out or already competing. It’s a great place for young swimmers to build confidence and develop their skills in a supportive environment. Highly recommend Swim Fast for anyone looking for top-notch swim training for their children!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103969177165373896286/reviews
Eva Liu,5,"My daughter has been with the club for 2 years and she has thoroughly enjoyed her time here. From knowing only freestyle to mastering all 4 strokes (and fell in love with butterfly), she has grown into a passionate competitive swimmer who is determined to keep swimming as her main hobby. We are very grateful for the support from all SAC coaches, and especially for Coach Wei who has provided such a fun, positive and displined environment for young swimmers to thrive. Coach Wei's weekly group stroke correct sessions are very effective in setting up the foundation of swimming techniques.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112060127209996996498/reviews

Eleanor Tan,5,"We started our junior squad journey when our daughter turned 7. From being fearful of the massive 50m pool, fear of the height of the starting block, fear of crowds at competitions… in the past 14 months, she’s overcome every single one of her fears at every step of her journey with the help of junior coaches’ dedication and focus on bringing the children to their personal next level. Our daughter’s done 6 junior competitions to date. We’re extremely thankful for the Swimfast community!
Coach Dean’s energetic & engaging  complimented by Coach Bryan’s calm instructions. The coaches maximise the time allocated.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102408342103311469601/reviews
Yusti Suhendy,5,"My daughter age 15 is a competitive swimmer from Indonesia. She trained with coach Melvin during our 1 week stay in Singapore. He was very attentive and showed great care to her, both complimenting and correcting bad habits and flaws in her strokes. My daughter loved his class and was always happy to attend his sessions.

I appreciate very much all his coaching and guidance and I would highly recommend Swimfast and coach Melvin!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104702336729512470486/reviews
