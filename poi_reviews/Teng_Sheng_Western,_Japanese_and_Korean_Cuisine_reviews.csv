Shimmy Ng,5,"Big cut of chicken chop that was nicely seasoned. Meat is juicy and flavourful with nicely charred skin.

Mash was flavourful as well. Fries were a tad stale as food had been tabao-ed, but was nicely salted taste-wise.

Also came with corn/ lettuce + sauces that were separately packed.

$6.80 for dine-in, $7.10 for take-away

Tsoi Ka Man,5,"Standard foodcourt setting.  I was just craving for some western food and came across this stall.
Ordered chicken chop @$6.80.
While waiting for my food, saw the review that was so bad and started to worry.
Honestly, I only waited within 5 mins.
The chicken is tender and the fries is just freshly fried.
A thumbs up for you‚ù§Ô∏èüí™üèº",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117045794841364142795/reviews
