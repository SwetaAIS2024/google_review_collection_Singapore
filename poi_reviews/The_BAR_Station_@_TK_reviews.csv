Daniel Koay (DanKo83),5,"If you're a fan of Greek cuisine, this is definitely the place go. I ordered the Lamb Kleftiko and I'm hooked. The sweet and sour stew coupled perfectly with the cheese+garlic bread combo. Had to mop every bit of the stew. The lamb is cooked to perfection, soft and tender. Every bite promises a burst of flavour in your mouth. Definitely a plus to chase away the Monday blues! Will return again to savour the Greek spread.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106035529528983278874/reviews
