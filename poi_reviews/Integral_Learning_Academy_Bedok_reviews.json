      "text": "joined Integral during my J1 year, Ms Yew really helped me to find interest in H2 Math with vigorous practices targeted at specific topics every week! She was truly a very accommodating teacher that displayed her passion for wanting her students to do their best and thoroughly understand their concepts well. With an abundant of questions given to try and send to be marked, concepts were quickly grasped and misconceptions were quickly rectified. Highly recommend this to any J1 looking to ace their A Levels :))",

She always aims to cover the topics before school does so that we have a better understanding before learning it in school. The small class size also makes it more conducive for learning.

My tutor, Mr Clarence, was very helpful and gave detailed explanations to all of the problems. The learning materials are more challenging than those provided in school, which is great as it helps with preparation and really comprehending all the concepts and skills. Because of this tuition class I scored A1 for both my WA2 and prelims. I finished my A Math O lvl exam with confidence thanks to the help and support of my tutor. Highly recommended to anyone looking to get better A math grades and simultaneously develop genuine interest in the subject.",
