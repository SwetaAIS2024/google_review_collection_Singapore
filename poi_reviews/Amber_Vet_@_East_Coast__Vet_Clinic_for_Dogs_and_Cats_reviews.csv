Kelvin Kelvin,5,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I brought my rabbit to AmberVet due to a loss of appetite and had a great experience. Booking an appointment was smooth, and the process was very efficient. The vet was knowledgeable and thorough in her check-up, ensuring there was nothing serious. She explained that the recent weather changes might be affecting my rabbit’s appetite and provided helpful supplements. She also advised me on keeping my rabbit’s environment cool and comfortable. Overall, she was very accommodating and made sure my rabbit got the best care. Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117890236689425486583/reviews
Sean Nicholson,5,"We moved to the east coast 2 years ago and as a result needed to find a new vet for our two dogs; we are so lucky to have easy access to Amber Vet for their care.

Dr Sharon and the team are always super friendly and the 2 pups are always excited to see them and have little concerns for the nail clippings (which has always been an issue for these sensitive souls)",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116039707558825033813/reviews
Ee Jean Teo,5,"We have been going to Amber Vet from the time we got Toby, our little lowchen. He is now close to 3 :) he enjoys the calm environment of the clinic and never hesitates to get right in. Dr Loon is attentive and kind, and genuinely cares for the patient. He gives the right amount of time and gives us good advice on how to care for Tobs. We love our experience with him and Dr Sharon too!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113082216610559121097/reviews
subi le,5,"The vet and staff are super friendly and really pay attention to the animals. They genuinely care and take their time with each patient. It’s usually not too busy on weekdays, so the whole experience feels calm and stress-free for my dog. Plus, the staff helped with giving medications, which was a huge help! Also there are a few pet friendly cafes nearby.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100734616064605444740/reviews
Vania Tan,5,"We can’t thank the amazing team at Amber Vet enough — especially Dr. Brian Loon — for the exceptional care they’ve provided for our newly adopted 8-year-old Maltese.

From our first visit a couple of weeks ago, we were genuinely impressed by the thorough and comprehensive health check the team conducted. We had requested a full assessment for our senior dog, and what we received went far beyond our expectations. The level of detail and the range of investigations performed gave us peace of mind and helped us avoid potential health complications down the line — because truly, prevention is better (and more affordable) than cure.

As a family that has adopted and fostered many dogs over the years, we’ve been to numerous vets — but none have matched Amber Vet’s advanced medical setup. It’s almost like a mini hospital for pets, which means we don’t have to travel between different clinics for diagnostics or procedures. It’s all available in-house, which is incredibly convenient and reassuring.

During the initial check-up, our dog presented with a heart murmur, and we were promptly scheduled for a heart ultrasound right there at the clinic. After assessment, medication was prescribed to manage the heart condition — all explained clearly and with such care.

Today, our dog underwent teeth extraction, dental cleaning, and a lump removal under general anaesthesia. The team kept us updated throughout the day with calls and WhatsApp messages, which we truly appreciated — it helped ease our anxiety and showed how much they care.

The clinic is also immaculately clean, and we love that there’s a separate unit for cats, which helps reduce stress for both feline and canine patients. We also learned so much about preventive care and the latest in pet healthcare — insights we hadn’t come across in our visits to other clinics.

Another thoughtful touch: invoices are sent via email, along with detailed notes from the vet summarising the visit and sharing helpful tips discussed during the consultation — a fantastic way to keep track of care plans and advice.

Thank you again to Dr. Brian Loon and the entire Amber Vet team for your professionalism, kindness, and dedication. We feel lucky to have found you!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103401469387600498208/reviews
