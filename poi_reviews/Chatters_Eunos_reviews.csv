Cheek,5,"Nice, cozy and clean place selling ice cream and pastries.

I had the raspberry yoghurt and half a waffle. You can taste the ice cream to help you decide. The staff is very friendly and patient.

Waffle is thick and crispy with a big scoop of yoghurt ice cream.

2nd time patronizing the outlet",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117327179247659626239/reviews
Wynn Chen,5,"Pleasantly surprised by the amount of toppings on the plate. It was not just quantity but quality, the brownie bits were not dry and tasteless but actually bits of a really nice brownie. For 9.90 you‚Äôll get more than most other places",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107741438577175920356/reviews
Jerry Aaron,4,"Nice little cafe in the eunos neighbourhood that serves mostly ice cream and waffles. also has small selection of cakes. seating space isn't big (12-15 pax max?) but lots of open space outside so can technically setup chairs on the grass outside if weather is good. ice cream and waffles taste great, some unique flavours, although flavour range not large.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108221080212091781400/reviews
