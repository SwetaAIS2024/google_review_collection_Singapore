lontongstroong,4,"Beautiful station of a new line in the MRT network. No idea about the meaning of the red gramophone-shaped ornament at the concourse level but it looks very unique.

Another thing I noticed with the new TE-Line stations is that path guides for queue aren't installed yet along the platform door. Perhaps the SMRT will do it some time later, especially after the JB Sentral-Woodlands North line completed (thus multiplies the ridership from the current base)?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews

Javen Leow,5,"Newly opened station serving the ""hidden"" westernmost portion of Orchard Road that most tourists to Singapore don't know about

Orchard Road actually begins in the middle between this station and Orchard station, but there's still a handful of shopping malls nearer to this station (most notably Tanglin Mall)

Several embassies are located nearby here. If you need to go to the embassies of China, Myanmar, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines or the UK High Commission, you should alight here (not at Napier), though it'll still be quite a walk",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103533744765056843646/reviews
