An expat in Singapore from a small town in the US prior had my anxiety and depression working full time and I was scared to even get out of the house in fears of a panic attack. Not only did he get me on the right medication to help \"level me out\" but talking me through the desensitization process and becoming acclimated to my new home and life in Singapore. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",
