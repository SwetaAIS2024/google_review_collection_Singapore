The college has a thriving and vibrant community. Great vibes. It has its own dining hall, lounges, music room, meeting halls etc. Surrounded by lush greenery.",

Close proximity to various canteens, sports facilities, health centre and exam venues (important for potential students!). Some aircon rooms available after recent upgrades and you can also bring in your own aircon if necessary. Getting to class when it rains is possible by foot. UTown is also great but when it rains you need to take a bus. And during peak periods you may not even be able to get on.",
