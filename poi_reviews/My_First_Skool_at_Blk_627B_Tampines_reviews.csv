man luo,5,"My daughter truly enjoys attending this school, and she especially loves the two teachers. They are dedicated, responsible, and make learning fun and engaging. My daughter often tells me how much she enjoys going to school, and the children get along very well with one another. This is a kindergarten I highly recommend.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103180777249247293252/reviews
Mr Chua,5,"We started to enroll our daughter to TMC05 since we moved to here.

My daughter started from N1 and she is now is K1 this year.

She didn’t love school from the start mainly because of the separate anxiety. But with the teacher patiently and love , my girl was adapting the school very soon. And now she looked forward to going to school and knowing what to expect each day.

Every staff person we met was polite, professional and friendly. Administration was wonderful and accessible.

And also I would like to take this opportunity to these teachers that my child transited through~
Teacher Rina, Zhuang Laoshi, Ms Jen, Cheng Laoshi, Ms Joey, Cikgu Su and Li Laoshi. Thank you being so patient, love, caring towards my daughter.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115668647560935372381/reviews
