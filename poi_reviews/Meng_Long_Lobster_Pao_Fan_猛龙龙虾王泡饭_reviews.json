When there were still three customers ahead of me, the cashier lady suddenly shouted, “What you want?” to take my order.\n\nI told her, “1 x number 4 with noodles and 1 x number 12 with rice,” but the cook in front shouted back, “Don’t make it so complicated, just say how many mains, rice, and noodles you want.” It was totally unnecessary and rude, like they don’t even care about basic manners.\n\nAfter I paid, I moved to the side to wait, but the cashier lady shouted again, “Go more to the side!” even though I was already standing quite far from the counter. Their behaviour was just ridiculous, like some Ah Beng opened this stall and hired people worse than uneducated.\n\nThere’s another stall called 猛龙龙虾王泡饭, and I really hope they aren’t related because I’ve seen bad comments about them too.",
