Suresh Kumar,5,"I was in the neighborhood looking for a preschool for my niece and decided to visit Little Footprints Preschool at Jurong West Avenue 5. Despite being busy, the principal welcomed me warmly and personally conducted a tour of the school with such grace. She took the time to explain the curriculum and environment, which I really appreciated.

The teachers were friendly and engaging, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere for the children. I could see that the children were happy and actively involved in learning. Overall, I had a very positive impression of the school and would definitely recommend it to parents looking for a nurturing and supportive environment for their little ones.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109458332570474476005/reviews
Nur Wahidah,1,"Useless school their principal don't allow me to visit my sons school for his 1ts day of school, I'm his biological mother I've right to comedown and see him. She's talking full of nonsense what she's say to me ""I can't any close details with you if you want any details need to ask your child protection officer or foster care officer""
