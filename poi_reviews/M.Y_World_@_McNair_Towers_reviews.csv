Say Wai Foo,5,"Both my kids have attended since N1 and playgroup for the past 4 years and love it! Teachers are kind and caring. And the new principal is very on the ball and we have seen a lot of activities and updates on the parent app recently. 100% recommend. Given it is a highly subsidised programme, do indicate your interest via Ecda early!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110519157249383561552/reviews
Fat Sheep,1,"Terrible experience.

1) the place is supposed to open on Saturdays but when we dropped off on a Saturday due to errands, they didn’t allow the kid to stay— did everything to make us bring our child home.  They didn’t even let him step a foot into the facility, even though he willingly wanted to go and play.

2) the “Teachers” play favouritism and will bully those children they don’t like and those are usually kids who don’t “listen to everything they say.”",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103505505349440561698/reviews
