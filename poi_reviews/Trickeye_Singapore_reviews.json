There were so many hidden tricks and tips up their sleeves! From really engaging, hilarious and funny AR, all the way to the scavenger hunts (seriously, it's so worth it! The prizes for the scavenger hunt are THE BEST), to the super helpful staff (shoutout to Maye) for being so kind and helpful to us haha! My family and I had such a fun time, thank you all for help! Best day ever ❤️ thank God for all! Seriously, don't miss this place! It's a hidden gem!",
