Nur Jannah,5,"A huge garden! Took about 2 hours to slowly stroll, enjoy the view and reach the other end of the garden. It’s home to many animals and there’s so much to see. My favorite starts from the Japanese Garden onwards. Really enjoy the peaceful environment there and nice place to totally unwind. It’s a short walking distance from the MRT station.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113210093672049038579/reviews

Mike Shary Production,5,"Went here during the noon to check out the scenery, it's awesome lotsa trees and flowers, there's a jetty for you to chill and catch the scenic view above the water. The park is clean, and parking was also available at a price. Lotsa slots available. There's also a toilet facility. Overall I give this park 4/5. I'm sure it will be pretty cool and chilling to be at night too.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103129479237663736934/reviews
Robert Chai,5,"Probably the largest and well maintained gardens in the West and definitely one of my most favourite spots to visit, either for your walk/job sessions or just walking around to find birds/critters to observe.

A great place that you will find beautiful vista views of both sunrises and sunsets. A very versatile place as well that houses many different areas for joggers, picnic-people, photographers, water-sports enthusiasts or just about anyone keen on interacting with nature. You can also catch some extreme sports activities across the lakefront, or even chill out at one of the most beautiful Starbucks view in Singapore!

Often, you can catch a few glimpses of wildlife like birds, monitor lizards as well as the occasional family of otters who will come by from time to time to fish for meals in the morning or bask in the morning sun.

Very eager to see the nearby Japanese Gardens’ reopening hopefully in the month of Sept 2024, after a roughly 3-4 year hiatus for renovations, which will really open up to bigger spaces and newly-renovated spots for explorations, exercise or leisure activities.

I do hope the massive monitor lizards of whom I mistakenly for Komodo dragons in the past are still around… As they are literally as massive as those Komodo dragons, but I have yet to see any of them lingering around the lake areas in the past 3-4 years I have visited the park.

Definitely a great visit if you’re around the area, and it may take you a few hours to scroll across this massive piece of beautiful greenery!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101775319044798524953/reviews
