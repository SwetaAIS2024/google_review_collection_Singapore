Due to a phrasing  in one of the clauses stated within the terms & conditions, there was a minor hiccup during the redemption process. However,  I want to praise the evening duty manager and also the lady counter staff who were patient, professional and polite throughout the situation.  And thanks to them my husband and I were able to redeem our complementary passes and watch the movie in peace. Thank you both very much!üòä",
