I only tried the bubble tea so I can’t comment about other food even though I tried their cutlets many years ago. Their bubble milk tea has failed to entice me to repeat purchase as the bubbles doesn’t go very well with the tea. I cannot explain but I can only rate it 2 out of 5. Unfortunately I am unable to separate the bubble from the milk tea. I will definitely give their bubble milk a pass.",

Definitely worth a snack on if you're looking for tea-time options in the area.\n\nMilk tea was alright, there are other better options boba tea options in the mall.",
