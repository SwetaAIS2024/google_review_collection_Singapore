Zuriel Mamba,4,"Affordable grilled fish located In this industrial area. $8.80 for half a fish really competitive. Settled for  mala xiangguo after the chatty owner recommended. Here the mala xiangguo was prearranged, hopefully there would be al carte menu in the future. The dish was somewhat fragrance, spice level was pretty manageable, perhaps to cater to the mass.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100097027827819745483/reviews
Karen Gads About,4,"Chanced upon this stall after my training nearby. This is another outlet of their Bedok outlet. Very friendly & chatty boss who recommended us some dishes to try. Eventually tried their Mala Xiang Guo set, prefixed for now & comes with a bowl of pearl rice, $10.90. Portion is pretty decent for this price with 11 ingredients. The mlxg is more of the dry kind, not overly spicy but fragrant to me.

We also tried their Grilled Fish in Golden Soup, half fish for $8.80 only! Very worth in my opinion, only disappointed that the serving pan is not heated. Fish is soft & smooth, few bones, broth is pleasant, sweet & refreshing with a very slight spiciness kick. Grill fish in Golden broth also has cabbage, beansprouts, beancurd skin strips & peanuts atop.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113503192007654817905/reviews
oscar w,4,a stall located in a sleepy foodcourt within an industrial building. most of the other stalls were closed when I was there on a weekday lunchtime. ordered the grilled fish 酸菜 version. it wasn't too bad but I reckon the Mala version should taste better. 口水鸡 is really nice.  will return to try other dishes.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111622338660084561466/reviews
Joseph Lim,5,"Excellent food! And very very reasonably priced too!
Located at a industrial office area means that on a weekend evening there is practically no crowd! Excellent for gatherings and slower pace of enjoyment!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116937594036646281017/reviews
