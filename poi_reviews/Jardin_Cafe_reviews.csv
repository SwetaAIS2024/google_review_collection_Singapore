Kimberley Howarth,5,"This is a beautiful little cafe, very attractive seating and comfortable to have a relax and chitchat with friends. The menu has some interesting things on it, we had avocado toast and ""crisps and dips"". The dips were really delicious indeed and good portions. The turkish coffee is very authentic and fragrant. Best coffee I have had for awhile, and I must return to try their other offerings. Staff were all very nice. And the proprietress is a lovely, friendly person who makes you feel very welcome. Thank you so much!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114957590885643931784/reviews

Ada Az,5,"Ordered chicken chop and crunchy chicken. Both priced rm29 and portion was big, so very worth it. The wedges tasted good on its own and the sauce only elevated the flavours. Cafe latter was a but bland maybe cause too much ice(?) Service was not so bad. It is a bit humid there so i hope they fix the air conditioner. The interior, was nice and very relaxing with those jazz music they play on. Would come again, i hope this place gains more popularity because its honestly a nice go to. Only thing i was a bit taken aback was the 10% service fee. Quite high id say. Total spent was rm95 for teo prople",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105947981854726553899/reviews
