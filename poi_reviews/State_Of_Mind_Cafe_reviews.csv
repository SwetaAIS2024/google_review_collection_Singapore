Yx Cheng,5,"The owner is a friendly, down to earth guy who makes a mean cup of coffee. Price was really reasonable as well. We tried a double shot espresso latte for $4.50 and an orange spiced mocha for $5.50, both were great. Heâ€™s got a CNY 1 for 1 promotion which is ðŸ¤¯. So if youâ€™re ever in the area I highly recommend you to give it a shot.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110406752146691041628/reviews
Belle,4,"The black sesame hojicha tasted a bit diluted and not so well blended. However the earl grey yuan yang was surprisingly very yummy, smooth and well balanced! There was a short queue on a weekday afternoon; waiting time can be awhile so do order in advance. Friendly owner whom I believe gives discount for regulars and perhaps for the wait :)",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117119627706215023059/reviews

Chua Ming Rou,5,Homey takeaway booth from home window for a cup of hojicha black sesame latte! Kinda hope that the black sesame was a little thicker and less sweet but overall a good experience! All the best for your business and thanks for sharing with us cool knowledge about coffee brewing!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111233418332065425234/reviews
Eileen,4,"I went to the place on the weekends, I loved the vibe of the place and how friendly there are!! I ordered a matcha latte and hot latte. Hot latte was abit sour and acidic, the matcha was soso, abit grassy and not really sweet enough to my liking. Iâ€™d give it a 3 star but because of the service / friendlyness of the owner, it changed my final rating to 4/5 to support their business! Iâ€™m very mindful about customer service and the owner felt very down to earth and carry on nice and short convo! Would recommend, but the drinks arenâ€™t to my preferences",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109723661934190510907/reviews
