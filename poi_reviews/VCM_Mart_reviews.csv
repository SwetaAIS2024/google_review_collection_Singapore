Timothy,1,"I thought that it was probably me who had a problem with the cashier who is a man. Because when i came to collect my Shopee parcel, he treated me like i was non-existent. Had gone there few times & wished EVERYTIME  that it was some other cashier who would be there. But never. It would be him.

It seems that he preferred paying customer instead of us who are collecting Shopee parcels. He would be talking to them. But when its my turn, he took out the business hp, kept his MOUTH SHUT & STARED at me..

I was like.. what the xxxx is wrong with you?! I had even greeted you with ‘Hello’, which is a norm when i go to any collection point.

My goodness..Shopee should delist this shop as a collection point.. but i think it wouldnt happen. So I made a promise that I will NOT EVER deal or shop here again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104212135038242653736/reviews
Karmz Phryford,1,"I picked up an item from a shop today, and the shopkeeper gave me a very grumpy look, as though I was disturbing him. I noticed he was busy restocking cigarettes at the counter behind him, but I can't understand why this caused such an attitude. This isn’t the first time it has happened. In the past, I usually brushed it off as it didn’t affect me much. However, today I started paying more attention, especially since I’ve seen so many negative reviews about this shop as a Shopee collection point—and it seems those reviews are accurate.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117241980499394646850/reviews
Felicia Png,5,"Have collected my Shopee parcels from VCM Mart many times and was always greeted with a smile. Not sure why there are negative reviews but really, our friend manning the minimart is friendly!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110407954508222562896/reviews
YY L,1,"Don’t use the Shopee collection point here if you don’t buy things from this shop. If you keep doing what I did, you’ll be marked and be treated with extreme rudeness. The last time I went, the cashier asked me to find my own package, then scolded me for moving his packages around, which he placed scattered on the floor. Just use the pick lockers at Blk 203/265.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102563074133018367124/reviews
Lavandir T,1,Attitude problem with this shop cashier/owner. Please unlist yourself as shopee collection point if you don't want to serve Shopee customer. Jolly well serve your own customers will make this hood a happier place. It's disgusting when you show attitude  for those collecting parcel. They don't owe you anything.
