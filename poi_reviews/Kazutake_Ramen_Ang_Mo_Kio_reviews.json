My family also told me not to eat as it was dark and doesn't look fresh at all. I rather forfeit the sashimi.\nOverall, won't be returning and don't understand such kind of sashimi, restaurant also able to serve to guests.",

      "text": "Had a late dinner - price point is good for what it offered. Ramen was decent, with a rich broth that is not overall too salty. Pork used was marinated and thinly sliced. The noodles itself was a bit too hard.\n\nThey did the fried squid well- it was crispy and not too oily overall. It was tender and fresh.\n\nThe mini chirashi don was disappointing. All the fresh fish were soaked with soy sauce and I couldnâ€™t taste the fish at all :( Rice was also a bit too mushy for me.\n\nThe California Maki and Mango Fresh Milk were value for money. The drink only cost $3.50!\n\nOverall, I liked the atmosphere and the place; but would only go there if I have no other Japanese food to choose from.",

All the ramen we tried was delicious and generous with the ingredients. The soups were not too heavy with qiu qiu noodles, perfect for a light meal. Standout was the chirashi which was filled with fresh fish and ingredients, well worth the price. Washed it down with a yummy and reasonably priced bubble tea. Will definitely come back again for more.",
