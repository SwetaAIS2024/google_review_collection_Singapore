Sriram Ved,5,"Located in Bukit Timah Plaza, this Sichuan restaurant delivers bold, flavorful dishes with generous portions. We particularly enjoyed the steamed okra, smoky potatoes dry pot, and mapo tofu. The restaurant is accommodating to vegan and vegetarian needs, with helpful staff who make customizations with ease. The space is small but clean and bright.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114779231041133886076/reviews
Stephanie Tan,4,"The restaurant is relatively small and gets quite warm in the afternoon sun. Menu contains a good range of mala xiang guo, boiled fish, meats, vegetables, cold dishes, skewers, noodles, and rice. The beef skewers were too tough and dry, while pork skewers are better, as some fat slices are used. I enjoyed the laziji and mushroom with cucumbers.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116228909321338746629/reviews
Yen Trinh,5,"Hidden gem of a Sichuan restaurant in Bukit Timah Plaza. The food was outstanding (quite generous portion wise). We loved everything we ordered (steamed okras, smoky potatoes dry pot, mala tofu and the fish in pickled mustard soup). Massive kudos for how vegan/ vegetarian friendly the place is (the staff is helpful in making slight customizations in our food). The restaurant isn't so big but clean and bright. We'll be back!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106124579273314676288/reviews
Yulong Wang,5,All dishes were ordered tasted authentic and fresh. Worth the extra calorie-intake. I would recommend the mapo toufu and chicken skewers.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106993845586324436951/reviews
