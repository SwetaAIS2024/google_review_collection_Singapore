Ask Me Anything In Singapore,5,"Good to chill house wine is very good. Sitting outdoors on windy day. Seeing the passerby with all sorts. N near music. Service is very good. Cute young waiter can spare me a Marlboro mint flare for a puff. Free. Quite a sweetheart. If you are sitting in. Beware they may play sports show. So music is sayonara.

But a very good deal here with very good service n pretty n cute waiters n bar tendeder girl.
