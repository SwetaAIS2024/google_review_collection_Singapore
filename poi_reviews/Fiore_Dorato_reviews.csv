Wayne Loo,5,"Fiore Dorato always deliver on their immaculate floral arrangements and quality.

I've been buying bouquets from them since 2011 at their club street location from Fabian,  and every year, the Mrs is always happy to receive the bouquets.

Service was top notch as well and Jacqueline was always there to assist.

To many more years of bouquet for the Mrs.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106654215560057689085/reviews

Terence Lee,5,"Fiore Dorato is my go-to florist any time I need to send flowers to a high value relationship. I patronize them regularly to buy flowers for my wife, work situations, and other important occasions like congratulations or condolences. They are extremely responsive and reliable (they follow my requests predictably), and have always found a way to deliver on time, even on short notice. My wife always remarks that Fiore Dorato's flowers last longer than other high end providers' do. Their flower arrangements are amongst the most beautiful of any provider, but what makes them stand out is the customer service and willingness to work with me. As long as they keep it up, I will continue to be a loyal customer. Pictured is the latest bouquet I ordered from them: beautiful, exactly as I specified, and on time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113121130039635448260/reviews
