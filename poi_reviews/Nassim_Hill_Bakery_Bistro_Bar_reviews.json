Luckily, without reservations we are still able to dine in since it‚Äôs early in the morning. Had my breakfast meal with bread basket with oat flat white.",

      "text": "Nassim Hill Bakery Bistro Bar is a well-loved dining destination located at the fringe of Orchard Road, housed in the historic Tanglin Post Office building. Since opening in 2012, it has built a strong reputation for its artisanal bakes, hearty comfort food, and cozy yet refined atmosphere. The space blends the feel of a classic European bakery with the vibe of a laid-back bistro ‚Äî making it a popular go-to for everything from brunch to dinner and drinks.\n\nI visited for lunch and the place was bustling, clearly a favourite among regulars. From the seasonal spring menu, I had the Crab Omelette ‚Äî packed with jumbo lump crab meat tossed in aioli, jalape√±os, and chives, served over a cheese omelette with crispy homemade croutons. It was satisfying, but the standout for me was the Garlic Shokupan ‚Äî soft Japanese milk bread brushed with garlic butter, simple yet exceptionally good. The only drawback was that the restaurant seemed a bit understaffed during the lunch rush, which led to some wait time. Still, I‚Äôd rate it a 5 out of 5 ‚Äî excellent food, vibrant atmosphere, and a top pick for all-day dining in town.",
