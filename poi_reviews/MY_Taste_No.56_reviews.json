      "text": "I'm happy this place opened near my house. I always order the braised pork rice and it has a good portion for the price paid. ($6)\n\nThe grass jelly fresh milk ($5.50) to me is really nice too but to me personally abit expensive. I however dont mind it as again, i enjoy it and would love to support this business :)\n\nI also always see that it's the same lady working here on her own and for one person handling the store the service is fast! and she is very friendly too.\n\nI will definitely be a repeating customer here and i hope to try other stuffs from the menu such as their coconut latte, soya/milk pudding, and other food options as well.\n\nIf you are tired of the kopitiam beside, definitely check this place out. Its worth a try!\n\nUpdate: Tried the curry chicken rice and coconut latte and it's sooo good as well. Even my mom loved it and she is usually abit picky.",

      "text": "Their curry chicken drumstick noodle was delicious. Rich and spicy. Potato soft and easy to bite. Chicken quite tender.\n\nAuthentic and delicious Malaysian food. Had their Cha Siu Noodle ($5) which was a dry tossed noodle with a right amount of dark savoury sauce. Portion was generous. Noodles were chewy and slurpy. Meat was chewy, juicy and garlicky but a tad mature. The texture differ from the norm, it's more like braised duck. If you love sambal, please have it. The sambal it legit Malaysian taste. Damn pedas.\n\nTaro Puree ($4) was sweet, smooth and creamy. Love the extra taro dices to add more texture.\n\nMelon Honey ($2) was refreshing and cooling.\n\nAll of which I find the price are quite acceptable. All were served in disposable. Place rather tiny but air con is good.",
