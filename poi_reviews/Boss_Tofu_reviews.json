The curry vegetable was pretty decent - not too watery or bland, but I would rather it with a little more kick. At about 7 dollars I do think it's good value for money and certainly worth recommending.",

Choices of chicken curry with potato, pork cutlet or fried pork belly (南乳炸肉）. Set is $8.90 and ala carte is $7.50. Recommended go for the set. They have limited choices of drinks but you can buy bubble tea from Yanxi and get 10% off when you quote having meals at Boss tofu. The portion was just nice and curry was good. They also sell Yong tofu if you prefer soup noodles but not a lot of varieties.",
