Paul Toh,4,"This shop deserves a bigger area and a bigger place to host customers.
The soup base is good, ingredients are fresh although not the expensive grade of seafood and meats. Price is actually reasonable after dividing up the total.
My main complains about this place is really the size of each table, too cramp and too hot. I would probably visit again after they move, if they move.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110110584107240453374/reviews
Lisa Kwok,5,"Such a hidden gem, the hotpot here is one of a kind! The location is a little out of the way but I always leave here feeling so satisfied. The soup base and adding the wine at the end makes it even more rich.
The homemade wanton is really good too!

We have never finished the entire pot of soup at any hotpot restaurant and this is our first!

No photos of the food before we ate because we were too hungry to dig in ;p",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116935202575546232834/reviews
Tony Too,5,"Fresh meat, prawns and nice soup. Very tasty overall. The üå∂Ô∏è is  spicy for me but also a must.
After eating don't feel thirsty unlike other hot pot restaurant.
Reasonable price.
But have to book in advance.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102687658535264276725/reviews
Ashley Liew,5,"Dined here several times with my wife, and tonight was the first time with my dad too. We all love the food here! The soup is so tasty especially towards the end. The ingredients are super fresh from the beef and pork to fish. The udon is so springy too. Really satisfied by the end of the meal! The staff are friendly despite being busy during peak periods. Be sure to check the opening hours as they are not open daily. When they are open, it feels like One Pot and the Free Movement Dance Studio (directly across) are the most happening and bustling places in this cosy corner of Singapore. There‚Äôs free parking here which is huge plus. We will be back! üôèüèª",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
