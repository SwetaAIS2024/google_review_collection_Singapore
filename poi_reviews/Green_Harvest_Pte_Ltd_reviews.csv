Van,5,Was reading Marion Nestle's books and learnt about the imports and a lot about food (highly recommend her books) Got curious about locally grown produce which brought me to SFA's site about where to purchase & went to check out Shengsiong for some local greens and found your mixed lettuce for my lunch tmr! Love that it's pesticide free and I'm hoping for more local produce on the shelves in future.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106036509015929837396/reviews
Adela Lim,5,"Bought their CaiXinHua today for the first time, I am impressed by the vegetablesâ€™ freshness and texture.  They are not tough like imported ones I bought before that requires much longer cooking. Price is about double though. Hopefully, with bigger demand of local produce, we could enjoy a more affordable price.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114499750801118797342/reviews
