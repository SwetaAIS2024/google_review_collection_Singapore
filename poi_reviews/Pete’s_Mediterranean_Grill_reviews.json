      "text": "We often go there and like the food albeit a bit pricy for what it is. The falafel with humus is delicious, the beef wrap feels very fresh and simple but so small that it leaves a need to repeat the order (very clever). We did and went for a second wrap with chicken. I must say it was extremely salty and less appetizing than the beef version. All by all a small shop with decent food located in the vibrant Alibaba hawker",
