S lim,1,"5star for Dr Tan who explain the details of diagnosis and treatment.
1star for service staff. came thru the door no one at the counter, called out a few times no answer. Staff came out no apologise to keep patient waiting, and she had a stony look while attending like I owe her. During payment i told her I have chas card, and i needed to show her. Because it’s for my kid so it didn’t reflect in my SingPass. And she agreed that she would do the deduction & I could send her once I got back. Receipt was sent via email. Staff Jermaine later called say she couldn’t process to give me the deduction for Chad cause she didn’t see the card! But why in the first place she agreed I could send it!! And to my disappointment I thought right before payment I told her about the chas deduction but she didn’t do it either. Was she dreaming? If everything was told before hand I would have make other arrangement for photo taken or go home take. But she agreed on and say she is able to do the deduction, all I need was to send her later when I got back. It’s so frustrating & unpleasant , already stress about kids sickness still need to handle this issue. told couldn’t void or refund and only offset next time. (Like a curse I will be sick again) worst of all no apolgises for her mistake",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108642816357525789269/reviews

Joyce Lim,4,"Sgd80 for 5 min consult and 4 meds relating to gastroenteritis. Clinic was empty on Friday evening at 5pm, no wait. Clinic looks very new and clean, well decorated. Chairs near recept aren't secured and have tendency to shift, could break glass behind if someone sits down too carelessly. Receptionist was prompt in registering but kept coughing, though was wearing mask, a bit disconcerting. Doctor was terse, could not hear him clearly through his mask. Bedside manners can be improved -- ultimately people gravitate to doctors who make them feel better, not just through accurate diagnosis and effective meds, but also through a ""personable"" interaction. This clinic has potential to be 5 stars, hope it takes in feedback and improves.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114306834103372851451/reviews
