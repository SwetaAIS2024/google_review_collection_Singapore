Graham Soros,1,"No eggs given as shown on the display. Told the cook, he said additional 50cents. Even the branch at 280 bishan st 24 is the same response. Basically is cheating the consumers.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101643797786594707432/reviews
BB Hans,1,"Ordered a plain kway teow goreng (no veggie.. nothing) and told him just add sunny side up. Wanted to PayNow him and asked how much. Was told $5.. I was like, what??

And I sarcastically told him, ""wow! A plain kway teow goreng with a sunny side up costs $5??""

He just looked away looking guilty!

Other indian Muslim stalls which I ordered the same thing costs between $3.50 - $4 which most of the time costs $4 but for $5 is a rip off!

I'd suggest to you guys by asking him how much is the price first before placing an order.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102665897979233316263/reviews
