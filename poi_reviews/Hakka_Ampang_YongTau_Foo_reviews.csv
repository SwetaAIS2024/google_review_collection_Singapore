Quing_åˆ˜å¦ˆå¦ˆ,4,"Hakka Ampang Yong Tau Foo â€“ I tried the Yong Tau Foo along with the Wantan Pork Broth Soup, which was rich, flavorful, and fragrant. The dumplings were well-stuffed with juicy fillings, and the pork broth had a comforting depth, making it a satisfying choice. The Yong Tau Foo ingredients, including tofu, eggplant, and bitter gourd, were fresh and paired well with the soup. A great spot for authentic Hakka flavors!

Sing Wee Choo,5,"The photo says it all. So tasty that I forgot to take photo first. Lol.
Like the variety and all fresh. Eat the crispy bean curd skin first to savour it at its crispiest! Order a little portion of braised duck and kway chap as a meal of you have more people. The yam rice goes well with the ytf items. Reasonable price",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105419411803640464788/reviews
