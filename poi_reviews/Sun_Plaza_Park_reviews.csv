Forest BK,5,"🌳Sun Plaza Park is a neighbourhood park located at Tampines Ave 7 and Ave 9, in Tampines town.
😜Nothing got to do with Sun Plaza at Sembawang. Haha..
🌿🫄It's a green lung where residents staying nearby visit for their morning exercise routine.
🏒There is a well-shaded spacious Woodball course with 12 fairways (gates).
Although it may seems to been a little neglected.
🥬🐈‍⬛👣Other features include a Therapeutic Garden, an Amphitheatre with Stage, Sand pit Playgrounds, Dog Run, Allotment Garden, Fitness Corner and Sense Discovery Garden.
☀️Around the spacious park, sun motiff features prominently.
🌼An interesting feature to note is that all the footpaths at Sun Plaza Park converge to form a sun motif, true to the Park's name.

Live . Travel . Enjoy,4,"Sun Plaza Park seems small from the outside, but it’s surprisingly big when you entered. It’s tranquil with children playing at the sandy playground and seniors chilling and relaxing on benches inside the park. A welcoming respite from the busy Tampines hood. Loads of roosters and its family of chickens roaming freely and happily.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108028609820315742265/reviews
阿宝,5,"I have been passing by this park for years as I always take bus 15 from Pasir Ris to Tampines & back…

My impression of this park is “quite dark” and not safe to jog or even take short cut thru the park due to all the tall & huge trees planted in the park…

Since I started my Sunday walk I decided to give this park a try…. & surprisingly it is not that “scary”!  The huge & tall trees actually make the park very cooling!

Kudos to the staff who help to keep the park so clean and nice for all!

I see many elderly taking their morning walk there & many domestic helpers on Sunday off also can be seen having their picnic there.

Loves the greenery in the park and I will definitely visit the park again & in fact more often from now on :-)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews

Fun Kwok,5,"Simple park with a small amphitheater, toilet facilities, playground and fitness corners. Good for jogs, and there are bbq pits closeby too. This park is part of a park connector which connects to the Bedok reservoir and Pasir Ris park connector.
It is well shaded and is a good place to chill. I had the opportunity to chance upon a trio of  ladies practicing Christmas tunes on their ukulele and they gave us an impromptu performance. Perfect!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102827686654539049214/reviews
