Amanda Mong,5,This is really a gem!! The food me and my friend had was really delicious. Thanks to Chef Nora for the recommendation and cooking for us! She is really hospitable and kind that she even offered chilli padi to cater to my taste. I had the yellow curry with seafood linguine (12.80 sgd) and my friend had Tom yum salmon spaghetti (13.80 sgd). We both topped up $3 for the soup of the day and a drink. I’ll say the seafood portion is really generous and cook to perfection. There’s no GST or service charge either. I’m really impressed and will be back for more!!,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116511842605241921035/reviews
Shirley Odelia,4,"Had teriyaki pasta but it's a bit too sweet for my liking. My friend don't like the cream based pasta. The chicken wings quite spicy but the staff so nice, have me ice water to drink. It's halal and no GST no service charge",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109300779610049496461/reviews
Edward Lim Wing Eu,5,"Back there again for lunch...you will love it. Do note, their nice dishes are on the spicy side, but you can ask them to tone it down. They are more then willing to do it...its delicious though.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103763407270524541353/reviews
Asyraf Salim,4,Interesting fusion of Asian recipes with pasta. Each pasta in the menu is accompanied by a cup of ice lemon tea. I'd tried the Black pepper chicken pasta and beef pasta. Would try the other items on menu.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117898046877558161748/reviews
RingaBelle,5,"I have walk pass this restaurant many many times but didn't attract me to try till today. I'm glad I did.

Service was very friendly. Restaurant was clean. What amazed me most was the food. I usually don't drink mushroom soup but this is so nice that I finished every drop. Soup is made from fresh mushroom and full of fragrance. The garlic on top of the bread is made of fresh garlic and tasted so so good.

Black pepper chicken pasta tasted yummy with generous portion of chicken. If you like peppery taste then definitely you will like this. The pasta was cooked in a perfect texture.
Practically nothing to complain but alot to compliment.
The chief might look young but she is really good. Definitely will return soon.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102859075502906636871/reviews
