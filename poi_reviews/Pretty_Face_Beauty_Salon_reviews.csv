Hon Weng Liew,5,"Had a great experience there with the fire cupping session. Staff was professional and the treatment was very helpful. Went in with a lot of tightness in my back but felt a lot better after the session. Staff is also very friendly and knowledgable.

Would highly recommend and would definitely go back again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103948217286222133597/reviews
Jialin Foo,5,"Went to Pretty Face for facial and had a great experience! I enquired quite last minute but Jenna shifted her plans around to accommodate me, very thankful!

I‚Äôm struggling with acne and Jenna tailored the facial according to my needs and I could tell that my face was a lot clearer after the session. She also explained in great detail what she was doing at each step.

At the end, she even massaged my neck and back to complete the whole facial experience, explaining that it would help with the detoxing experience (because of how the lymphatic system is connected).

Overall I‚Äôm very pleased with this facial and would recommend! No hard selling either which is always a plus.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114523840264615865431/reviews
Vivien Lim,5,"Have being a patron of Pretty  Face Beauty Salon for more than a decade,Hence I could confidently attest the awesome  facial service/treatment rendered. Prices charged are reasonable & value for money. I personally like the skilful and professional services of the staff, kudos to Ms LiJiao, the beauty therapist as she diagnoses, assess and prescribes appropriate treatment plan without hard selling. Patrons  do not feel obliged and pressurised to take up packages but  are  convinced by the Salon owner's business philosophy in providing authentic customer care and quality personalised services. Thanks and looking forward to my next visit again. Keep it up.üôèüëç",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114922427575604895520/reviews
