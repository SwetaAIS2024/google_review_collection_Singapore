Tere Cahyono,5,Katarina has been a very helpful and she was always ready to reply to you even when she was on holiday. She would give you a very helpful recommendation with extensive network. I got the painting that she arranged with the painter himself ( with some personal touch ) and delivered professionally. Even the delivery crews seemed were having a great working relationship with Bruno Gallery. The delivery crews measured using the laser measuring tool that I didnâ€™t expect this such service. Katarina and Yasin are friendly and they are very knowledgeable. Would definitely to get more paintings from them. Thank you for being patience with my requests even when it was not during business hour and you were overseas.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113707087513203866843/reviews
