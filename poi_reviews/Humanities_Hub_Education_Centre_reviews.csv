Chen Senyi,5,"Humanities have always been my Achilles' heel. I would not have done well for my O levels and A levels without the help of Humanities Hub. For some context, I went for Social Studies tuition for my O levels and Economics tuition for my A levels. I scored way above my expectations for both national exams and I was able to go to my dream Junior College (RI) and I am currently applying to my dream NUS course. The teachers are extremely dedicated and experienced in teaching their students and are patient in doing so. Moreover, they are constantly improving their teaching methods in response to the feedback of the students as they believe that they have a responsibility to help their students score. Even though I did not see an immediate jump in my grades, I continued learning under them as I felt that my grasp of knowledge and skills are improving and that the jump in the grades will come eventually. I was proven right for both my O levels and A levels. This may be cringe to say but I am going to say it anyways: Humanities Hub has been life changing for me.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110112075424777896225/reviews
