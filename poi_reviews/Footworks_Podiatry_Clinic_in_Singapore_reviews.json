She is incredibly patient, taking the time to explain everything clearly and making sure I feel comfortable and informed at every step. Itâ€™s clear that she genuinely prioritizes her patientsâ€™ well-being over anything else. I truly appreciate that she offers free visits for adjustments until I feel full comfort with my feet before even considering charging for services. That level of integrity, compassion, and professionalism is rare and deeply appreciated.",
