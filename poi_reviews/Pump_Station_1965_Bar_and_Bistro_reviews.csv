Ruby Peng (wanderlustruby),5,We came for drinks after dinner but was surprised they have a full Thai dishes menu that looks so good! The pork jowl salad is sensational! Also cocktails are very good price! Would come back,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111061924363706483960/reviews
wuan ng,3,"The food overall was quite good, and the portions were generous. However, I feel that the service could be improved. My plate was cleared before I had finished eating, and they didn’t even ask first. Additionally, there were quite a few mosquitoes around. We informed the staff and asked if they could turn on the cooler, but they just replied that it was broken and didn’t offer any further assistance. It’s worth noting that there was more than one cooler in the area",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118028746086899371752/reviews
Han Lee,4,"Only outdoors seating so can get rather warm in the afternoon.

One cool thing is we can order food from 3 places - pump western; the Thai food beside and the Chinese 串 further down. Seems like all same bosses.

The western food pump platter is average. The beef is too tough, wings really good. Nachos is short of guacamole though. Calamari is huge and juicy. Thai food is great esp the fried vegetables and fresh coconut. The pork is abit too dry though.

Winner is actually the 串! Very tasty and well spiced. Drinks are decently priced too - $50/bottle of wine.

Service is good and attentive.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115116918025714974988/reviews
Soh CH,3,Food is not bad. But I find the place a bit warm and many flying insects thus affecting my appeite. Service crews are friendly. I will hope the management to install more fans to make this place more cozy.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100767732463011015737/reviews
Madhu M.,3,"Relaxing place to chill and enjoy western and Thai food. Food was delicious, however, service inconsistent depending on who you order from. Drinks and food orders were missed out, I don't mind waitress not writing down orders but have a concern when they are missed out. Hope this part is improved. Other wise was a pleasant family dining",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104475516303642123147/reviews
