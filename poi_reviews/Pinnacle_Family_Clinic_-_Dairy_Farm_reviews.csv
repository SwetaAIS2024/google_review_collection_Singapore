Andrew Attan,5,"Never rated a clinic before....here goes:
Medicine tasted not too bad.  Some were a bit too sweet. The pills were nicely shaped and easy to swallow.  Ambient was coolingly cold.  I loved that they have a weighing machine that can take height measurement and they have a machine you can self serve to take blood pressure.

Haha.
Anyways....
I loved this place as it is not yet so crowded.  There are a lurkin, coffee bean and Baker and Cook cafe.  Same doctor for now and this is good.  Staff is great and service is prompt.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107330331263865807315/reviews

rayyen santika,5,"I had the pleasure of visiting Pinnacle at Dairy Farm recently, and I can't say enough good things about the experience, particularly the nurse MeiQi was incredibly welcoming and professional from the moment I walked in. She took the time to explain everything thoroughly, answered all my questions and made sure I felt comfortable throughout my entire visit.
