      "text": "TSD has been my family’s go-to dental clinic for years—from my parents to my kids, we’ve all been well taken care of here. The staff are always warm and friendly, and the dentists are gentle, patient, and clear in explaining any procedures or diagnoses.\n\nDr. Low has been overseeing my braces journey. I’m especially grateful for how gentle and reassuring he’s been throughout. He always takes the time to explain each step and what to expect next, which really put me at ease.\n\nOverall, it’s been such a pleasant and smooth experience. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend TSD CCK to anyone looking for a trustworthy and caring dental team. Thank you for taking such great care of my family’s dental health over the years!",

She’s very pleasant, friendly and knowledgeable, and taught me a lot about my teeth and how to take care of them. The scaling and polishing itself didn’t hurt, and I am very satisfied with the results. Will definitely come back for future check ups and wisdom teeth surgery.",

      "text": "The high ratings on Google made me think the clinic is decent but I was wrong. Overcharge me with mediocre service by the male dentist. I only booked because I had preferential pricing cleaning and polishing which was meant to cost only $80 but dentist did a rushed and attentive job which lasted only less than 10mins. Even without consulting me, they want to quickly rush me to do the X-ray for no reason and slapped me with another $300. So the rushed cleaning and polishing was for the purpose of slapping additional services that customers don’t need. When I politely rejected, they quickly applied fluoride on my teeth which cost another $40. Overall I won’t visit this clinic again. Should have stuck to my usual clinic where the hygienist cleans the teeth meticulously and the fluoride application was included.",
