      "text": "Ordered a 双鱼汤- fish soup served with both fish slices and fried fish bites. It cost me around $9+. Though the price is a bit steep, I can understand that rental and it being in an “ulu” area demands that it charges higher prices for menu item. So I will not comment on the value for money aspect.\n\nHowever, I did find the portion size to be a bit on the paltry side of life.\n\nThe fish soup was not filled with many ingredients, and the fish slices were a bit too fishy for my liking.\n\nThe fried fish slices is my biggest complaint unfortunately. They were mostly like off cuts of the fish, and I barely tasted any flesh and most of it was just fried coatings (or with such little fish that it only tasted like coating). Overall, it did not make for a satisfying meal.\n\nTheir menu is extensive, and I still want to try more of what’s available before making a final call. I see that they have different outlets around Singapore so I am definitely willing to try out their other outlets before coming to a conclusion. But so far? This is not a place I will come back to.",

House flies is indeed an issue.\n\n2020: 5 star - Seafood soup is true to their reputation, thick and tasty with a pinch of wine yet not too milky, comes with two big prawns and fish maw. Fish is really fresh, whether it is in soup or deep fried. Vegetables are grown by themselves too. Homemade chrysanthemum tea and lime juice are surprisingly nice.",
