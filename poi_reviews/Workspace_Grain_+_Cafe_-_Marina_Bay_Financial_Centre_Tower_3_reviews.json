Hot long black.\n\nA special mention to Nurul, who was warm, attentive, and made us feel truly welcome. Her excellent service added so much to the overall experience.\n\nWe will definitely be back!",

I appreciate their food, especially the roasted pork. The salmon, chicken, pumpkin, glass noodles and mushrooms are also noteworthy. The staff consistently greet me warmly in the morning, making me feel more like a friend than a customer. Please continue to provide excellent service to encourage customer loyalty.",

They know my order without asking, and I always look forward to the friendly banter.  For lunch, the salad lunch is also very good, lots of healthy options- just make sure to go early enough for the best selection.",
