Meat was tender and soft, crispy and crunchy. Their spring chicken was of similar quality, tender, crispy, and not oily too. It's value for money, definitely must try and worth the queue.",

They recently increased prices by about $0.30 so chicken chop is $5.80 now but it is still one of the cheapest around and very good value for money because it comes with fried rice and fries. The chicken chop is the thin type but I prefer this over the thick kind.",
