J,1,"Although the food is decent and I often patronize this restaurant, I found a feather in my food today.

CP,5,"I came here specially to try their Dosai. My conclusion is that it is one of the best Dosai I have had so far (how I assess whether it is to my likely is by going for the plain version the first time). I asked for the Dosai to be more crispy and the stallholder was very kind to agree to immediately. Thanks for being customer oriented. I will definitely come back for other items.

PS: The dosai pairs wonderfully with a cup of Ginger O from the stall beside.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861923464679544218/reviews
