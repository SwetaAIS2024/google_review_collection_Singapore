Samuel Lam,5,"A good tasty bowl of mee pok! My favourite is number8. A mixture of prawns, abalone, meat balls in my noodles.

The owner cooks the noodles well and mix’s the noodles to perfection. The chilli and vinegar is a must.

Just a warning, her chilli padi is very very powerful.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103278705053675847980/reviews
Dan P,4,"Somerset Fishball Noodle at Empress Market is a popular stall that draws a long queue during breakfast and brunch hours, which is usually a sign of good food. Despite the crowd, I found that the waiting time was reasonable, as the stall operates quite efficiently. The food was served fairly quickly, which was a pleasant surprise given the number of orders they were handling.

I decided to try the fish dumpling kway teow soup, and it turned out to be quite unique—something I’ve never had before. The fish dumplings had a smooth, chewy texture with a tasty filling inside, and they paired well with the light yet flavorful broth. The kway teow was soft and silky, making it a comforting dish overall. This dish stood out from the usual fishball noodle options, and I’d definitely recommend it if you’re looking for something different.

One thing to note is that while the food is good, the auntie serving the dishes didn’t look very friendly. She might have been feeling stressed from the high volume of orders, so I wouldn’t take it personally. The service is still efficient, which is what matters most.

I’d love to return to try their abalone noodles next time, as they seem to have quite a variety of options on the menu. However, if you’re driving, be prepared for some delays when entering or exiting the multi-storey carpark, as traffic can get quite congested during peak meal periods.

Overall, Somerset Fishball Noodle is worth a visit for its unique offerings and fast service, as long as you don’t mind the busy atmosphere!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113338739131835413171/reviews

Stan L,4,"Good value, tasty food, quality ingredients. The texture of the fishballs is good - none of that factory-made toughness. They use bottled Maggi ketchup instead of those large cans of tasteless ketchup. The serving is huge for $4. Not sure what happened with the other reviewers, but the stall operators were friendly.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103246641418990496624/reviews
Saifu Angto,4,"A good place to get fish ball noodles for a very reasonable price.  Super quick service, and reasonable serving size.  Ordered the small #2 for $3.50.  Especially like the thick flat yellow noodle.  Usually open till late in the afternoon and busy starting in the morning.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews
