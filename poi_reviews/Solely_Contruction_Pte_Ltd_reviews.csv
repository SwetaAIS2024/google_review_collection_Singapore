theboylifeisinthe dark,1,The company is very rude and exploitative of the salaries. I can't get MoM every time. The dormitories are dirty and worn. The toilets are disgusting. The dormitories in Yangon are clean. I have to warn you that the next people will suffer. There are only 150 Burmese restaurants. They have already cut 180 from the salary.,12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100612221519236245325/reviews
