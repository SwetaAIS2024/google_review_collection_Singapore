Do yourself a favor—do not order anything to eat unless you enjoy deep regret. The only redeeming item was the milk tea with grass jelly, which was just average. A hard pass for food lovers.",

We were a party of 7.\n\nOrdered some of the local dishes like the fried mee Siam, chicken briyani, local Kaya butter toasts, fried rice, noodle soup and chicken chop.\n\nAll the food was good especially the fried rice. But the briyani rice could be better. The chicken was also not hot enough on the briyani. Interestingly the Kaya was good and we bought 5 more tins after our meal. Prices were reasonable and the services ok only.",
