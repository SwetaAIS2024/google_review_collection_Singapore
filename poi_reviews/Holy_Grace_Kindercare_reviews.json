      "text": "Would not recommend this kindergarten purely on the basis that the management team are not actually concerned with the well being of the child. Although they have good teachers from time to time, there is an extremely high turnover of these teachers due to the way the management runs the kindergarten. Expect the child to have at least 1 change of teacher within a school year. The kindergarten hides behind the narrative of being supported by a church but the management does not practice the good values that they purport to inculcate in the children. If you are a non Singapore citizen, expect to be discriminated upon when it comes to implementation of any policies. If you are a Singapore citizen, expect to face unfair policies (e.g. Fee refunds) if the government does not step in to provide any guidance (e.g. COVID-19 fee refund).",

      "text": "My girl has been attending HGK since last year and she’s been excited and happy to attend school everyday. She comes back reciting all the mandarin songs and poems she learnt from school, and my wife and I can in fact pick it up from her and recite it back to the teacher the next day. The teachers are very patient with my girl, especially when she’s very inattentive at times. The teachers are also very meticulous as my girl has specific needs that requires attention. We are happy with her learning (which is evident) and we are affirmed by the choice to continue putting her in HGK. On top of that, the school environment is good. Separated classrooms and designated music room, garden and spacious indoor play space for activities such as water play and cycling. Oh and add to that a free basement carpark for those rainy days. Payments and refunds were prompt by the admin and the figures were well-explained as opposed to a separate review. All in all, I would def recommend HGK to other parents. Thank you and well done HGK!\n\nPs I don’t usually leave a review but I honestly don’t think HGK deserves a 1.5 rating so here is my honest review!",
