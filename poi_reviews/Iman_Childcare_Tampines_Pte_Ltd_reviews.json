Apparently, the school didn't allow me to do so.\nWhich was weird, as even full-time Madrasahs would do that, if it is for the betterment of the child's well-being.\nMy constructive feedback: School has to listen to *both* sides of stories if they co-parent, especially if it is for the child's well-being.\nThank you, all in all, and may Allah bless your effort.",
