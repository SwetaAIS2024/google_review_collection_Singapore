Yelena Tannanova,5,"Great japanese language school for folks who prefer a slower pace. Minna no Nihongo is used for the beginner classes, which imo is a pretty solid choice because it uses kanji right from the start (even kanji beyond n5/n4 levels) - as someone with a rudimentary grasp of hanzi, it's a lot easier to remember kanji+hiragana/yomikata over pure hiragana/yomikata.

Teachers seem to be uniformly nice and approachable as well, and it's easy to switch between classes if you aren't meshing well with a particular teacher's teaching style. TLDR: Highly recommended :)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103496075346769834523/reviews
