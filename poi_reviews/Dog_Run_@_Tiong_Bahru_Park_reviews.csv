Jeroemy,5,"A nice and small dog run that’s situated right in Tiong Bahru park, directly opposite Gan Eng Seng. I think it’s a great space that’s close by housing estates to take the fur friends to interact with other dogs, which helps to stimulate them.

It’s really nice that it’s also situated in a park, because you can take your dog to walk around Tiong Bahru park to get some energy out before taking it to the dog run.

Only gripe I have is that the ground in the dog run can get a bit muddy/retains moisture despite it being very bright, sunny & hot. Not sure if it’s because of the type of ground/soil used. But it has ever since gotten better overtime",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113002867544321957411/reviews

Frank Andersson,4,"Good when not busy. Too many use it when leaving their brain art home. Wish they would forbid toys and balls in the park, too many accidents happen because of that and human interference. Dogs are fully capable of entertaining themselves.
Benches, water and water bowls at the park.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100236845804563648844/reviews
Clarence L,3,"This dog run is set in the beautiful surroundings of Tiong Bahru Park but unfortunately is not useable, although it remains open, as it is too muddy.
There probably needs to be some intentional draining of the area, especially the entrance to the enclosure, & placement of sand to dry the ground, given that the weather is never too dry for long enough to enable the ground to dry naturally!

*Update: Have since visited again & the muddy areas have been filled with sand, making the surface more durable, although still less-than-ideal vs grass with good drainage. A water tap & benches have also been installed.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115177177756309455851/reviews
