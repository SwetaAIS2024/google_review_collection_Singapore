We were able to upgrade 1 side to a chilli cheese fries and another to onion rings for a minimal top up fee. At the condiment station we were surprised to see that we were able to help ourselves to unlimited salsa and chopped onions. The service staffs were pleasant and friendly too.",

I inadvertently left my handphone at the counter and went upstairs to wait for the meal.\n\nWhen I realised that my phone was missing, I went back to the counter and the lady at the counter had kept my phone and returned it to me. I would like to thank her for her act of kindness.\n\nThe burgers were prepared well and the fries were fresh and crispy.\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant was great!\n\nDefinitely worth repeat visits here.",

      "text": "Excellent burgers! Always loved Carl's Jr with their freshly made burgers. Excellent fries and onion rings - crunchy and freshly made. Milkshake was slightly sweet, but that is what we expected when we chose it. My only complaint is the environment. Inside is super cold!! I had to move from indoors to outdoors as it was just too cold to stay inside. Manage the environmental controls, and this becomes a prefect location for a good burger at affordable pricing.",

But students started rolling in around 12:30pm.\n\nThey actually have condiments at the condiments station unlike the other outlets.\n\nI didn’t know they served sweet potato balls and it’s actually pretty good. And their promo is also a really good deal. I hope they still have it regularly.\n\nThe only gripe I have is that the chili cheese fries being too salty.",
