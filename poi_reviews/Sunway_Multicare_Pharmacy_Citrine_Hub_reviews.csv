Mimi Kan,5,"Was greeted warmly by a male staff when I first stepped into the pharmacy. After I pointed my freshly wounded knee to him, he quickly offered me a seat and together with a kind lady pharmacist immediately sprang into action to help me with picking up medical supplies and dressings for my wounded knee. They even assisted with dressing up the wound and gave calm assurances. I am grateful for their kind and compassionate gestures. Without doubt the friendly and kind staff made my day despite the pain I suffered from the wound.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102250517613750355597/reviews
