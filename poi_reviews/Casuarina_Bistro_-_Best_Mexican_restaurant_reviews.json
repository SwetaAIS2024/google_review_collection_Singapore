I was there for Mexican food and we had nacho and tacos and chimichangas. Food was quite good and the fish tacos are worth a mention. Prices are decent and portions are decent.\nOverall this place is a unique combination of food range, restaurant and bar. Will return for beer and food the next time in the evenings.",

We ordered different types of nachos, tacos, quesadillas, burritos and chimichangas to share and all were delicious, authentic and were large portions at reasonable prices. There was also a beer promo for 3 pints for only $30. Service was quick and attentive probably because there was only one other group of customers. It was pretty quiet for dinner. Will definitely come back to try their other Mexican dishes.",

      "text": "Our server Sunder - very friendly and helpful guy - recommended their signature fish tacos and lo and behold the best fish tacos I‚Äôve ever had in 2025! The combination of the spicy sauce, guacamole, sour cream and the slaw together with the fish tacos that was PHAT and juicy, crispy outside and tender inside. Amazing stuff! Will be coming back for this.\n\nOn the other hand, tried the steak which looked unassuming BUT the cut is so good?! Though a tad overdone, it was simply juicy and tender and the fatty parts melted in my mouth creating the most amazing steak taste. Pasta was supposed to be aglio olio but it came with a tomato paste? Tasted good though I liked it ü•∞",
