Extremely disappointing quality of the White Bee Hoon which is supposed to be their signature. It was a total opposite of what the main branch always served, probably due to a lack of QC across its outlets? The waiting time was also too long, which was not what I've experienced at the main branch despite the Sembawang outlet having way more customers during peak dining hours. Not worth the premium price paid for this quality of food, and it was a totally unpleasant dining experience. I don't think it's nice for their customers to experience this standard of their dishes, as it clearly doesn't reflect the true quality as set consistently by the main branch. Hope the management does something about the food quality here."", 'languageCode': 'en'}","{'text': ""I've always been a patron of the main branch in Sembawang so I visited the IMM branch since I was around the area and loved the food.
