Was not disappointed as we had a great time learning about mosses, how to care for them and the basics of terrarium landscaping. The founder, Ming Kuang, is a humorous and down to earth terrarium expert who will guide you through the building process patiently. After 2 hours, you’ll head home with a handcrafted masterpiece and pleasant memories.\nWhile location is not the most convenient, there are many cafes nearby for you to build a day’s worth of itinerary around.",

He was more than willing to answer my inquires, about the different types of terrariums, how to take better care of the terrariums, the workshops they offer and, how he started up his company from scratch, was also inspiring.\nThe terrarium that i had purchased was a perfect idea for a gift as well, and it looked incredible! Overall, it was one of the best customer interactions I’ve had so far and it was worth every penny I’ve spent, did not regret my purchase! :)",
