Carol T,5,I should hv given this review earlier but nonetheless is better late than never. After seeing many good reviews about PainFix I decided to give it a try. It was last year when I had this pain on my shoulder. I couldn't lift my arm straight up & had trouble reaching to my back. I had difficulty doing simple tasks. Went to GP & TCM (accupunture) but didn't really help. On my first visit to PainFix I wasn't prepared for any follow up treatments. Therapist told me that my injury will take more than 1 session to see the result. I was skeptical then but still gave it a try else I wouldn't know if it helps. After the 3rd visit I can feel a great difference & after the 4th I am almost fully recovered. I am very thankful to the friendly therapist that helped me. PainFix can really fixed my pain. So glad that my arm can be flexible again. If u are reading reviews about PainFix give it a try. Never try never know.,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111013608018788113097/reviews
Jeff Chan,5,"I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Master Vivian. Previously, I suffered from unexplained arm pain and visited many doctors without any improvement. Later, a friend recommended a professional physiotherapist to me. From the very first consultation, I felt reassured by her expertise. In just 30 minutes of treatment, I experienced immediate relief. After undergoing several sessions, the pain completely disappeared. Now, I visit once a month for maintenance, which has been highly beneficial for my overall well-being. I sincerely appreciate your exceptional care and dedication. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110195634677573970529/reviews
Lim Chantel,5,"Even though I am less than 25 years old, I have been feeling lower back pain and stiff shoulders for a long time. Senior Therapist Bryan has completely healed me, such that I no longer feel the backache and shoulder pain. It is incredible the work that they do here, no needles, not equipment, just using their hands. Chief Therapist Vivian who conducted my consultation is also attentive with every patient in the clinic, making sure to check up on my treatment regularly. I can’t remember a time when I did not have back pain, and it is incredible that they are able to accurately diagnose the source of the pain, and efficiently remove it from my life forever. Highly recommend this place if you have any pain that has been bothering you, whether small or big!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114920794760073499147/reviews
J C.,5,"Two years ago, I struggled with a severe misalignment in the left side of my lower body, which left me unable to bend even 90 degrees. The pain confined me to bed rest for extended periods, drastically disrupting my daily life. Thankfully, I discovered PainFix Clinic and Vivian, whose expertise became a turning point in my recovery.

Though it took immense effort, I mustered the strength to visit her clinic for an assessment. Vivian’s deep knowledge, patience, and tailored therapy sessions worked wonders. Gradually, her treatments restored my mobility, allowing me to resume my normal routine.

To this day, I return to Vivian for monthly maintenance—a crucial part of managing my physical health as I age and navigate a demanding work life and my regular badminton sessions. Her ongoing care has been invaluable, and I wholeheartedly recommend PainFix Clinic to anyone seeking compassionate, skilled therapy. Vivian didn’t just alleviate my pain; she gave me back my independence.
