Can imagine itâ€™s a nice hangout/convenient spot for residents to get their pizza fix but other than thatâ€¦ will give it a miss.\n\nPrice isnâ€™t that wallet friendly either for the portion size",

The pizza is definitely cooked on the spot and we had a good dinner. Will definitely be visiting often in future to try the other items on the menu",
