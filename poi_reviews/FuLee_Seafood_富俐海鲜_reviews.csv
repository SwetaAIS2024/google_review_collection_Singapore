Amelia Tan,5,Had the red grouper hotpot which was really good value for money for two persons. The fish meat was substantial and fresh. Have gone there twice and consistently good. They were also not stingy with belachan chilli,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106201968820191751094/reviews

yun jing,1,"This is our initial and final visit to your establishment. As evident in the receipt, we ordered the curry fish head and chicken. While there were no issues with the chicken, the fish had an unpleasant odor, resembling drain water. Despite informing the staff about the issue, they suggested cooking it longer. Unfortunately, even after the second attempt, the fish still had the same unpleasant taste. When we sought assistance again, the staff chose to ignore our concerns !!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110555950704190755175/reviews
Scott Ng,3,"Came over for dinner and ordered their signature white bee hoon, Hong Kong style ribs, fried vegetables and the promotion nonya fish tail with rice. Ambience was quite okay since here is a kopitiam or food court. Very bright lights and many bright colors sign boards. Service was prompt and friendly. Price wise was on the affordable side especially  their promotional dish was a steal. Foodwise was good and much better than the average standards. However still can't compare to the restaurant standards. Portion was just right for the average  person. Overall a good dining experience over at the food court which has a lot more food variety to offer. So a strong 3 stars for me.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113822134459298973109/reviews
Denise L,4,"Went on a Sunday night at around 7pm, waited for around 20 mins for the food.
$13 assam fish tail looks quite messy when served, taste spicy also.
Prawn paste chicken is very crispy but not salty.
Tofu was good.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101498022192398766194/reviews
