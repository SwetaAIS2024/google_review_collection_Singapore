      "text": "Date visited: 11 May 2025, Sunday\nTime visited: ~2100\n\nHorrible experience! I have been to this restaurant many times but this was by far the worst experience yet. I ordered 2 drinks, 3 dishes, 1 appetiser, and 3 rice. One dish came before the rice. No cutlery was given. It was only given after the first dish came. Rice came after. A staff came to our table and too away the cutleries before we even took any cutleries, also didn’t ask if we still needed it. Had to tell the staff we’re still waiting for  more dishes to come. They then returned the cutleries back to our table. The other dishes came one by one and not all at once. Another staff came to our table and just took the cutleries without asking AGAIN.\n\nOne of the dishes that we ordered was salted egg chicken (in the pic). My boyfriend and I collectively ate less than 10 pieces of chicken from the WHOLE MEDIUM SIZED DISH. MEDIUM. I paid $26 for a MEDIUM SIZED DISH only for it to be mostly fried flour. Tell me why the dish is called salted egg chicken if 3/4 of the dish is fried flour? Other than that, another dish we ordered was onion omelette. It can pretty burnt on the top. Tasted ok but salt wasn’t mixed in properly. The last dish was fried beef Kai lan. It was tasteless for the most part. The only thing I could taste was the garlic and the beef had that frozen taste. The only food item that was good was the cuttlefish dough fritters.\n\nThe space between tables are also very tight. Even the waiters and waitresses who are on the smaller side struggle to squeeze through. Also, you have to push your chair all the way in if you don’t want to get bumped into or almost get hit by the big trays they’re carrying.\n\nReally disappointed by the service above anything. The food was so overpriced and disappointing to look at once it came. I really thought the price would be justified after it came but nope. Please reconsider coming to this restaurant. Just head to the Tang Tea House at Simpang Bedok.",

When I informed the manager, her lack of surprise was deeply concerning, suggesting this is not the only time this has happened. The apparent acceptance of such unsanitary conditions, especially where food is served, is appalling. If you value hygiene, please do yourself a favor and eat elsewhere. This place is clearly not maintained to acceptable standards.",

We tried several dishes and particularly enjoyed the chicken satay, stingray, and fried kway teow. However, the signature dried beehoon fell a bit short of our expectations. While we had a great dining experience and enjoyed the food, it would be even better if they could reduce the oil for a less greasy finish. The restaurant is also offering a 20% discount promotion for Grab payment.",
