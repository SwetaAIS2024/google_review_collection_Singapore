The bungalow is big with 2 rooms downstairs and a room upstairs, the Aircon works great, there's BBQ pit with lotsa sittings outside and outdoor dining table and all this with sea view of big ships passing by. The outdoor has total space of like half of the soccer field from the entrance to everything except the house. Yeah it's big private space we're talking here.",

Which means you'll have to pay for the usage of lawn as well. But it's worth every penny! Will blog about this venue soon.",
