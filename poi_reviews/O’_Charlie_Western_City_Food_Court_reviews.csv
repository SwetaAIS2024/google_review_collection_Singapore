X C,4,"Chicken chop ($8) and fries were nice though I thought the portion could have been more generous given the price. Instant mashed potatoes tasted a little weird to me, will omit next time. It‚Äôll be good if baked beans could be offered as a side.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116460421482938982554/reviews
Wanping Koh,5,I love the old school chicken chop. Nostalgia and taste great üëç Everything in the plate is nice. Reasonably priced also.  The coffee shop can get quite crowded and warm during lunch. Go early.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109224939018544216535/reviews
Justin Mah,5,"Second time ordering on Deliveroo. Food tastes good and large quantity is given.

One set has the mains, fries, mashed potato and coleslaw (3 sides) which is more than usual western food around, no compromise on the quantity too.

Fries is not the usual shoestring fries that tastes cheap but a thicker one and has something like cajun powder on it.

Mashed potato is very creamy and thick so it pairs well overall with the fries and main.

Boss was also nice enough to change some sides for me when I called.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108917268612824515736/reviews
Raynold Toh,3,"Ordered the chicken chop and grilled fish takeaway. Fries were chunky and not soggy. Chicken and fish were average, nothing to shout about, maybe they lacked seasoning. Mushroom sauce was üòñ, quite watery and tasteless...",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101539374315793409069/reviews
Derriaus Chia,5,"Thinking of gatekeeping but good things must share right?

Better than a lot of restaurants out there!

Ordered the Chicken Chop pasta with cream.

1. Pasta isn‚Äôt overcooked. ‚úÖ
2. The cream is thick and has an aroma. ‚úÖ‚≠êÔ∏è
3. Chicken chop is fresh, not dry. A little bit more charred would be perfect. ‚úÖ
4. Mushroom sauce is ok. Don‚Äôt have those instant taste. ‚úÖ

Will be back for more!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102849958111768898804/reviews
