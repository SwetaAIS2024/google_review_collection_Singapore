The cubicle number S1 for the ladies toilet when you enter, please do not go to the extreme left cubicle, there is no water at all,  after I have removed all my clothes and wanted to take a good bath,I was so mad. Then I just go to the next cubicle,the water came out as a midst water!!! My goodness!!!! At the end I just wipe clean pack and go home.\n\nI hope the MP of  the Yio Chu Kang read this review, go and have a spot check.\n\nPls don't have a shower there ,just go home and bath.",
