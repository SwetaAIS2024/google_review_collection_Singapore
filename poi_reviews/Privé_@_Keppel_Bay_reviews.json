Comments from our table;: food portion is good for sharing; food quality surprisingly good. Shout out to Mok together with Gary and team did a great job attending to us.  (Didn‚Äôt take the rest of food pics as we arrived separately.) drinks were $9 per glass. Can try Vietnamese chicken chop. Mushroom pizza was good too!",

The team was also quick to help when the sudden downpour came and groups of outdoor diners had to move to tables to avoid the pelting rain. Ms R and the blond male wait staff (sorry didn‚Äôt get your names but you were so kind to elderly diners‚ù§Ô∏è) managed the lunch crowd so well and gave my guest a birthday cake surprise too! We had a great time thanks to both of you!",

Pizza Margareta was good but don't put the basil leaves in to bake. Put it in 30 sec before it's ready. 1 leaf per slice would be nice presentation.",
