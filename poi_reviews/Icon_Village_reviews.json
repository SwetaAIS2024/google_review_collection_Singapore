Personal favourites are Nick Vina Artisan for great bakes and Alice boulangerie.\n\nThere are plenty choices for brunches, meals, evening drinks and dinner.\n\nThe mall is designed with 2 main passage which gets somewhat confusing to locate certain eateries at times.\n\nIt is just 3 mins walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT.",
