Sarhan,5,"Stopped by here as my wife had a $20 off for her birthday month. Ordered the ramyeon and it totally hit the spot! Flavor was legit, and the portion was a lot. Terrence, the manager, was attentive & super friendly even after we did not hit the minimum spending for the discount. Appreciate his sincerity. Definitely coming back for another bowl soon!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108318036935971279843/reviews
Wendy Mar,5,"Enjoyed our lunch at our favourite restaurant of all times. Food standard is as good as ever. Free flow of side dishes like kimchi. Most enjoyable part of the meal is the friendliness of Crystal, the service ambassador. She was very welcoming and warm the moment we stepped into the restaurant. She recommended the dishes and we tried and we loved them! She will come and check on us to ensure that we are enjoying our meal. The celery crush drink and the new ice cream dessert are worth trying. Thank you for your impeccable service,Crystal! ",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103748512269087148753/reviews

FRS,5,"Had my first dinner at Seoul Garden Hotpot IMM, and it was a wonderful experience. I was attended by Crystal and Aunty Connie, who were both incredibly friendly, attentive, and hardworking. Their warm hospitality made me feel welcomed right from the start.

They gave great food recommendations, and their service throughout the meal was truly exceptional. Itâ€™s not every day you meet staff who are so dedicated and genuine.

A big thank you to Crystal and Aunty Connie â€” keep up the fantastic work!
