Timothy TM,3,"Very old mall but has many good stalls, eg. Giant at basement level, bubble tea, plenty of good and cheap hairdressers, McDonald’s, some excellent restaurants (Thai, Korean, western), food court at top floor, massage parlours, and tuition classes. It’s next to Beauty World MRT station so it’s just matter of time before it gets many upgrades and more interesting shops.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116897826354325250403/reviews
