Visit them soon :))\n\nThe red line station can be warm sometimes due to crowding & aircon under service. Friendly SMRT staff.\n\nLandmarks: Newton Food Centre (famous for BBQ seafood, prawn mee, duck noodles, Thai food, Nasi Padang etc.)\n\nPrudential@Scotts, NEA, Sheraton Towers, Alliance France.",

The downtown line is probably one of the best addition to the rail system. Efficient, clean, and not a very long walk from the Blue to the Red lines, compared to some other interchanges.",

The station is quite new as Downtown line only like 3 years ago. This station is one of the few stations that requires tap out to transfer in order to get to the Downtown or North South platform or exits located in this station. This station around in the vicinity has a some condominiums found here. There is a food Center located in this station’s exits (If I remember, to get to the food Center, it is at Exit A). This is the only interchange station that is really quiet as there isn’t any shopping malls located in Newton…",
