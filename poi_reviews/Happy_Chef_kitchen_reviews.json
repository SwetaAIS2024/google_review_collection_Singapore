      "text": "Tried the braised pork belly with potatoes and shredded cabbage. Absolutely loved the pork belly dish which is mildly spicy due to it being cooked with chinese style dried chilli. The braised pork has more fatty parts than lean and is cooked till really tender. Combined with the potatoes in the rice drenched with the gravy and it was heavenly! The shredded cabbaged is also good with hints of wok hei.\n\nThe century egg dish looks good and I originally wanted to buy it but the stall assistance said not available. There are weekday promos for some dishes. Will be coming back.\n\nNote that this stall is located in the coffeeshop  just below the multi-storey carpark. Not to be confused with the one at the Happy Hawker coffeeshop which has limited menu.",
