Jarrett Blaustein,5,"The food is too good. I came for the $4 Asahi and left with a belly full of amazing, freshly cooked tapas with fresh ingredients and wonderfully balanced flavour. Youâ€™d pay 4x the price in Australia for the quality of food and 10x the price in London, assuming you could find it.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112407209606208896825/reviews
