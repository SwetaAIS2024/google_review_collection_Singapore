Zozo,5,"authentic Japanese cuisine at unbeatable prices. From succulent fresh sashimi to expertly crafted dishes, every bite transport your senses to the heart of Japan.

Stepping in, the space is divided into two levels, with the ground floor featuring a food preparation area surrounded by counter seating, like Omakase style. In contrast, the second level offers the regular dining tables, ideal for groups of four to six. The venue's interior showcases a unique Japanese aesthetic, incorporating wood elements and furnishings throughout.

We start our food fest with a luxurious lineup: Ikura Chawan Mushi for a unami-ness kick, Tempura Moriawase for a crispy variety, Mizayaki A5 Wagyu Bento for a rich indulgence, Scallop Kakiage Ramen for a noodly delight, Chirashi Don for a fresh ocean taste mix, and Salmon Bara to round it all off.

Overall, Konoha Japanese Cuisine stands out as a genuinely down-to-earth establishment that delivers high-quality Japanese dishes at affordable prices, offering exceptional taste and value.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109173464175521287422/reviews
Limzy,5,"Comfortable cosy casual Japanese restaurant serving quality food. No gst only service charge. Ordered the agedashi tofu, pork katsu curry don, and yakiniku don. All the dishes were excellent. Yakiniku was especially flavourful. Pork katsu was crispy outside tender inside. Curry was smooth but quite spicy. Tofu was silky smooth.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116700878853534773356/reviews

Daphne Leong,5,"Can’t decide to write this review or not, because sometimes you want hidden gems to remain hidden!

Chawanmushi, topped with translucent umami bombs of Ikura and freshly zested yuzu, is one of the best I’ve tasted.

Shio ramen and Beef udon were deliciously comforting, flavours were always on point I haven’t had a chance to try other rice or noodles on the menu

The transparent Mochi with the creamy centre has a lovely texture, satisfying despite lacking in sweetness.

Chef seems pretty traditional, the sake were from a traditional brewery as well - Gekkeikan. Sushi counter seats or upstairs seating so if you want a lot of attention (or not) you know what to do.

Thanks for the satisfying yummy food!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108841615788121623519/reviews
Alan Liem,5,"Had our anniversary celebration with Konoha and we were treated to an 8 course splendid dining experience. Place is cosy and family accommodating. Chef was very flexible to allow on the spot options for non raw and non beef diet restrictions. Food was fresh and tasty. Staff were friendly, warm and attentive. Overall a wonderful exclusive dining experience. Will come again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109757653166670829551/reviews
