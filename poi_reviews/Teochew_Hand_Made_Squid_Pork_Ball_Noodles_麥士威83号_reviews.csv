Davis Tan,3,"Ordered the $8.50 mix soup with Kuay teow. Came with 2x fishball, meatball, squid ball, slice of lean pork meat. Taste were just average. The meat were overcooked, meatball was flavourful, squid ball taste bland and the fishball have a soft non chewy bite. The Kuay teow is also bland without much favour, maybe I requested for just a little chilli. Overall a average bowl of noodle that is not very value for $.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116995118433894351591/reviews
Merryheart,5,"Chanced upon this hand made squid ball & pork ball noodles and was pleasantly surprised how good it was.  This was the best squid balls I have had in Singapore.  The texture was so bouncy, springy, crunchy upon the first bite. The taste was very intense with a rich natural savoury squid taste, probably with some pork lard.  Their pork balls were very good too, made with minced pork exquisitely complemented with a profile of dried cuttlefish.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101391398296811227556/reviews

Max S.,5,"Tasty bowl of noodles! I would recommend to add extra vinegar as it adds that extra kick to the meal. Really enjoyed the noodles thatâ€™s cooked to perfection. The fishball and meatball were really good but sotong ball i have had better ones.
