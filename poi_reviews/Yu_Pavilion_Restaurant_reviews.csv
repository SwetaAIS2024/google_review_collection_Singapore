The Travel Hunter,5,"The Dim Sum was freshly prepared and exceptionally delicious. The Siew Mai, prawn dumplings, were executed surprisingly well. The service was excellent, and the price point was reasonable. Highly recommended.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112702441126152817912/reviews

Tucked away in the upper floors of Heartland Mall, Yu Pavilion is a small and cozy restaurant serving up dim sum and authentic local chinese cuisine. We came on a weekday evening for dinner when it was not too crowded, and here’s what we got to share:

𝗛𝗮𝗹𝗳 𝗕𝗲𝗶𝗷𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗥𝗼𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗗𝘂𝗰𝗸 / 半只北京烤鸭
This was the absolute star of the show! The Peking duck had glistening and crispy skin, with a thin layer of fat hidden underneath atop the tender duck meat. This paired perfectly with the spring onions, cucumber, and sweet sauce wrapped in that thin pancake we know of. We opted for the remaining duck meat to be cooked in Ee-fu noodles and it was really good!

𝗕𝗹𝘂𝗲𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗿𝘆 𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗽𝘆 𝗣𝗿𝗮𝘄𝗻 / 蓝莓虾球
We were honestly surprised by how good this turned out. The prawns were coated in a thin batter and it’s seafood savouriness was very well complemented by the tangy blueberry sauce. We would get this again!

𝗦𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗕𝗿𝗮𝗶𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗣𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗕𝗲𝗹𝗹𝘆 / 招牌红烧扣肉
This dish featured many strips of braised pork belly which was to be wrapped in their steamed buns. It did get a bit salty and oily for us towards the end.

𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗼𝗽 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗕𝗹𝗮𝗰𝗸 𝗙𝘂𝗻𝗴𝘂𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗔𝘀𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗴𝘂𝘀 / 云儿芦笋带子
A standard vegetable dish to provide us with the seafood and greens. It was definitely essential but was nothing to shout about.

Honestly, this restaurant surpassed our expectations. You can surely tell that the chefs know their stuff, and the dining experience here was unique and pleasant.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102701618033288060462/reviews
Han Wei Woo,5,A hidden gem in the heartlands. Food was very fresh and delicious. Love the Peking Duck and it serve with egg skin wrap rather than your usual popiah skin. Very nice place to dine in with your family.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104523913485995862949/reviews
Alexander John Villanueva,5,Easily one of the best tasting Cantonese food I've had. It's not too expensive too. In yung picture is a coconut dessert which was really refreshing. They have innovative dishes like the blueberry prawns which is the best I've ever had. Would love to be here again.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110816087744874093034/reviews
Zozo,5,"We ordered

Half Beijing Roasted Duck
This dish is absolutely irresistible, boasting perfectly crispy skin and juicy, tender meat. Each bite offers a satisfying crunch, followed by an explosion of flavour that leaves me wanting more. For an additional $10, we opted for a second preparation method, transforming it into braised Ee Fu noodles with duck meat. The combination of the rich sauce and delightful chewy noodle texture, paired with the tender duck meat, results in an incredibly delicious experience.

Braised Pork Belly with served steamed bun
Don't judge this Braised Pork Belly by its appearance - despite seeming fatty, it's surprisingly not, and its exceptional quality shines through with each savory, melt-in-your-mouth bite, infused with the distinct aroma of Chinese Five Spice and the depth of dark soya sauce. Have it with steam bun is another level

Blueberry Crispy Prawn
Experience a truly unique flavour that will leave a lasting impression, combining the rich seafood umami with the sweet and tangy fruitiness of berries.

Scallops and Black Fungus with Asparagus
A gourmet delight for the taste buds! Savour the succulent scallops and crisp asparagus in every flavorful bite!

Btw, service is super worth mention!! All staffs very friendly and very attentive.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109173464175521287422/reviews
