Size of chicken is pathetic.\n\nCoffee is so bad too. Bad burnt smell.\n\nOrdered soft boiled eggs. More than 15mins still not served. Asked staff about it and he said they forgot about the order…\n\nRestaurant has a weird odour too.\n\nWould give zero stars if I could.",

Saw some very interesting dishes like the Hakka chwee kuay and ordered one to go. Reasonably priced at RM6 for a large slap of the chwee kuay. Ordered a Kaya and butter toast as well and a coffee and an ice mixed coffee and tea.\n\nThe toast wasn’t outstanding, just like the ones I made myself at home. But the chwee kuay was nice. Though we would have preferred it hot. The toppings had a pretty generous shrimp bits which went very well with the plain chwee kuay. The drinks were very local which we liked.",
