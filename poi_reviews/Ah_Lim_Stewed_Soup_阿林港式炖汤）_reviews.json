      "text": "Very nice double boiled soup store at Bt Batok East Ave 3 coffee shop! So far I been ordering the Black bean pork rib soup for past occasions. The store is generous in adding the black beans to the soft ribs.\n\nYou can't wait to finish all the beans even though with the brown rice and the soup will make you feel very full. The pork ribs are using soft rib bones and they are also generous in this. The soup is not too oily and tasty with the blackness from brewing with black beans.\n\nThere are over 20 dishes to choose from and I am not sure when I will finish trying all these soups! Likely it will take an intense month to try all these steamed dishes.\n\nThis store is also available in Grab Food.",

      "text": "The friendly folks at Ah Lim churn out really good authentic soup. It's easy to tell good soup from poor ones, or you could just rely on your taste buds. I've not sampled everything on the menu, but so far nothing has disappointed me.\n\nHowever this place is very popular so they tend to sell out early. And if you come during peak hours, you'll have to bear with the queue. I don't mind though, as they are so satisfying.",

Personally love the cordycep flower chicken soup and the pig's stomach pepper soup. The emperor chicken is good and sizeable, adequate for two pax for a meal. The steam items are nice and completes the meal for someone looking for a heartier meal. Sells out pretty fast by the late afternoon. Great nourishing soup that's superb comfort food!",
