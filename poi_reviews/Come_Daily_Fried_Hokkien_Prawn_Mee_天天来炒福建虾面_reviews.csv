YY,4,"Wasn‚Äôt expecting such a long wait for my plate of Hokkien mee during lunch time since it‚Äôs generally empty in the early mornings when I‚Äôm here for breakfast - but had to wait 30 minutes on a weekday when I ordered at 1239 hrs, understandably so since it‚Äôs peak lunch hour.

That said, the plate of Hokkien mee was good in general, I believe there were some clams in there which I had to pick out, flavours wise was good and portion was alright for $5.

I would return if there‚Äôs a shorter wait, but not if it‚Äôs another 30 minutes one.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews

Dale Mac,3,"Not one for me unfortunately...

The entire dish, to me, was a singular monotonous non-descript plate of homogeneous tasting ingredients braised together and sloppily served...

The 30 minute wait has nothing to do with my comments because I don't mind waiting for good food and respect the time it takes to prepare it as well...

But I won't need to have this one again...

These are my personal views so please give it a try if you're in the area and decide for yourselves ‚úåüèº

ps. No food was wasted",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113950514812482140406/reviews
MAX LEW Z E,3,"30 minute wait time during the lunch crowd period, ordered the largest portion at $10.The dish came with 4 decently-sized prawns and sotong/squid, but no pork belly so I was slightly disappointed. The pork lard was actually added with the noodles during the cooking phase itself, which was interesting. The mixture of noodles in this hokkien mee was thick bee hoon + yellow noodles. I wasn't a fan of their chilli, but just my preference as I prefer sambal belachan for my hokkien mee. My immediate reaction when putting the noodles in my mouth was : "" wah supper eggy "", and it's quite evident from the photo that they add a lot of egg into their noodles. My major con however was this richness and sweetness from the noodles, perhaps MSG? This made the whole dish feel really jelak/surfeiting after 5-6 mouthfuls. Maybe not my preference so I don't think I'll be back, although I won't say that this is a bad bowl of hokkien mee. Staff were friendly though üòä",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102841234723242817751/reviews
H R,4,"Perhaps my expectations were high due to the hype. I felt the gravy wasn‚Äôt tasty until I added the lard (you had to request this separately) and lime. Overall it was decent and I would eat it if I‚Äôm around the area and the queue isn‚Äôt long.
Ps: do note it‚Äôs cash only.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116103776742775295409/reviews
