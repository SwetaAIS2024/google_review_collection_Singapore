With a rotating selection of locally brewed beers that are as diverse as the crowd they attract.\n\nYou can bring your favorite dishes from nearby restaurants. Sometimes there's random potluck  organised by the regulars that everyone is welcome to try out!\n\nWho are the regulars? a wonderfully eccentric bunch, often seem to be in their own world. But they know when to make way for newcomers to feel welcomed!\n\nThey may not look like friends, but they're bonded by a shared love of craft beer. They cheer when a tap runs out ‚Äî because they know that a freshly brewed keg is coming up.",

Prices are better than other similar spots around Singapore. You can bring in food in fact they encourage you to do so. Really enjoyed my first visit. Won't be my last.",
