Sihan Goi,5,"This place doesn't serve the best food and drinks, but our deserves 5 stars at its price point. Food and drinks are decent but not fantastic. The chicken chop is slightly better than food court quality but plated better. Portions are small,but food is very cheap. Service is adequate and mostly self service. Ambience is pretty good as well, bright and spacious.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101606206460809087168/reviews
Kelvin Chye,5,"A surprising find inside ITE College Central. Located all the way inside the campus. Didn't expect to find a trendy looking cafe inside. They served some nice drinks, snacks and western dishes. Would visit again to try their other offerings. Too bad their opening hours are short and limited. Closed on Sunday.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117999709976505884094/reviews
lynn,5,"Note: you’ll need to +$1 to the prices if you’re not an ITE staff.

I enjoyed my grain bowl, and appreciated the good range of ingredients available for order. Vegetables were nicely seasoned and cooked too - they weren’t too salty and the veggies were a nice green color.

I visited on a Monday 12pm, and it was packed with students as it was their lunch break. It began to quiet down around 1pm, so I think that would be a better time to visit if you’re thinking of getting some work done.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113035353984436054163/reviews
Choo HengHeng,5,"The sour dough waffle crispy chicken is good , especially its batter .The Salad bowl chicken is tasty . I can imagine the rest of the food should be as good as what we have ordered . Greatest satisfaction is the price , so friendly to the pockets . Definitely will return for the rest in the menu. Today (9/9/2023) is my second visit , still as good as what we have tasted . Keep it up !",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106562069610360478877/reviews
yin yang,4,"I came all the way down
As much as it is commendable that u guys people with disabilities for the cashier, i think there is still room for improvement in terms of communication. Sometimes we can attempt to go against nature but sometimes it is wiser to not force fit nature  . If a fish belongs in the water it should not come up to land.

The matcha cup doesnt have handle hence it is hot to hold it , i need to wait for it to cool down before able to hold it.

The food and drink was served in two intervals and not together",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110447409122862409272/reviews
