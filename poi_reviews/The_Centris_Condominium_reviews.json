Many schools nearby such as Canadian International School, Frontier Primary, River Valley High and few others Primary and Secondary schools as well.\n\nSheltered & linked to Jurong Point via Residence glass entrance from B1, L1 and L3 near Malaysia Boleh. Greenery landscape is well maintained with big pool!\n\nCan be more convenient for delivery drivers and visitors by providing a few more pieces of furniture in lobby! ☺️",

Gym is rundown, smelly and small with minimal equipments. The best part is the huge swimming. You can walk to JP without worrying raining or sunny day is thru basement parking at 1A. Alternatively, You can go to level 5 which is also connecting to JP. Hope management can improve the gym.",
