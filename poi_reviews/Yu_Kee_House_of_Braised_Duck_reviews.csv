Kelly Leung,3,"Another neighbourhood braised duck rice shop. Just made it to be the last customer for  my Sun dinner (Google says it closes at 8:30pm on weekends, but the shop stops selling at 7:30pm). Had the Happy Duck Rice ($5) - It tastes ok with fair amount of duck meat. Can come if you are nearby, not worth to travel especially for this.

Other than duck rice , they also sell wanton noodles, fish soup and other hawker food.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104789885423897668628/reviews
Amos Jolly,5,"Kuay chap very good. Duck noodle dry, with some extra thick sauce. Delicious!

Edit March 2024

Have become a regular here with my team. My personal fav is duck noodles(dry version) with extra sauce and extra chilli. It has become a source of comfort in my daily working life.
The rest of the guys are in constant argument on whether the duck rice or kway chap are best.   Either way both delicious. We basically order the full spread everytime we go.
Very value for money as well. Duck, kway chap has all become insanely expensive everywhere but here. Itâ€™s like 2000â€™s pricing. Bowl of kuay for 50c. Seriously?! And itâ€™s real good too. They must be losing money on this.

I hear they keep prices down so the elderly residents can still afford to eat there.

I sometimes even go twice a day to dabao for friends and family for dinner!

Slight negative, because Iâ€™m there so often. Can tell some slight inconsistencies but overall still my fave place to eat in the area. ðŸ˜Ž",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110491566794647065682/reviews
Rong Liang Chia,3,"Just another braised duck rice shop. Nothing fancy about it, and honestly, I am surprised it is still around given it never seems to draw a crowd.

Yu Kee offers kway chap too. Hence being versatile for breakfast and lunch. The food is okay la, nothing really to make me need to come back here. Having duck rice anywhere else would feel the same.

The service is actually okay. But to a point, that sometimes the staff doesn't let you breathe and keeps poking his recommendations while you are trying to decide.

3 stars for being average.

Mark Yeo,4,"Visited this place for lunch after church. Quiet place, spacious seating as they operate within a large ground floor shop unit of a HDB slab block. The 5 of us shared halh a braised duck plus sides which included bean sprouts, preserved veg, braised pork, fish cake and intestines. The duck meat was soft and tender. The three types of chilli made the difference.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102332048638713474085/reviews
jayden,1,"Order via grab delivery, even stared in remarks for extra gravy. Came with totally no gravy at all. So dry how to even eat? Not only dry, dont even have the braised taste without the gravy. Ordered for a meeting with client, totally disappointed and make me look stupid! Had to tell my customer to give me a moment to drive to another place to buy food instead!

No number to call seller, grab taking ages to reply. Totally screw my day.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
