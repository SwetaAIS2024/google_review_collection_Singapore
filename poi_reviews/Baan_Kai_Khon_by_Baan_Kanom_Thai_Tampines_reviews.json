Without hesitation, she prepared a new order for me, ensuring I had the best experience. Truly appreciate the excellent service & dedication.\nThe omelette was decent,  however the fried chicken was  dry. Good that the noodles were not lump together.",

Ordered a Tom Yum chicken fried rice, Tom Yum soup and pandan kueh.\nFried rice was tasteless and dry, soup was very salty and the pandan kueh was just carelessly strewn into the box.\nFor someone who always finishes my food, this is one of the few times I simply could not bear to eat another mouthful and left the rice and soup half eaten.",
