Page Turner,5,"Decided to revisit the place after seeing positive reviews.

Table and cutlery are clean.

Truffle La Mian is so so delicious, generous ingredients with fresh vegetables and mushrooms!
Dim Sum are also equally tasty.

Staff are very good people with friendly vibes. The tall gentleman takes his work seriously. The young lady with glasses is always cheerful and bubbly. The short hair, petite lady is very kind as well. 😊

Blue Pea Nasi Lemak is really nice 👍

Assam Fish with Rice and Bak Chor Mee Dry are my favourite dishes! Generous ingredients with fresh vegetables as always. 😋

Hainanese Curry Chicken Rice tastes like like the real deal! If you close your eyes, to chew, you would not believe it's vegetarian chicken. 😁

这里的素食很好吃。😋🙏

Mee Tai Mak Laksa is simply delicious. Added one more egg to it.

Hainanese Pork Chop Rice is also wonderfully crafted. Also added one egg to the dish.

Kudos to both young ladies and the gentleman who put in great effort in customer and food preparation services.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113293133719563777031/reviews
Gabriel,4,Bak chor mee is rather delicious and flavourful. Truffle la mian could have been better if there was some mock meat added as the default is with zero mock meat. Service crew was polite and friendly. There is limited seats but the crowd is also not alot always so you should be fine even during peak hours.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117387838809977391267/reviews
Benjamin Park,5,Nice place for breakfast. Quiet and chill place with nice decor. The food is affordable and not bad tasting. You save about $2 for their Kaya toast set compared to fun toast. They have an interesting rainbow toast too.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117599988314464672388/reviews
Wie b l,5,"What a rare find! I was in the neighbourhood, saw the vegetarian food, walked in, and simply ""try my luck."" And I was blown away! This is a great place for ""meatless compassionate eating!"" Most of all the taste is uncompromising! Go and try it!
The place is also near to the Punggol waterfront, so the air is good, very breezy, and best of all, it is not crowded--even on a Saturday night. There are crowd at certain times, but not crazy sardine pack crowd (hate it!)
The nasi kampung or nasi rendang is really good. The rice is fragant. The sambal is savoury and not too spicy. The rendang is full on flavours made of Monkeyhead Mushroom, not soy meat. So so so good!
The Bah Chor Mee is also very good. The noodle could be harder, but it is not soft. Blended with the paste with the mock minced meat, plus the wontons, it's really very satisfying.
The laksa has got good colours, quite spicy. I felt that they could do with lesser oil layers on top. But the colour is so vibrant. You may not get the real laksa taste, but seriously, it is not far behind. In fact, I prefer it. It's really good.
The rest were just ""Itchy Mouth"" just to try the Chee Cheong Fun and other stuff. They are up to par and real good value on the overall, a place you can get your ""regular food craving"" fixed.
I would not say it is a Michelin Star restaurant, but it is certainly a great place to eat, have a chat and enjoy the food slowly. Well, eh ambience can be improved... no place is perfect anyway :)",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109201224600301983721/reviews
T Vivian,5,"I visit this shop several times a week for breakfast and they remember the food and drinks I want every time. Although the previous team was excellent, the new little girls and weekend 大姐wearing the spec are also great. Their warm smiles make people feel very friendly every time. The food is also delicious and maintains the same standard. They are serious and work hard and improve. I think Grove is really lucky to have such a sincere and hard-working team again",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115489933675661260632/reviews
