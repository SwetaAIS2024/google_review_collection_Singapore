Juliana Lim,3,"Tried the lemongrass chicken roll, taste was just alrightâ€¦ luckily the sauce was not bad. Price is very affordable for this location. Suitable for a quick bite but certainly not the â€˜yummyâ€™ roll I will come for if I want to fix my Vietnamese cuisine craving.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108648720230543194928/reviews
Angel Tan,5,"Had fresh Vietnamese rolls for lunch twice this week! Liked the rolls (smoked salmon, lemongrass chicken and avocado) and sauces! ðŸ«”",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108844531618530891906/reviews
Zyin W,4,$3++ for such a big roll! The staff provided a quick service during the lunch rush. Iâ€™m surprised too that I can select 3 different dippings. Most probably a dip for a roll.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116916832921600340121/reviews
Matt G,3,Very average lunch from here that included a very dry steak salad and a smoked duck roll. Most items tasted as if they had been made well known advance with no freshness. The one great think was the lemongrass drink. Would recommend many of the other great places in the same complex over this one.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101779009883502926166/reviews
Lim,4,"Itâ€™s not really worth the price for $10.90 for a 3 rolls set, at that price you can buy a salad with more protein and more vegetables that is much more healthy. The set comes with a lemongrass drink that cannot be changed and I felt that itâ€™s not that nice. And the options for the $10.90 set donâ€™t have much options for meat, the rest are all vegan. If you want meat you need to top up at least $1 more. Too expensive in my opinion for what you are getting since the materials are really cheap.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108415029573971248916/reviews
