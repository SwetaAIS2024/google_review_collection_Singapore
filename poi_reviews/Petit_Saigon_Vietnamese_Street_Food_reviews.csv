Spicy beef noodles, mango salad, and pork rice are good. I think Iâ€™m gonna be a loyal customer ðŸ¤­",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108035560329259979557/reviews
P Loh,4,"Foodâ€™s not bad for the price point. Bought on sun evening when they were busy handling many orders. Waited long time to order and also long time for order to be ready, but lady owner was not rude and apologized for the wait.

Pho is not bad with the correct flavour, but I realized that it was missing basil leaves. Not sure why.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106500811268054043566/reviews
amos foong,1,"This auntie has bad attitude. One time, maybe itâ€™s a bad day. Tried this stall 3 times already and the auntie is just plain rude. Needlessly snapped at me. Iâ€™m a customer patronising your stall, Iâ€™m not interested to get snapped at. If you are not happy with serving the customers, maybe you should just not do it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115255552579350643631/reviews
