Peter Tan,1,I just back from your shop. I just kindly ask to your cashier ( slim Indian lady) for pay wave but she showed me very rudely. She must explain nicely to all customers. This is not the first time I had encountered. Please change to your cashier asap. This is very impolite and bad attitude.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103185844247328764261/reviews
