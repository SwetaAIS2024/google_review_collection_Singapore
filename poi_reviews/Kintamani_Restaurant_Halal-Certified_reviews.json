      "text": "Very affordable, delicious and high value buffet, located at Furama Riverfront Hotel. (It is even more worthwhile if you use Chope using weekday lunch.)\n\nAs it is also Halal Certified, it is a excellent place for large group gathering. The large seating area will easily accommodate this.\n\nMost of their cooked dishes are delicious. I love their lamb chop, rendang beef and the chicken. Their soup of the day (Kambing soup/ oxtail soup) is superb.\n\nOther than cooked food, they also offer quite a variety of pastries, cold seafood, fruits and drink.\n\nA definitely happy to eat buffet that is affordable too.",

Think the chef cook and prepare the food quite early before the buffet started . Platter of fruits are soggy been cut or prepare the day before so not really fresh . Overall is a good dining experience",

There was snow crab legs for lunch when I went, even though it seems only for dinner. Could be because of some one-off reason but makes it even more worth.\n\nHowever, the crab (cooked) seems not fresh, loose meat.\n\nThe restaurant looks pretty small so better to reserve during peak periods",
