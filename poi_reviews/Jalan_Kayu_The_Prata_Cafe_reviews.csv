Ivan Loh,2,"I was quite disappointed with Jalan Kayu The Prata Cafe. Having stayed near Jalan Kayu before and frequented the prata shops there, I expected much better. Unfortunately, the food was not good at all, and the kopi was equally underwhelming.

The only positives are that the food is served quickly—great if you're starving—and it’s not expensive. But honestly, the quality isn’t worth it. I’d recommend giving this place a miss.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114542374982525257775/reviews
Vigneshkumar Jayakumar,4,One of the best Indian/Malaysian style hotels in One North offers excellent service. The staff members are proficient in both Tamil and English. Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian food options are available at this restaurant.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111010202860582543427/reviews
Jocelin Lam,3,"We tried mutton curry rice set, meat murtabak, vegetarian rice set, and maggie goreng. Food here was pretty good. I like the maggie goreng I ordered. But it has quite a lot of MSG. My colleague’s meat murtabak was full of meat. Every bite is filled. Mutton was too tough. Overall reasonable food for reasonable price but too much artificial flavouring.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108309078007094838575/reviews
Yas Md,2,"Ordered mutton biryani but the mutton contains more fats than meat. The serving is extremely small. Mutton murtabak has very thin filling and salty. Price is expensive for this serving.

The auntie cashier was also busy on the phone and talking to other staffs and have to be reminded again of order which has not been delivered after 10 mins.

The shop feels warm, with no aircon running within the shop despite it being empty.
Please just close down or improve. Will be te last time eating here.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101471030018563145130/reviews
BK Koh,4,"Had late lunch after 3pm. Service was fast as place was empty.
Teh tarik - one of my personal faves in sg. Not too sweet and right amount of froth.
Dosa masala - not bad. Wished that the accompanying curry was heated up.
Prata - not bad. Personally, would prefer a crisper version. Curry tasted like fish curry and it was yummy. It was warm as it should be and had a bit of spice.
Would come back for my prata fix if I'm in the vicinity.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101331793744939484482/reviews
