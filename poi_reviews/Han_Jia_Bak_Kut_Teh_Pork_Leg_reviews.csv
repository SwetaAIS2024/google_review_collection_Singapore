Brandon Wong,5,"Was there around 12:30pm on a Thursday afternoon. This was one of the few stalls that was open at this food center then. There was a queue during lunch time, expect about 10mins wait. The dry ribs, mei chai and soup were all great - not too oily and salty. There is a drink stall right next door. The whole food center can be very hot during the day.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112124406115202450220/reviews

Bee Huay See,5,"What do you usually eat at East Coast Lagoon Food Centre? Since I tried this Han Jia Bak Kut Teh, itâ€™s become my comfort food and the only food I eat here. The soup is the peppery and herbal type without being overpowering and oh so delicious. I always have a second helping of soup. The ribs are of very good quality, no porky smell and the meat tender and flavourful. I especially like the Dry Ribs. It is about 1/2 a rack of well braised ribs, goes so well with the preserved vegetables that come with it. I have already finished eating everything, absolutely everything before writing this review, thus only photos of the stall. Give it a shot ~ it is yummy!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109930295126514795969/reviews
Ivan Teh,5,"Bak Kut Teh (SGD $10.90) @ Han Jia Bak Kut Teh Pork Leg.
.
Established in 1963, this brand serves up an unconventional cloudy broth that sits in the middle of the spectrum, with savoury salty peppery spice garlicky herbal earthy sweet flavour.
.
The pork ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender and soft, with meaty savoury sweet flavour. The crunchy preserved mustard greens / meigan cai / mei cai carry vegetal sour salty earthy spice flavour, pairing well with the fluffy soft steamed white rice with grainy sweet flavour.
.
While they could be more generous with the crisp fried dough fritters / you tiao, I liked the soft soy braised hard-boiled egg with eggy sweet flavour, and the spongy soft soy braised tau pok / dried tofu puff with grainy salty sweet herbal flavour.
.
A star here is their soy braised pork trotter, equal parts lean and fatty, coming easily off the bone. With chewy gelatinous wobbly texture and bold meaty salty herbal sweet savoury fatty flavour, this was incredibly satisfying.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114332345573544911646/reviews
