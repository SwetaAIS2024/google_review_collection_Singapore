Li Yin Tan,5,"Good clinic and great front staff. Dr Leo is payient and very experienced, clear with explanation and will share about his plan on how to treat the child.

Waiting time maybe long especially with peak flu season, so need to be prepared to wait especially if nees to do blood or urine test to check source of infection..

Edwina Cheang,5,Brought my child to doctor Leo for the first time for my childâ€™s cough and fever. He listened to his lungs carefully and was told he is having some wheezing which were always not heard by the GP and lead to my child admitting to High dependency as his lungs collapsed and have lack of oxygen going to his body. Although the bill was at the pricier side. But thankful that Dr Leo heard the wheezing and we can start him on medication.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106518327232006248598/reviews

kanishka lowe,5,"A very patient, calm and composed doctor I have come across.

We were consulting other paediatricians before him for my child, however decided to stick with him owing to his nature of giving quality time to his patients.

He reassures the parents, listens to them carefully and very calmly resolves all your worries, which I feel is a must for every doctor.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107976863759095874434/reviews
