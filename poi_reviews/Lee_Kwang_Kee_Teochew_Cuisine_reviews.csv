Yvonne Lim,5,I must say the fish head steamboat is really delicious. N the rest of the dishes are indeed one level up in a hdb area. The restaurant is not big so I tink itâ€™s better to make a rsvn before coming . The price of hotpot is not cheap .. double the price of fish head hotpot. But do give it a try! Also they hv 20percent discount if u join members so u guess itâ€™s more worth it!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102485107465056564154/reviews
Isabelle Tay,1,"Never ate such horrible fish steamboat before... not sure why this place is so crowded but the reviews are mostly accurate. Paid $65 for a pot of soup with so much veggies and pathetic slices of fish which were not even fresh. The soup was so fishy my dad ate 1 mouth and thats it......

The other cooked dishes were still fine. Oyster omelette had alot of oysters but not fresh. Prawn ball was fine. We also ordered their bazhang (not in pic) but it tasted horrible ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®ðŸ¤®

Never ever coming back again and pls do not waste ur money here!!!!!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104140455507701408773/reviews
Jason Tan,5,"We came here for our reunion dinner. The restaurant is crowded, and service is a bit slow. We order the set menu, so we do not have the fish steamboat, which apparently every table order one. We will come back for the steamboat after CNY. The food on the whole is good, especially the steam fish and shark fin. Recommended.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102278742016607759038/reviews
Cindy LHL,4,"The food was fresh and delicious, The waiter was impressively efficient, especially in keeping the soup replenished. Although the restaurant isnâ€™t air-conditioned, the ceiling fan provides good ventilation, making it comfortable enough. I also couldnâ€™t resist trying their huge dumplings, worth the value.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111706455619461510946/reviews
J Li,5,"I'm impressed with the food here. A jem in the neighbourhood and it open 24 hours!
Very authentic teochew food.
Highly recommended on their teochew platter, you can have all the teochew signature in one plate. The pig trotter jelly is also a bit different with other stalls, thicker and more texture, and very nice. The fish porridge is awesome too. You must try
The best part you can also enjoy Cantonese dim sum here.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110687871487557983807/reviews
