Ace Shimizu,5,"Have always been going here for a few years already. Food is good and afforable. Portion given was enough to fill you. There is a shop selling briyani only on Friday! Nasi briyani ayam sambal is the best! Nice , sweet and aromatic. Price is $6. Not to overpowering and taste just nice for briyani lovers, people should try it. Place also sells other different meals like nasi lemak, nasi sambal goreng and indian foods like prata and thosai. Located just 5 mins walk from Kembangan Mrt.

Fafiq AJ,5,"Lots of variety and cuisines for you to choose from, I'm spoilt for choice here but I got spicy Mee goreng with egg and love it so much, no kidding! Every bite was full of flavour and umami and the egg completes the meal and don't get me started on the teh tarik la super nice he did TARIK in front of me and for dessert I got some coconut jelly which cools my throat and stomach so much which is good in such hot weather. Spacious seating, lots of choices, perfect for family too and kids got many choices too. Can't wait to come back and try the other menu. Don't forget to return your tray!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105435428750384132273/reviews
