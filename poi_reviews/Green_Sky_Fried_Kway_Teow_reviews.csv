Stephanie S,5,"Came here on rainy Saturday noon, happy to find that thereâ€™s no queue. The kway teow is decent while the fried oyster is wonderfully crispy! Will definitely come back for more!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107087636976390322247/reviews
Laenie K,1,"Made our order at 1240pm. Its now almost 215pm. And our order of 3 dishes is still not ready. Apparently they missed our order, then promised to get to it and half an hr later, its still not ready. Yes, they are busy but this is ridiculous. Of course, hawker style, no apologies is forthcoming.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110116693614844923808/reviews
Abdul Salam,1,"Was recommended by a friend to try their cockles fried kueh teow. So I travelled all the way from sembawang to this place. And unfortunately, the cockles kueh teow is full of garlic. I don't even know how to eat this seriously. Totally disappointed.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115973794624357363179/reviews
YAN FOK,4,"Concur with review of Joy KC about the food and service.

Carrot cake is alright, while the char kway teow is decent with fair wok hey and seafood-kuay-teow flavour notes.

Crispy oyster egg is super delish, best item here imo. Texture and flavour keeps well surprisingly even after 1-2 hour in packet.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104325779890446281219/reviews
Lyn Tan,5,"We are here only for 1 dish and only this dish. The Crispy Orh Luak. ðŸ˜š We often reach before their opening at 12pm. Today we reached about 1145hrs and we were #3 in queue. Unlike the usual teochew version, the batter is fried thin and crispy. Thumb size oysters are fresh, no funky taste.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103475245792825286443/reviews
