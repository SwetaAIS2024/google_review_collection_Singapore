      "text": "The steakhouse offers a nice interior design with a cozy, casual dining vibe. However, it’s not ideal for date nights but works for gatherings with friends due to its slightly noisy atmosphere. The steak was expertly prepared and tasted great, but the overall experience didn’t feel worth the price.\n\nOne downside was the limited selection of accompaniments for the steak—only one type of sauce was provided. The chef recommended the Daily Baked Bread Selection ($14), which I feel there’s nothing to shout about. Additionally, as my partner and I don’t drink alcohol, we clearly stated this while ordering, yet we were repeatedly asked if we’d like wine with each course. This persistent offer felt a bit intrusive and detracted from the experience.\n\nAnother issue was the presence of houseflies near the entrance where we were seated. It was quite unpleasant and disrupted the dining ambiance.\n\nOverall, while the food was of good quality, the lack of a premium atmosphere, combined with service and environmental issues, makes it unlikely we will return. There are other steakhouses offering comparable food with a better ambiance and attention to detail. This place is best suited for casual dinners or informal gatherings.",

Atmosphere is not good because there is only 1 main dining section and it becomes very loud. Price of dining is overpriced. Would not be visiting again.",

Getting a ‘Tres Leche’ milk cake IS A MUST.\n\nAttentive and warm-welcoming service was another highlight of the night.\n\nThanks chef and team. You guys are amazing!",
