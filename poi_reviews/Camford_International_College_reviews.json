It taught me how to lead teams and plan effectively, skills I now use at work and in life. The online classes fit perfectly with my schedule, letting me learn at my own pace. Huge thanks to Ms. Apple, my consultant, for her amazing support! I will recommend Camford to colleagues.",

      "text": "I was already working as a Sports Administrator before enrolling at Camford. I decided to upgrade myself to keep up with the fast-paced demands of society. The International Business Management Diploma at Camford was the perfect fit it was flexible and online, which made it easier for me to manage my work, family, and studies. The knowledge I gained in areas like marketing proposals, market research, and consumer behavior really helped me perform better at work. It also gave my company the confidence to trust me more, which led to a raise. I’m also keen on pursuing my Advanced Diploma and continuing my learning journey with Camford in the near future. I'm truly grateful for this opportunity to grow.\nI truly appreciate the supportive staff at Camford as well. They were very patient in explaining things clearly and even helped me find ways to settle my study fees, which made a big difference for me. I'm truly grateful for this opportunity to grow with Camford.",
