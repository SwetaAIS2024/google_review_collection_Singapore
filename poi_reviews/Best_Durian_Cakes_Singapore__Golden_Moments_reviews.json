When tearing into it, can literally see the durian fibres. The seeds were soggy and some of the durians tasted bland.  Maybe it‚Äôs not the season, quality was much better before this. Gave our feedback, they ask for some pictures. They were nice enough to offer us a return voucher afterwards.",

      "text": "Durian Delivery. Always a Golden Moments supporter! I must say that their quality is great and service is amazing! Once I received a box of mashed durians, which I believed that the driver might had performed an emergency brake. All the durians were mashed and tugged in a corner. Without further question asked, a new set of durians were delivered to me without additional charges within an hr! They really go the extra miles to ensure that their customers have a positive experience with Golden moments! Keep it up the good work! üëç",

      "text": "Superb quality & service! First encounter was a company event where Golden Moments did a nice and engaging infotainment setup to introduce different types of durian and pamper my co-workers with fresh in-season varieties. Next was an after-wedding party. It was easy placing the order and the delivery came in ~90min. My extended family loves it - despite a feast at the dinner banquet, we devoured the Black Gold MSW for supper that came in a great mix of sweet, bitter and bitter-sweet. Generous flesh, small seeds. Highly recommended! Certainly value-for-money and very convenient.",
