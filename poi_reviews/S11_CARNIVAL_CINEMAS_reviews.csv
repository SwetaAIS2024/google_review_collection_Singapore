Manikanta Tankala,2,"Except for the reason that Telugu films gets released here for lesser price than GV or other place, there is no reason for me to be here. The seats are so small that it feels like kids seat. There is no food at theatre. The bathrooms are pathetic beyond any complains. The location is remote. There is no public transport to this place. If you’re visiting this place with family, take grab or taxi.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100496635234006791873/reviews
Sree Raj,1,"I will not recommend this cinema hall to public. Its more for the workers who are staying in the dormitory.

1. Price is not justifiable, however they have buy 3 tickets get 1 free offer.
2. Toilets are like dorm toilets, dirty.
3. Location hard to reach but I had ebike hence easier for me.
4. Not a place for family as mostly area is workers oriented if you get what I mean. There are no ladies in the vicinity.
5. No place to sit while waiting for cinema to start.
6. Two big cinemas halls. Seats are new but there is a railing blocking view. Its abit hard to explain.
7. Hall was geneally empty except for a few workers and myself.
7. Overall, a one time experience.  Will not be coming here again..bye",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104750747855314553523/reviews
Naseer Alsahlee,5,"Cinema located at S11 Dormitory, 10 mins walkable from Nibong LRT which is connection with Punggol MRT Station. Seats are clean, Popcorn $3 and Cooldrinks 500ml $2. Getting normal taxi is difficult.

தமிழ் படங்கள் ($85க்கு 10 படங்கள் 6 மாதம் அவகாசம்). எல்லா புதுபடங்களும் வெளியாகின்றன.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108038607018891125501/reviews
deenu behara,1,"One of the useless theatres I have seen. Except for the free car parking facility there is nothing more to mention about this theatre.

Absolutely there is no accoustics treatment for the auditorium. These days people are spending thousand of dollars on home theates for accoustics treatment. I wonder how a professional/ commercial theatre could miss this concept. As a result u can never enjoy the sound in the theatre.. echoes reverbing from every corner makes it hard to listen to the dialogues properly(forget about songs...all you can hear is a bang bang sound)

The theatre chairs are so uncomfortable..No recline and seat backs cushions are only upto your shoulders.. no head rest.

Overall worst theatre experience...",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104981148379439356774/reviews
Gpadisal,2,"Looks remote, I almost booked the tickets for my family. Found many reviews talking about difficulty in reaching there, withdraw in last minute. Not sure any one willing to go there to such remote area to watch movies. The ticket price also not justifiable.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111786159611012741912/reviews
