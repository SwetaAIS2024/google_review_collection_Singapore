N. Ram Senthil,5,Singapore is heaven on earth where all races live in unison under the magical spell of Almighty God. Singapore history is amazing how it has emerged from British colony to modern smart city without loosing the Asian Culture Heritage. The Tamils who contributed for Singapore growth is rooted deeply on worshiping Goddess supreme Mother who has incarnates in various forms. Kali is the form of divine Mother who intercedes in the devotees life to bestow best gifts for righteous people. Ruthira Kaliamman founded by humble labourers who were doing brick works in JLN Bukit Merah now emerged as a spiritual community emanating divine aura in Depot Road vicinity. It is a must visit place for those who would like to experience the divine within our hearts. The temple band team Natheswaram player Vinod will mend our mind to steadfast in spritual path through his tunes. Best time to visit during closing prayers at 8:30 PM to 9:00 PM and rest assured Vinodh will make us spell bound with his music emanating the vibration of Ustadh Bismillah Khan‚Äôs Shenoy Ragas. Yaman is called Kalyani and Vinodh plays Hindustani version of Hamir Kalyani to melt our hearts to surrender to Almighty. Om Sakthi.

Gopalasetti Krishna Chaitanya,5,"Here's a brief history of the temple:

The Sri Ruthra Kaliamman Temple was established in 1995 by a group of devotees who wanted to create a sacred space for worship and community gathering.

The temple is dedicated to Goddess Kaliamman, a fierce and powerful deity revered by Hindus. The temple's name ""Ruthra"" refers to the fierce aspect of Goddess Kali.

Over the years, the temple has grown in popularity, attracting devotees from all over Singapore. The temple has also become a hub for cultural and community activities, hosting various events and festivals throughout the year.

In 2015, the temple underwent a major renovation, which added new facilities and improved the overall infrastructure.

Today, the Sri Ruthra Kaliamman Temple remains a beloved place of worship and community gathering, serving the spiritual needs of Hindus in Singapore.
