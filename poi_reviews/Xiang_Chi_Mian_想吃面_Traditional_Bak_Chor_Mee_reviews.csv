Princess Mania,4,"Tried the traditional minced meat noodle ($4.50) with abit of chilli. Meepok was al dente and had a good mix of minced pork, mushroom and liver. Overall flavour was tasty. Soup was good but not as hot as I hoped for. Using the NTUC Fairpricr app to pay, a 10% discount is given. Not a big deal.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107320587807657797918/reviews
Shawn Chong,5,"My kids love the noodles here, which is a great endorsement as they are picky. The noodles are excellent and cooked just right to give it a firm and å¼¹ç‰™ texture. They use freshly made noodles with no hint of alkaline water ç¢±æ°´ which is my yardstick for good noodles. The free bowl of soup is flavourful and shows efforts in the preparation. Worth patronising. Hope you enjoy as much as I do.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111622450919341080428/reviews
