Service is fast.\n\nHere is what I recommend:\n1) Black Vinegar pork (thick gravy, premium sauce)\n2) Curry Chee Cheong Fun (comes with fish roll and crispy tau kee)\n3) Curry chicken with toast (home style rich curry, not too spicy)\n\nKopi O kosong is nice too.\n\nServing is just nice for the price.\n\nWould return again to try other dishes.",

The rice in the Nasi lemak was just plain rice, and the black coffee was disappointingly bad. I don't have high standards, but I will not return to this place. Not recommended.",
