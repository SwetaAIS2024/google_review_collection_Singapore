Allen Teh,5,"This is definitely one of the best early childhood education centers in Singapore!
The teaching philosophy here is very good. In addition to paying great attention to children's moral character, they also pay great attention to their self-care ability.
What's even more special is that they attach great importance to filial piety and environmental protection, so the children who graduate here are more filial to their parents and know better about protecting the earth and caring for the environment.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112946538797839888031/reviews
