Jimmy Sim,1,"Went to Dr Lee to straighten my teeth. Paid $4K plus in total.. after 13 session of supposingly straightening my teeth, I notice that my whole upper teeth was slanted to 1 side. Notify Dr Lee and he just brush it off. Final session ended... I now have a crooked jaw line. Told Dr Lee and he say there is nothing he can do. He is the most irresponsible dentist I have ever encountered. If there is a negative star rating, I would definitely give -100.. 👎👎👎",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107302755572489643411/reviews
John Mose,1,"Convinced me that extracting premolars were necessary for my braces so went ahead to do that. Went to another dentist few months after the extractions, and the first comment was “why did you extract your premolars?” Apparently there was a way to do proceed with braces without extracting premolars and i was furious upon hearing that. Times have changed, there are definitely more skilful, updated dentists/orthodontists out there. Thank you Dr Lee for the irreversible procedure i will probably regret for many years to come",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109143359175800413888/reviews

Aloysius Leo,5,"Friendliest dentist I ever met. Made sure that I wasn’t all stressed out during the session lol. Solves whatever dental problems I have, with great after sales service too!

Counter staff also very friendly. Before this, I thought all dentist counter staffs are supposed to be rude and heartless. Lol",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118322452519895777520/reviews
