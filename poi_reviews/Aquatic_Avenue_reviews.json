      "text": "Mixed experiences due to two different staff.\nThe guy with no specs is friendly and helpful. He was patient in answering questions. He also demonstrated sincerity in helping me to set up my tank well by sharing many tips and advice. It was always a great experience with him around, whether I buy anything or not.\n\nThe bespectacled guy, on the other hand, is unfriendly and arrogant. He seems to be more helpful towards customers that he thinks will spend big and carries a condescending attitude towards the others. An unpleasant experience when he is around, perhaps because I usually tend not to spend so much at the shop.\n\nTanks are generally well maintained and the fishes look healthy. Wide range of accessories available although some tend to be on the high side. Maybe due to them being of high quality. The plants are beautiful and great.",

Tanks here really look much better maintained than most other shops.\n\nI started my planted tank journey here thanks to Gabriel.\n\nWhen not too busy, he was very helpful and willing to share knowledge without being very pushy in his products. Gabriel recommended only the most essential and even helped advise which should be prioritized for a successful tank.\n\nWill definitely return once tank is cycled to browse further.",

So tell me why i had to wait till 11:15AM and still no signs of any staff setting up the shop. The shop is just CLOSED. It got me thinking, does this happen everyday? What time does it actually open? I eventually decided to leave and have to make a detour to another place. Truly inconvenienced and disappointed. No closure notice was put up anywhere so i assume the shop is operating normally. Lateness is such a turn off.",
