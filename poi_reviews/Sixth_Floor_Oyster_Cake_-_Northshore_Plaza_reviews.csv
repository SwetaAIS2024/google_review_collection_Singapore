Petals Ray,5,"Been going around SG trying to hunt for my best childhood taste & so far, none can beat this shop's oyster cake yet.

It's crispy on the outside, soft & meaty & full of wholesome goodness inside without too much flour or oil meshed up within the fillings.
Since I don't really like oysters, the prawn & pork substitute is equally satisfying üíû

Even though I'm weight conscious, biting into this didn't feel as bad as those temporary set up stalls selling hard & cold fried pancakes. Each time I passes by, they are always ready with a few hot or warm crispy crusty fried pancakes. I'm quite sure this is 1 of the best in Singapore.

So glad I can cycle there to get it whenever I have the craving.

J. Tay,4,"The filling is a good amount with minced pork, oysters and shrimp, I'm a fan of the taste. Kinda hefty, eating 2 will fill me up. The kimchi one was also good but it's not available the last two times I went.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108850317457824409105/reviews

EQ Xavier,4,"Ordered a portion of fried oyster to try, it's delicious. The meat is very juicy while the outside layer is very crispy, the item is also freshly made and have good quality. I heard of the chilli that is very spicy and fragrant, however when I was given the item, it does not come with the chilli. I request for the chilli, and the staff gives me a look of annoyed, I was surprised that they don't give chilli with a portion of oyster..",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105533019712721928126/reviews
