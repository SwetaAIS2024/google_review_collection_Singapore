Kamal Indika Nanayakkara,5,"Nee Soon 3G Park is a delightful community playground situated near Block 833 Yishun Street 81. This park is a haven for families, offering a range of play and fitness facilities that cater to various age groups. ￼

Playground Features:

The park’s standout feature is its Origami Playground, a vibrant teal-colored structure inspired by origamic architecture. Designed with folded and tilted walls, it offers unique play elements such as climbing nets, a wide steel slide accommodating multiple children simultaneously, and a hammock forest that encourages balance and coordination.  ￼

Adjacent to the main playground is a toddler-friendly area equipped with gentler slides, spinning cups, see-saws, and interactive elements like a tiny mailbox. This ensures that younger children have a safe and engaging space to play.  ￼ ￼

Accessibility:

The park is easily accessible via public transport. It’s approximately a 3-minute walk from Khatib MRT Station (NS14) on the North-South Line. Multiple bus routes, including 117, 807, 811, 851, 852, 853, 854, 855, 857, and 969, serve the nearby bus stops.  ￼

Facilities:

While the park focuses on play and fitness, there are benches available for parents and guardians to rest while supervising their children. However, there are no public restrooms within the park premises. Visitors can find restrooms at nearby facilities such as Nee Soon South Community Club or Plaza 833, both within walking distance. ￼

The park experiences varying crowd levels:
•	Weekdays: Generally less crowded, especially during school hours.
•	Weekends: Busier, particularly in the mornings and late afternoons when families visit.
