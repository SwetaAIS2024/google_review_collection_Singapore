My bag, phone was in the office. Frantically, I seek help from Mr Fazly and due to his professionalism and tactfullness...from contacting the management office, communication with the emergency contact person of my company, the wait and all...I managed to get to my colleague, open the door, and got back my bag and phone. I'm so proud to have a security officer in my office building who is so humble, honest, sincere, helpful and tact. Thumbs up Camden Management and it's Security Team especially MR FAZLY.",
