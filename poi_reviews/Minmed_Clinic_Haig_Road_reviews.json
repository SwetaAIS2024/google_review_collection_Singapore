The clinic does not accept cash and does not print receipt that shows the breakdown of transaction.\n\nWaited for a good ten minutes just to register and during registration, counter staff asked for my email address so as to send me e-receipt. Till now I did not receive any e-receipt.\n\nBad attitude of nurse and counter staff when speaking to my sick father with no empathy and patience.\n\nI do not recommend this clinic.",

The entire team has been professional and always did their best. Throughout the years, definitely there are times when I do have bad experiences but overall this is still a clinic I will go back to. But I do avoid the timings when Dr Hor is not in. :)",
