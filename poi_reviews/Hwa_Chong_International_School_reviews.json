      "text": "A Personal Review of HCIS: Don't Believe the Bad Reviews!\n\nHello, everyone! I feel like I really have to emphasize this—don’t let the negative reviews influence your perception of HCIS. Every school has its ups and downs, and HCIS is no exception. While there may be a few teachers who aren’t the best, it’s important to look beyond that and appreciate everything the school has to offer. In this review, I want to share my personal experiences at HCIS and why I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone considering joining.\n\nThe School Experience: A Warm Welcome to a New Journey\n\nWhen I first joined HCIS, I had no idea what to expect. Like many students transitioning into a new school, I was filled with a mix of excitement and apprehension. Would I make friends? Would the teachers be supportive? Would I be able to keep up academically? All these questions raced through my mind, but looking back now, I can confidently say that my experience at HCIS was nothing short of amazing.\n\nThe orientation camp was one of the most memorable aspects of my introduction to HCIS. This camp was designed to help new students bond with each other and ease into school life. However, I had never attended a camp before, so I was completely unprepared. In my excitement (or perhaps my nervousness), I forgot to bring a sleeping bag. The camp took place in the ISH (Indoor Sports Hall), and the floor was as cold as ice. As I lay there shivering, wondering how I would make it through the night, a kind Orientation Group Leader (OGL) noticed my predicament. Without hesitation, he offered me his sweater, ensuring that I wouldn't “freeze to death.” It was such a simple act of kindness, yet it left a lasting impression on me. That moment set the tone for what HCIS truly represents—a supportive and caring community where people look out for one another.\n\nAfter the camp, the transition into school life was made seamless, thanks to the incredible teachers. They were extremely kind and guided us through the initial adjustments, helping us understand the traditions and values of HCIS. There was a strong sense of camaraderie among students and staff, and the welcoming environment made it easy to feel at home.\n\nMaking Friends: Finding My People\n\nOne of my biggest concerns before joining HCIS was making friends. Would I fit in? Would I find people who shared my interests? Luckily, those worries vanished almost immediately. The school fosters a culture of inclusivity, and I found myself surrounded by friendly and approachable classmates.\n\nOn my very first day, I met one of my closest friends. We clicked instantly, bonding over shared experiences and mutual interests. From group projects to casual hangouts, our friendship grew stronger over time. I also met many other amazing people who supported me through my struggles, whether with academics, personal issues, or just the everyday stresses of school life.\n\nOne of the things I appreciate most about HCIS is that the friendships you form here feel genuine. The people I met weren’t just classmates; they became like family. We studied together, shared countless laughs, and helped each other through difficult times. Whether it was staying up late to finish assignments, cheering each other on during sports events, or just having fun during break time, these friendships made my HCIS journey truly special.\n\nI would write more but I have reached the character limit.\nAll in all, 10/10 would recommend",

      "text": "As a current student in HCIS, ever since I joined in year 1, my teachers have been nothing but supportive, guiding me in my academics and my learning journey. I can’t describe only one experience, because there have been countless teachers which are all willing to help. I was actually very touched that they took time off their schedule, to help students review coursework (especially my humanities teachers), and answer any queries during their free time, or lunch time. With this, I actually managed to improve in my studies, and I wouldn’t understand multiple physics, chemistry or especially mathematics concepts. So to all the teachers who have been teaching me, I am incredibly grateful.\n\nFurthermore, when I wake up, I feel happy to go to school, meet my friends, teachers and learn. Because I realised that the school community has made me feel welcomed. Beyond the classroom, there are many CCAs to choose from. I’ve had the opportunity to join many CCAs, including table tennis, where I’ve represented my school in competitions against other international schools. I was also in Jam Band, and have performed with my friends and fellow CCA mates in school events such as Teacher’s Day, Open House and many others. These opportunities allowed me to grow not only as a student , but as an individual with these valuable experiences.\n\nAlso, I like how the school has added many amazing facilities for the students. For example, an upgraded 2 story library where I normally go there to study as I usually have a very long break when my lessons haven’t started yet, or even after school. And also, the gym where we go during PE lessons sometimes to use treadmills, weights and many other equipments you see in a typical gym. Boarders and students are also able to use the gym after school. What I’ve realised in all the years I’ve been here is that HCIS has grown alot, upgrading its facilities. In the annex building extension, there are many other things I have not mentioned yet, like the art room or black box, all designed to give students of our school a comfortable and inspiring environment, allowing us to thrive.\n\nNow, I am an IB1 or year 5 student, working towards my final IB exam, and will be graduating next year, and I can say that I am proud to be a student here. From music, sports, to leadership activities, and facilities, I feel like my school journey is vibrant, giving multiple opportunities to grow and learn as an individual, and I have also made many lifelong memories. HCIS has transformed me into a well-rounded student and a better person.",

      "text": "Hi guys, as a proud HCIS student, I must say that my last three years at this school have been one of my best years in my life (no joke the experience is actually great).\n\n1. Teachers and learning\n-Not only are the teachers are often very clear while teaching, they're also really nice and easy to understand. I've seen negative comments about teachers being rude and to that I ask - which teachers did you get? All of mine were rather nice. Also there's people complaining that the teachers won't answer everything you ask, but you're a teenager past 12, I think y'all are old enough to cut the spoonfeeding. Also they do make the lessons interesting with questions once in a while and sometimes Kahoot quizzes.\n\n2. Cohort/student body\n-The cohort is really small and so are the classes, so everyone should know everyone like the back of their hands. I've seen some complaints about bullying, but this is something I rarely if not never see nowadays. It's also really multiracial, there's many Chinese, Koreans, and Thais all around the cohort, it's incredible.\n\n3. Curriculum\n-The curriculum is very easy to get used to. For the first 2 years, the system is such that the MYEs and the EYEs are all based on what is taught in that semester, meaning that there is less stress on the students knowing that there are less topics to juggle. I think this goes away in Year 3, but even then most of the topics are basically more in-depth versions of what has been taught in previous years. Also, there's a really fun project called a coursework which accounts for 10% of your grade. Students are put into pairs or small groups to work on this project which could range from a slide presentation to hands-on activities like making a virus model (I did this in Year 2 biology).\n\n4. CCA selection\n-Not much to say here, but the CCA selection is massive. There's Indoor Skydiving, Archery, Bowling (which I'm currently in) and so much more to choose from. (if y'all come please join bowling its the best CCA)\n\n5. Other minor things\n-The camps are very fun too! Every year will have an orientation camp which teach values like teamwork (students have to work together in a multitude of activities) and resilience (the camp conditions are harsh and the food is horrible).\n-The school also has Internationalism trips to go (Y3-4), and although I never experienced them myself, the feedback is mostly positive and the participants seem to have a good time. (it's a learning trip, each one encompasses different subjects)\n\nOverall, HCIS is a very fun and engaging school. Unlike local schools which seem repetitive (using Primary School as a reference), one HCIS year often has a multitude of unique events that you will never forget. (I still miss the Year 2 Resilience Camp 🥲)",

      "text": "My daughter had a wonderful and enriching IB journey with HCIS, even though her stint was only two short years. The school provided a nurturing environment to challenge every student to better themselves academically. Kudos to them as students come from across the academic spectrum. The IB preparation was solid. The school has strong teachers across both STEM and Humanities.\n\nMy daughter had many opportunities to work with schoolmates from across Asia and Southeast Asia, to explore interests, to participate in events and competitions and to embark on service learning together. The mutual learning from diverse backgrounds and cultures was invaluable. Every student has an interesting personal story of how they ended up at HCIS :)\n\nTeachers are supportive of a wide range of pursuits, while also keeping students on track for the IB exams. We are grateful to the school.",
