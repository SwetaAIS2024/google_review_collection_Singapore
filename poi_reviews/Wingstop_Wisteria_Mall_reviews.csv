Liau Yuan Wei,2,"NOT WORTH THE WAIT!
Me and my friends waited for >1h for our wings for dinner at the shop itself. Can tell the staff couldnâ€™t cope with the huge influx of online & Grab orders with many upset Grab drivers & customers

Wings: While they were juicy and tender, I think Louisiana flavor is not bad but the Garlic Parmesan leaves a lot to be desired. Not enough garlic taste.

Fries: Voodoo fries live up to its name with a very interesting and nice fries with the sauce. Very easy make you full",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101467908285337699109/reviews

Jaden Chua,5,"First-time try at this stall today for dinner and this is by far the best boneless chicken I had compared at other outlets before, the flavours are more savoury and the chicken appears to be very crispy and piping hot to eat.  Looking forward to another visit here.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101555998961631082743/reviews
