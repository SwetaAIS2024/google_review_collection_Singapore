Expect to queue at the stores, unless you're lucky. Coffee is good here too. The only downside here is the seating, very limited outdoor seats, so takeaway is the best option.",

Server possess good attitude, though we have to clear our own table.  Will patronise again cos across the road is 24hr NTUC FairPrice!",

      "text": "Nice and affordable Muslim Halal food amongst the other good food in this small coffee shop.\n\nThe mee rebus (S$3.80) gravy was rich and tasty.  You could taste the peanuts.\n\nThe lontong (S$3.80) tasted good but I would prefer the more concentrated type.  That being said, generous portion of vegetables.\n\nPerhaps one area for improvement could be the bowl that they used.  It will be easier to eat it with a plate than a bowl.\n\nUpdate as of 25 Jun:\nThe same owners also own the Muslim rice stall. The beef rendang is tender and tasty.  Must try!  Cannot miss it!  The bean sprout is crunchy and flavourful. Do not miss their sambal fish and black Sotong if you are seafood lover.\n\nBoth the husband and wife are very friendly.",
