Evan Ho,5,"Sally Law has a very good system in cutting hair! Rather, its not just cutting, she trims in style! I like her sense of beauty (审美观), it matches what a good hair stylist should be.

Worth the trip. 👏 thank you Sally.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110912649346440133984/reviews
Kaeley,5,"Had my hair cut by Sally last Sunday - which was a ritualistic and personal decision as I wanted to have a fresh start after having a really tough Q1.

Sally was very understanding and gave me a haircut better than I’ve expected! Thank you so much!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112847957478241439251/reviews
De One,5,"A great haircut isn’t just about the cut—it’s about precision, style, and making sure you walk out feeling confident. If they’ve got you coming back, that means they truly understand what works for you. Big respect to Miss Jovi e",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101198017993757465380/reviews
chin yong Low,5,"I guess not all KCut outlets are created equal—some are wielding scissors like they’re auditioning for Edward Scissorhands, while others are out here giving Michelangelo a run for his money with their hair-sculpting skills. Thankfully, the KCut at Ten Mile Junction falls into the latter category. The lady  stylist, Ms yee didn’t just listen to what I wanted—they understood. It’s like they had a psychic connection to my hair (or maybe I just finally found someone who speaks fluent ‘bad hair day’). No awkward pauses, no “So… what are we doing today?” followed by a blank stare. They just nodded, grabbed their tools, and worked their magic. I walked out with a haircut so good, I caught my reflection in a car window and almost proposed to myself. 10/10,
I would recommend. If you’re tired of playing Russian roulette with your hair, just come here. Your scalp (and your self-esteem) will thank you."" P.S. If you see someone outside the salon bowing to their own reflection, it’s probably me. Don’t judge.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111036357516829039535/reviews
David Koh,5,"Tuck inside Junction 10 shopping Centre, yet Korean kcuts is bustling with Customers & the queue can be quite long.
