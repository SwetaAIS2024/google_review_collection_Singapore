Despite them being busy seating customers and serving dishes, they were attentive to our requests and always approached us with a smile :) plates were cleared off as soon as we were done eating.\n\nThe flavours and food here has always been consistent and we always enjoy a good grilled chicken and salmon here.",

The location is popular with students, so when we were there, it was noise af. The open concept of the shop means that the noise goes everywhere. You might have to shout at your partner when having a conversation. I recommend coming for the food, but watch for how crowded it may be.",
