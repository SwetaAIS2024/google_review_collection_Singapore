JL Sunshine,4,"Just to compliment Dr Foo for being so caring and friendly. üëçüëçüëç But Dr Foo, please note that your staffs are not that friendly. They ought to be more polite and respectful to all the patients. Please tell them to mind their tone and attitude. Thank you Dr Foo.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111771907955862947855/reviews

Ariel Lim,5,"Have been going to Little Cross for many years for consultation with Dr Foo. Very happy to see a passionate and friendly doctor who will explain everything very clearly to me and will do a thorough check. Always a comfortable visit!
Also had a very good experience with the new staff, Jannie, she's friendly and courteous with all the patients.

shakira sahlan,1,"I have been a patient for over 15 years here and I am so incredibly upset by Mr Chan. I visited on 24 January.

I was explaining to Dr Chan about my symptoms and he firmly said ‚ÄúI am asking yes or no‚Äù. Excuse me? I am explaining what is going on with myself‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ Bloody rude. Don‚Äôt be a doctor if you‚Äôre just rushing and consultation was less than 5 mins.

I have never experienced such doctors until I met Dr Chan. Please don‚Äôt be a doctor if you‚Äôre not listening to your patient. I will be taking this issue to the higher authority as I think no one should go through that. Awful.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112140442030590421269/reviews
Abdul Aziz Abdullah,4,I have been a client of Little Cross for more than 20 years. Dr Foo is an excellent doctor who provide very accurate assessment of your sickness and medicine required for it.  Dr Foo recommended that I join the government subsidise SG Health and help me save cost to pay for my longterm health care cost as I am near my retirement age and my employer does not pay for my longterm illness medical cost.  The support stuff are also very helpful.  Thank you Little Cross.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110782246812959116044/reviews
