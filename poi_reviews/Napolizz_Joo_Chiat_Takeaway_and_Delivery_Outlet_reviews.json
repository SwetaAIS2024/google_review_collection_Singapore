      "text": "I ordered the Napolizz pizza, and it tasted great, although there were a few things that were slightly disappointing - (1) the egg yolk had broken when it arrived and was running everywhere in the box and also into the plastic bag it came in :( (2) I wasn‚Äôt able to taste the Gorgonzola cheese, which was actually part of the reason why I ordered this pizza, but the taste of the pizza itself was nice nonetheless\n\nThe calamari rings were the ones that were kind of disappointing, both in quantity and the lack of crispiness (which may have been affected due to the fact it‚Äôs delivered).\n\nIn a nutshell, love the pizza (crust, toppings, their ratio) and would highly recommend it, but unfortunately not so much so for the calamari rings",
