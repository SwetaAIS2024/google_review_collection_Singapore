Lim CH,5,"I consistently have excellent experiences at the West Plaza McDonald’s. The outlet is impeccably clean and well-maintained. The staff are courteous and attentive, and special recognition must be given to Manager Manda, whose exceptional service consistently goes above and beyond expectations. Her dedication is truly appreciated and never taken for granted. Congratulations, Manda, on a job exceptionally well done!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106262940297272320333/reviews
Meng Pok Thum,4,"This space kept changing tenants, the last one was a halal food court, without air-conditioned yet the prices were much more expensive than air-conditioned food court, business was really bad, closed down in a very short period. McDonald took over, renovation was well done, very comfortable, all staff I interact with are very nice, McDonald done a good job by providing clean and comfortable dining space, with relatively reasonable prices.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117910893271871312647/reviews

Eileen Q,2,"This is the second time recently we ate here at west plaza outlet. And the fries are disappointing. Not fresh at all. It has been left out for super long even tho it’s abit warm, but can taste that it’s not fresh. Macd is reknown for your hot crispy fresh French fries but this store don’t have it.
Disappointment. It will make me not come bk to this outlet again if you don’t improve.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101753655973323334301/reviews
ministic2001,4,"First day so far good quality food. I don't expect the quality to last hahahahaa.

Though I just find their Kitchen too big since there isn't a dessert kiosk or mc cafe. I find that they could have made half of their kitchen space for more dining space.

They even have sink to wash your hands and a dedicated tray place for those who order mobile order takeaway.

They also have chargers at certain seats. Really nice atmosphere.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115150469048875749297/reviews
