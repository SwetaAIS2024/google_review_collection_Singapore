Bei,4,"If you're around Fernvale, the Salmon Mentai Don and Chicken Cutlet Mentai Don are absolute must-tries! The salmon is seared to perfection, topped with creamy, flavorful mentai sauce that adds the perfect kick to the tender fish. As for the chicken cutlet, it’s crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, with that same heavenly mentai sauce elevating the dish to the next level.

Don’t forget to grab a side of Mentai Fries—they’re addictive! Crispy fries drenched in that signature mentai sauce—what’s not to love? And if you’re feeling like something lighter, the Tamago Mentai is the perfect bite-sized treat, with the fluffy tamago perfectly complementing the rich sauce.

Highly recommend giving these a try if you're nearby!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104388834361342743125/reviews
Steve Adams Tan,1,"Place has already closed. Quality has dropped pretty much since their first opening launch, hence it is expected that they might close soon…their standards were very high and excellent in the past. I think they may have change the chef or ingredient/supplier, hence the drop in quality. Customer service was also not the best. Overall a bad honest experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102345809295669123844/reviews
F L,4,"The shop is good for a hawkers place; a bit pricy compared to local food, but it’s also worth spending a bit for a Japanese food treat.

They give generous serving of sauce (mentai and teriyaki).  The chicken mentai don is very good, while the saba teriyaki don is also good (just be careful of few bones).

We felt the Mentaiya Fries is better than Genki Sushi (and we also got it for only $2, promo price until end of May 2024.  So grab it now!)

Overall, a satisfying Japanese dinner.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118412867496723033084/reviews
Josiah,5,"Affordable and delicious!

Ordered the Salmon Mentai Don, Mentai Fries, and Spicy Mentai Soft Shell Crab.

The salmon don was of a good portion and had a generous amount of mentaiko sauce.

Unfortunately, their fries were soggy as compared to their punggol outlet which was very crispy and on par with macdonald's fries.

Their Spicy Mentai Soft Shell Crab was really flavorful and had a good amount of meat.
Generally, other soft shell crabs I've had did not have as much meat as theirs.

Would definitely revisit someday!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102907636743760669809/reviews
Catherine Ling,4,"Seen this on Grab, so came to try it out. Very friendly owners. The Chicken Mentai Don ($7.80) is super crispy and quite tasty but I think the Katsudon might be better. The Salmon Mentai Don ($8.80) is definitely worth the dollar more. The Mentai dressing is generous and the rice is Japanese rice. So overall, pretty good value.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104381248516022602975/reviews
