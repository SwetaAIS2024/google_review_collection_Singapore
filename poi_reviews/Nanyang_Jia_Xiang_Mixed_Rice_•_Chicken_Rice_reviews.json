When I pointed out the mistake, he acted aggressively as if he wanted to argue. In the end, he only gave me $4.40 and quickly walked away. He still own me $0.7 (I realised after finish eating and walking away)\n\nI advise any tourists who are at this stall or planning to visitâ€”please avoid it.\n\nI hope that CASE can investigate this kind of stall.",

She even tricked me into paying more money. I'm a regular customer and know the prices. She gave a discount to the man before me and then charged me the extra, thinking I wouldn't notice. But customers aren't fools.",
