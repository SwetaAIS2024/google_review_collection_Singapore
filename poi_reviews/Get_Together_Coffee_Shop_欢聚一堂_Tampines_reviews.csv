Jacob TAN,4,"First time eating at this coffeeshop. We came to try the zhi char stall which is quite good. Ordered hot drinks here. The tea was excellent but the coffee was not as good. There is a good variety of food stalls here, from noodles to nasi padang, western food, chai fan, roasted meat, chicken rice etc.
Will order and try the food from the other stalls in our future visits.
The coffeeshop is clean and airy.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
BeholdHim,4,"A relatively new coffee shop. A breath of fresh air compared to the older coffee shops. Our favourites are the ba kut teh, char Siew rice and Prata bomb @$3. The char Siew rice is the same operator at Old airport road hawker centre. Somehow the original stallâ€™s char Siew seems to be better. Overall, a decent coffee shop to patronise with ample and easy parking. The Ang Mo mini mart is just few units away. The area has a bakery shop, dentist, clinic, Guardian, laundry shop etc.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107790882829972143902/reviews
Tabitha,3,"Some stalls such as the noodle/Indian stall  can still be open past 10pm from what I saw.

Mala looks to have fresh ingredient & the usual dish suspects ðŸ˜ƒ",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110750330489234379036/reviews
S,4,"Thereâ€™s a variety of quality food options but dining in space is rather limited, better to takeaway if you stay in the area.

Itâ€™s also a 24-hr coffee shop but I think only bak chor mee is available in wee hours.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104940088914798587469/reviews
Jace Lim,3,"The cai fan stall egg dish is sour, gone bad.
Brought back to feedback they were apologetic and exchange dish for us.

The bcm, roasted and chicken rice stall is nice",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113726943112676855508/reviews
