Gave up after eating only 1/2, too spicy and salty.\n\nPrata egg looks good come with dhal. Yet to eat at this point of review, will update\n\nTeh halia is the saving grace to this meal order. Awesome tea.",

My preview review was to gain attention of the management.\n\nP.S.: I'm a daily customer eating breakfast and dinner there. I was paying just $1 for a chapathi until yesterday.",

I tried their Chicken Fried Rice and Coin Prata, and I instantly fell in love with them. To complement my Main dishes, I ordered Milo Dinosaur as well and I will tell you, it was one of the best Milo Dinosaur's I have had. Well of course it would need a bit of refining, but props to them, overall their service, food quality and drinks were all great .",
