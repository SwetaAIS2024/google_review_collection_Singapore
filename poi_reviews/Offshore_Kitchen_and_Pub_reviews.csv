David Chee,4,This is the third time we had dinner here and the taste seems to get better each time. The cockles and oysters were very fresh and there is a Saturday promo where you can order a free item from the kid’s menu when you order a main course. Great place for a dinner and drinks with friends and family.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103141603760662465251/reviews
Esther Bebe,5,"I love the food! It is always well-prepared and is super tasty. I will always order pizzas and the pork knuckle. Beer buckets are at $35. I tried their cocktails (whisky dry, lychee martini, whisky sour). It was so so so good!! Kudos to the bartender who made us the drinks. Oyster lovers...must order their fresh oysters. You'll love it!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116216056846983883936/reviews
