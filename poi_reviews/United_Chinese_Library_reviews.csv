Jenny Ong,1,"The Chinese elderly man in charge of this library has a horrible attitude. He’s so rude, won’t allow me to enter, saying they have people fixing the aircon but the aircon contractor says it has nothing to do with them, we can come in but the elderly man won’t allow. Now the aircon contractor is gone the elderly man in charge refused to turn on the aircon and he also refused to let us borrow any books saying the person in charge not in. Ask when the in charge of borrowing book return.”, he answered very rudely ‘I don’t know, you call him and ask’ asked how can he be contacted, he said ‘I don’t know’.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101937465893531725947/reviews
