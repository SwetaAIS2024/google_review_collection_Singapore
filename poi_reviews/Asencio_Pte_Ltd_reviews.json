I drop by to try on the uniforms for my girls, and it was better as compared to getting it online.\n\nGetting there may not be as easy by public. There was also no signage as to how to go to the shop. We figured out somehow. Need to find the passenger lift which was allllll the way in but the shop was right at the exit of the lift at level 5. :)",

Why set up online purchase when you have such a rubbish website. Please don't waste our time trying to purchase it online because its either getting locked or unable to find the item you need.",

It’s as if my order fell into a black hole.\n\nI tried reaching out to the contact information listed on their website multiple times, on different days and at different times, but they never responded. Their so-called \"customer service\" is nonexistent.\nThis has been a frustrating and disappointing experience. I do not recommend this shop to anyone. Avoid at all costs!\n\nAnd finally after about 20days. I received. and then found out. 7 file missing.....",
