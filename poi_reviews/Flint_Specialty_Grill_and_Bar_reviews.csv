Wong Teck Jung,5,"The newly renovated food court is really crowded!  I snagged a seat in front of Flint, so I figured I'd check it out.

First, I got the ribeye with red wine sauce.  The steak was incredible (for a hawker outlet); it was delicious on its own, but the sauce really took it up a notch.

Then I tried the smoked duck with pesto pasta. That pesto was so fresh-tasting, especially the basil.

Since I was loving it, I ordered the grilled chicken chop with brown sauce.  It didn't disappoint.

They use black pepper in everything, which gives it a nice kick.  It was a really great and satisfying meal.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115500349786770672418/reviews
Tan Ellie,5,"Nice and tender striploin. $16.90 + $1 to change potato salad to aglio olio, and a 10% discount for paying with fairprice app. Totally worth the price point.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111125302058390843293/reviews
D,3,"Chicken chop is way too thin, please fix portion sizes! Wasnâ€™t worth it for me even at $8.90 (promo) due to how thin the chop was.

Potato salad was good and the cook on the meat was good too, will try again after some time",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100427877525143731595/reviews
Jeffrey Adijanto,5,Amazing food at a great price!  Had the ribeye steak with aglio olio and it was some of the best I've had.  It is even better than some expensive steakhouses I've been to!,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105615961789324278451/reviews
