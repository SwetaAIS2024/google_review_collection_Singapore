The only gear I saw was on the wall as pictured, there didn't appear to be any keebs/additional headphones available to try as other reviews have pictured.\n\nUnfortunately the item I walked in to buy was only available for purchase online which was a shame but I did try listening to some of their beans + purchased a cable in the end. Good experience overall.\n\nJust to note: I did send them an email ahead of time regarding some IEMs I was interested in purchasing and weeks later they still haven't replied. I changed my mind regarding the purchase in the end so it's not a big deal but I thought it was worth mentioning.",

And I do recommend others who’s interested to visit the place and try out their IEM’s on display! Staff is super cool, chill and informative about the different sets of IEM’s. There’s no cost to try them out and gain some of the experience.\nI should have taken more photos but I was too shy.",

Love how staff was pushing me to stay in my initial budget when I found IEMs I liked which were 2 to 3 times of my budget (hehe oops). In the end, I settled the one I kept gravitating more and suited my comfort/budget best!\n\nI'll be spending months thinking about the Odyssey now that I got a taste of meta tuning...",
