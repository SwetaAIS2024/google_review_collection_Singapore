      "text": "Laser off my thick eyebrow embroidery with Dr Edmond. As the nature of the embroidery was very thick n dark so I needed a few sessions in order to get rid of the ink. Clinic assistant Sandy was so nice and assuring throughout the whole process and help me with the application of numbing cream. Dr Edmond uses pico laser for this treatment. He was very meticulous and careful. He keep checking to ensure that he covered most of the part instead of purposely leaving a lot of it to make you have to go back a few times. After firing the first round, he uses another level energy and run another round for me. I appreciate that which is why I did not try other clinic for the next session laser. The clinic is also very nice small and comfortable setting. 1session $240. It was very red and hot after the numbing wears off. This is the price to pay for tattoo/embroidery I guess. My 2nd visit wasnâ€™t very pleasant though as the numbing on me was on for a very long time probably an hr and the clinic kept serving another customer probably she spend more? 1st pic is first session 2nd day. 2nd & 3rd pic is 2nd session same day. Everything heal up nicely and I had also done a new set of embroidery.",
