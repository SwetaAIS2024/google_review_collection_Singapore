Tim Ezra,4,"Good place to shop for Abayahs, Athars and mostly other things related to Islam. Don't go there expecting more.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107288961181819489105/reviews
mohamad syaznil,4,The mall seems to be going downhill. But the interior is kept clean and the food halls look nostalgic. I met with some lovely sellers from Luv Krystalite shop selling crystal which definitely made my day.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107017250200180112141/reviews
Steven Morris,5,"Doesn't look fancy from the outside but as you descend into the main hall, you are surrounded by fine materials and crafts people. I visit Amazon Leather goods every time I'm in Singapore. 30+ years, never been disappointed . Not everyone knows about this shopping centre . Recommend!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116017450354053482854/reviews
Naureen Yasir,1,"Very disappointing mall.
So many closed shops.
Some Women owning the jewellery and clothes shops are quite rough and their behaviour is non- welcoming.
You keep waiting for them to talk and they tell you in a cold way they dont have size.
Mostly Muslim and traditional jewellery and clothes.
If you are looking for nice customer service the place is not for you
But Prayer rugs, Oud,etc can be bought from there",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105822677408406416639/reviews
イザベル,4,"this place is a lifesaver when finding parking around the area!

mall is a little dated but still decent, toilet cleanliness is average - could be better

only gripe is accessibility to carpark outside of mall opening hours (after 10pm), kinda scary accessing the carpark via other means instead of through the mall’s lift.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108863355468523327621/reviews
