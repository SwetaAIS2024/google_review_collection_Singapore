The Chef/Waiter was so kind and servant hearted!\n\nThe Restaurant was noisy as there was drilling but he was still very patient and met our each and everyone of our needs!\n\nAnd the Food matches the Service too! Amazing! The waiting time is reasonable as it was made to order. The wings took longer than usual but when I tasted it I was short of words and it was AMAZING...!\n\nAll in love this place and definitely deserves more recognition.",
