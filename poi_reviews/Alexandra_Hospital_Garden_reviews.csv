Forest BK,5,"Alexandra Hospital Garden was mooted in 2001 to bring biodiversity to Alexandra Hospital ground by the then management Team. Back then when biophilic was still a new thing, the team incorporated greenery and nature to help with patient care and recovery.
The garden's shrubs and flowering plants were carefully selected and cultivated to allow caterpillars and various species of butterflies to flourish.
At its peak, over 100 species of butterflies were spotted along the Butterfly Trail. The Butterfly Garden was care for by a delicated team.
Sadly, over the years the Butterfly Garden falls into neglect, and the butterflies gone.
Fortunately, the Garden, together with the water fountain is still around.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
