TF,5,"My healthy pleasure when I am craving for teochew porridge. Managed by a friendly old couple. Extremely popular during lunch time but queue moves fast. The variety is amazing. From my understanding, they are open for lunch and dinners on all weekdays. $10.50 for 6 dishes including porridge.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101085736491369105980/reviews
