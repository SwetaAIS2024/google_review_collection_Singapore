      "text": "The last time one of us came here was 5 years ago and safe to say, the standard has not dropped. We brought our French and Italian friend along and they thoroughly enjoyed eating here, having eaten in Singapore for at least a decade. The har cheong gai was very good, fried well without excessive oil smell and a good strong prawn paste taste. Meat was tender and juicy too. The tie pan tofu was also good with a good portion. Kailan was fresh and crunchy, well stir fried. The sambal sotong was not too fresh but cooked well and we enjoyed the sambal flavour. The yang zhou fried rice was very fragrant and we enjoyed it so much we decided to get another portion. Staff were helpful and quick to serve us and answer our questions, though we were one of few people there as we went in at around midnight. They close at 1.30am so it is a super good spot for supper to end the night.",

Also, they mentioned no GST, but then charged a 10% SVC fee. It's fine, but the service was so bad — can they really take a 10% service charge from their guests like this? Terrible customer service!",
