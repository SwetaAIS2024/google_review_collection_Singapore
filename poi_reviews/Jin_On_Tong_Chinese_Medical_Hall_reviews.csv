Rebekah Mak,1,"Doc is good but the outside staff don't respect patients. Sour faces. And they can only accept cash. Not even paynow or paylah. If I had a better choice, I wouldn't have paid money to still receive such black face treatment.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111698812299645447487/reviews
YL,5,"My family & I have been visiting this clinic since I was in kindergarten, since this current doctor's father was running the clinic & the doctor himself was still a TCM student at Uni, till the father retired & sadly passed, and he has since he has taken over his father's clinic. His wife is part of the OTC staff, & has been friendly to us since the beginning. I have been to this clinic for many ailments, such as fever, leg cramp (which turned out to be anaemia as diagnosed by his father), tummy aches, flu etc. Compared to other TCM clinics that provide acupuncture, cupping & massage, this clinic is significantly more affordable, albeit when his father was around it was WAY cheaper but inflation is real guys. ÊääËÑâ also doesn't take ages like those other clinics, & their medicine actually works. As with all TCM, you will need to go back a few rounds to completely recover, especially from flu. As an adult suffering from low grade fever and flu for 3 weeks even after visiting GPs & polyclinics, I decided to turn back to this childhood TCM clinic of mine & I am happy to say I have fully recovered after 3 rounds of treatment! The travel to this clinic is worth it, for the bill, for the efficacy of the medicine, & the service. This will be the only TCM clinic I recommend to everyone who is interested in seeing a TCM practitioner.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104594339442819825017/reviews

Victor Halim,5,"Wowww.  Mind blower. I decided to give it a try since I saw long queue and today it's my first try because I had a neck pain. The doctor access and did some stretch and my pain is almost gone. He gave me some Chinese medicine as well and the bill is very affordable compared to others. I seldom see good TCM nowadays, good skills with good affordable price nowadays.  Downside is only might have long queue ha",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103860561869673376361/reviews
