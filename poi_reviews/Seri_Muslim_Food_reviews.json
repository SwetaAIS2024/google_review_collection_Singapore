They open almost everyday but avoid Friday praying timing cause many ppl all around from nearby estates and industrial company will come over. But not to worry, The stall has many staffs  and they serve pretty fast,  add this stall in your makan sutra  bucket list in order not to regret.  Plenty of parking space in the basement and lastly wish you all a good day and cheers",

A long queue is expected but thankfully waiting time is not very long as they have many people taking and preparing your order.\n.\nMy favourite items from their menu are #MeeRebus and #Lontong. Standard menu items ranges from SGD$2.50 to SGD$3.00.\n.\n#StanzFoodHunts #TamanJurongShoppingCentre #MuslimCuisine",

Portions seemed to \"shrink to 2/3\" compared to previous visits.. is this the current trend due to price increase of ingredients ?\n\nEven their popular Nasi Lemak only comes with 1 small chicken wing + 1 egg + 1 pc of cucumber + rice for $3.50.\n\nIt's getting pretty expensive to dine in Singapore nowadays.. even hawker food is too expensive!",
