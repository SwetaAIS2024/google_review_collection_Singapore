I tried the laksa base and it’s not too thick or bland for pairing with the ingredients.\n\nThere are a few soup bases you can choose from like Mala, Tomyum and laksa. You can also choose your carbohydrate that include noodles, beehoon  and rice. A hearty and filling meal.",

Soup is also moreish and they prepare every serving properly, packing gravy/fried items separately. Ingredients are good too.\n\nSpecial shout out to the service staff (especially the one on the night shift!) they have amazing memory and are always super nice and helpful.\n\nGreat place, always happy to be back.",
