The costume 1920s Gatsby style is just amazing!! Won me the best dress award for the night. What can I say!! Nothing but just Awesome Costume can do for you. Try them! Local company without a shopfront for now but hey! That's where the Gem are found!! Thanks Ben for your terribly Awesome service! ðŸ¥³,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101981081674683517404/reviews
Jenson Chen,5,"Messaged a few costume companies but only Awesome Costumes got back to me.

As a size XXL person, was quite afraid I wouldn't be able to fit anything but I just needed to give them my theme and waist/chest measurements and boom, he made me a ""badass pirate"" with a costume that fit perfectly on the first try.

In keeping with the name Awesome Costumes, all my colleagues were in awe and kept asking me where I got my outfit from.

Needless to say I won best costume which makes this the 2nd time out of 2 times I have rent from Awesome Costumes.

A bit pricey but worth it for a good time and lots of laughs.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105951561256112113870/reviews

Hazim Z,5,"Super convenient!! The collection and return of costume was very easy and Ben was very punctual. Contacted Ben through Whatsaap who then gave me a list of Star Wars theme costumes. I rented a Chewbacca costume which was a head turner, and was even stopped a few times by passerby to take pictures while on my way to the convention hall! Highly recommend Awesome Costume for your costume needs:)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101029494888848178689/reviews
