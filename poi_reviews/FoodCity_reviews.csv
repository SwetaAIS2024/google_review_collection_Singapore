Tan Junyu,4,"Came to try the new vegeterian stall yi su pin after i saw big john jiak's reels. We ordered a chicken rice and bak kut teh and also takeaway crispy chop kolo mee. Chicken rice were just okay. I had nicer one somewhere before. Bak kut teh not bad. A bit pity, kolo mee is soggy, not sure is it takeaway or overcooked. Crispy chop taste like the meat chicken cutlet.  Definitely have to try if you are craving for some vegeterian food other than the regular ÊñãÁÇíÁ±≥Á≤â.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113984036409422535641/reviews

PomChatChat,2,"The economical rice stall‚Äôs standard a bit on the low side.
