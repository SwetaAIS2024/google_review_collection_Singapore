They sell magnets, sandals, shoes, iPhone accessories, key chains, food, cloths, aftermarket items, bags and many more thighs to explore!\n\n2. Cheap items for low price but is it really that cheap?\n\n3. Friendly people trying to make a living! Prices are negotiable with some stalls not all!\n\nMinus 2 stars for 2 reasons\n\n1. There’s a stall that sells smoothies! I ordered the worst avocado smoothie in the world! So watered down! Not real avocado!\n\n2. Prices are cheap but if you want cheap cheap souvenirs go to Chinatown!",

No stall selling their stuff with overprised rate. You can do bargaining here, but the seller is not giving much cut for the prise. Its better to prepare your money, and bring it more if you love shopping.\n\nThere is a cctv and officer everywhere. So make sure you bring your document and not committing something suspicious. Hehehe...\n\nYou can enjoy a street food also in here. And everything is under 5 minute of walking, so it is very accessable.\n\nSome unique stuff is just around the corner.. so make sure you exploring it first before you decide to buy some thing... your dream stuff maybe just hidden somewhere to buy.\n\nHappy shopping..",
