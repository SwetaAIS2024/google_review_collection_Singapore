Forest BK,5,"⛰️Ang Mo Kio Town Garden West was built on a hillock surrounded by lush greenery.
🍀🏃A network of tarmac paths meanders around its hilly terrain and forested area attracting both nature lovers to explore its natural setting and fitness buffs for leisure runs, workout and brisk walks at the serene Park.
🏋️The Park's features include a Hilltop Plaza located at the top of the hillock where one can have a panoramic view of its surrounding.
☘️There are Allotment Garden, Dog Run and Children Playground.
🐦‍⬛During weekend mornings, the Birdsinging area is crowded with songbird hobbyist and their caged birdies.
🧘🏃The community Park is largely frequent by the Ang Mo Kio estate residents, who come for their morning jog, brisk walk, Qigong session or Stretching exercises.
🍀Fun fact:
🍋🫒Before the Park was built, the area was part of the larger Sin Pah 新芭 (""new forested area"" in Hokkien), which stretched from present day Ang Mo Kio Town Garden West to Serangoon Gardens.
🌳Within Sin Pah, there were forests, Rubber Plantations, vegetable farms and a few villages.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Meng Fai Yip,5,"ANG MO KIO TOWN GARDEN WEST was a rather huge park by local standards. And it felt as if I was climbing up Bukit Timah Hill when I climbed the steep slopes of the park. So be sure that you wear shoes that have a good solid grip. Overall, I would say that this park is the larger version of Garden Hill Park (see my Google review under “Garden Hill Park).

Photos do not do justice to the place (hence I didn't take many photos). You have to be there to experience the beauty yourself.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109238839349859158213/reviews
