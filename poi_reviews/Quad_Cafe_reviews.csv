Seah Jia Hui,4,"Fan of the Korean food here but the waiting time during peak hours 12-2pm and 530-730pm is very long. Expect at least 30mins wait. They will take orders by a batch of maybe 5-7 customers then complete the order. Bibimbap is the fastest. Recommend their soondubu and samgyetang on a rainy day. Rest of the stores.. just try when the Korean shop has a long queue. Yong tau Foo is popular as well. Canteen wise, quite dirty and has many house flies. The seats inside are not ventilated at all so itâ€™s hot and smelly. Recommend to sit outside.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109933240025657790273/reviews
Dione Goh,4,"Saraca tamarind hall canteenâ€™s korean food have moved here. Same korean auntie and same good food. However, they no longer sell kimchee stew. Opt for sundubu jiggae (toufu stew) instead. Perfect for rainy day. The store opens at 11am and the queue gets exponentially long afterwards. Expect up to an hour wait if you are there during meal time(12pm onwards). The fried rice is also good. Pro tip, if you are purchasing kim bap(korean sushi) you do not need to queue. The tteokbokki looks handmade and delicious. Overall recommend.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105548852220440511521/reviews
Hazimah,4,"Great selection of halal food. Particularly like the Chinese food stalls for the zi char selection and dumplings. Will try the korean and vietnamese stalls next time.

Scallion pancake was good as well with lots of scallion and egg filling and some shrimp in the middle.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104739769787911429660/reviews
