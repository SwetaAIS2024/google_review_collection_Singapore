They welcomed us warmly, and the guy at the reception was very nice (he even took the time to explain a lot about the menu).\n\nThe food was great, especially the marinated pork, which was excellent. However, we found the service severely lacking. We tried calling for assistance with grilling, extra utensils, and sides (since they were closing soon, they had already removed the sides), but it was very difficult to get the attention of the waiters. At times, it felt like they were actively ignoring us. We eventually had to get up and approach the staff directly just to get the assistance we needed.\n\nWe understand that everyone was probably tired, and it was close to closing time. However, since they accepted us as customers and we still paid a service fee, we expected better service.\n\nThat said, we're still willing to give this restaurant another try since the food was pretty good.",
