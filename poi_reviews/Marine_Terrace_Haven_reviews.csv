Sudhir SB,5,Home made prata anyone ? Although this is a place where most people have walked across but never notice that there is a yummy prata place. The best aspect of this shop is everything is home made ( not using out of  the box frozen dough balls like most shops do  ) . Just look at the prata and it’s divine especially when it takes a splash in the fish gravy ! Incredibly divine ! The service is excellent but if you come late there will be Long queue and you need to have patience if you want to enjoy some scrumptious breakfast! Give it a shot and you won’t regret!! 😋 😋 😋😍😍😍😍😍😍 Sedappp!!!,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105586838995884226224/reviews
