È©¨ÂòâËéπ,5,"I would like to express my sincere appreciation for the outstanding service I recently received at your hospital.

Due to an urgent request from my surgeon in Malaysia, I had to undergo an immediate blood test. After approaching several clinics, I was told that most samples would be sent to external laboratories, which would take considerable time. Fortunately, one of your Raffles clinics recommended that I visit Raffles Hospital directly.

Initially, I was worried that the process at the hospital would be complicated or that I would have to wait for a long time. However, from the moment I arrived, the entire experience was seamless and reassuring. Every staff member I encountered‚Äîfrom the registration counter to the doctor consultation, and finally to the phlebotomy nurse‚Äîwas efficient, genuine, and helpful. At no point did I feel lost or uncertain.

I would like to give special thanks to Thom, the nurse who performed my blood draw. He noticed that I was nervous about the procedure and made every effort to keep me calm. His technique was excellent; the process was almost painless, and I truly appreciated his kindness and professionalism.

Although there was an additional urgent processing fee of $50 (total $291), I found the service to be swift, smooth, and entirely worth it. Thanks to your team‚Äôs efficiency, I was able to resolve a pressing issue quickly.

Once again, thank you very much to everyone at Raffles Hospital for your dedication and exceptional care.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110142233399724233097/reviews
Tommy Ng,3,"Take the northwest green line or downtown blue line and alight at Bugis MRT station, exit towards Raffles Hospital and you will be looking at the entrance.

This hospital looks run down and hardly maintained, facilities and interior looks dated. The inefficiency of their A&E is unparalleled. They only have one standby doctor whom cannot make decisions. You would need to make decisions on your own to push for outcomes.

Their hospital wards serve food that is undeserving for a private hospital.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108333284987009118312/reviews
uz,5,"I gave birth at Raffles Hospital on May 7th.
All of the staff were incredibly kind and attentive, making my hospital stay a truly wonderful experience. In particular, SSN Nicole and SN Kiranjit, who took care of me from my first night through delivery and after, were outstanding. They eased my nerves when I was anxious upon admission and made me feel very reassured. They also explained my current situation and what to expect next, which helped me prepare mentally. During childbirth, their words were a tremendous support. After giving birth, I struggled with breastfeeding, but they listened to my concerns and, thanks to their thoughtful care, I was able to get proper rest. Their nursing was not only knowledgeable and skillful, but also truly compassionate.
Dr. Chow was also very thorough and always offered reassuring words. This was the first time I received such careful examinations-he is truly a wonderful doctor.
If I have another chance, I would definitely want to give birth again with Dr. Chow and the Raffles team. I have never been to a hospital where every staff member was so wonderful. I am deeply moved. My family loves Raffles Hospital. I recommend it 100%.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100574580666594546326/reviews

Le Rock Steady,4,"Had a fall and was sent by SCDF to Raffles Hospital A&E as it was the nearest available appropriate hospital. Was attended to immediately at the A&E. Ward doctor came down to assess and was moved to the ward within an hour plus.

Warded in B2 class 6 bedded room that was spacious and air conditioned. Each 6 beds room has a nurse station at the entrance for better and faster overview and response.

Nurses were caring and attentive. Response was generally quick to the call button. They were cheerful, friendly brightening up the stay. The physiotherapists and occupational therapists were cheerful and encouraging, making their sessions enjoyable within that situation.

The hip was fractured and needed surgery. Surgeon assigned is very experienced and advised which was the better of 2 options. Surgery was so successful there is little pain from the operation.

Have no prior experience staying in other Government public hospitals' B2 class wards but don't think they provide meals menu. The B2 class here provided many menu options like eggs & bread, corn flakes, fish or chicken porridge for breakfast. For lunch and dinner, there are options like fish or chicken porridge, Japanese style pan fried chicken rice bowl, masala fish, Hong Kong style fish, chicken korma, claypot vegetables, black pepper fish with garlic & lemon sauce and spaghetti bolognese. Being hospital food majority are ""healthy"" üòÅ with a handful being quite tastyüòã.

For Info Only :
SCDF sending cases to Raffles Hospital was under an Emergency Care Collaboration between Raffles Hospital and the Ministry of Health starting from 3 June 2015. Patients sent by SCDF ambulances to Raffles Hospital will enjoy subsidised care, and will pay rates that are similar to those in public hospitals. This applies to treatment rendered in the Emergency Department, as well as inpatient care and follow-up treatment in its specialist outpatient clinics.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115013846059878367663/reviews
