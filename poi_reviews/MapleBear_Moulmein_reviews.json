      "text": "Very nurturing, caring and attentive teachers at Maplebear! My son enrolled when he was 10months old and transitted to toddler class. It was unfortunate that we had to move and had to change school when he is at 20 months old. We can really tell that the teachers made a lot of effort to understand the child and is able to pick up what they need. We have seen our son grew so much as of first week joining and continue to grow be it in motor skills and social skills.\nDefinite will recommend parents to consider Maplebear Moulmein.",
