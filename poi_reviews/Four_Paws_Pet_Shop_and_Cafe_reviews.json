Besides food, one might also catch paws in actions, probably if they happened to be roaming around inside the separate area.\n\nNote that this is the ONLY animal friendly cafe in Beauty World.",

You can also watch the cute meow meows from a distance.\n\nIced coffee: Was slightly towards the milky side but still decent!\n\nIced matcha: Too milky for my liking, can give it a miss.\n\nIced peach tea: I believe it‚Äôs ice shaken. It has a rather big serving. Quite refreshing but nothing to shout about",
