Shahmir Siddiqi,5,"I stayed at Rucksack Inn at Temple Street for 15 days and I loved it. I enjoyed the atmosphere, helpful service, clean common area, and the constant cleaning of bathrooms. The rooms were a bit small but that didn't create any problems. Everyone over there was willing to help each other. The location is extremely good for tourists. However, the location is Chinatown so Halal food is a bit difficult to get but nearby 7-Elevens came in clutch for that. Loved everything about my stay. Will stay with them again in the future.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112727311161998536685/reviews
Toto Hugo,4,"Very strategic location with very good common room. Please note that toilet and shower is separated but it doesn't separate by gender, and the stall for each is very narrow, if you a big guy, considered this before you stay here, but for normal size, it should be fine.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103972767978602816651/reviews
Erenz Jay Reyes,5,"I stayed at Rucksack Inn for one night stay during our quick trip and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and comfort. The room was spotless, the bed was firm yet cozy, and everything worked perfectly—from the air conditioning to the Wi-Fi.

Check-in was quick, and the staff were friendly (Specially Ate Chris) and helpful from start to end.

This motel might not have luxury frills, but it delivers exactly what you need: a safe, clean, quiet place to rest—at a great price. I’d definitely stay here again.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100675960227640728268/reviews
PinoyGaijin Travels,5,"Rucksack Inn

Rucksack Inn is a perfect place to stay for budget conscious and want to explore the city state by foot. It is conveniently located in Chinatown, a haven for gastronomic adventure.

I had stayed a room with two bunk beds with my friends.
The room had no windows but has good ventilation. There are individual lockers which you can tuck your important belongings.

The shower and bathroom are separate. The space is just enough to do your business.
The pantry and working lounge close to the reception is great. You can do some personal work there with an ease.

The surrounding area is safe at night and very close to MRT station.
The staffs are helpful and accommodating.
Overall, a decent place to stay in Singapore.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102042585106675853558/reviews
Nicole zhang,5,"Good location, it's convenient to everywhere. It's fine hygienic and safe. Reasonable price. Just a little bit noisy, recommend you to prepare ear plugs and eyes mask for a better sleep. Overall it's nice for people who is traveling alone.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102100236334490180204/reviews
