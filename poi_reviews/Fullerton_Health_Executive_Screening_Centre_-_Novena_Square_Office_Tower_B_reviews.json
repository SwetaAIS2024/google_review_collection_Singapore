      "text": "I have been coming to Fullerton 🏥group for my annual 📆 health 🩺💉👩‍⚕️ screening 🩻 for years now. This Novena outlet is considered one of their newest and finest.\n\nWhen I first started with them, I was getting my medical check ups done at Takashimaya and there have been so many changes since. We used to sit 🪑in the common area at the entrance and then we will be called from room to room. And when we are done with that particular check up, we will return 🔂 to the common area to wait 🕰️ again and most of the time, when you head back, your seat is no longer 🚫available. Can be a frustrating 😡process and indeed very disrupting.\n\nWith this new 🌟 concept from them, whereby you are housed into an individual cubicle, it is so much better 👍. You register 📝, get assigned to a cubical. In the cubicle, there are Handphone 📲 Charges, Bag 💼👜🎒storage, swing shelf, water 🥛, powerpoint 🎛️ for working on a laptop 💻 and a nice cushion seat with lots of privacy.\n\nThe nurses 👩‍⚕️and doctors 👨🏻‍⚕️will then come to you to draw your blood  💉🩸there, bring you to various rooms 🛖 for your check up 🩻 and each time you go 🚶‍♂️back after you are done, the cubicle and your belongings 🎒will be there waiting for you. In fact, breakfast 🥪🍩☕️is also served there.\n\nThe staff 👩‍💼are amazing 🥳. From the counter registration 👩‍💻, nurses, doctors and my favorite breakfast auntie are all so polite and friendly 😊. They are professional and I didn’t feel the need to rush 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️🏃from point to point. The doc 👩‍⚕️who attended to me also took her time to review my past history and check up on me.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful check up experience. Keep up the good work! 👍👍👍\n\nPro Tip :\n1.      Book at least  3️⃣ months ahead for your appointment.\n2.      Complete the questionnaire online 🖥️before going down.\n3.      Be on time! ⌚️\n4.      I will book 7.30am (always) so that you can eat 😋 right after the blood draw and you would have fast overnight.\n5.      I will also choose Novena over other outlets as the RadLink Diagnostic center is also located next block. If I need a CT scan or other checks, you can just walk over and get it done. Booking Takashimaya or Raffles Place means you will need to drive off to Paragon, park the car 🚘 and go for your test. (Novena would be seamless and perfect.)",

      "text": "I recently had a health screening at Fullerton Health Novena, and I am thoroughly impressed with the experience. From the moment I arrived, the staff/nurses were exceptionally attentive and made me feel at ease throughout the entire process.\n\nThe nurses were particularly skilled and professional through my tests, didn’t manage to get all their names but I was pleasantly impressed and specially when it came to drawing blood, I’m usually nervous about needles, but Vertyno is so gentle and efficient that I barely felt a thing! Jayanthi was great with prepping light servings and refreshments right after the session. It was evident that they are highly experienced and dedicated to providing the best care.\n\nThe nurse Aqisah who assisted me in understanding the available packages was also very knowledgeable. They took the time to explain each option clearly and helped me choose the one that best suited my needs without any pressure. I felt confident in my decision, thanks to their expertise.\n\nOverall, my experience at Fullerton Health Novena was excellent, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a thorough and professional health screening.",

She was warm, professional, and made the entire experience smooth and comfortable. Charlene took the time to explain everything clearly and ensured I felt at ease throughout the process. Her friendly and attentive approach left a lasting impression. Thank you, Charlene, for your excellent care!",

I used to visit the Ngee Ann branch, but after this visit, I definitely prefer coming here instead.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Vertyno – he was amazing at drawing blood! As someone who’s afraid of needles, I was really impressed by how gentle and skillful he was. I barely felt a thing.\n\nDr. Goh was equally fantastic. He’s polite, easy to talk to, and made me feel very comfortable discussing any health concerns I had. His advice was thoughtful and reassuring.\n\nThank you to the entire team for the excellent service – I truly appreciate it!",

      "text": "Second time with this branch and I must say that I always have a delightful experience, cleanliness and professionalism are top-notch.\n\nCustomer service also exceeded my expectations, special thanks to Aqisah who allowed my husband to have his executive checkup the same time as me, and also who watched over my 3-month old for a bit as the nurse did my ultrasound. The auntie who serves the meal also allowed me to use a room for diaper change. Really thankful to all the staff for being very accommodating.\n\nLastly, the place is quite safe and secure. I accidentally left my apple watch, lodged a report when I got home and received a notice after an hour that my apple watch has been found.\n\nTruly Fullerton Health Novena gives you peace of mind and assurance that you’re in good hands. ☺️",
