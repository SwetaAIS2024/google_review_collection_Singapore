Nicki Styles,5,"Absolutely huge!
Quite a warren, and we struggled to navigate it.
Different towers, lots of lifts a bit disorientating.
So many stores!
B2 basement 2 has a fantastic food court with many vendors, and we definitely recommend a visit here for cheap meals and light bites.
Something for everyone.
Super clean and well looked after.
Then toilets are in tiptop condition and quite fancy.
Outside has some lovely artwork and sculptures, so do also check them out.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104037118338666454244/reviews
Di Di,5,It is a great place to spend hours at when it is raining. There are a variety of food at the food hall and there is also a supermarket and many levels of shopping and dining areas. There are staff stationed at the entrances to issue umbrella bags so that the mall remains as dry as possible. I was attracted the the bags and the sincerity of the auntie at Sogeum and is now a proud owner of two bags.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews
P W,5,"Takashimaya is a mid-range Japanese department store with the usual inventory that you would expect from such a place, but I always enjoy looking at their household items, womenâ€™s clothes and accessories and food items. The store also has a really great food court in the basement.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106142468026787183516/reviews

sam Mariella,4,"This is a review of Takashimaya and Ngee An City all together, as most of us associate Ngee An as Taka.

It is a rather old shopping mall in orchard.

Notable mention is :
1. In one section, it houses many top world  fashion brand boutiques.
2. If you like Japanese eatery, go to Basement 2
3. It has a very large  event hall in basement 2 ( Takashimaya Square)
4. Occasionally having  large outdoor  event at ground level ( foto shown an event car at ground level at Ngee An Civic Center)
5. Lot of restaurant at level 5 and 4.
6. Taka has dedicated taxi stand. Ask the concierge for exact location as it is not at ground level.
7. You could go to Orchard MRT through underpass link to wisma atria then arrive at the station",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107208136672624210336/reviews
