Aisha Abellanoza,5,We received a warm welcome from the reception. Room is great and very spacious. Aircon and heater is working properly. I recommend to book one of their suite to make your money's worth and be able to enjoy your stay.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100889161372401986920/reviews
Ainezanee Al-Yahya,1,Experienced a very bad customer service by the staffs. Very rude and unwelcoming especially a staff named Edward at the reception. And staff kept on banging on the door to remind checkout time eventho it is still early. This feels so unprofessionals and unnecessary.

Just Kev,1,"Words cannot describe how terrible this place is.

1. There is nothing on the listing for this place that said you had to pay a $100 bond with a credit card or debit card but they'd suggest cash (hmm dodgy af) by the way its been 2 whole months and I haven't seen nothing and still arguing with them trying to get it back.

2. The room was not clean but also broken (the sliding door to the toilet and shower). Yes they had to saw it off right infront of us, instead of giving us another room or anything complimentary.

Customer service could not give a damn and wouldn't trust any 5 star review as it is bias af because they give out discount to get better reviews and scam others who are looking to book.

They reply back as if they give a crap but behind the scene back to good old scamming business",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118296985700365680079/reviews
