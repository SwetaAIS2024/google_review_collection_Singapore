Nur Iman Rostam,5,"Sungai Ulu Pandan is one of Singapore's tributaries that flow through the heart of Clementi, West Coast and Jurong East before it is discharged into Pandan River which flows into the Singapore Straits. It is part of National Parks' Ulu Pandan Park Connector which links some of Singapore's natural habitats and landscapes with numerous trails and biking tracks to create a green belt of nature experience.

Sungai Ulu Pandan is a gorgeous riverside landscape that is filled with clear waters that provide a home to numerous small shoals of fish. It is so clear that creates a quiet scenery substantiated with rounds of wind breeze blowing through the valley. It is a calming experience. You can even find the former Jurong Railway (part of Jurong Heritage Trail) on the trail. To get here, one can take Bus 284 from Clementi Bus Interchange and alight at Bus Stop no. 17201 along Block 308. The park connector is a hike down stairs or ramps.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110287485091231667131/reviews
Forest BK,3,"Sungei Ulu Pandan's source is traced to the vicinity of North Buona Vista.
The River source starts at the low lying area just outside the Buona Vista MRT Station, along Commonwealth Ave West.
It then flows to Ghim Moh to Ulu Pandan along the Ulu Pandan PCN.
Sungei Ulu Pandan is then joined by the Holland tributary, which originated from Bukit Timah Diversion Canal, at the junction of Clementi Road and Ulu Pandan Road.
Continuing, it's flow under Clementi Road to Sunset Way Estate, crossing Clementi Ave 6 and Commonwealth Ave West into Faber Heights.
At AYE near International Business Park, another tributary originating from Bukit Batok joined up with the existing Sungei Ulu Pandan to form an even larger mass of water.
It then journeyed into Pandan Gardens to Pandan Reservoir before discharging into the sea next to West Coast Park at the river's mouth.
There was once an old Village bounded by Sungei Ulu Pandan and Ulu Pandan Road.
The village is known as ""Tua Kan Lai"" 大港内 which means ""near the Big Canal"" (Sungei Ulu Pandan)
Most residents there were surnamed Chua.
As such, the village was also known Chua Village.
It's now a private residential estate.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
