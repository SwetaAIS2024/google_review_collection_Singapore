I initially was not quite used to it as it was quite a free and easy concept where teachers will allow the kids to decide on an artwork of their choice in between the scheduled lessons. Turned out she is pretty excited about this part as she gets to do what she likes. Teachers are also patient and allow them to be creative in their expression which is crucial.",
