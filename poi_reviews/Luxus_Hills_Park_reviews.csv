Crypto ExDee,5,"Very beautiful small park that is great for individuals for exercise and chill, especially at night.

This place can be quite busy in the evenings but it’s usually quiet at night.

The park isn’t big but there are plenty of facilities here. You pretty much can find a playground, a fitness corner for young people, fitness facilities for the elderly, obstacle courses, as well as a swing.

There are also plenty of benches with shelter.

One round around the outer track is about 475 metres.

This park is connected to Ang Mo Kio Linear Park.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110697649280498996686/reviews
Khaw Brenda,4,"Nice place  to walk around,  the tree trunks stepping section are so impressive. Surprisingly there's a toilet in this small park. Overall its a friendy park.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116577495615755874521/reviews
Lynn Lee,5,"A verdant open well kept and we'll designed park. So, thumbs up.
The BIG problem though is right smack in the park proper stands a large white signboard that carries this caveat ""Private land .. use at your own risks..,. (and ending with) Spore United Estates Pte Ltd."" Question, as this is a public park by NPark, how does this signage fit in?",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103280231236480734003/reviews
Roy Ng,5,A beautiful leafy park that was part of the Seletar Hills rubber estate. There is a storyboard to showcase the area's history. It is smaller than the adjoining AMK Linear Park but I think Luxus Hills Park is more beautiful with plenty of shade. Toilets are located beyond the western edge of the park (at the side of AMK Linear Park).,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107278129895216196380/reviews
Ant Tan (Ant),5,Nice park for quick run and the exercise bars are fairly new with no rusts. Easy to grip. There’s children playground too.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116001171041763971352/reviews
