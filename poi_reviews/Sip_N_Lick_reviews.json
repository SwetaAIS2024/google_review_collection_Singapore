Looked at the drinks menu and decided to get non-teas instead, and noticed the ice cream range was good too, so got ice cream. Surprised by the good taste and texture for the affordable price! Good service too. Thank you.",

Pearl was 50 cents\nQuite cheap tbh. around same prices as I-tea :)\nVery cosy, went after \"afterschool rush\" so no one.\nGot the 50% sugar. was quite sweet but not overly sweet.\nNo \"old tea taste\". milk was decent\nPearl was not sweet which i feel is good as i dl sweet pearls\nVery good location outside multiple schools and under hdb so targeting younger crowd.\n\nSaw they have icecream but not that hungry so will try next time\n\nOverall amazing for its price and quality wise is quite good almost as good as the premium places",
