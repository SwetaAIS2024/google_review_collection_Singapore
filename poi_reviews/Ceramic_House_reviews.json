      "text": "I wanted to deepen my skills in pottery and decided to continue learning handbuilding at Ceramic House. The course is very well-thought out and structured to help build up your skills in handbuilding techniques (which will translate to helping you when you progress to wheel-throwing).\n\nMr Lim is a great teacher who willingly shares his vast experience and knowledge with all his students; he is able to guide, correct and troubleshoot with you what went wrong. The wide variety of glazes (that he makes!) will leave you spoilt for choice for how best to bring out your piece.\n\nDon’t forget to also check out Mrs Lim’s works: she’s incredibly skilled in making animals.\n\nIt’s a lovely environment as well, where it feels like studio members are all learning from one another even if we’re at different stages of our pottery journey.",
