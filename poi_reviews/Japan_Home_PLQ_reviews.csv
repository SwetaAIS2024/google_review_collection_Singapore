Yv,1,"Very very rude staff. Tall slim girl with spectacles. Charge the wrong amount from the display price and then scold me for not letting her know during payment. First time encountered such kind of service behaviour. If not interested to work, should not put her in frontline. I will not patronise again. Japan Home should take note.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105319996517127590501/reviews

kindly asked her to shift a box as it was blocking a shelf i was browsing (box was stacked on 2 other boxes, i couldn’t reach it) but she got upset, gave me some random thing i didn’t ask for and started throwing things around when i reiterated for her to help me move the box. she even shoved the box and hit me with it. unfortunately, i will not patronise this outlet again.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114004511975023310235/reviews
Gloria Xu,1,"Went to buy stuff in Japan Home PLQ, kindly ask the staffs to move boxes of boxes as I want to see some stuffs placed on the shelves, she wasn’t happy to help. True enough, she is unhappy to help with customers, she came by and throw all the products on the floor and not even happy to help. Not the first time I visited this outlet, but this time was way too much.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110486127828548456391/reviews
SC Ong,1,"Very rude staff. No one was mending the cashier. Went to tell her nicely and she did not answer. I thought she was deaf so I wave to her. She never acknowledge and just walked angrily to the cashier. Settled the payment and she just threw the receipt across the cashier counter. If so unhappy working, just quit.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103687949344688619899/reviews
