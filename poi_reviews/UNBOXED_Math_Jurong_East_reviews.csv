Mohamad Fairuz,5,"Kudos to all teachers in Unboxed Maths, especially Tr Faith and Tr Joy. Teachers with patience, dedication, determination and great knowledge.

Teacher Faith and Joy put selfless effort to ensure the student understood  lessons taught and display empathy by reminding parents not to overexert kids to prepare for exam. She never differentiate students and ensure every students in her class gets sufficient boosts of maths techniques weekly. Rare attributes in teachers.

Since my daughter is under tutelage of Tr Faith, she improved significantly (from strivers to achivers).

Please continue to be innovative and believe in my daughter.

A heartfelt thanks to teacher Joy and Faith",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115046388441843096855/reviews
Sherry,5,"When I joined unboxed, my grades were average, but I wanted to improve them, as I felt I could do better. The teachers here are very nice and friendly, which made me feel comfortable around them as i didn't feel intimidated. This encouraged me to ask more questions when I was in doubt. Throughout the 3 years I attended unboxed, my math grades not only improved but also maintained A1 throughout. Nowadays, I also feel more confident when tackling word problems. I would really recommend unboxed if you want to unleash your potential :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118296141262204508533/reviews
Afshah Eksan,5,"I'm extremely impressed with Unboxed! My child, who was in Primary 6, has been attending classes here for almost a year and has shown significant improvement in his Mathematics, from AL4 in Prelims to AL1 in his PSLE. The teachers are knowledgeable, patient, and genuinely care about each student's progress.

The centre's facilities are modern, clean, and well-organized, providing a conducive learning environment. These factors are what contributed to his Math grade for PSLE, which greatly exceeded his and my expectations.

What sets Unboxed apart is their personalized approach to learning. They take the time to understand each student's strengths, weaknesses, and learning style, tailoring their teaching methods accordingly.

I highly recommend Unboxed to any parent seeking quality education for their child. It's been a game-changer for us!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110572150950444663909/reviews
