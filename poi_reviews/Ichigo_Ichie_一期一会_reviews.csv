Ami (あみたん),1,"I'm Japanese and I supposed to be humble, but this time I can't. Everything is terrible. Me & my husband went to use their co-working space. First of all, plugs are limited. There's no plugs in the socket at working table. We only found 1 plug near a window. Second, there was a dead cockroach inside the socket. Can tell that the place has been neglected. Thirdly, we also felt neglected as there's no staff or anyone in there. There's a counter bar but it was left not operated. We supposed to get 1 free ""premium"" coffee each for $8/hour pay ($6/hour from next hour), but nobody serves anything to us unless we walk to Sakae Sushi counter right outside the door or order something from QR. We decided to order some food so the staff would walk into this co-working area. Staff was ""too busy"" for us and said he'll come back for order later, but he never did. By the way the coffee was ordinary, like instant coffee, not ""premium"" as they claimed. Lastly, food tastes terrible. I ordered Chawanmushi (Japanese steamed egg) and my hubby ordered vegetarian bento set. Steam egg was dry, not juicy as it supposed to be. About bento.. I don't even know where to begin.. First of all, there's only 1 type of veggie (only avocado) for tempura, and it came without tempura sauce. We wanted to ask for sauce, but what to do? Are we supposed to walk all the way to ask for it? Also, the cheese on top of fried shiitake mushroom looked and tasted artificial. Very orange. The fried tofu sauce was too thick and sweet, but he ended up dipping everything in this sauce, because there's no other sauce.. I felt sorry for my husband, I almost cry.. We were supposed to spend a lovely time together.. So as a conclusion, the place was neglected, we were neglected, the drinks were meh, the food sucks, and we ended up paying total of $80+ for such food and ""service."" Will never return again. Please don't claim ""Japanese"" if you can't even offer a proper service and food.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111201687188409738984/reviews
jonathan lee,3,Place looks okay as a coworking space. But I think it will do much better if it had monitors that we can plug in with HDMI cables. Also the day pass and hour pass are too expensive compared to other coworking spaces like spatial.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114639907150177755294/reviews
