Catherine Koh,1,"I ordered a medium Milk tea with 70%sugar, no ice, and coffee jelly topping. The tea tasted horrible, really really bitter, and definitely not sweet at all. Koi’s drinks standard had been on a steep decline. I was a diamond member last year, but find myself drinking less and less these couple of months. Really disappointing.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103085570187655117132/reviews

sea li,1,"Horrible terrible clueless staff. Allowing a customer to buy 19 cards is fine. But requiring her to make 19 transactions of payments separately and then issuance of cards is ridiculously slow, that holds up the queue. Meanwhile , no orders can be made. When questioned, the 5 staff kept quiet. You need to reflect on your procedures, productivity, systems.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104752428713691597053/reviews
rick wen,5,"Had a GREAT EXPERIENCE served by the coloured hair guy who call Calvinn, nice speaking, easy going and friendly customer service.

Order number :12 (purchase time around 5.45pm on 6 Feb 2025).

Customer service is not an easy position,
But he is deserve to have good feedbacks.

K C,1,Undercooked pearls and 70% sugar level tasted like 20%. I’m not a sugar lover and was surprised the 70% tasted exactly like the usual 20% I’ve had at other outlets. Pearls aren’t as chewy as other outlets and tasted tough. Writing this as I’m drinking them.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107891098677913637564/reviews
