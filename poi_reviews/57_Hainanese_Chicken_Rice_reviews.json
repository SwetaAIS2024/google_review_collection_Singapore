They gave me all breast meat and charged me $4.00. It came with a small bowl of soup which I agreed it was salty. It did not taste like normal chicken soup but I think it may be suitable for wanton noodles soup.\n\nI see many people complaining here but there are many people queueing daily. It is not the cheapest chicken rice in Tampines though.",

Drum stick used to be $5.5, now $6. Stall raising prices only after opening not too long ago. Too pricey! Can get cheaper and also delicious chap cai peng at next stall beside it.",
