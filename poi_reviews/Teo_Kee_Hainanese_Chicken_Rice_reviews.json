The drumstick was also deboned but the bone was left there in an awkward way.\n\nAlthough it is a drumstick, I find the portion quite same.\n\nTotal about $9 or $10.\n\nBut for the market to be just beside, there's chicken and duck rice that's more value.",

      "text": "New chicken rice stall in New Century Food House kopitiam along Clementi West Street 2.\n\nOrdered steamed chicken drumstick rice with added chicken gizzards. $7. Besides normal poached boiler chicken, they also have poached kampung chicken but minimum order is for half a bird.\n\nThe chicken was succulent and juicy. Chilli sauce with ginger puree elevated the taste of the chicken. Gizzards were crunchy with no funky or bitter aftertaste. But they committed the cardinal sin of all food stalls serving rice - half cooked rice, still hard at the center of the grain.\n\nI really liked what I ate, except for the rice so I hope this is just a one off mistake. Will go try again soon.",
