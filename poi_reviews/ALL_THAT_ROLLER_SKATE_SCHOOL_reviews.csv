Stephanie Siow,5,"My son went for Coach Moon’s holiday skate camp with absolutely no prior skating experience and had lots of fun! The coaches were all super patient, teaching the kids techniques in an easy to understand manner. They also made learning skating fun with games that even my son - who hates persevering when he’s not good at something - wanted to participate in even though it involves more skating that he’s not great at. Highly recommend",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111479004960478107014/reviews

Miao Sun,5,"My daughter loves the course very much. The coaches are patient and experienced to teach kids especially younger ones. Children can walk by themselves after the first class. And for experienced students , they will learn more skills. Really recommend.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116850504305042432221/reviews
Doreen Ong Lee Leng,5,Our 1st born enjoyed their lesson a few yrs ago. So naturally we went back to Coach Moon now that our 2nd child is ready to explore this sport. Attended the fun filled 3 days beginner camp and my 2nd child just cant get enough of it. Coaches are energetic but also not forgetting everyone's safety and sufficient water breaks too. Thumbs up!,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110703789812246710235/reviews
Alstroemeria Yee,5,"Our boy has been with coaches Moon and Edison for a few years now and it’s been fun all the way. The coaches are very patient and the kids are able to pick up with the clear instructions and demonstrations. Although it’s a group setting, they are mindful of each kid’s ability and they do a debrief with parents at the end of class when time permits. We can feel the passion from the coaches. During this circuit breaker, coach moon had organised activities via WhatsApp to encourage the students! It’s rare to find people with such passion. Highly recommended!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108390661490305812292/reviews
