CK C,3,The older but less well known sibling of Sim Lim Square. This shopping mall is also a congregation of electronics shops but sells less computers and more LED lights.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Lenny Lim,5,"I haven't been to this place in years. Used to be the place to go for electronics hobbyists to go to get parts. To my delight, there are still shops catering to hobbyists, and the people I've talked to are both helpful and friendly. They will suggest parts, alternatives, if you're not sure what you are looking for. It sure beats ordering parts online, even if I have to pay a bit more. And knowing I'm getting what I need instead of ""oh I'll order this just in case"" I'm likely saving money.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116417928602560285641/reviews
Sunbreeze Cazi,3,"Had to get one adaptor for smart door bell (Aqara g4), started with lvl 3. Straightaway realised that the shopkeepers here have no patience for questions or noobs. U either know what you want and tell them very specifically or u will be given a little talk down.

Lucky for me, the boss @ sinta electronics at lvl 3 was patient to my noob questions.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111701250300307343299/reviews
Zulkifli BMO,5,"Great place to get your LED lighting, electrical, and electronics parts, etc..,. Owners and friendly and helpful.  They help each other shops by recommendations to another shops that they do not sell the parts you are looking for.
