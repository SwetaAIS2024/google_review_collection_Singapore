Chris Koh,1,"Breakfast (buffet).

Avoid at all cost UNLESS you really desperate.
You’re better off ordering GRAB food and save RM25 per pax for breakfast.

Nasi lemak - horrendously salty sambal, soggy ikan bilis,  murdered (smashed) hard boiled egg
Omelette- basically scrambled egg without any condiments
Soft boil egg - came raw, not cooked 1st time, returned & came back as hard boil egg
Latte or cappuccino  - pay separately (tea & coffee from a flask available)

Dare not try anymore after sampling some of the above…",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108679415913261921001/reviews
chew eb,1,"Serves breakfast for Somerset Medini Iskandar Puteri.

Food was a total disappointment, basic food could be done in a more respectful manner. Flies hovering around.

The floor was sticky.

Floor staff wasn't able to respond to different ability needs.

Avoid this place at all costs. There are better choices at the nearby hospital, which are walking distance.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116144727788369563694/reviews
Abdul Wahab,5,It's a small restaurant to cater growing working population in Medini. Lunch set starts from RM10 with ice lemon tea. Totally worth it!,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106779813698560376411/reviews
