      "text": "They have far more days off compared to others, but they look after them carefully. I feel less anxious because I can keep in touch with my homeroom teacher even on small matters. Until 2019, the principal had an attitude of listening to and incorporating the opinions of parents and working hard for the children. Also, the nutritionally balanced school lunches are wonderful. It tastes great and the kids seem to be ordering a second helping each time. Twice a year, parents were also able to sample the food. I think it's great to be able to learn about Japanese culture even when you're in a foreign country, as they properly celebrate events that are unique to Japan each season.\nHowever, for better or worse, it is a traditional Japanese kindergarten.",

      "text": "It was a good kindergarten that lived up to its basic philosophy. I was hoping for something similar to a Japanese kindergarten, so I feel safe sending her there.\nParents, such as veteran teachers, have a sense of trust, and my child has become more enthusiastic about everything, and I have been blessed with friends who have become good friends even after joining the school mid-year. I also felt very welcomed. I went to two other kindergartens in Japan, and this is the only one where I didn't say I didn't want to go to kindergarten. The school lunches are said to be delicious, and are useful for preparing menus at home.\nAs a parent who has experienced various kindergartens, I think this is a very good kindergarten.",

      "text": "After attending an international kindergarten and a local kindergarten, I enrolled my child at an older age, and I was surprised by the high quality of the teachers. It's my child's first time studying abroad and experiencing a foreign country, but he enjoys going there every day. The younger child will be admitted a little earlier.\n\nEven children whose Japanese level is not very high are treated well, and they are given care so that they can naturally gain confidence in their Japanese. There are many things I would like local schools to emulate, such as holding a birthday party for the whole class once a month and making the children feel special with handmade cards, instead of holding birthday parties every week like local schools, feeding them sugary cakes, and handing out cheap toys. It's clear that the school is run with love and great organizational skills from the teachers, so even foreign parents and helpers who don't understand Japanese are always impressed.",
