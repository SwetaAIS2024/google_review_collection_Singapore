      "text": "The karaoke place at Plaza Singapura is a nice spot for parties. There are plenty of rooms, each with stylish futuristic decor and a good sound system. However, the lighting is a bit strange ‚Äî after each song, it switches to a darker mode, while we actually preferred it to stay bright.\nThey have a large selection of songs, and the food is decent, though it‚Äôs served quite slowly. The air conditioning is extremely cold, making both me and the food freeze, and there‚Äôs no way to adjust it. Overall, it‚Äôs an okay experience, but you‚Äôll definitely need to dress warmly, almost like you‚Äôre going into winter.",

      "text": "The location was central and so convenient. The room catered to a large group, and we all came at different times, but were able to find our room easily.\n\nSo much song and laughter. It was only my second time going to karaoke (the first being in Suzhou, China, in 2017). This experience was very comparable. Their facilities were top notch. Their song choice was wide enough. I don‚Äôt know any Chinese songs, nor  do I know much about pop, so their selection of 90s alternative music made me super happy.\n\nAll-in-all a great night. Not bad for someone who does not like hanging out with people in large groups (at least for now).",
