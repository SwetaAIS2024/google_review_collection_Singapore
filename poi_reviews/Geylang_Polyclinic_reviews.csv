An CC,1,"Experience is very bad ，doctors need improvement, only a few words and charge more than 30 SGD dollars consultation fee. want to do a pathogen test and the very young doc say that here can not , I know here cannot. only tell me go to KK, 24 hours Service. I wonder why this government clinic dose not like others (like sing health ,it can take samples then send to large hospitals for exam). why here can not take samples then send to hospitals for exam? Every thing goes to kk ? Seriously?
This is the worst experience in government clinic.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104831598204561439135/reviews
Rachel Yang,5,"Came here for my child’s vaccination (which is free if your child is a Singapore Citizen).  As long as you make an appointment, there’s no need to wait long for your turn. Doctors and nurses are all very nice.  Building is bright, clean and airy. Payment and booking of appointment is fuss free and can be done over the self service kiosks. Highly recommend. 😃",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102129393691495238410/reviews

Ant man,5,I'm writing with rgds to the dental section. Very impressed that doctor actually follows up to check if you're okay after the surgery and give advice. From consultation to surgery to post surgery ---- same doctor. Even pte dental clinics may not offer this standard of service. 👍👍👍,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103076607825891186103/reviews
百里竹,5,"The service attitude of the staff is very good. There are often taxis waiting outside the clinic. There is a food court on the right outside the gate, which is very convenient.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114019173768248442814/reviews
