      "text": "Tucked away near the corner of a quiet mall, this eatery was a rare find indeed. Immediately as I walked in, I was greeted by a tantalising herbal aroma that permeated the restaurant. My friend and I opted for the $24 turtle soup and some prawn paste chicken to share. We were blown away by the tenderness of the turtle meat and uniquely heartwarming quality to the soup. The owner of the place was incredibly friendly and generously topped up our bowls with copious amounts of stock at his own initiative. Even the prawn paste chicken almost sent us to the high heavens---freshly fried, it was crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside. 10/10 would recommend",

      "text": "Stepping into Tai Seng Turtle Soup, I didn’t know what to expect. However, one sip of their herbal turtle soup was all it took to blow my mind. The rich, aromatic broth was a perfect balance of herbs and spices, each spoonful bursting with deep, comforting flavors that lingered long after the meal. The turtle skin was tender and succulent, absorbing meat essence of the soup beautifully.\n\nBut the surprises didn’t end there. The prawn paste deep-fried chicken was a hidden gem on the menu, and quite possibly the best I’ve had in Singapore. The crispy, golden-brown exterior gave way to juicy, flavorful chicken, with the prawn paste adding a unique umami kick that elevated the dish to extraordinary heights. Every bite was a delightful crunch, leaving me craving more.\n\nAnother standout dish was the claypot crocodile tail. Served piping hot, the meat was incredibly tender, and the crocodile skin had a uniquely jelly-like texture that was both intriguing and delicious. The robust flavours of the claypot’s rich sauce perfectly complemented the crocodile tail, creating a savoury and slightly sweet profile that made it a truly tasty and memorable dish.",

      "text": "Absolutely love this traditional cuisine. The turtle is bred for consumption by the way. So it’s ethically sourced. The soup was my life saver whenever I catch a cold. It helps to improve the “yang” in me and really tasted awesome. The price is worth it! Best of all, you can top up the soup. Had been visiting this since I was a kid when me dad brought me to the original shop more than 40 years ago. It’s worth a visit as it’s really a dying trade. Once this is gone, it will be lost forever!",
