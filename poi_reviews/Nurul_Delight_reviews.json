The sambal chilli was so so good ,the rice is just yummy.My whole family loves the nasi lemak here.\nThere is one in bukit batok west block 413 ,where u cant even ask for additional chilli or chicken eventhough u would pay for it. Same shop name (not sure if both is the same owner) but different area. Bukit batok 217 was a great one , but the bukit batok 413 was not that good.\nOverall, the rice , the sambal.. all taste really well..The staff was also friendly too .",
