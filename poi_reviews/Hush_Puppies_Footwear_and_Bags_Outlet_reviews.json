      "text": "The young saleslady who served us at IMM had a very good customer service. She is friendly and patient. As it is an outlet store we understand that not all sizes are available. At first my hubby (reg size 42.5) tried size 43 but is evidently too loose. The lady asked my husband to scan around maybe there is something else he might like. My husband admired the comfortability of the shoe he is trying on and asked the saleslady if other outlets have his size and yes, the lady checked for him even if it means she is going to lose a customer. In the end, my hubby tried the same design but is size 41 and to our surprise it fits him well. Without a doubt we bought it. As a customer, we don't only look at the item we are buying but also how we are serve. Hush puppies should value staff like her, she is a gem.",
