      "text": "As a seemingly ordinary neighbourhood school, St Gabriel's is anything but ordinary.\n\nFrom the highly capable and caring teachers to the supportive school leaders and community, this school is the perfect place for its students to grow and further their aspirations. The teachers in this school are definitely what defines the experience Gabrielites receive. With teachers who motivate students to continuously challenge themselves to scale to greater heights and also have a soft spot to render support and a listening ear to students, St. Gabriel's feels like a second home for its students.\n\nWith numerous opportunities for students to grow in fields such as leadership, aviation and their CCA, students are strongly encouraged to ignite the fire in them to make their dreams a reality.\n\nThe homely feel of the campus is also something that students can look forward to with tons of open space and greenery that allows students to refresh and take in the peaceful surroundings.\n\nPersonally, St. Gabriel's has truly shaped me into who I am today, thanks to its remarkable community and supportive staff. I would definitely relive the experience in a heartbeat!",

It's not what it looks like in the past, where many described St. Gabriel's as a 'gangster school', but once you enter its the exact opposite. Friendly students that'll help you in school. It's only been a few weeks as I'm a Sec 1 but solid school",
