Kei Chen,5,"Customer service - 9/1
Curry Chicken Noodle $4 taste ok
Kopi C Gao $1.60 still ok too
Total $5.60, budget food for a cafe.

Good to go eat if your nearby.

Chicken will be better if breast chicken meat or instead of with bones, easier to eat.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106031746776717760576/reviews
Dan P,5,"Richton Caf√© is a hidden gem conveniently located below an HDB block in Pasir Ris, making it a great spot for a quick and satisfying lunch fix. The caf√© offers an impressive variety of affordable and reasonably priced dishes, catering to different cravings. Whether you‚Äôre in the mood for Mee Goreng, Chicken Cutlet Rice, Hongkong Mee, Hor Fun, Mui Fun, Popcorn Chicken, Yong Tau Foo, Fried Bee Hoon, or Kway Teow, there‚Äôs always something to choose from.

One of the highlights of this caf√© is its indoor air-conditioned dining area, which provides a comfortable escape from the heat. However, seating is quite limited, especially during weekday lunch hours, so it‚Äôs best to come early or be prepared for a short wait. Despite the crowd, the service is efficient, and orders are usually prepared quite fast, making it a convenient option for those on a tight schedule.

A standout for me is their sambal chili‚Äîflavorful with just the right amount of spice, enhancing many of their dishes perfectly. It‚Äôs the kind of place that serves no-frills, hearty meals, ideal for a casual and fuss-free lunch.

If you‚Äôre in the Pasir Ris area and looking for a budget-friendly, tasty, and quick meal, Richton Caf√© is definitely worth a visit!

Muzalifah Idris,5,"Our 1st time trying the food here at Richton, and we were pleasantly surprise!ü§ó The cafe was cozy but like a no frills coffeeshop, so prices were understandably and pleasantly affordable! Dining tables were limited, abt 7 tables, but theres an atmosphere of neighbourly friendliness as most of the customers seem to be residents from the surrounding flats who seem familiar with d aunties serving here.

We tried their Hokkien Mee & Seafood Horfun, and wow, its delicious and the serving is Generous too! Took a while for me to finish mine! See foto attached.

We would definitely come back again to try their nasi lemak! Thankfully a friendly neighbourhood cafe serving good food with affordable prices! üëçü§óüí™üôè",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100651161058523901007/reviews
Joseph Benjamin,2,"Food good! Need to work on your online orders. Waited half an hour in line. While everyone who ordered after me got their food before me. Worst part is when I asked for more chili after waiting so long the guy just gave me the worst look ever as if I‚Äôm asking for a lot. Just rude! Been coming here to eat and breakfast over the years but service is something needs to be worked on. Coming to work with a god damn smile isn‚Äôt too hard to be honest

On a positive note. Their economic noodles is one of the best",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112204612668921468857/reviews
knnbccb,2,"Food taste superb, but at least cook ur egg to make it look more presentable and appealing to taste. Not just once but out of 5 nasi lemak set A orders on different occasions, at least 3 occasions were presented with an unappealing overcooked egg.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114000301728185997471/reviews
