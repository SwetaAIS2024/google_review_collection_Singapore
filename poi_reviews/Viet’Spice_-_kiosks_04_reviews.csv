Liam Lindemann,4,"Small street stall on the edge of Chinatown with the typical Vietnamese baguettes Banh Mi. They are freshly topped and then roasted in the oven. Correctfully afterwards are the fresh ingredients (carrots, herbs) added. It tastes okay, but unfortunately the baguette is much too crispy because of the time it was in the oven. It could also be juicier for my taste with a bit more sauce.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104106014053199433342/reviews
Saifu Angto,3,"A small stall selling vietnamese food and drinks.  After lunch, so did not stop to try bu the coffee drinks seems interesting especially coconut coffee and egg coffee - reminding the ones you can find in Hanoi.  Maybe next time I'm in Chinatown, I'll give it a try.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews
Pauline Ng,4,"Had a pork banh mi. The bread was nicely toasted  with butter and pate. (I prefer butter over mayo).

I've been to hawker stalls that don't bother toasting the bread, so I appreciate it. Of course, this means you have to wait a few minutes for it.

The woman behind the counter was nice.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105472715200257589493/reviews
mardinde1gezgin,1,I bought the worst sandwich of my life today. I couldn't eat it. I threw in the trash. chicken sucks. There is a huge difference between the product displayed and the product I purchased. I asked you to put salad in the sandwich. You just put a lettuce and a carrot. This product is not worth the money I paid. I will report this place to the tourism police.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104373629831120146941/reviews
Jenn Lam,2,"Ordered spring rolls and chicken feet. Terrible food quality, the spring rolls were not fresh, the rice paper was dried out and the sauce was overly sweet. The chicken feet tasted overly fermented and were mushy, had to throw the whole portion.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104685603756342556473/reviews
