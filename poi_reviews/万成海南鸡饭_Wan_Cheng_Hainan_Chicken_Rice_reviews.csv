chin wah john Tan,5,"A gem hidden in an obscure location in Sungei Kadut. Although they are a chicken rice stall, I decided to try their Kway Chap.

At $20 for 3 pax, I would never expect food of such good quality! The innards and pig skin were braised to the right chewiness and extremely flavourful. I tried the recommended Malaysian style kway teow instead of the usual kway and was pleasantly surprised that it paired well with the ingredients.

Thought I didn't try, the chicken and roast meat looks equally appetising! This is definitely a place that anyone should consider to visit if you are in this ulu area where birds don't even want to lay their eggs.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108449533965430335818/reviews
Kenny Yao,3,"I drive by it often, but no one knows about this place. Cars can be parked on the roadside. The taste is okay, the black rice here still has some flavor. A light lunch was ok.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114302111195693524282/reviews
