We tried a double shot espresso latte for $4.50 and an orange spiced mocha for $5.50, both were great. Heâ€™s got a CNY 1 for 1 promotion which is ðŸ¤¯. So if youâ€™re ever in the area I highly recommend you to give it a shot.",

There was a short queue on a weekday afternoon; waiting time can be awhile so do order in advance. Friendly owner whom I believe gives discount for regulars and perhaps for the wait :)",

Hot latte was abit sour and acidic, the matcha was soso, abit grassy and not really sweet enough to my liking. Iâ€™d give it a 3 star but because of the service / friendlyness of the owner, it changed my final rating to 4/5 to support their business! Iâ€™m very mindful about customer service and the owner felt very down to earth and carry on nice and short convo! Would recommend, but the drinks arenâ€™t to my preferences",
