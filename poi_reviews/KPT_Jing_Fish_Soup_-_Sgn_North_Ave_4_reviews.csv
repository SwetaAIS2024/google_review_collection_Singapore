Nicole Yang,5,"Really love the fish soup here - the fish pieces are sizeable and portion is quite generous. Each of them are fresh, tender yet still full of bite. Soup is deliciously made with lots of garlic (although it can get salty sometimes), tofu, tomatoes and veggie. It's a comfort food for sure and something I think of getting regularly. Recommended to try for sure! Service is not the best though but don't let that put you off from the delicious bowl of fish soup!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107660172885999064218/reviews

Lim ah gao,1,"No more $3.50 fish porridge. The fish soup stall suddenly changed the budget meal to fried fish head which is totally inedible. So many fish bones and no meat, not suitable for old people. I won’t come to this coffeeshop anymore, time to boycott",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107178705462821500753/reviews
Pearly Toh,1,$6.50 for fish porridge and fish soup and there’s only 4 slices of fish. The fish soup also tastes very salty and unhealthy to consume. Worst fish soup stall I have eaten. Thought it’s a healthy option but it turns out to be a scam,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101978377731423139196/reviews
