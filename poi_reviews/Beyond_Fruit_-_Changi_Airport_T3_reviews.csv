M L,5,"Among all the outlets, I prefer the one at the airport at T3. The staff, Cin Pin, is very polite, helpful and efficient. The dessert served is well balanced, especially the cookie butter where the portion is just right. My children and I visit this outlet almost every other week!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103968549533723654891/reviews
Taylor,1,This place may or may not be great but one thing I can say is that it is NOT where google says it should be. After going round and round in circles I eventually had to give it up for a lost cause because it was nowhere in sight.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108141643277664008672/reviews
