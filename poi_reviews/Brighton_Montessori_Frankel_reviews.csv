Teresang Ng,1,"Not a very good place for kids. My son was there and the teachers mediocre. One file costs $6 ! Just a normal file for kids to put papers.

The teachers were not exactly well qualified too compared to other schools.

Every thing is just money money money. If the school has outings and you are not keen to let them go also cant. U r advised to keep your child at home.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113510572226583500629/reviews
