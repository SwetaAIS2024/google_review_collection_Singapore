      "text": "The watermelon juice and dragonfruit+soursop juice are over diluted too much until two clear layers can be seen.\nWith ice=S$2.00, No ice=S$3.00.\nI requested for no ice, but the taste are seriously watered down. This quality is unacceptable.\nI know many stalls are struggling during the COVID-19 period, increase price or drop the quantity to recover their losses from the customers seems like a shortest way. However, you cannot do this in both ways to sacrifice your quality and at the same time generate double profits from the customers. It is just like doing one-time business, you will not go farther by sacrificing your reputation.",

      "text": "Decent fruit juice stall where everything is $2. You can also add $1 so that there is no ice. The juice itself can be quite diluted but I guess it is reasonable for the price. They are strategically located next to the famous noo Cheng prawn noodle and you will see some of the people queuing for prawn noodle order a juice so that they can remove their masks while standing in a scorching hot Adam road food centre. I guess I did that too!",
