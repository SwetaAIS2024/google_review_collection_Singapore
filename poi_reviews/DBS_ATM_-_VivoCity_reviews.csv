Flo Yeow,4,"This set of ATM machines is on the ground floor, closer towards the river side of Vivocity. It's right now located across from Aburi-En, #01-159/160.

It's not the most intuitive of locations, given that there's so many other better spots closer to the MRT entrance, but I guess it would have been an empty spot left unused in any case.

Better than nothing, especially if you're in need of cash while dining at Vivocity along one of the restaurants/bars, or at Haidilao.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
