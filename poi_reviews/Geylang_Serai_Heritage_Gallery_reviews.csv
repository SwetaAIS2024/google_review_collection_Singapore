Patrick Lau,4,"First time visit today to collect the NHB rabbit series of red packet for the coming CNY.

Place is very new, very well kept, very clean and I really wouldn’t mind spending an entire afternoon there reading a book and listening to background classical music.  Sadly, there are no seats and table as well as background music.  But it’s ok, it’s supposed to be a museum of sorts, not a cafe

Centre sitter has a lunch time break of 1200-1400hrs.  There’s plenty of car park lots in the basement car park and I think EV chargers will be available very soon!

Will definitely visit again!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106881591692184457438/reviews

Samuel Lipoff,4,"Nice small free heritage gallery with some nice explanations about the history of Geylang Serai and the Malay kampung.  Quite a few videos and oral histories (most in English, some in Malay) － my favorites were the stories of the hawkers.  If you come before lunch you can walk across the street and eat at the same hawker stalls that they interviewed!  Nice selection of artifacts and well presented.  Not a destination by itself though.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110394865249528273768/reviews
