Sean Goh,4,"Chanced upon this zhichar stall inside a coffeeshop along Tanjong Katong road. My parent came here previously and said that the food was not bad. Happened to be around here in the evening and decided to pop by for dinner. There isn't much stalls that were opened when we reached. Not difficult to get a table since there wasn't much people around.

Ordered 3 dishes, sweet and sour pork, stir fried broccoli with garlic and hotplate beancurd. Didn't had to wait long before our food arrived. Food was indeed good. The most outstanding dish definitely has to be the sweet and sour pork. Meat was crispy and the sauce was well balanced. The remaining 2 dishes were equally good as well.

Overall, enjoyed the food and would definitely come back again in the future. Parking wise, might be a little challenging.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews

Chan Jin Han,5,"The food here is fantastic.
The ÊúàÂÖâÊ≤≥ has wok hey.
The Curry Pork rice is tasty and flavourful.
Only reason I gave 3 ‚≠ê for service is the owner did not give me fried egg despite the menu illustration has it. The owner said it is add on. ü´§

Otherwise it is worthwhile. Will comeback a 2nd time",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111596010068031788476/reviews
