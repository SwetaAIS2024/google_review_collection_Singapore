Theophilus Zao,5,Had a fun experience as the waitress served out food with perfection. As it was my birthday they helped to play the happy birthday song thru their sound system as well as singing it for me. Pizza Hut @ HarbourFront was the best experience ever for my 18th birthday!!! üî•üî•üî•üíØüíØüíØ,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103824967491722545440/reviews

Ellie Lee,5,"We attended the kids‚Äô pizza-making workshop yesterday, and it was such a delightful experience! Although there were some inconveniences during the registration process, everything went smoothly after getting in touch with Cherry, the manager at the Harbourfront location. Her professionalism, communication skills, and kindness were truly appreciated.

The workshop itself was excellent! It was clear that all the staff put in a lot of effort and preparation to make the event special. My child had a wonderful time learning and creating their own pizza. Thank you for organizing such a fun and meaningful activity. We‚Äôve made some unforgettable memories at Pizza Hut!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117085777565455837449/reviews
