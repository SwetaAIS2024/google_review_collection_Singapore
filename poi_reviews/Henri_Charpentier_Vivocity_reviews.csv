Tam Nguyen,4,"The tiramisu is truly exceptional, boasting a rich and creamy texture with a perfect balance of coffee and cocoa flavors. The cheesecake is equally impressive, offering a decadent and satisfying experience.
While the quality of the desserts is undeniable, be prepared for a slightly higher price point. However, for a special treat or a memorable dessert experience, Henri Charpentier is well worth the splurge.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107623195585945809154/reviews
Eve C,5,"We needed a tea break and Henri Charpentier is in the right spot for it. Henri Charpentier has always been a very good Bakery focusing on the cakes they do really well which is their shortcake and cheesecake.

We ordered the strawberry shortcake, mango shortcake and double cheese cake (all in slices) to try. My girls were slow eaters and I was surprised for the first time, they gobbled down the cakes. Not because they were hungry but they really loved the spongy cake and the light weight cream. We all enjoyed it.

Compliments to the staff as well with good service and recommend better payment method for us.

Only downside is the limited seatings but when I was there, the place is not crowded so I could find a seat. A lot of customers opt for take away.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109756518746414930822/reviews
Max N,1,"Visited this outlet on a Friday evening around 8:30pm and the place was empty.

We took a while to decide as it was my sister's and mother's first time. The lady manning the cake counter did not bother to ask or offer any assistance. In the end we opted for their limited time special Berry Blossom ($10.20) and their Double Cheese Cake ($8.70).

When asked by the other staff how many forks I needed, I said 4. To my surprise they gave us plastic forks, in my other visits to their other outlets, they'll give a metal fork when dining-in. But I didn't question as it has been a while since I last visited, just thought it was a change in SOP.

On to the review of the cakes we ordered. The Berry Blossom was overtly sweet and sickening. The cake on the inside was dry and bland. The cheesecake was light and airy, a good mix of savory and sweet, but not too sweet.

Whilst we were in the midst of eating, another group was about to leave, returning the tray to the tray collection point. As I was conveniently seated right by it, I noticed they were given metal forks. 2 ladies who walked in behind us ordered 1 cake and were also given metal forks.

As my partner was full from dinner, I returned the unused 4th fork that I took for him to the counter. Only to be met with the cake counter staff taking it and simply tossing it in the air in a somewhat rude manner. The fork hit the edge of the counter and fell to the floor. Whilst she violently hit the tray against the bin to show her displeasure.

Overall, would not recommend anyone to purchase from this outlet. Both staff were extremely rude and treated us poorly, when we did nothing wrong and were cordial when ordering.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107968498556516114277/reviews

LLY,1,"For a $10 slice, this black forest cake is far below average standard. Too sweet, hardly any cherries and too much chocolate. Is anything but fresh.  Cream Was greasy.   more fitting as a chocolate cream cake At a price of $5.

First, and definitely last time eating at HenryiCarpenter.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109532822556061355724/reviews
