Truly international experience.\n\nLot of accessories also provided like Balaclava, Socks, gloves and Helmet Cameras also.\n\nEnsure to have sports shoes compulsory, suggested to bing your own Balaclava or purchase once and keep it with you.\n\nRide is awesome, kids, teens and suitable for age groups.\n\nReally exciting and fascinating. Nice cafe also near to hangout.\n\nBest time to go is evening or night and no rain. If it rains ride will be cancelled and no refund.",

Loved that they had free storage for us to put our stuff in while we were go karting! The cafe was pretty good too! They had private rooms which seems like a good place to hold small parties",

I highly recommend the Stage 1 kart, which packs 8 HP and even has pop n bangs!! It was such a fun surprise! ü§© The karts are very well maintained, and the price is fair for the quality of the experience.\n\nThe staff were super friendly and helpful, making sure everything ran smoothly. For anyone who's a first-timer, this place is definitely worth a visit! I‚Äôll be back for more karting fun for sure! üëçüèª",
