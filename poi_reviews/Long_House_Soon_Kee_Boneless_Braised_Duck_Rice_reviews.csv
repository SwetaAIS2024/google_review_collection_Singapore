Erica Tan,5,"Very nice and simple plate of braised duck rice.
The soup that comes along was herbal and tasty.

$4.50 for a plate of duck meat rice with some peanuts and 1 egg.
Added taukwa which was silky and smooth.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100559657465191889850/reviews
bh,4,"The braised duck is prepared a tad bit salty, though flavorful, it could be better if the meat is more tender. Otherwise it has a well balanced delivery and service from the store owner.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111872021927120413017/reviews
S A,5,"Known of this family owned stall for very long n decided to try this for first time. I find this duck rice is healthier. It is unlike those salty & oily braised duck rice with a lot msg but not this. The duck rice, sauce and soup here are not very salty, yet still can deliver a good flavour. Duck meats not dry and very tender. Portion given is also generous $4.50",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104490291353349286192/reviews
Tan Wei Liang,4,"A decent plate of duck rice, but honestly quite overrated. The rice was mostly clumped up, but goes pretty well with the braised sauce. The duck was quite dry - nothing fantastic. The upside is that it is boneless. The innards though are braised pretty well and provide an additional texture to the duck rice. The soup is good too - not like the typical bland soup that is full of MSG. The chilli was meh too, not spicy nor fragrant at all. Overall, I wouldnâ€™t mind eating it if I am nearby and craving for duck rice, but definitely not worth a queue.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102725254698687540687/reviews
Jacob TAN,3,"This coffeeshop is next to the food centre. It was not crowded during lunch time. There were 2 persons ahead of me in the queue but it took 10 minutes to get my food. The duck and the gizzard tasted ok but the portion was quite pathetic. The chilli had an overpowering spice taste that didn't gel with the taste of the braised duck. Overall, I was quite disappointed with this meal.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
