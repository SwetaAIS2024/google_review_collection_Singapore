Ronnie Goh,5,"As the Managing Director of Swiss Interior, I cannot recommend IDIS highly enough for their outstanding diploma and short courses. We recently sent 30 of our designers to attend their programs, and the results have been remarkable.

The courses are tailored to identify and enhance each designerâ€™s strengths while addressing their weaknesses. This personalized approach has not only improved their technical design skills but also elevated their ability to understand and meet client needs more effectively.

Thank you IDIS!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108533463984806543473/reviews
CHRIS SUM,5,"I am a renovation contractor. Speaking with designers have always been a difficult task in the course of my work. One of my objective for 2021 is to enrol myself into a interior design course to learn the designer mindset, language and working method. During this one year, i have learnt things that are beyond my own imagination and expectation. Now i can speak with designers better, understand their mindset and most importantly, able to differentiate a good design vs a bad design. I belief we can all bring design to a higher level as a interior designer or a hands on contractor",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115556547171959835822/reviews

The ambiance exudes creativity, and the faculty and staff are passionate about nurturing the next generation of interior designers.

The curriculum is comprehensive and well-rounded, covering everything from design principles to technical skills and industry trends. What sets Inspiration apart is its emphasis on hands-on learning. We were constantly working on real-world projects, collaborating with classmates and industry professionals to bring our ideas to life.

The faculty members are experts in their field and are always available to provide guidance and support. They challenge us to think outside the box, push our creative boundaries, and develop our unique design aesthetic. Their insights and feedback have been invaluable in shaping my growth as a designer.

One aspect I particularly appreciate about Inspiration is its focus on sustainability and ethical design practices. We're encouraged to consider the environmental and social impact of our designs, ensuring that we create spaces that are not only beautiful but also responsible.

Overall, my experience at Inspiration Interior Design School has been incredibly rewarding.

Doreen Ling,4,"Took a leap of faith and attended the sketch up part-time course (oct 2019). Instructor is Jayden, he is direct and casual, with a good knowledge of the industry . Lesson is clear and very relevant to my job. Certain sequence need live demo (which U-tube lesson may not provide) . No regrets as I achieved what I wanted to learn. As my classmate Lynna mentioned , I also from zero knowledge of this software to able to produce the drawings attached. Already started applying to my work . Thks Jayden , job well done !!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112539334815488517085/reviews
