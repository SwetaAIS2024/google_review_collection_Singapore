Daniel Sim,5,"Newly opened Thomson GP clinic (from Pheonix Medical Group), walking distance from Bright Hill MRT. Dr Lee Kai Lun is very approachable, caring and will spend time to understand & explain what is causing the medical issue. I also appreciate the quality of medicine issued, which strikes a good balance between affordability and efficacy. I recommend to give them a try if you're looking for a quality family doctor.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105499730783375350107/reviews
Jennifer Germaine Choi,5,"Very new clinic and by far the best in Upper Thomson compared to the one we used to go at Imperial Court.

My daughter had a fever for a few days, Dr Barron Soh was very caring and good in explaining and letting me know what to watch out for if she doesnt get well.

He is also very diligent in checking if i already have certain medicine so he does not need to prescribe for her unlike some other clinics.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113819206751609247242/reviews
Serene Hui Koon Ang,1,"Clinic closed at 3pm on Tuesday but when I brought my daughter there at 1.15pm, the doctor has already left! Definitely does not reflect well on a new clinic. Whoever is keen to visit this clinic, please call to check if thereâ€™s any doctor on duty before going down to avoid making an empty, trip especially for someone who is not feeling well.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109556693098375808027/reviews
