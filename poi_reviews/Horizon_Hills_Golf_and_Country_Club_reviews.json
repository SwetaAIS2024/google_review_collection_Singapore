I was truly impressed with the menu, offering a great variety of delicious dishes. The highlight for me was the kambing bakar‚Äîit was tender, flavorful, and perfectly cooked. Asam pedas claypot also.. woahh the best üëçüëç\n\nThe overall dining experience was excellent, and considering the quality of the food and service, it‚Äôs definitely worth the price. Highly recommended for a satisfying and enjoyable iftar!",

The green is very fast, just one light tap and the ball rolled a long distance. It‚Äôs buggy on track, hot to walk for afternoon flight. Our caddy is not effective, would not search ball for us, read the wrong line during putting and made mistakes in fetching the correct club. And we were told to tip the caddy by a fixed amount, not by the standard of service she provided.",
