      "text": "This place specializes in Singaporean cuisine and offers a serene dining experience.\n\nUpon arrival, I was impressed by the peaceful atmosphere and the soothing sound of the nearby waterfall. The place was bustling with activity, primarily catering to take-away customers. However, there were also a few customers enjoying their meals in the comfortable seating area.\n\nWhile the overall quality was satisfactory, there were a few minor drawbacks. The bread served with the meals was slightly hard to bite into, which affected the overall enjoyment of the dishes.",

      "text": "The most horrible phad thai i ever tasted! It is so horrible that i don't even know how to describe. Yet you call your orchid thai? I mean,  please try it yourself or any thai, i am very sure, you'll get very negative feedback. I have to literally swallow it in order not to waste food. Please don't sell this if you cannot be authentic or even up to the basic standard. Yet it is not cheap too. Very very and extremely disappointing.\n\nThe staff especially male cashier. Unfriendly, rude and not happy with his work i guess. Literally threw the packet lunch in the plastic bag and unhappily slam the food in the table! I mean harlow i am paying customer ok? Do i deserve this? What did i do to you? If you have a bad morning then pls take leave or mc. Don't come to work with an attitude. You only spoil ppl mood. Ir your boss never pay you enough? Then please take it up with your boss and not the customers!",

Good environment with the water flow down sound at another side of the wall. Can see the cloud on top of this cafe... the food is just a very normal local food plus some Thai food like Tom Yam soup and mango sticky rice. I having a Teh siew dai And Mee rebus is just ok normal. But enjoy the environment with this open space cafe!!!",
