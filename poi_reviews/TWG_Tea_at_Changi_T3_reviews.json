Despite the late hour at night (around 11pm), the gentleman behind the counter was engaged, patient, helpful, courteous. Minimal waiting time for service. The macarons and chocolates looked delicious too!",

The staff were very helpful, asking me questions about the kind of tea tastes and scents I liked and suggested a few blends. Their suggestions were all so amazing - I wanted to take them all. A wee bit pricey, but the brews are amazing. They also have some cute tea pots and sets, as well as traditional china tea sets",
