William Chiang,5,"This is my offday favourite lunch place. All the way from Bedok to here for these 2 foods. This boneless chicken rice honestly is the best. Fragrance rice, thick and juicy chicken, fresh ginger and chili paste, if you want can put black soysauce. Chicken rice closed every Monday. And prefer this ÊñáÂçécoffee stall, not only they provide gau coffee, the boss can remember all regular customers past orders, extreme good memories.

Worth the trip.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102756607536029317980/reviews
