I've always liked this location as it's sort of hidden and quiet and away from the more crowded area like Upper Thomson.\n\nMrt station near by so it's accessible. Many supper locations around as well.\n\nExtremely friendly staff and owners, good sound system. Especially loved the second floor.\n\nWould be patronizing this place very often.",

The sound quality was great, and the karaoke equipment worked flawlessly, adding to the overall enjoyment.\n\nThe staff at Gold8 Bar were friendly and accommodating. They promptly attended to our needs and provided excellent service throughout the night. The drinks menu was diverse, offering a good selection of beverages to suit different preferences.\n\nThe dim lighting and stylish interior created a vibrant ambiance. I highly recommend the Gold8 Bar for anyone looking to have a memorable karaoke experience with friends or family.",
