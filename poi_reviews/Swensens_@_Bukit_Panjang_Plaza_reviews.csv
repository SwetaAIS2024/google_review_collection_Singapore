S,1,"Ordered two fish and chips via Foodpanda and was thoroughly surprised when we got our food. The quality of food has dropped significantly since we last had it - fish isnâ€™t the same as we had last time, itâ€™s too soft and overly flaky and literally falls apart when we pick it up with a fork, it doesnâ€™t have the same firm yet tender texture we had last time. Next, no tartar sauce was given, despite it being emphasised on the menu description. The last straw was when we were given dried up, mouldy lemons for the fish. Thankfully I scrutinised before even squeezing it onto the fish if not it would have been a huge food safety breach, and there could be possible serious medical consequences had we ingested it. All these, for $39, for two sets of fish and chips, no less. Terrible experience. ðŸ˜ž",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102643677937221156518/reviews
Abraham Lee,3,"I think the brand has really failed to evolve with the times but nonetheless still brings back a nice touch of nostalgia with food that still tastes great! The placement of the tables seem very cluttered and squeezy, often causing a bottleneck between their own staff and customers. Waiting time was also unacceptable, taking about 30-40 mins for our mainsâ€¦ I guess the saving grace was the baked rice and the ice cream. Nothing to mention about the service, pretty standard and could use a little energy/ tinge of politeness.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews
Anikaz Travel,4,"Good food and great selections of ice cream. A lot of vegetarian options. They have an array of impossible burgers to choose from!
The pizza was delicious and had an incredible tangy sauce.
The mozzarella sticks were delicious too! The sweet potato fries were incredibly crisp.
The banana split was sweet and decadent with different flavours of icecream.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100371975357068365869/reviews
Andrew Ng,3,"Terrible, bring such food out and when the guy wearing tie saw it, still did nothing until i need to raise to another person on why is it so burnt!

GK,1,"We tried to enquire on the Trust promotion on complimentary sundae but the staffs very all busy and just act not seeing you. When a staff came, he said he not sure and need to ask. He never come back. Asked another staff, and he said he will informed the counter but nobody come. Waited for more than 20mins. Eventually when the manager finally came, told them to cancel the reminding order as we were already rushing offâ€¦.. Swenson pls help to improve your staffs services and knowledge of promotionsâ€¦..",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113924202838582804526/reviews
