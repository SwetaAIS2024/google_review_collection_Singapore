i VG_,4,A sec 1 in this sch and I can say it’s not a bad school actually. Teachers are kind but strict. They’re not the type of teachers that anyhow exposed other student’s grade to everyone. They respect students privacy. Canteen food not bad just that the food portion are a bit too small. OGL’s are really nice and fun! Overall it’s good.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111431572958161652568/reviews
Toyoshima Hikaru (Tkgs),5,"The uniform and hair rules are strict, yes, you will get booked for it during spot check, but the teachers and students there are very warm and nice. The teachers will remind you in a NICE manner when you have a strand of hair unclipped, so for those who said that this school is trash, that's not true! I never regretted joining this school and being a tkgian.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114010721443173052511/reviews
P M Y,1,"This school seems to like to penalize their students for minor infringement of school regulations and academic mistakes. Meritocracy must come with a heart, dun just emphasize scoring in exams and army-style discipline without empathy and compassion.

And for goodness' sake, please redesign the school uniform already, it makes the students look like they are in a dystopian institution and are treated as such.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115827995126127522086/reviews
Qaisara Zaki Beetsma (Tkgs),5,"Okok fine the booking system is a bit harsh but if you pin your hair up and all is all actually ok. It’s you not being responsible, not the booking system being rigged. Overall, i love the school, great teachers and canteen food mostly halal, all nice. I love the wide range of facilities and activities in the school, they make sure it’s not ALL about studying. Loving my seniors, campfire was amazing and y’all should consider choosing this school, it’s great. I especially love the glow up room. Other than my art teacher, it’s all fine, nice classmates and overall learning vibe. TK rocks!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112173105433630115500/reviews
Suzanne Ho,5,My daughter loved the pastoral focus and support of her teachers and the blamefree and holistic approach to education.  She moved from fail to A1 the next term thanks to the support from the teachers during the 'drop' in remedial classes. A school that is great today and gets greater with the proactive and supportive management team and teachers.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106324451545736437317/reviews
