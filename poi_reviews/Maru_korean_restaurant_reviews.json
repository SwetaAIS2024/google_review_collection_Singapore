The ingredients were notably fresh and we appreciated that. However, we felt there was room for improvement in the refinement of the flavors and presentation.\n\nWe did observe an unpleasant odor within the premises, and we kindly suggest that enhanced attention to cleanliness would contribute positively to the overall dining experience.",

Cold water and side dishes are provided as standard. Big bottle beer about 30 rm. Quite generous with the cabbage for wrapping the meat.",

      "text": "We visited Maru Korean BBQ at Eco Botanic, JB, with high hopes, but unfortunately, it didn't quite meet my expectations. Despite its authentic appearance and reasonable prices, the taste fell short. Compared to Korean restaurants in Singapore, the standard here was somewhat lower. However, I appreciate the affordable pricing, and I hope they'll enhance their seasonings to improve the flavor. With a bit of improvement, this place has potential!",

      "text": "Very authentic Korean bbq in Eco-Botanic. Crowded during dinner time with many Korean family inside dining too. We ordered grill pork and chicken. Very well marinated and juicy. The bean paste seafood soup is delicious too. Seafood pan cake, bibimbap are all similar to the one we tried in Korea. The banchan is free flow. Total 5 of us with the above dishes come to about RM 250, which is rather reasonable.",

      "text": "I recently visited Maru Korean BBQ with my wife and we ordered the BBQ pork belly. The food was really delicious and the pork belly was incredibly tender and juicy. We also decided to try Set A (pork belly, pork rib BBQ & Kimchi Stew) which was plenty for two or three people, with a variety of side dishes.\n\nOne thing that really impressed us was the fast service. Our dishes came out quickly and our server was very helpful, giving us recommendations and even explaining how to cook the meat just right. Overall, the dining experience at Maru was excellent and the food was top-notch.\n\nIf you're looking for a great Korean BBQ spot, I would definitely recommend checking out Maru. It's a great place to go with friends or family, and the food and service are both outstanding.",
