Elijah Tan,5,"I have tried their food several times for lunch, and I must say that they do have a nice selection. I would normally order their lemak chicken and bagedil. Their portion is quite large and at a reasonable price of only $6.

If I could propose a suggestion regarding the operational efficiency during the busy lunch hours, it would be super nice to have two staff members dedicated to taking orders and serving customers, considering the limited time frame of only one hour that we are assigned.

Other than that, great food and friendly staff.

Highly-recommended!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109287346354369266778/reviews
