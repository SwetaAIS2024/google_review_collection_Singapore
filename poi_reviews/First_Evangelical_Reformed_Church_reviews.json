A church that holds to faithful confessions - mainly, the Three Forms of Unity and also, to an extent, the Westminster Confession of Faith while having sound and faithful preaching of the Word. The people here are welcoming and down-to-earth toward guests. Will definitely visit a couple more times for as long as I am in Singapore.",
