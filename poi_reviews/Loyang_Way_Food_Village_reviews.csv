peter h t seow,3,Good place to eat some prawn noodles if you are in the vicinity. The soup is good even in a standard bowl of prawn noodles.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111973456590377177245/reviews
Ken Ang,3,"We visited on 15 Mar 25 around 845am. Two men operating the stall. Order item No 2, the prawn soup was not thick, and prawns were also not fresh. The original taste and standard have dropped. Hope will improve when we get back again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114571952012110683977/reviews
TCH,5,"Free parking here but it can be a challenge to find a spot during peak meal times!  Weekends one would find many cyclists stop over here too!

Many choices of food here, with the Legendary Loyang Big Prawn noodles here being the main draw!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102467592239988127131/reviews
Nick Doggett,4,"Good food available here, wide variety. Gets very crowded at lunch time so better to visit before 12.30 or after 1.30pm.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113028671643948738139/reviews
Me T,3,2pm only and like half the shops are closed. Quite crazy I'd say. Kinda made a wasted trip down. This was on a Friday. Maybe the date matters? Eaten here before and there's some pretty decent and affordable food soooo. Will not give such low rating,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108574826620835359575/reviews
