      "text": "Limited stalls open at the Bedok South Blk 16 hawker centre on a Sunday afternoon. They one of the limited stalls that were still operating. This stall has been around for quite sometime. Stall is operated by an elderly lady. Menu is pretty much similar to those Korean/Japanese food stall in food court. Price starts from SGD$4.80 onwards.\n\nOrdered item no.11 on the menu which is Teriyaki Chicken and Saba fish bento. Paid SGD$5.50 for my meal. Didn't had to wait since there was no other customer except for me. Presentation of the food was mediocre. Teriyaki chicken was pretty small piece, it was crispy but there was barely any sauce. Saba fish probably fried a few times, as a result it was very dry.\n\nOverall, food was disappointing, don't think  would patronized again. In the same hawker centre, there is another stall selling Japanese cusine.",

      "text": "Utterly regret paying $11.40 for very bland food with questionable quality of ketchup and mayonnaise.\n\n3.30pm on a Mon afternoon - almost all stalls closed. #3 just arrived home after a day camp without lunch.\n\nWas thinking of either chicken rice from Peng You or duck rice from Koon Kee (both their duck rice stalls are good - elder brother's stall also has yummy kway chap), but #3 insisted on trying this stall.\n\nOrdered ebi tempura udon (for #3) & salmon egg omelette rice (for me).\n\nService was satisfactory both in terms of friendliness and promptness.\n\n1st red flag: salmon in real life was noticeably thinner, shorter & narrower than in the picture. Actual thickness: about 5mm only.\n\n2nd red flag: ketchup squeezed onto omelette appeared transparent (not opaque) & lightly coloured red (not thick & dark red) - it looked like red-tinted starch glue used in art and craft.\n\n3rd red flag: mayonnaise for ebi tempura is runny, not thick.\n\nOn first mouthful, worst fears confirmed: everything served was bland. Even #3 commented that the ebi tempura tastes like cardboard.\n\nThis stall is not for me. My first & last time.",
