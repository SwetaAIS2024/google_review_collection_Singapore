      "text": "My go to album shop :) it sells stickers and kpop albums and also has a photo booth. there is also a lucky draw that changed theme once in a while. There are also toploaders, sleeves and lightsticks.somr albums with slight flaws (eg. a dent) will have a discount (eg. 10% discount). there are so many different types of albums ranging from solo,group and even ost albums.the place is so organized so it's very easy to find things. They also sell old albums and unpopular groups. They also have reasonable pricing. On top of that the shop is so pretty and aesthetic and the staff were so friendly and will help you out if u need it. 100% recommend this :)))ðŸ’«",

However, today (31 August 2024)\nwhen I was checking my bank transactions, I found out that $21.63 was deducted from my bank account by Things I Luv past 8pm even though the store closes at 8pm. Looking to resolve this immediately and have called my bank about this. Please be careful when going to this store!!!",
