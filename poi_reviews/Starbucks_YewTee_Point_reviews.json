      "text": "This is a compliment to the 2 young Starbucks staff on duty at Yew Tee Pt branch on 21/4/25 (Mon) at around 8.30pm. The young lady staff recommended my daughter to try Sea Breeze Mint Chocolate Coffee Frappuccino (Less Sweet) if she would like a not too sweet cold coffee. It is indeed nice, esp cuz it has similar taste as Starbucks' X'mas Peppermint Mocha, which is our entire family's favourite drink! They also prepared my hot Pure Matcha Latte to perfection! Their cheerful and warm disposition, as well as their great work attitude, is highly appreciated!",

      "text": "Dining at Yee Tee point next to Yew Tee MRT. The store can be found on the first floor and it is well hidden. If you like a quiet place, with less people and dislikes having everyone staring at you eating from the outside. Then this is your place, only a few downsides. No windows to look outside, food might be limited but it might be me coming after lunch time and the seating might be small or limited the numbers of people seating. Other than that, the server is super nice, even serves my food and drinks to my table which I could collect myself since I'm very close to the collection table.",

Drinks is oatmilk cocca machiato (very bitter) & flat white.\n\nDeep beef pie and the creamy chicken foldover is the must try item. They taste really good. Beef pie with the strong aroma tomato base and the foldover and maple pecan apple cake, both taste is well balanced.  Come try!\n\nP.s. : I have sweet tooth. ðŸ˜…",
