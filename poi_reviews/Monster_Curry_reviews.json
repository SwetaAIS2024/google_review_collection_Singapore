Ren Jie although not familiar with the voucher things, but also done a good job in being available for customer always. The last trip when I came, hard to get someone when we need something. This time Ren Jie is fast to respond. Will come again",

Super value meal for a restaurant these days üëçüëç\n\nLove the waiter's service too! He was a one man army serving everyone at lunch hour, blending drinks, prepping takeout containers, serving food, taking payment etc. Very polite too. Would love if restaurant can put names of cashiers on receipts so we can properly applaud him. But in any case, pleasant experience today! Will definitely return again!",
