Charlotte Tan Jing Wen,5,Really thankful for all the help and advice given to me by the lactation consultants at Parentcraft Centre (special thanks to Fonnie and Sharon). Fonnie has been so lovely in helping me and reassuring me when I had mastitis :') they always follow up with calls after LC appointments which honestly is such a nice gesture because they're also really happy to give advice over the phone. Thank you for helping me reach a stage of my BFing journey where I'm happy to be BFing!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105325166209899119891/reviews
