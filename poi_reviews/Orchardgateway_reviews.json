      "text": "Love this indoor shopping mall. It has multiple levels and offers so much of variety of shopping, food and more. Very spacious, open and clean. People here are friendly as well.\n\nThere are many small vendors as soon as you enter the mall at the first level. I can‚Äôt always find handcrafted unique items in the section.\n\nOf course, our favorite level is were filled with variety of restaurants and delicious cuisines . The food court which is what Americans call it is huge. So much variety of foods are offered here and has a fun grab machine with arcade too.\n\nPricing throughout the mall are very, but majority are very reasonable . Grab pick up is convenient by one of the main entrance.\nHighly recommend.",
