Speedy service also. Seats quite limited perhaps due to the rising popularity of the shop. Patience will reward u with a table within 5mins. Will come back regularly!",

I also tried the Sweet Potato Orh Nee Paste, which hit the spot, especially on a rainy day. The desserts are comforting and full of flavour, and the service is fast too. Definitely a place Iâ€™ll keep coming back to!",

Shouldnâ€™t the out of stock situation be informed to us before we order ? We are willing to pay $8.20 for a bowl of dessert that we liked rather than paying a premium but getting substandard food (like one big bowl of ice onlyðŸ˜…) . Appreciate that the owner can look into this to uphold their reputation.",
