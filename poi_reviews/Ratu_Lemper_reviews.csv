Jun Hong Kang,5,"Various kinds of Malay Kuih and cookies sold here. Personal favourite would be the kuih salat and ondeh ondeh. They are famous for their lemper which is the glutinous rice filled with fillings wrapped in banana leaf.

Sadly they are located a bit far from the tourist spots so I'm unsure how long would they last as it was quite quiet the 2 times I visited them.

Their chempedak kek lapis was very expensive though and probably not worth the price tag...",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114391004118123754474/reviews
V Lim,4,"I ordered their kueh thru WhatsApp and send a grab pickup to take my food from their booth at Causeway point. When the grab guy arrive at their booth the 1st thing they told him was there is no order under my name which makes me worried. Then I tried texting or calling thru their WhatsApp but nobody pickup or respond immediately. After awhile my guy called again and say they found my order. I was really worried because I was not at the booth to check it personally and there was no help thru the WhatsApp too. The kueh is nice, all my friends and family enjoy it especially the creamy kawsi pandan. But the other kueh kueh was not cut nicely and I have to slice it thru again so is easier to pick up.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105727216385829706567/reviews
tari jame,3,"price of the kue now expensive, quality of the lemper has decreased and the size has become small n bika ambon doesn't smell like lime leaves and they sell cake edges, bika bakar tastes a good, but the price is relatively expensive for a half portion size.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103005569727061412710/reviews

C Li Ng,5,Skillfully made kuehs. Nicely balanced flavours. Bought the kueh to assemble into a birthday cake. The lady tending to the shop was very accommodating.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102379486490332641416/reviews
