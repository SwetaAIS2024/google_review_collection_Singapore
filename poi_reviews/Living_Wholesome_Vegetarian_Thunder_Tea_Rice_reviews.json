      "text": "Located at Bukit Timah Market & Food Centre, stall number #02-188.\n\nPrice: $7.00 (Lei Cha Brown Rice)\n\nThe ingredients of the Lei Cha (Thunder Tea Rice) includes fried bean curd, sweet chye poh (preserved radish bits), long beans, stir fried cabbage, mani cai (sweet leaf), black eyed pea, toasted peanuts and sesame. Tea soup is basil based and kind of resembles Thai green curry in taste minus the coconut milk.\n\nAll the ingredients they used are very fresh and tasted delicious as a whole. The tea soup might seem little at first but the amount given is just right.\n\nLooking forward to trying the Bee Hoon set next time!\n\nDo come support the lesser known dishes in Singapore!",

      "text": "So yummy and wholesome. A bit pricey but worth it. Balanced flavours with generous portions of veggie and taukwa, complete with beans (more protein!) and crunchy peanuts~ requested for thunder tea paste since this was a takeaway, and I added my own water to it. On the saltier side, though I guess this is common, so I added more water to balance out the taste a bit. Still very tasty though. Will be back to try the beehoon :-D",
