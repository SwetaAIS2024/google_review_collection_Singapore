K,5,"Highly recommended. Best wanton noodles in Bukit panjang.

Big wanton. Big prawn dumplings. Noodle serving can be more. Spinach noodle is special. Char Siew is nice too.

Mala dumplings is super spicy.

Recommend to get the spinach noodles special, as it would come with char siew, 2 normal wanton, 2 fried wanton. Then, add on the promotion cheesy fried prawn dumplings (in 6), for a super satisfying meal.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109386738253826668143/reviews
Jeffrey,4,"Inside the newly renovated coffee shop. There is always a long queue during weekends, not mush so during weekdays. They used to be very slow in serving but now things has improved. I ordered the signature wanton noodle, dry with chili. Noodles are nice chewy, I really like their sauce with the noodles, their wanton is bigger than usual as they are generous with their fillings. Presentation is good for a coffee shop. Overall it is a tasty above average plate of wanton noodle.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114245811301243431771/reviews
Jason Ong,4,"One of the nicer Wanton Noodles around. This is the dark sauce version. I've tried both the regular and spinach noodles, and both were yummy.
The wantons were fresh and of a good size, unlike some stalls which serve miniscule wantons. Worth a visit if you're around the area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101337983538091125134/reviews
Paul Young,4,"Decent bowl of Wan Tan Mee. Not too bad at all.:) noodles was done well, wan tan was meaty. I donâ€™t like the fried one but loved the soup one. Great amount of char Siew but not the best.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109729405213634414664/reviews
CHIN ANG,3,"Large signboards promising
but looks can be deceiving
plate looks good but alas
MSG after mouth thirsty
black sauce kind no chilli
generous wantans taste like siew mei
dumplings just add small cultivated prawns
needs lots of water after
sad you only get veggie scraps
definitely not a Kee noodle seller",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106579944402663883280/reviews
