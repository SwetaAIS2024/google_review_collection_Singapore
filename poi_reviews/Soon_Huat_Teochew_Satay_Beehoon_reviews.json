I noticed the staff owner added lots of sugar while stirring the pot of sauce. The liver and cockle wasn't fresh. Will give a miss. Noticed very low number of reviews.",

      "text": "One of our favourite satay bee hoon in town.\n\nThe sauce is a thick, sweet, nutty aroma that wafts through the air and pulls you in — that's the smell of heaven if you ask us. The sauce here is rich and grainy with larger peanut chunks, and the mild spiciness of it all cuts through its thickness well, making it a perfectly balanced option we go back for time and time again.\n\nBear in mind that it is not a vegetarian dish. As the peanut sauce has shrimp in it (blended into the sauce, hence it is inseparable)\n\nThey sell sauce packaging separately as well. You can bring home and follow the simple 3 step instructions.",
