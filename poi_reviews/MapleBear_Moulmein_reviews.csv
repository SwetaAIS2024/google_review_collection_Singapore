Candy Chew,5,"Very nurturing, caring and attentive teachers at Maplebear! My son enrolled when he was 10months old and transitted to toddler class. It was unfortunate that we had to move and had to change school when he is at 20 months old. We can really tell that the teachers made a lot of effort to understand the child and is able to pick up what they need. We have seen our son grew so much as of first week joining and continue to grow be it in motor skills and social skills.

Shirley Chua,5,"Highly recommend MapleBear Moulmein, as our baby has been thriving under the care of the principal and teachers. They are knowledgeable and dedicated to her. We can tell that the teachers genuinely love our baby, and she is always all smiles whenever she checks in to school. She has been progressing towards her milestones very quickly, and we enjoy receiving the teachersâ€™ regular photo updates on her development. We feel assured knowing she is in good hands.
