Sarbjit Singh,5,My colleague and I needed a vaccination urgently prior to our last minute travels. The receptionist and doctor were kind enough to wait past their closing time to administer the vaccination.  We're very appreciative to the two of them for their understanding.  Great customer service.  Thank you.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112550755559100016552/reviews

Nicol Pang,2,"I'm sorry, but I am not very satisfied with this service.

I was assisted by a new staff member who didn’t know what to do and didn’t ask for help. There were only two people waiting in the clinic, yet I still had to wait for a long time.

When it came to my blood test, they couldn’t find a vein on either arm. Eventually, I suggested drawing blood from the back of my hand. However, the needle was inserted too deeply, causing no blood to flow initially. They had to move the needle around before the blood finally came out.

I’m someone who isn’t afraid of needles, but I wonder how those who are scared of needles would cope in such a situation.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105563223870184989432/reviews
