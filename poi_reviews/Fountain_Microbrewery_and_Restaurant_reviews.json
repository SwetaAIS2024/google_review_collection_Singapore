      "text": "We celebrated Valentine's Day here. We had no idea that the Science Centre would have such a treasure.\n\nAround 740 p.m., live music began, and I loved the atmosphere and bright lighting. Air conditioners are also nice. Additionally, patio dining was available outside.\n\nThings to improve: two employees seems like too little, especially on V day. A platter for two to three people, pandan beer, and chamomile tea were ordered. The ribs are tasty and delicate, however the pork shabu smelt so strongly of pork that I only took a bite and didn't touch it. The fish fillet has a somewhat powdery taste. They could improve their sound system, and the singer's voice sounds muffled.",

The live band (Char Siew Pao!) was amazing, they sang really well. 5 Stars ü§©. Didn't manage to try the beer though, will try next time when not driving. Recommended üëç",

One issue here is that some Telco (M1 & TPG)  have no signal in the restaurant which means you don't have data to even use WhatsApp in the restaurant and there's no WiFi for customers to use.",
