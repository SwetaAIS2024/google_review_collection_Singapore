      "text": "There is definitely a serious piracy concern with the use of songs performed by cover artists rather than the original, licensed versions, downloaded from china websites and TVs, unauthorized romanized lyrics added to the original footages. You can rarely find the original, licensed versions of the songs now as they are overshadowed by the modified or pirated versions. This is destroying the music industry and a real shame to Singapore. I hope the authority is taking action on this before this is getting too far. Rightful compensation and apology should be made to the creative industry to retain our reputation to uphold the protection of intellectual property.",

But upon checking receipt after payment, we got charged for an additional half hour but yet the staff didn't want to refund me back. Totally ridiculous.\n\nTeo Heng, if this is how you train your staff, then everyone pls be extremely careful and check before making payment to see if \"additional costs\" are being added.",
