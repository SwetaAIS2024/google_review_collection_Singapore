Anna Louise,4,"Excellent eating place for duck. The dishes are surprisingly affordable, simple and tasty however the process that goes behind it is incredible, tedious and hard work. I like how crispy the duck's skin is with its meat still very tender. Nice texture especially it's a duck dish. Highly recommend! I definitely will bring my family, friends and relatives here. Only draw back is the restaurant's space is quite small. They need to plan to expand soon :)",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108421858744086610740/reviews
Paul Toh,5,"This place must be the best kept secret of the best duck places in Singapore. The roast duck is out of this world!!
Iâ€™m a roast duck fan and I can guarantee you this is one of the best u can put inside your mouth. The skin is crispy, the duck meat is not gamey, and the fat/meat ratio is just right.
I highly recommend this place!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110110584107240453374/reviews
Jia Lin G,3,"Ordered the roast duck drumstick and pipa duck noodles. Sure, the food was prepared with passion and heart. However, taste was mediocre (on the bland side). It was also not the cheapest. They have a rather extensive menu, with goose on the staple offering, which is very rare.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114367969390582161619/reviews
Joey Tan,5,"Loved the hospitality of the service staffs here! Tried the pipa duck, soy chicken and roast duck. Favourite has got to be the soy chicken :) very tender and moist!

Overall portion was very generous. Do try the chilled century egg with tofu (not in photos)!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115196205392994148305/reviews
Sean Goh,4,Very cosy eatery hidden inside a shopping mall. Had the pipa duck thigh noodle SGD$6.80. Very value for money  to me. The pipa duck was flavourful and tender. The sour plum condiment goes well with the duck so was the chilli. Noodle was slightly salty. The ventilation needs some improvement as the place was smoky and warm.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
