      "text": "Located at the corner of the hawker center, this newly opened stall serves up fried rice. I got the grilled pork chop fried rice ($6.90). The food is served pretty quickly too. There were two people in front of me, and I waited around 5 minutes before my buzzer buzzed.\n\nThe pork chop was tender and well-marinated. The fried rice was fragrant as well. The only downside here is that the plate is small, so you might need to be a little careful when eating to ensure you keep everything on your plate!",
