Veron Loh,1,"Ordered the salmon mentaiko garlic rice. Rice bowl was small at a hefty price of $10.90 (take away add 30 cts).

The brocoli were overcooked and tasted soft and soggy. Garlic rice was hard and full of garlic bits which was not to my liking.

The main star, I.e. salmon was overcooked, resulting it to be hard and dry.

I would say that this is a disappointing meal experience and will definitely be my first and last meal at this stall.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111657564956625832347/reviews
Vanessa Tan,3,"Ordered MK Special Chicken Cutlet ($5.90) with garlic fried rice (top up $1) didnt have much garlic taste in the rice so it was disappointing :( wont order the garlic fried rice again!

Otherwise everything else was average, nothing to shout about. The chicken came out different from what i expected from the images advertised.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110679538561876302414/reviews
jr mac,3,"Iâ€™m still a fan of KOFR for their fried rice â€” but if youâ€™re fond of mentaiko dishes, pork cutlet is a good try ! ðŸ˜‹ The sauce was thick and the broccoli served were fresh and crunchy.

Peter Lin,4,"Mentai Pork Cutlet. From the same boss of King of Fried Rice, Mentai King is the latest venture and if it achieves the same warm welcome of their previous DTF fried rice, you may find one a Mentaiko rice bowl near you. Their signature is the mental pork cutlet rice which is essentially a spin-off of the Fried Rice King's Signature pork fried rice but the focus is on the garlic flavoured Japanese rice.  The mentai Aburi also provides the umami they promised.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108515973091979261098/reviews
