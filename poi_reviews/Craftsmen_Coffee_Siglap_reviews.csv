Wong Shu Ning,5,"Cafe food might feel like a basic option—and so if I had to pick something that sets this place apart from the rest, it would have to be their waffles. Crisp and a perfect base for the decadence of a lovely berry sauce and strawberry ice cream + cut fruits, I thoroughly enjoyed polishing this dessert. The Rosti was just alright. Done well. A solid cafe offering good, consistent options. Good for an easy brunch in the area",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111175631885931056641/reviews

MsOmNom,5,"Great little place for a nice breakfast in the East. Prices might seem high but the portions are really generous! The salmon eggs Benedict was done perfectly and their breakfast set is not bad too! After eating here, you can skip the next meal.
Coffee is also pretty good so I totally recommend this place for a nice weekend brunch",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112478801214182052307/reviews
