Mast Omar,5,"I order our favourite satay goreng b4 raya. The taste of the satay dont need to say. I think everyone knew it üòÄ Its super good. Gravy given was generous too.The service was prompt and communication is fast. If you want to avoid long queue, just choose their delivery option. Delivery was on time, infact early. Dont hesitate to order. üëç Thank you Haron Satay!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106903374686875512555/reviews
Razeen Muhammad,1,"Ordered for a 6pm pickup and was informed order was ready, but was told at 6.40pm (after waiting 40mins) that our order was not received and had to wait till 7.30pm. Called Haron satay but no response as well. Could not wait any further and left. We did not have food for iftar that evening and so did a few others who were waiting too. Hope you wake up and learn from this disaster.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113438204288695124081/reviews
Aifa Nur,5,"No waiting time as long as order via WhatsApp.
The Satay are tender & well grilled.
Satay are pack nicely without any leaking of oil.
My fav is the smart locker pick up.
Definitely will order from here again",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110169063927135684115/reviews
yusman yusoff,1,Incompetent & unreliable service. Ordered through oddle 3 days before for self pickup from 4.30pm to 5pm.  Oddle updated that order was ready at 4.30pm but no satay in sight. Nobody came out to the collection area to explain the delay or expected waiting time. Can't even find anyone to cancel order as system is automated.  Made me late to collect my other food orders and totally messed up my family event. Order was only ready at 5.41 pm and it was lukewarm when I picked it up from the locker. didn't even feel like it was just cooked.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107586723355525024/reviews
Mr AR,3,"1.  Long queue. One waited more than an hour despite having scheduled.
2.  Placing of orders in pigeon holes didnt work.  All exchange were done thru the solitary window.
3.  Gravy was good, the hallmark of Haron Satay.  But the satays were not tender, some were small in size.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112888542947824711783/reviews
