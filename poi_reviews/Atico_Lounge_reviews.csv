GKN,4,"The window seats are quite hard to book on weekends. Initially, the air conditioning at our table wasn’t working, but the staff later moved us to a sofa seat, which was much better. We waited over 30 minutes for our food to be served, and it was difficult to get the staff’s attention. However, one staff member was especially sweet—she apologized and even offered to help us take pictures, which we really appreciated. So, we decided not to let the wait spoil our mood. The view is great, and the food was decent, though not particularly outstanding. That said, the high tea price in this area is quite reasonable and offers good value for money.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114065293574498191443/reviews
Chris Teng,4,"We ordered the tea set on a weekend for three together with a main and two drinks. The main was very good! The meat was very tender even to the bone! Loved the matcha latte too! It was very foamy. As for the afternoon tea set, it is very worth it! The desserts and light snacks were very good for the shared price!
Ambience and vibes were lovely. Would come back again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116085925768492411982/reviews
Wai Pung Chan,3,"Visited today for high tea to celebrate my wife’s birthday. I had made a reservation for two at 3:00 PM and specifically requested and secured window seats online. We arrived 30 minutes early, but instead of being informed that our reserved table would be ready at the designated time, we were immediately seated at a high table—which was uncomfortable and not what we had booked.

When I asked the waiter about it, she confirmed that the window seat was indeed available at 3:00 PM, meaning our original reservation could have been honored if we had simply been asked to wait. Unfortunately, no one took the initiative to communicate this, and it felt like our preferences were disregarded without explanation.

This kind of oversight is unacceptable, especially when guests have made a clear request for a special occasion. Better communication and respect for confirmed reservations should be a priority.

That said, I do appreciate that the team followed through on my birthday request for my wife. Small gestures like that made a difference, even if the seating situation detracted from the overall experience.

Better coordination and clearer communication would go a long way toward improving service for future guests.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112311562468349952037/reviews
Hiang Ar,5,"I really enjoyed the mignonette sauce served with the oysters – it had a perfect tanginess with a nice crunch from the onions. The atmosphere was fantastic: elegant yet relaxed, making it an ideal spot to take in the city skyline.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101185220797498251612/reviews
Jeng Cute,4,"Food was good, service was great, the view was awesome but the Sunday crowd at the skydeck (not the resto) was just too rowdy. It's really been a long while since I last visited, I didn't know that the skydeck was free to enter (not ticketed) and gets crowded with some not really leaving.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102357774721100594416/reviews
