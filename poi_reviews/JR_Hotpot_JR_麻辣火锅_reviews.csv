munchwithvienna,5,"One of my favourite hotpot in SG. It's definitely a hidden gem in the heartlands of Yishun St 51! Both owners –Jason & Ray have been running this business for over 3yrs. They are very humble & nice people! Their service is 👍👍👍

The homemade soup base is made from scratch & contains no MSG! Many different soup base for you to choose from. Their ingredients are very fresh & affordable! I love the beef & seafood the most! I always enjoy having hotpot here. Won't burn our pocket!

Wide variety of quality ingredients at a super afforable price, you can enjoy a free flow of soup (2 soups for just $4.90) You can order their Couple Set at $24.90 or Family Set at $44.90 for a start.

I highly recommend you try their Lala Ginger Soup (you can't find it anywhere else in 🇸🇬). If you love spicy soup base, do try their Butter Mala (this is my favourite). For Vegetarians, you can try our their Spinach Century Egg Soup or Tomato Soup.

Oh yes, don't forget to try their 卤肉饭! The meat is so tender & flavourful, just like the ones we had in Taiwan! The fried buns are superb too!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111493889212305743241/reviews

Julia Lee,5,"A highly recommendable place for steamboat lovers in the heartland. From the flavorful broth like mala, herbal chicken, tomato, my favourite ones are the healthy mushroom and 猪肚汤. Now they also have the new gingerly Lala soup! They offered a wide variety of fresh seafood, meats, veggies and also customisable sauces. Definitely a must-try steamboat! And not forgetting the most friendly boss Ray and his staffs for their great services!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108005106293572221818/reviews

mushroom soup,2,Food is okay; average hotpot but be prepared to wait for 30 minutes to get your soup base set up and then another 30 minutes to receive the ingredients. Another 15 minutes to receive the ingredients they missed out on accident hahahahahhaha.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103763145958425916548/reviews
