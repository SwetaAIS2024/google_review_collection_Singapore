Would be even better if they could provide more vegetables but overall it was a satisfying bowl of noodles.",

They have 7 different types of Ban Mian to choose from, and prices start from SGD4.5 onward.\n\nI ordered the sliced pork version with you mian. The portion of noodle was quite generous. Sliced pork was tender and the the meatball was well seasoned. The bowl of noodle also came with the mani vegetable. The soup is also flavourful and I finish it.\n\nOverall. This Ban mian is definitely above average, and I would recommend it.",
