      "text": "Really thankful with Le Xue - Ms Peng .\nI am a new parent, obviously i want my baby to have the best of everything .\nAt my baby 11 mths old i did alot of trial with other education such as hegurxx, chengxx zhx and etc that specialise in mandarin. Because my thoughts was she can learn english when she go to school .. and english is much more easier to learn .\n\nWhen having trial with Le xue( i paid for the trial) with Ms Peng , i was impressed that my baby can listen and follow her instruction on what Ms Peng did . I maybe can do that as well but trust me that it will take me one month to train one single movement instead of one session by Ms Peng .\n\nAfter the lesson i went back to discuss with my husband and i decide to sign up for the lesson (1 year because i am really kiasu).\n\nIt has been 5 months and i have seen alot of improvement especially when other people always comment that .. wow she is so young as she can speak so well and accurate . Not only her speech but also her behaviour as well .",
