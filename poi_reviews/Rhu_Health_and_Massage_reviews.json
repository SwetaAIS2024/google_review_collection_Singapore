      "text": "Nice place, great massage, nothing to be complaint about. The masseuse Sue is very professional and friendly. Traditional full-body massage (with oil) is highly recommended. I personally loves the oil which the masseuse told me it is a traditional herbal massage oil (smells good). The place is clean and comfortable, located on the second floor, so you have to request an appointment so that the staff will guide you. Overall,  I'm very satisfied with Rhu Massage! Highly recommended!!",
