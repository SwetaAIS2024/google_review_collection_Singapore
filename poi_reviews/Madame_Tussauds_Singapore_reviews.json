      "text": "We had such a fun and memorable experience at Madame Tussauds Singapore! Visiting from Canada, we weren’t sure what to expect, but it turned out to be an absolute blast. We’ve been to the New York location before, and this one definitely lived up to the hype — in fact, it had its own unique charm and fun surprises!\n\nThe wax figures were incredibly lifelike and covered a wide range of international and local celebrities, making it both entertaining and culturally interesting. We especially loved the interactive sections and themed zones — they made the experience feel much more than just a photo-op.\n\nEverything was well-organized, clean, and easy to navigate. Great for families, couples, or solo travelers looking to enjoy something lighthearted and exciting. Highly recommend it if you’re visiting Sentosa — definitely worth the time!",

      "text": "Madame Tussauds Singapore has a wonderful collection of almost life size Wax Figures of various celebrities including World Leader, Sports Persons, Actors and local people depicting Singapore tradition and history. It presents the Singapore city’s iconic landmarks, cultural heritage and life of people. Some of the Wax Figures are very realistic. One can take photographs with these figures. In between your journey, you will get a short boat ride as well. There is short Marvel 4D movie which you can enjoy as well.  Overall, Madame Tussauds Singapore is a wonderful experience of entertainment and culture, offering a memorable experience.",

      "text": "Madame Tussauds,Singapore is located at the famous Sentosa Island. It's on a close,walking distance to the last Sentosa cable car stop. To me, it's a must visit place as it offers a fun and interactive experience, blending lifelike wax figures with immersive zones that celebrate global and local celebrities. Visitors can pose with wax versions of famous personalities from the film industry, music industry, sports and politics. Therefore, making it a great spot for photos and star-struck moments.\nHighlights include the “Spirit of Singapore” boat ride, which showcases the city’s culture and landmarks, and the Marvel Universe 4D experience, where fans can engage with their favorite superheroes.\n\nPS: - Highly recommended for visiting when in Singapore/Sentosa.",

Though they might be interesting for history enthusiasts.\nMy recommendation. It is worth adding in your itinerary, but may skip it if you are short on time.",
