There is a great variety of slides for both children and adults to play in. There are several family themed slides and some for more thrill seekers. It is within walking distance of the mrt station or just 1 bus stop away.",

With annual membership, easy to stop by after school.\nIt stops all facility when bad weather is coming due to the risk of lightning. There is no compensation for this. You can wait till weather becomes better to enjoy the park or leave in this case.",
