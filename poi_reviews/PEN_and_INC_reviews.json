The Salted Egg sauce completed the dish very well! Seafood Marinara was delicious as well but the Mexican brownie stole the show. It was very chewy and rich, which went very well with the ice cream! Overall it was a delightful dining experience.",

      "text": "After discovering PEN & INC through Google reviews, we decided to visit the restaurant located in NTU. Following the signage and direction boards, we easily located the establishment. Our visit took place on a weekend late afternoon, and we were among only three patrons at that time.\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the restaurant's vibe and the background music. Our order included the Slow Cooked Beef Cheek, Fish & Chips, Honey Mustard Chicken Leg, Meat Beef Ragu Pasta, and the highly recommended Lava Torte for dessert. All dishes were impeccably prepared, with each item reaching the perfect level of tenderness and harmonizing well with its respective sauces. It's challenging to pinpoint a single \"Must Try\" item, as every dish was truly worth sampling.\n\nAmong our favorites was the Chocolate Baked Lava Cake, exuding a delightful fragrance of chocolate and mild milk. Served piping hot and paired with cold vanilla ice cream, each bite resulted in a satisfying melding of flavors that melted in our mouths.\n\nThe waitstaff and entire crew were not only friendly but also deserving of a double thumbs up for their excellent service. Our visit to Pen & INC proved to be a delightful and memorable experience, making for a wonderful afternoon.",

While the prawns were plentiful, it didn't taste fresh. Banana cake was nice though.\n\n23 Sep 24 - Ordered fish and chips. The fish and chips were too dry for my liking. Furthermore, it cost $22 after GST and service charge for this plate. At most, I would pay is $12 at most.",
