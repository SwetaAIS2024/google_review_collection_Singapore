Sng Eugene,3,"Before the Bus Stop was constructed, passengers have to board bus services at heartland areas. After construction, this Bus stop serves many and journey time has been cut short due to express services.

Bus 89 is always full every weekdays morning.
The crowd starts at Seng Kang before the bus turns right into TPE. As route ply thru Schools, SAF Camps, Loyang Industrial and Changi Airfreight Centre, crowd is always expected. Sent multiple feedbacks to LTA regarding massive crowd on bus 89 but LTA is not doing anything to solve this crowd issue.

Edit: Bus 89 services improved, however Bus 118 waiting time can be as long as 17 minutes even during peak periods!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104378252443687353932/reviews
