Nunki Ang,5,"Actually I bought in here 2 times already, only this time, i was able to write the review. All my purchases were taking out. And it's great! Start from the service, the packaging was amazing with that kind of price, for the laksa or noodle, they gave separate the soup. It's yummy for me and family. The chicken rice set was tasty as well. I love it! Looks like i bought proper bento so I can bring it somewhere such as work or picnic. Nice! Keep it up please and I'll buy it again and again next time.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115049581451574514827/reviews
F naim,3,"Chicken rice was standard .
Chicken was soft and tender.
Soup was almost bland.
Gotta improve as previous chicken rice shop was definitely better.
Expected better from a chained stall/shop.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116454669011711865623/reviews
Vicky Melwani,1,Chicken was undercooked and soup tasted like old acid water. Felt so sick after eating here. Seriously avoid if you can. They'll force you also to join some membership for some stupid reason and if you politely say no They'll become very rude.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110590404577731353669/reviews
