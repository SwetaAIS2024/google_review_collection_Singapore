Grace Cheong,5,"Consulted Dr Joven Lai on 3/4/25 for a recurring gastric issue. He was professional in demeanor, meticulous, patient, friendly and caring. Most importantly, he was gentle.  All the requisites needed in a good doctor.
He's truly an asset to our health care industry.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117403524116462556531/reviews
Leens Harry,5,"I visited this clinic to see the Gp for flu and the Dr was Stella Wong , and she was exceptional. She went above and beyond, asking about my overall health and providing valuable advice that is often overlooked by others.

SherNoProb SYS,1,"Had bad cramps and walk a distance to the clinic to found out from the Doctor that they doesn't have the medication(Tramadol) that i can take. Been to many clinic, this is the first time, I'm encountering Doctor who is uncompassionate and has non-chalanant attitude. Even Tele-Doctor is better and patient to find solution and advise accordingly. Despite unable to provide me medication, he still charges me consultation fee(half price).
Do not recommend to come here if you are sick.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115491460055542418432/reviews
Qian Xin,1,"Googles says clinic opens til 10.45pm but when I reach at 10.30pm the nurse told me the doctor left early cos he is a relief doctor. This is very irresponsible relief doctor. Health care provider cannot be like that.
This happened on 2 August 2021.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102288625247108770746/reviews
