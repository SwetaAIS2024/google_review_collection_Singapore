Matthew Lee,5,"So I came here with my PRC wife Emily Xia to support her homegrown brand. I was pleasantly surprised at how good Luckin Coffee is compared to Starbucks.

Luckin Coffee is as good, if not even better than its aforementioned rival in all aspects including app UX, quality of drinks, store ambience, etc.

For new app users, there is the $0.99 among other amazing promos.

I highly recommend Luckin Coffee for all looking for good drinks and food to enjoy while socializing with their friends.

Edit: Me and my wife Emily Xia Jing at Luckin Coffee again with the results of our ravenous hunger ðŸ˜º See 3rd photo",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103085852239067801925/reviews

YC Ng,5,"One of the few Luckin outlets with seats, and coupled with a 60% discount voucher made this a great place to hang out!

Though the indoor seats in front of the counter were too cold for comfort..",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114616404937921117862/reviews

Kayden Choo,5,"My usual order of Hot Velvet Latte, I like it very much. Enjoyed the fragrance of the coffee.

Tried the Oat Milk Latte before, personally did not like it. The taste of the Oat Milk was too strong for me.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111046245288496998971/reviews
