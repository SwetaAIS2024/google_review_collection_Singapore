Kian Yang Lee,5,It's the best place imo to learn piano. Teacher Ernest Chin is a fabulous music teacher that teaches concept in an easy to understand manner. He explains things that can be easily understandable by people of any age. He is also friendly and has good work ethics. Couldn't recommend this place more for anyone wanting to learn piano or music theory.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104946923580901197129/reviews
