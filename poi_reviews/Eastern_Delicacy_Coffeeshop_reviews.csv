Jacob TAN,3,"This is one of a few coffeeshops in the Kaki Bukit Industrial area. Came here to see whether anything interesting to eat after dropping my car for servicing. There were only 4 food stalls opened and I didn't find anything interesting so I just ordered a coffee and took a seat in the area with open space. It was quite warm. The coffee was quite mild but taste was fine.
Business was slow as I was there before lunch time. Service was quick and polite.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
