      "text": "‚õ∞Ô∏èBukit Batok Town Park is also known as Little Guilin Â∞èÊ°ÇÊûó because of the majestic rock formation on the tranquil lake that resemble the actual Guilin in China's Guangxi Province.\nüèûÔ∏èSurrounding the tranquil lake waters are expansive lush vegetations and matured tall trees which provide a natural ambience and shady enviroment.\n‚õ∞Ô∏èLittle Guilin lies just across the Bukit Batok residential estate.\n‚õ∞Ô∏èIt's offers a convenient and serene retreat for the residents living nearby.\n‚õ∞Ô∏èThe Town Park is easily accessible by public transport. It is right at Bukit Gombak MRT Station.\nüì§Bukit Gombak Trail:\nüì§Bukit Batok Town Park used to have a Bukit Gombak Trail. The nature trail started from Bukit Gombak Stadium and went across Gombak ridge towards Hillview. It ended at Chu Lin Rd.\nüì§But a landslide occurred along the trail at Chu Lin Road end; and for safety reason, the nature trail was closed off to public access in 2007.\nüèûÔ∏èFun fact:\n‚õ∞Ô∏èBukit Gombak and other hills around it, like Bukit Batok and Bukit Timah, used to be a vibrant granite quarry area during its heyday.\nüèûÔ∏èWhen the granite quarry industries ceased their operations, the abandoned quarries soon became the city's natural landscape and nature parks.\nüèûÔ∏èLittle Guilin was the former site of Gammon Quarry which ceased operation in 1984.\nIt was converted into Bukit Batok Town Park a year later.\n‚õ∞Ô∏èBukit Batok, which means \"coughing hill\" was derived from the sound of constant blasting of the quarry activities.",

With its serene lake and magnificent rock formation, also known as Little Guilin or Xiao Guilin, the park offers a peaceful escape from the bustling city.\n\nHowever, it‚Äôs important to be cautious about the monkeys that inhabit the area, so remember to keep a close eye on your bags and belongings.\n\nThe calm atmosphere and picturesque surroundings make it a perfect spot for gatherings and day-time parties with friends. Let‚Äôs all do our part to preserve the cleanliness of this place and ensure its enjoyment for everyone.",
