Shah Rizal,1,"Waited long for my order. They packed/served the bulk order first, and Grab/Panda orders. I had to wait a while for my online order for self collect. Although I got my items correct, but the sprite taste like Plain Water with a bit of gas!  No sprite taste! Disappointed with KFC!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107855618480468245819/reviews
ShiMin,5,"I've just been here. Take order 2 Ultimate Zinger Box ($11.30) for takeout. Service here is pleasant. Staff here are attentive and approachable when I just come in and determine what menu I aspire to, and they directly reacquire to me without delay. The atmosphere here is spacious, and the restaurant here is cozy. It has a relaxed, casual vibe.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108535033719523303550/reviews
