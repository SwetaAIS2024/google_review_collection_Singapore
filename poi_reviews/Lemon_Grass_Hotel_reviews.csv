- Not soundproof
- The room size a little bit smaller since itâ€™s supposed to have a single bed and a large bed only. But it happened to be two(2) large bed. Otherwise it is just nice.
Besides that, everything is fine.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112248458415291779119/reviews
Israfael Abdullah,3,"Experienced this during multiple check-ins here. Housekeeping wasn't done properly. A room had a half opened soap bottle full of dust under one table and another room had a sticky floor the corner, a plastic bag left on the inside of the bedroom lamp and ciggarette ashes at the side of the toilet bowl. Most other rooms seem to have leftover batteries from the remote controls. Please do check and do not expect guests to replace the batteries to the remote controls. Service wise, everything was fine.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108902828513785056533/reviews
Wendy Hardynata,3,"A decent hotel for tourist if you only sleep here at night after exploring the city. The facilities just standard. The food provided here is just too expensive. You can find food in another store near the hotel. The room cleaning service is optional, if you want the staff make your bed and change your towel with a new one.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103017676331001639520/reviews

Zairene. Kmrzmn,3,The room was nice and comfortable. Just that the brown blanket was too itchy for both of us. Television cable was very blurry couldn't watch much shows after all everything seems good.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107124017887986108473/reviews
