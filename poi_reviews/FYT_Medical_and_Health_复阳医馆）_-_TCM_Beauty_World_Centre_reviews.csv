Pauline Lai,5,"There are thousands to one TCM clinic in Singapore but to actually find a physician who can fully understand my medical condition is crucial to ensure effective & safe treatment which aligns with my needs.

I have been consulting Physician Ch’ng Ping Feei for my post-herpetic neuralgia which is an intermittent or continuous nerve pain affected by shingles.

Physician Ch’ng is very knowledgeable & professional in her skills especially acupuncture. She is attentive & will patiently listen to my lengthy problems before giving me a satisfactory explanation.

As my condition is very complex, besides acupuncture she also prescribed  herbs. She will add or subtract certain herbs when I give her my feedback. She is like my personal physician n I’m very impressed on the herbs she concocted.

She is indeed a gem to FYT Medical and Health Clinic. The therapist is equally good in body massage to loosen my tight muscles.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117421972163819442309/reviews
Tricia Pang,1,"Disappointed that pain in my leg / back worsen after the treatment ( pain increased for 4 days then back the original pain before treatment) . Nothing solved..

More disappointed that I called to ask if the doc can have a look again to see what went wrong.. however the reception said I need more (paid)sessions and didn't check back on me with doc. Poor after care service. Why will I pay more sessions of $145 if it worsen my pain? Very disappointed with the experience.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113957243055104834860/reviews
Yours Only,1,"DO NOT COME HERE. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I WOULD RATE 0 STARS OUT OF 5 IF I COULD.

I came here for shoulder and back problems. They told me to get a x-ray to evaluate my spine. After I got the x-ray, they told me I had multiple problems with my spine, and that I required treatment to fix it if not I would continue to have shoulder and back pain. They suggested that I sign up for a 10 session package that costed SGD 1600 in total.

Not only did the 10 sessions not help with my shoulder and back pain, it caused permanent damage to my joints. It has been a long time since my treatment package has ended. Till today, I still suffer from permanent clicking and cracking at my joints as a result of the manipulations they performed.

I went to see proper doctors at SGH and they told me I had loose joints. Manipulation SHOULD NOT have been performed. The doctors at SGH also told me there was NOTHING WRONG with my spine. I regret coming to FYT Medical and Health, because not only did they not fix my problem, they worsened it. Their services are also extremely expensive and not worth it in my opinion.

If you have any problems with your neck, shoulders, or back, PLEASE SEE a proper doctor and physiotherapist. DO NOT COME HERE.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109615481489284224000/reviews
Peiwen Ng,5,"Dr Wang (王新) is very professional. He helps to relieve the pain on my back, as my spine is not straight. He also helps to relieve the pain on my neck which most of us have due to prolong usage of mobile phone and ipad.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115591044903282255707/reviews
