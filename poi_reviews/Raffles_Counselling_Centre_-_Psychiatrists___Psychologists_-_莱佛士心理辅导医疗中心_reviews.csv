Kian Liang,1,"Most Rude and Bad dr I ever encountered at this centre - Tham Keng Seng. Expensive consultations and when a treatment plan is not working,
he raised his voice and is unprofessional.
Not even worth any point.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109867674633957509129/reviews
Hadassah Mariadas,1,"Daylight robbery. They charged 250sgd for 15 minutes of consultation and their Filipino staff, Christine has the cheek to tell me they increased the Dr's fees within a month's time without notifying the clients. Its pathetic.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104333915953835413074/reviews
Celeste Hutson,5,"Dr. Kua is the first psychiatrist I've had the luxery of seeing. He's extremely professional and thorough with my concerns for my mental health. An expat in Singapore from a small town in the US prior had my anxiety and depression working full time and I was scared to even get out of the house in fears of a panic attack. Not only did he get me on the right medication to help ""level me out"" but talking me through the desensitization process and becoming acclimated to my new home and life in Singapore. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100081120436933057090/reviews
Singa Gems,1,Worst ever phone system for reception. There is no automated call queuing system. Calls keep ringing but no response with no idea of waiting time. It costs a few hundred dollars to implement a telephone queueing system but so helpful to patients.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111790507574418748725/reviews
