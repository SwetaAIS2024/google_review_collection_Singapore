      "text": "Hands down the best pizza I‚Äôve had so far! The service was great, and the ambiance was just right‚Äînot as loud or noisy as some people say.\n\nMy friends really enjoyed the Japanese-style pizza (totally forgot the name), but for me, the \"Original Famous\" was the winner. So simple, yet the blend of cheeses made it so, so good. Just a heads-up‚Äîeat your pizza ASAP because the crust gets a bit dry and tough if you wait too long.\n\nThe sides are on the pricier end, but hey, if you‚Äôre up for a treat, give them a shot!\n\nWill definitely be back for special occasions!",

      "text": "Blue Label Pizza takes classic New York pizzas and gives them a unique, elevated twist. Their crispy, well-balanced pizza base provides the perfect foundation for their creative toppings, making each bite a delightful experience.\n\nWhile the prices lean on the higher side, the quality justifies the cost. The ingredients are fresh, and the flavor combinations are well thought out. A standout is their Japanese-inspired pizza of the month, which brings an exciting fusion of flavors to the table, proving that innovation can work beautifully with tradition.\n\nBeyond the food, the ambience is modern and inviting, making it a great place to enjoy a leisurely meal. The atmosphere, combined with delicious pizzas and premium ingredients, makes Blue Label Pizza a worthy spot for those willing to splurge a little on high-quality, creative pizza.\n\nWould definitely recommend it to pizza lovers looking for something beyond the usual fare!",

      "text": "Must order the artichoke and spinach dip and chips!! So good we polished it off. The pizza was good but not great, a bit too burnt for my liking if you ask me, so the crust was quite bitter. The crust was also too thin for my liking. The carrot cake was recommended by a friend but the 3 of us were so disappointed, it was way too sweet and dense. I took a bite and couldn‚Äôt bring myself to take another one. Atmosphere and staff were 10/10 tho!",
