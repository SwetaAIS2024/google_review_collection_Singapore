Melvin Liew,4,"This outlet at i12 Katong is spacious, lots of natural lighting (window seats) and quiet. Restaurant was quite empty compared to Sushi Zanmai and Genki Sushi next door.

Staff were friendly, quiet place for dinner. Food quality is decent, as expected from Crystal Jade.

They have good mix of Cantonese dim sum, and various Shanghainese and Sichuan cuisine dishes. I highly recommend the egg white conpoy, Sichuan saliva chicken, Sichuan hot and sour soup and the Dan Dan La Mian. Portions feel a bit smaller than usual though, compared to Paradise Dynasty.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102951175816995376482/reviews
Sim Simon,4,"We ordered some dim-sum evergreens, despite the outlet's forte in Chinese ramen and xiao-long-bao (steamed pork dumpling with infused soup), as we had wanted to enjoy only light food.
The food was wonderfully nice!
Staff were attentive, friendly and helpful: constantly topping up our Chinese ""pu-er"" tea.
Ambience was pleasant and comfy, conducive to a good relaxing dining experience.
However, the self-service Q-registration, using the QR code, might not be too easy (inexplicable) for first-time users, without initial staff assistance or clarification.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115942688592554491924/reviews
argh c,4,Paper menus are provided but you order via QR codes on your phone. Pay at the till when you leave. Food arrived fairly promptly. The xiao lung bao were good. The fried dumplings were quite good although not 3 for $6.90 good?,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107945476213341647743/reviews
Martin Chan,4,"Food generally good. Menu was similar to Din Tai Fung. You won’t find the familiar Hong Kong roast meats here. Their signature Dan Dan noodles was essentially noodles in a dilute satay peanut sauce. Didn’t quite work for me, even though I’m a huge fan of satay sauce. 2 dishes that I really liked were the crispy duck and the braised pork. The red bean pancake was very disappointing. Skin was a little hard and not much red bean paste. The place was somewhat noisy. Service was not bad. I will go back just for the crispy duck.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109128816127264362444/reviews
Randy Ngatimin,4,"Xiao long Bao is good, internal soup is really sweet and tasty. La Mian is nice but the pork ribs is a little too thin and dry. The other dim sum are also good.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107076346774947547605/reviews
