Thete were Billard Tables to play. Very Spacious And big space for group gatherings there.\nCarpark lots but limited space. Nearby Bus stops & coffeeshops for food around that Vacinity. The overall Service  was very commendable and well maintained. A Well Deserved Praise for this Vintage Building especially the Management Staffs is very Approachable and friendly that makes the atmosphere more attractive!\nIt is open to public and operating hours till 11.45am+. So head on down there as a group for old times Fellowship with old friends or camp mates/school mates. Worth it all. Cheers!",
