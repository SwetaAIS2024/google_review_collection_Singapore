      "text": "Tried this stall for the first time. Food was tasty & not bad. But the main downside is their high (food) prices for a heartland coffee shop stall. Ordered fried chicken wing, an egg, sambal goreng and Lady's fingers. Portions were quite small, considering the price that I paid. Don't be mistaken by my photo, the plate looks full cos there was a lot of curry on it :)\n\nDamage was $9.50.\n\nUsually I would be paying max $7 - $8 for such a combi elsewhere, with some places even charging closer to $6.\n\nDefinitely way above many similar stalls in coffee shops.\n\nWill be my first & last visit there.",

      "text": "Nice nasi padang. The beef rendang is good and traditional. Rempah of the rendang is great and fresh. Ask for extra gravy for rendang as it is more traditional dry style. Other dishes is good too. They are generous with the gravies so that added complexity to the dish. I think firstly the dishes are traditional and what dish we choose to balance with each other is important. It is almost the same for all nasi padang too. Overall it is a great gem for authentic nasi padang. Well done!",
