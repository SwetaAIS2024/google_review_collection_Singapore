Mike Chiang,5,"5 stars
Absolutely love Brauhaus! They have an incredible selection of bottle-conditioned beers from around the world — everything from authentic Belgian Trappist brews to classic German styles and rich English ales. It’s a beer lover’s paradise! The food is equally impressive — hearty, satisfying German fare. Their pork knuckle fried bee hoon is a must-try — a perfect fusion dish that hits all the right notes. Cozy vibe, friendly staff, and great for both casual hangouts and serious beer appreciation. Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117369048343345237773/reviews
Bert Grobben,5,"Wow! Had a great catch-up here with a friend who used to work in Germany, and this transported him back. Lovely warm wooden interior, great life music, and an amazingly wide selection of beers. Let’s do a world tour!

Tried the pork knuckle and the sausages, with sauerkraut and potatoes. Amazing sausages, and a fairly ok pork knuckle. I’ll be back here for more.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112544204326995021121/reviews
Sean Aaron Chong,5,"My family and I have been regulars here since I was 15, we always enjoy the live music every Friday and Sat nights but now they do have live music gigs frequently during the week.

We love their signature pork knuckle bee Hoon as this is something familiar and yet homely for a Singaporean Chinese Family. Tasty noodles with good wok hei and the meat from the pork knuckles isn’t tough.

Pork knuckle and sausage platter is also a must try!

My wife ordered their beef goulash, I tried it for the first time. So good too!

Lastly if you’re into beers, they have a wide variety of beers from various countries. Personally I would recommend trying the beers from Germany or Belgium as it really fits the theme.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107809966642363550343/reviews
She Chan,4,Really good and authentic beehoon. So many choices for beer and I suggest you ask the staff to recommend instead of trying to figure it out yourself. All the dishes are great tasting and matches well with the beer selection.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100105400422210682159/reviews
