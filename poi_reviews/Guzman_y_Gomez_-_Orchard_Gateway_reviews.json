The moment you step in, you’re welcomed by a vibrant atmosphere that makes you feel right at home.\n\nThe menu offers a fantastic variety of options, all of which are fresh and delicious. I love how quickly they prepare the meals without compromising on quality. My go-to is the [specific dish], which is always packed with flavor and perfectly portioned for a satisfying lunch.\n\nThe staff is friendly and efficient, ensuring that my order is ready in no time. It’s perfect for those busy days when I need a tasty meal on the go.\n\nWhether you’re dining in or taking out, Guzman never disappoints. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quick, delicious lunch option! Can't wait to go back!",

The taste was horrible :(( overly smokey and unbalanced, making the dish almost inedible.\n\nI truly hope this was just an off day for them because I have enjoyed their food in the past. I’m sharing this feedback in the hope that they address these issues and return to the quality I once knew. Until then, I’m hesitant to order again",
