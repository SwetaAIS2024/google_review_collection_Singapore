Hachiko,5,"I have been Mr Wu's student for a long time, since Primary 4,  in Secondary 3-4, I attended his lessons for A-math as I was struggling with the subject and became an A1 student during o'levels from a C6 student.
Throughout my experience, Mr Wu is a very patient and encouraging teacher. He is very open to questions, for example, even though I was attending his A-math lessons, he encouraged me and my friends to ask him any questions for E-math and would also spare more time after lessons to help us with our questions. Mr Wu is very passionate about his teaching and math. He also has a youtube channel that you can check out >.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109221503193816490266/reviews
Tee Song Wong,5,"My daughter attended Pentagon Tuition classes for mathematics when she was primary 4. She did relative well in her PSLE. I was contemplating if she should continue the tuition in Secondary School and seek Mr. Wu advise. Mr. Wu reckoned that she should try out on her own first instead of having tuition. At the start of Secondary 2, my daughter highlighted that she needed help for her mathematics, and we went back to Mr. Wu. In her Secondary 3 year, she only had tuition for A Math.  Mr. Wu is always open and willing to help if she has any questions on her E Math. My daughter did very well for her A Math with an A1 in her O Level.

Mr. Wu is very passionate on his teaching, he complied videos of solving difficult math questions from different school and shared it in his You-tube Video. As a parent, what I like of Pentagon is that they take in Students regardless of grades and help them to improve. This is so unlike some other “reputed” tuition center who only accept students of certain grade. If your child need help in math, it is worth getting help from Mr. Wu. Thanks, Mr Wu",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106098958086087163046/reviews
ELQ,5,"Both my daughters have been with Pentagon Learning for a couple of years, one doing A Math and another just completed A' levels H2 Math.
Mr Wu has the patience of a Saint. He believes that Mathematics is about understanding how concepts work instead of just memorizing a bunch of formulas. He ignites the curiosity of his students by encouraging them to ask many questions and shows them the Beauty of Mathematics.  He comes up with creative ways to help his students understand different concepts, challenging them to try out different ways to solve questions.
My daughters have become better and  more confident as they tackled challenging questions.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113892647619715939023/reviews

Jing xuan Chong,5,"Hi! I am a 2022 secondary 4 student and joined the tuition in june. I was struggling with my amaths and could barely do any of my homework, and I decided to join the tuition center from reccomandation from my classmates. And I did not regret this decision one bit!
Mr wu is a really good teacher. You can tell his enthusiasm for maths through his enthusiasm in lessons. He likes to simplify complicated math concepts by relating them to our real-life experinces, making it much easier to swallow down and understand During breaks, he will tell us about some fun math facts! Whenever I have a question, i can always drop him a message and he will answer me within a few minutes! In fact, he always encourages us to ask more questions! Before an exam, he will always ensure that we are well prepare. He will go through any topics that we may be more confused on, and goes through quite a few papers and makes sure we do sufficient practise! sometimes he also gave us advice on our past secondary choices and told us about what he did too!
In the end, i jumped from a F9 grade to an a2 grade, so i think this really shows how good of a teacher he is!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107834416635915992443/reviews
