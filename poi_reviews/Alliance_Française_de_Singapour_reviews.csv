Claire Li√©geois-Aractingi,5,"My daughter is attending the singing classes lead by Maria Lavergne and she absolutely loves it ! Maria is enthusiastic, energetic and really passionate about music. She has lots of material that the children can touch and play with to discover music. My daughter is looking forward to the lesson every week.

LULS Thyself,4,"The gallery was really detailed liked especially about the part on how much effort the restoration was done to the more dame as well as the history of the building. Overall, it was quite the experience.

The VR however, was kinda of a lil bit of a dissapointment, mostly because it was more game graphics rather than real life Images. There's also a limitation on movement. So it felt less interactive than I was expecting. I mean, It was based on Ubisoft's program. So I expected more out of it.

That said, the overall experience was still highly positive, and shout out to the staff for being patient and helpful because there was a period where the exhibition was really packed. The VR headset running out of battery was unfortunate and the staff handled it like a boss.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108600251934192454535/reviews
