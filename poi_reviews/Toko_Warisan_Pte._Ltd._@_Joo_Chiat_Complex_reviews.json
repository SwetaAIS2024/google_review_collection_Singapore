Wanted to buy bunga paha and clarified with Staff A (the day before I bought) if eggs would be provided and the staff said yes. Came back the next day, another staff B served me and she said no, the eggs would not be provided (even though I told her multiple times Staff A said eggs would be provided). Went back to the cashier to talk about it and laugh. Kakak kakak kerja kat situ lain kali tak payah pakai tudung kalau nak ketawakan orang macam sial.",

She had merely asked, 'Serunding pondok abang dah takde jual lagi eh?'.\n\nThe reply given by the woman who works there was, 'Sejak bila eh kita ada jual serunding tu? Masa covid ke? Mana ada eh?'.\n\nThe customer before my mom was also similarly replied to.\n\nPerhaps she is having a bad day. But even if they had never sold a certain product, surely there is a better way to reply instead of the sarcasm-filled reply given.",
