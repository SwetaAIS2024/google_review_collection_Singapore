There’s quite a lot of ingredients in it for $4 such as fried fish cake (the kind sold at yong tau foo stalls), strips of pork belly, half a braised egg and a thin cutlet. I’d say it’s a nice comfort food on a cold day.\n\nThe stall offers fish porridge / soup with rice and other noodle dishes like laksa, BCM etc. at pretty affordable prices too. Do pop in to try if you are in Bangkit.",
