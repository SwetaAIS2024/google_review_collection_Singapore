With her background in Internal Medicine, she diagnosed my wife's Auto Immune condition. My whole family sees her for stomach issues and treatment is very effective.

Clinic is usually full of patients.

Jeyanthi Mala,1,"Just contacted the clinic. Wanting to bring my 78 year old mum for consultation. The lady who attended to the call asks me a question and before I can answer, she interrupts me, and assumes a position. The customer service is equally important as consulting the doctor. Thus, I would highly recommend not to consult with this clinic.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109121704294445482270/reviews
