Joey Tee,1,"Just had the worst pasta of my life, and I rarely post any reviews. There was literally no seasoning whatsoever, had to add salt myself after. Portion was also very little for $8.20 (creamy salmon pasta).

Had bought the pasta from the shop before, not too sure why the quality has dropped so drastically. Perhaps due to a change of people?",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111783696928319201402/reviews
Winston Ang,5,"I thought they closed recently as the shop was vacated. Turns out, they renovated and did not increase price. My favourite western store in north east- mushroom chicken chop. Much better than the ‚Äòfamous‚Äô Hougang western others talk about.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101584352203209480601/reviews
Mun Chong,5,"Near to the carpark lift
Apparently they really started cooking only after my order was placed
Everything on my plate was freshly cooked and fried stuff were all crisp n crunchy
Chicken cutlet portion is HUGE, fills up the large plate pretty well
Blanched broccoli is pleasantly healthy... Mental note to order double portions of blanched broccoli for a healthier lunch
Onion rings were crisp n stayed crisp until I finished the meal
The added sausage was huge and outstanding as it doesn't have that thick plasticky skin that many Western stalls offer
If the coffeeshop had better ventilation I would have given atmosphere 5 stars
As it was, I had to sit out the secondhand smoke throughout my entire lunch
Paylah and cash available
New addition to menu - pork cutlet. Great value for money $7.50",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103491652776344320179/reviews
tomyumdumpling,5,"Visited the coffeeshop stall for a meal. The coffeeshop that the stall is located at is generally quite spacious and there are seats available.
The ordering is done at the counter and the food was served within a short period of time.
The food tastes great, the chicken cutlet was definitely significantly sized.
Overall, it is a great meal that satisfies the western food cravings!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108361107100333876893/reviews
