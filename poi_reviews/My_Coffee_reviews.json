      "text": "Ice Latte hits off very well. Minty coffee is enjoyable. Tom Yam seafood pasta also nice, must try. Creamy beef meatball should be left for someone with more diverse taste buds. The carbonara turkey bacon has stronger mushroom taste, not my kids' favourite. Overall, the service from order to receiving food was good. The meal may take longer to arrive. This place is situated indoors. Good for a family who wanted somw quite dining.",
