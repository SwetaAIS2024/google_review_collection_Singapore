      "text": "We enjoyed our visit to Tablemates so much we made a second booking!\n\nWe were really not prepared for a delicious culinary adventure by Chef Carmen! Our food was beautifully presented, and every dish was so dynamic in flavor! Now, even several days after our meal, my wife‚Äôs family is still talking about the Koji Duck dish!\n\nDishes were very well presented and explained to us. You can really get a sense of how passionate Chef and the team are about their craft! We brought several bottles of wine for dinner that night, and the team even offered to decant our wines.\n\nMy guests came away entertained, impressed and most definitely full! Once again, thanks to the Chef and team for a perfect night!",

      "text": "A really nice private dining experience with Chef Carmen and her lovely family. They were super hospitable and accommodating.\nThe atmosphere was fantastic and they have 2 lovely dogs üòÅ.\nThe meal itself was really good.\nThe cook on everything was on point and portions were generous. Too generous that we were full after the sourdough bread/kombu butter/cheese course.\nThe only negative thing is that some of the dishes were on the saltier side like the tortellini  which also had small bits of the crab soft cartilage.\nSome of us found the tomato juice that was served with the tartare, alittle too spicy.\nWe also found the meringue abit too sweet.\n\nAll in all, it was an amazing evening with wonderful hosts. Definitely worth a visit.",

The combination of flavours were well thought through and amalgamated beautifully. From the homemade sourdough, fresh scallops and sashimi, to the perfectly cooked duck and strawberry yoghurt panna cotta! I left full and contented. Would definitely come back for more! Thanks Chef Carmen",

      "text": "Amazing atmosphere. Great place for dinner. We had their squid ink linguine, onion tortelloni, and lasagna. The onion tortelloni was especially delicious, highly recommended.  It came with an amazing sourdough focaccia, and the best of all, there was an amazing dessert with each set!\nWe had the Basque Burnt Cheesecake and it was the best burnt cheesecake I tasted in Singapore. The insides were rich and sweet and it was extremely creamy and soft while also not losing its firmness. They also added a bit of alcohol to the cake that really cuts through the sweetness. It was not jelak, I could eat it all day! Ultimately it was a very enjoyable experience. The atmosphere and the food was amazing. Would eat again 10/10",
