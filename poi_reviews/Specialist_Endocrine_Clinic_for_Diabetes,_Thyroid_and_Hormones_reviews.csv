Paige Walker,5,"Dr. Foo is one of the rare specialists, who are both highly competent and highly empathetic.  I've been seeing him for nearly 3 years, and each visit, he spends a significant amount of time walking me through my test results, explaining the various outcomes and the latest research on my condition.  Despite his advanced degrees and outstanding depth of knowledge, he treats his patients with the utmost respect.  Through his treatment, my condition has dramatically improved - I highly recommend him to anyone in search of an Endocrinologist.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117100438564783075409/reviews
