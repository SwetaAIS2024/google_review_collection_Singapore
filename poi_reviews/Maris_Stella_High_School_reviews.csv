Marc,4,Donâ€™t care what the other reviews say heads up you will get made fun of but most of the time itâ€™s all in good fun plus we always made fun of each other as jokes. most teachers not bad but 1/20 are great all things aside after the first year getting adjusted to the not great toilets and food (some are great btw) it was the best 10 years of my life (sec plus primary),3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106957370405886120585/reviews
EL,5,"With the new principal who has just came on board for 1.5 years, the school has finally begun to see remarkable improvements and positive transformation. He has clear vision of academic excellence and is instrumental in ensuring the boys are raised properly and not bullied in school.

Facilities are still old but he transformed it by upgrading to his best efforts, which was not seen and neglected by the previous principals. The PSLE and O-levels results improved vastly over a short span of his leadership. As proud Marist, We hope to see Maris Stella raising its standards and going back to its old high days again!!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115126841104220688321/reviews
