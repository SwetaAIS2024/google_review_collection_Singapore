M Farhan,5,Best pizza at the area. Quality was good and the sourdough pizza bread they use is phenomenal. Love their margherita & truffle pizza.  Take note pizza are freshly made so if they have lots of orders expect some waiting time.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102418811056275261325/reviews
Peach Mint,5,"The pizzas here was freshly made. The taste was awesome and delicious. Affordable ,worth it and it's fast too.
Just ordered mine and got my pizza ready  in 10 minutes.
Loves their 2 pizza combo. Their garlic bread super soft and we cant get enough of it. Would comeback for other flavors and more and especially their garlic bread..yummms.
Highly recommended.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112428196440653463189/reviews
Food hunter,5,"Canâ€™t rate on services and atmosphere as they only do takeaway. Very good balance of quality and price of pizza. I tried chicken pepperoni, truffle mushroom, margherita & garden shrooms.

Chicken pepperoni - very well flavoured, perfect mix of tomato base and cheese. Tasty meat.

Truffle mushroom - Very good flavour of truffle, but wish the truffle flavour can be stronger and spread across the pizza. The one that I ate, the truffle is only on certain parts of the pizza. So some slices can be quite bland.

Margherita - Well balance of cheese, eating this feels very light.

Garden shrooms - I personally donâ€™t eat bell peppers so didnâ€™t enjoy this as much, hence canâ€™t say much about this pizza

I am a big eater hence I can eat 2 of these pizza in a go. But for a normal person, 1 pizza is more than enough to satisfy one meal

Note to Now Pizza - Could include thin crust pizza as an option for consumers with different taste. Keep it up, I feel this is better than other major competitors!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100878011953837906113/reviews

reyna,5,"so disappointed.. that i didnâ€™t find out about this place sooner!!!!! ðŸ¤© the friendly staff offered me a sample and even though it was cold, it was still so good ðŸ˜© so of course i had to get it. I ordered the margarita and hot bee pepperoni and both were so delicious especially the pepperoni one because of the hot honey ðŸ¤¤ writing this review makes me want to go back again to try the other flavours ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112318493624209464641/reviews
