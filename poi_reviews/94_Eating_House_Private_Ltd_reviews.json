      "text": "I'm not sure why the name of this coffee shop is called \"94 Eating House\" since there is no actual signage of that here.\n\nIt's an array of food options from tze Char, Chicken Rice, Ban mian, Western Food, Wan Tan mee and cai fan here.\n\nA few famous establishments here, which seems to be the Western stall , serve the old school style of chops.\n\nVentilation is good even though there is only a veranda outdoor seating. So it's rather cramped.\n\nI had the You Yi Ban Mian You Mian store, and I really loved the Pu Tian Lor mee!!! The meat is so tender and flavourful.",

There is no one enforcing patrons to only smoke in the smoking zone, which is the area near the carpark and has an ashtray on each table.\n\nPeople just don't care and just smoke cigarettes across the entire coffee shop even though there are empty tables within the smoking zone.\n\nIf you want a cigarette free meal, avoid this coffee shop until they do something to address this issue.",

The fried buns they serve are also quite fragrant, but slightly oily. We didn't managed to finish the fries though, as u can see the portion is really big!! Overall a happy meal and will come back again soon!",
