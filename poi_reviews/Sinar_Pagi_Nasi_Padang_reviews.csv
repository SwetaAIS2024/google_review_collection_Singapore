Harman Harison,5,"The queue was quite long. I would not recommend coming here at 1pm as by that time there would be many people here and some of the dishes might be finished by the time its your turn.

Nasi Rawon and Nasi Jenganan was unique and tasty. As it was my first time eating these, the taste was quite new to me. The combination of several dishes and gravy complemented each other.

Queuing up for more than 20 minutes was really worth it. Services was fast, when it was finally my turn, and the plating was awesome and showed how experienced the shop-owners were.

Trying to find a place to sit and eat was a bit hard as it was food court. Will definitely come again to try other options.

Highly recommended!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100447961201731726488/reviews
Ding Man,2,"ordered Ayam Sambal and 2 veggies which costed me $10.5. I couldn’t believe the price so I asked again. And this is in Eunos not CBD.

I’ve been to Indonesia many times, had Nasi Padang in Padang, Malang, Surabaya…all I can say is the food here was quite mediocre, chicken was dry and hard, I couldn’t taste the spiciness in the sambal.

Quite disappointed overall, definitely not worth the 10.5 I paid.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112981455129850864987/reviews
Hairry Zhuss,1,"Honestly, the food was mehh… overhyped and overpriced. $11 for a Nasi Ambeng Daging felt a bit much. The rendang wasn’t just lacking in flavor—it was hard too! And I was surprised they only gave one piece of terung (eggplant).

Are they famous for their food or for their high prices? I guess the nicest thing on the plate was the bergedil. Everything else was just so-so je. I’d recommend others to try other stalls with better prices and quality.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106964920558006772044/reviews
Khairil Azmi,2,"The uncles were, as always, friendly. While the food wasn’t authentic Nasi Padang/Nasi Kapau, it was tasty, though not particularly special, similar quality can be found at other Nasi Padang stalls across the island. That said, the long queue didn’t feel worth the effort. Unfortunately, I experienced severe diarrhea today (while I had not eaten anything else aside from their food). I tried their dishes several times before and never had such an issue.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115086562090551812532/reviews
Jing Tong,5,"If flavor had a national anthem, Sinar Pagi Nasi Padang would be belting it at full volume. The beef rendang? So tender it probably resigned itself to fate. The sambal? Spicier than my last breakup. Rice so fluffy, I half-expected it to give me a hug. I came in a mere mortal and left questioning if I had ascended. Service is fast—blink, and your plate is full. My only regret? Not bringing Tupperware. Five stars, would sell a kidney for more.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114453568467619573771/reviews
