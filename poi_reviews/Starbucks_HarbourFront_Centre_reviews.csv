Rhian Tan,5,Nice quiet place on a Monday late afternoon. Muffin tasted fresh too unlike some other branches.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111841763291533864817/reviews
Helvio Neto,5,"Small but very cozy store located inside the HarbourFront mall. Here you can buy different SB souvenirs, like the Singapore Starbucks mug, among others.
The service is good and the quality of the coffee is excellent, as always.
This is a good place to wait and have some good time while waiting for the ferry to board.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100481209676676485935/reviews
Huyen Dam,2,"I always order my matcha latte no sugar and im very sure the last 2 times i ordered from here, it was made at normal sugar level but i didnt find out until i made my way back to office. So today, i reminded myself to taste my matcha before i left and it was sugaryyy. Is there no “no sugar” button in the order system? Yes, the ladies there made me a new one with no sugar immediately. But i dont wanna have to taste test my matcha every time i order from here.
Never had issues like this at any other Starbucks.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110249059619989582273/reviews
Shi Mun Wong,1,"ordered pick up while walking to the starbucks from the mrt, hoping for the drink to be ready when i reach. when i reached the cafe, which wasn't busy at the moment when i entered, app says my drink wasn't ready.. hence i went on to set up my laptop first. i did abit of work for like a good 5mins, and i saw the staff wasn't preparing any drinks, they were chit chatting. so i went to the pick up stand to see if my drink was ready. next thing i saw is my drink there at the pick up stand... my drink have definitely have been there for a while as the foam have been separated by the melted ice. picked it up anyways cus im thirsty. staff only click ""ready"" on my order when i have COLLECTED AND SEATED?! LIKE HELLO U GOT TIME TO CHIT CHAT BUT CANNOT JUST CLICK THE ""READY"" FOR ME TO KNOW???? -- starbucks please work on your staff
anyways, i ordered my regular low fat hojicha with extra scroop, this was sweeter than what i usually have at other starbucks.. what in the LOW SOP here!! --  please educate your staff with your SOP PROPERLY
nevertheless, i came here during the PH to study, surprisingly no crowd. the only plus point for my visit here today. but noisy staffss definitely made the experience worse. Its okay to chit chat during work but mind your volume. YOU HAVE CUSTOMERS!! BE PROFESSIONAL LADIES!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101562817130043632078/reviews
Will S.,4,"A small and dated venue. So dated it feels like the 90s. Care for a trip down nostalgia lane.
Regardless the staff are super efficient. If you’re not looking to hang out then you’ll get your food and drink in lightning speed.
Impressive",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106258992195754957473/reviews
