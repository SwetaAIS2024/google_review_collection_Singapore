Shelters all through from the train station, and shopping malls, are a huge plus for my transit experience. The well maintained bus guides and transit timings, although not entirely accurate, is very helpful in allowing me to make public transit arrangements.",

The bus stop also has a signage showing the buses arrival times. This is super awesome when you know how long you have to wait. The bus stop is long enough for two buses to stop at the same time.",
