Jonathan Lim,5,"Kenn is a great instructor, be sure to take your WSET level 2 and 3 classes with him! Thoroughly enjoyed being a student here, location is also 7 minutes walk away from Old Airport Road where you can get some yummy food during the lunch break. Contact Eyleen to enquire about the classes!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114473725027611542564/reviews
