Ginger,4,"Thumb up and thanks for the Progressive lenses( sharmir lens)
recommended by the  shop. Though the lens are very expensive , it  is indeed worth getting them.Was so surprised that it did not cause any  peripheral distortion when moving your eyes from side to side. In fact, I was prepared to give myself a learning period to adapt to it as from from past experiences, some lens might feel off-balance or even nauseated.
Highly recommended to   get Progressive lens from Beijing optical shop .",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113114062429206502351/reviews
Renee “Rain” Wong,1,"I bought an office lens for the first time which cost me $700+ from the shop. I went back this afternoon to ask for adjustment as the side is loosen and out of shape.  I was attended by the younger sister. She told me she will try to adjust but hope it won't break.  I was quite shock to hear that! What type of negative response and attitude is that? When she was adjusting, I kept praying in my heart that it won't break. She also tightened the screws.
She then passed me back the spec. I requested for a new box because the one I have has worn out, I was charged $2.50. I am not satisfied because when I went home , I realized she didn't do a good job to the adjustment. One side of the screw was looser than the other side. And one side was still not balance. I really regretted to do my specs there. Will not recommend anyone to go there. They are the most expensive shop, as feedback by my relatives previously.   Having paid so much yet getting this type of attitude and no customer service quality.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117810631684990320847/reviews
