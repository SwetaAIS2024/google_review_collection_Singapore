Han Yu Tan,4,"The sweet and sour pork cutlet rice is decent. Big portion, gave me 3 cutlets. The pork is okay, not very crispy, sauce is pretty mild. The veggies that come with it is very delicious though. I liked the pandan milk tea, very nice mix, providing some sweetness to the tea.

The kaya toast was quite good, very buttery, nicely melted, very creamy.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110231907823839530082/reviews
Anthony Chew,2,"We dined there this morning, ordering the Toast platter and Curry chicken prata.  The food quality was acceptable, but significant improvements are needed across the board.

Our order was mistakenly given to a later arrival who had ordered the same dish, resulting in a 20-minute delay.  The principle of first-come, first-served should be consistently implemented.

Observing other customers receive their orders (even different dishes) while we waited was frustrating.

The service staff require additional training.

My wife's curry chicken arrived even later, after a 30-minute wait.

No apology or acknowledgement was offered for the significant delays.

The food was adequate, lacking any exceptional qualities.

The ambiance was unremarkable.

However, the pricing was exorbitant.  Breakfast for two cost $25.

We recommend exploring alternative dining options in the area; we discovered a much more affordable establishment in a nearby building.

We enc ourage you to investigate other possibilities.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118153053365625377782/reviews
Richard Tan,3,"The toasts were delicious. The service poor as the food were not served together which led to my partner has to wait for almost 5 minutes before my toast was served so that we can have our meals together. The boiled eggs were served last and almost 15 mins later. And the restaurant was not even crowded.

Need to improve on service.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106165873437868392637/reviews
Joshua Lim,5,"Very kids friendly cafe and value for money as the coffee cups are big. Service is fast enough and the portions are big (esp the western, and can be shared). Hope this brand continues to do well as there are not many brands that do local food well. Nowadays its all Chinese food and sadly the local players are going extinct",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118041392877147202556/reviews
HC L,3,"Took about 25 minutes for the French toast to arrive. The simplest version of french toast was with cinnamon sugar and costs $5.20. The cinnamon sugar was thickly applied and a little too strong for me. Would have preferred a plain version. But a plus point was the honey and butter slab given (see photo). Also, I ordered Teh O by mistake (via the app) and the waiter changed it back to Kopi O kosong. Good service. But I think the kitchen was understaffed and the toast came 25 min later. Luckily I was not in a hurry.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105381120259821237733/reviews
