PS Goh,4,"Have not had the chance to go to that many LIVE music places recently but Black Bird is definitely THE spot if you miss Hard Rock Cafe in the 90s. Bring back so many memories as the tunes were played‚Ä¶

Prices are decent‚Ä¶ Brunello for $128++",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115592507731713934798/reviews
YSV Q,5,"Friday night vibes were lit‚Äîplace was totally buzzing. Skipped the munchies, went straight for the liver damage with those drinks. Service was on point, and the throwback 80s-90s beats? Absolute bangers. No cap, the crowd was def rocking their 40s, as one of the reviews said. The spot was totally off the MRT radar, but snagging a Grab or hopping on a bus home was chill.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113635450901943089399/reviews
Soo Hin Yeoh,5,We were not here for the food but The Blackbird has a good live band playing in the evenings and it serves good drinks. Service received was good especially from a server named Karen. üëçüèº,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115725392210756907778/reviews
Edliana Edward,5,"You will need to reserve first before coming. They had a promotion 2 pints of Heineken and satay at $35++. We got ourselves nacho cheese fries, fried chicken and regular fries along with the promo. The live band starts at 7pm. Then we got ourselves carbonara, a kids‚Äô menu of nuggets, mash potatoes and grilled broccoli. For 5 pax, the total came to about $290.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104379533528826162087/reviews
