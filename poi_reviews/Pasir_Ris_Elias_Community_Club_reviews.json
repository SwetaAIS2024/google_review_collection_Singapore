After that I came for my favorite breakfast- Mcdonald.\nMilo re often is to get my cash from the POSB ATM located on the ground floor of the CC\nIt was renovated new years back and I had to move away so I hardly come back that oftenâ€¦.\nThat also because of Covid-19 I did not visit this place with any purpose.\nThat morning I was looking for the howker noodle stall for breakfast so I came back here n decided to take a few pictures of this CC!\n\nIn front of the CC building has a huge void ground that is used to hold our major festivals, that make our residents get together and celebrate in harmony!",
