It was already dispensed and I left the clinic when I realised she prescribed me a penicillin and went back for a change. Medical negligence by the locum which could have led to serious adverse report.",

      "text": "I never wanted to post an unpleasant review but I can no longer ignore this matter due to its seriousness. I was given an antibiotic course for a treatment of a common bacteria. This is not rocket science. Every doctor knows about the dosage.\n\nBut my treatment was heavily under-dose. After the course I went for lab test and found the bacteria was still active. This under-dose treatment has given the bacteria a chance to become resistant. Can you imagine a simple illness becomes incurable because the clinic wants it to be that way? There are only 2 scenarios: either the doctor is incapable or he intentionally doesn’t want to quickly cure the illness. Like I said any undergrad doctor can come up with the correct dosage to treat this bacteria. So I’m thinking something shady is going on. Plus, the doctor recommended that I had a scope to test for the bacteria after his antibiotic course. Of course I didn’t come back. A breath test is sufficient and accurate to diagnose this bacteria and the doctor recommended scope?!\n\nI’m on another course with another doctor but the damage is done. The bateria might have developed resistance to the recommended antibiotics. I can only hope a correct dosage be able to kill the bacteria. But I hope you make the right choice by not committing the same mistake I made.",

I mentioned to him, and he says none of my problem.  When he started his examination, told me that I am fine but my throat was so swollen and inflamed, he sweeps through my back with his stethoscope before I could even breathe.\n\nThen mention 2 days MC. Which I requested for 1 day.  He still proceed to issue 2 days. Then he talk to the clinic nurse like some entitled old dudes.",

I have made them my regular clinic.",
