I watched a few kids collecting all the toys inside one of the play houses and not let other kids come in and bully them, told the staff they need to intervene. They completely ignored my complaint and buried their heads in their screens. Not only incredibly rude, but the staff should not be put in charge of a kids playground - unable to supervise kids, they are a security hazard.",
