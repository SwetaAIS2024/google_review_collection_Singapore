      "text": "Cheng Mei Shi Hao Wei Dao is a well-regarded lor mee stall nestled within Tanglin Halt Market, known for serving up comforting, traditional local fare. With a reputation built on consistent quality and bold flavors, it’s become a favorite among residents and those seeking a taste of authentic Singaporean hawker cuisine.\n\nI had the Fried Fish Lor Mee for breakfast, and it was excellent — especially the fish, which was crisp on the outside and tender inside. At $4.50, it was great value, and there was no queue during my visit, making the experience even more enjoyable. Tanglin Halt Market itself adds to the charm — peaceful, unhurried, and perfect for a quiet morning meal.",

      "text": "Usually people go there for the laksa. But today, I want to speak up for the lor mee there. This lor mee somehow perfected the thickness ratio for the lor, not too thick and not too thin. Their fried fish nuggets are my favorite. Done crispy, light and well seasoned, it is also not oily. Normally I had mine with mee hoon, as I find it much more tasty after soaking in the broth as compared with mee. Do ask for more garlic, chilli, 香菜  and vinegar. The portion is generous, good value. The owner is young, so many more years of this wonderful bowl of noodle to come. Taste 9/10 Value 9/10",

I am a huge fan of lor mee, and have it quite often. This one is ok for the price. It's certainly not the best I've had, but I wouldn't mind eating it again if I'm in the area.",
