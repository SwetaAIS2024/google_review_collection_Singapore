Ken Peh,5,"Ordered their fish ball noodles, very solid. The chili sauce is super spicy and the portion is real big. The kopitiam also have a lot of other stalls including all time favorite chicken rice. It's a very old nostalgia 80s 90s type of setting. Don't miss it when you are here.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113975004215945002265/reviews
Ruth Ngo,5,Eating House 815 is a gem! The food is really good and the portions are generous. I enjoyed their nasi lemak - it was fragrant and delicious.

TigerFriends,4,"One of our favourite coffee shops tucked in HDB in Jurong West near Pioneer North.

This coffee shop is always crowded and there are many options of food to choose from including mix rice, chicken rice, noodle soup, porridge, mee hoon kway, Indian stall that prepares variety of food including Roti Prata, Mee goreng, Briyani, et cetera; Chinese fruit and dried squid rojak, veggie Chinese vegetarian food, Japanese and Malay cuisine. Of course a coffee shop is incomplete without a beverage corner that also sells half boiled eggs and Kaya toast.

The three oldest stores I know are the Rojak, fishball ball noodles/curry noodles and chicken rice stalls.

My favourite store is the fishball noodles stall. Be fishball noodles, they also sell laksa, curry noodles, braised chicken feet, wanton noodles, noodles and more.

Mixed rice stall is also popular because of plenty of choices from variety of dishes.  The taste of their dishes quite tasty but I found the price is slightly higher, and the portion varies depending on the server.

The local coffee is quite good but the price is higher than in the city.

Overall still a good neighbourhood coffee shop to visit especially when you do not know what to eat. You will find something there.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118361107044052388566/reviews
