Dang Hoang Anh,4,"Here’s a 200-word review of **Straits Chinese Nonya Restaurant 土生坊正宗娘惹餐馆 (1953)**:

---

**A Heritage Feast of Peranakan Flavors**

Established in 1953, **Straits Chinese Nonya Restaurant** (土生坊) is a culinary institution that preserves the rich traditions of Peranakan (Straits Chinese) cuisine. Nestled in Singapore’s vibrant Katong district, this family-run eatery offers an authentic taste of Nyonya heritage, with recipes passed down through generations.

The menu is a symphony of bold, aromatic dishes. Standouts include the **Ayam Buah Keluak**—tender chicken braised in a earthy, tangy black nut sauce—and the **Itek Tim**, a comforting duck soup with salted vegetables. The **Nonya Chap Chye** (mixed vegetables) and **Babi Pongteh** (braised pork in fermented bean paste) showcase the cuisine’s balance of sweet, savory, and spicy notes. Don’t miss their **Kueh Pie Tee**, crispy cups filled with julienned vegetables and shrimp, or the decadent **Durian Pengat** for dessert.

The restaurant’s nostalgic ambiance, with vintage tiles and family photos, complements the homely cooking. Service is warm, though the pace can be leisurely—ideal for savoring each dish. While prices are mid-range, the quality justifies the cost.

For travelers and locals alike, 土生坊 is a must-visit to experience Peranakan culture on a plate. Its timeless flavors and historical charm make it a true gem in Singapore’s culinary landscape.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106100598552094093683/reviews
Zatarie Hoe,5,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at The Straits Chinese Nonya Restaurant at Keck Seng Road with my family visiting from overseas, and we were all thoroughly impressed. The restaurant offers an authentic and delicious taste of Nonya cuisine that left a lasting impression on all of us.

Every dish was lovingly prepared and rich in traditional Peranakan flavors — a true celebration of heritage cuisine. The service was also impeccable; the staff were attentive, warm, and made us feel right at home. It was a wonderful experience seeing my family enjoy the food and hospitality so much.

A small point of feedback: while the curry fish head had a generous portion of vegetables like brinjal and lady’s fingers, we found it a bit difficult to locate much of the actual fish head. It would have been even better with a more balanced portion of fish. That said, the other dishes more than made up for it — everything from the chap chye to the ayam buah keluak was outstanding.

Overall, I highly recommend The Straits Chinese Nonya Restaurant for anyone looking to experience authentic and satisfying Nonya fare. We’ll definitely be back again!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115063186209477778569/reviews
