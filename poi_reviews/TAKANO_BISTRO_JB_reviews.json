      "text": "I heard that Takano ventured an outlet in Johor and I have to try it. Well the food was amazingly done. We tried Mutton, chicken satti sorry, chicken kicap satti sorru and sardine satti sorru. Everything has its own unique tastes. Not usual where all satti sorru will taste similar but here, it wasn‚Äôt the case. The Kallu (palm wine) was worth to try. The environment was cozy and new.  The only is that the staffs are too shy, I guess. They might need someone who can speak up loudly and clearly to guide them. Definitely recommend for those who‚Äôs staying near Gelang Patah.",

      "text": "Came here after seeing good reviews and food was delicious‚Ä¶. Ordered satti sorru and also this man tau bun with curry, spectacular they definitely live up to the hype. Highly recommend, not to mention we had extra 10% discount for Valentine‚Äôs Day\nUpdated review.\nWe had to wait an extremely long time, and the service was disappointing. The staff member mentioned that only she and the chef were working, so the food would take a while, but she didn‚Äôt even give an estimated wait time. This lack of communication was frustrating. On top of that, the air conditioning wasn‚Äôt turned on, and her excuse was that she was alone, which makes no sense. To make things worse, the dish I wanted wasn‚Äôt even available.\nPrior to my visit, I came across a particularly negative review but chose to overlook it, assuming it might have been an isolated experience. However, upon arriving, I found the service to be exactly as described, if not worse. The inefficiency, lack of attentiveness, and overall disorganization made for an incredibly frustrating experience.\n\nA word of caution to anyone arriving on an empty stomach and a short temper please prepare for a test of patience. If you have high blood pressure, I strongly advise bringing your medication, as the level of frustration this establishment induces may lead to unnecessary health concerns. Consider this a fair warning.\n\nI‚Äôve given honest reviews before when the service was good, but I did not expect such a poor experience. Take this feedback as you will.",

      "text": "I went to try and support Takano Bistro in JB on 1/3/2025 ,Saturday but unfortunately, my experience was extremely disappointing. I ordered the *Masala Chicken Satti Sooru* and *Kicap Mutton Satti Sooru*, but both dishes were tasteless and had a peculiar aftertaste. Additionally, the *Egg Podimas* came with anchovies that were not properly fried, making it unpleasant to eat. The *fried chicken* was another letdown‚Äîit lacked seasoning and was completely bland.\n\nWhen I brought up these issues to the staff, I was told they could not refry the dish because they were ‚Äútoo busy,‚Äù even though the restaurant was not at full capacity. The response I received was dismissive, with staff insisting that ‚Äúthis is how the food is‚Äù and blaming the poor quality on a high volume of orders. If that‚Äôs the case, perhaps there should be limitations on the number of orders they accept to ensure food quality isn‚Äôt compromised.\n\nOverall, I was really hoping for a good experience, but the food and service left much to be desired. I hope the management takes feedback seriously and improves both the food quality and customer service moving forward. Thanks ‚úåüèΩ",
