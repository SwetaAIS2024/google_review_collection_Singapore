seow,1,"They seem to have problems handling their inventory. Have bought ice cream from here where the entire tub is frostbitten on at least two occasions.
Which seems to suggest their handling of the ice cream possibly allows it to melt rather a great deal before they put it into the freezers. I have had to throw out newly purchased ice cream due to this issue and I live nearby in the area.

But as they say; fool me once, shame on you.

peggy teong,5,"Great service from Jaya at the gourmet food section. So accomodative, friendly and helpful in  serving me for my Christmas orders.
The orders were on time.
The roast were awesome! The ibirico pork ribs were fantastic , premium cut and well roasted juicy and with good portion of meat.
Her suggestion to order 3 racks for my party were spot on. The Turkey too was beautiful roasted. And so was the pork knuckle .Great service with a smile.  She even helped me carry them to my car as it was heavy. Super helpful . A valuable asset to Cold storage.
Thanks from Peggy Teong",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103173525862155094606/reviews
