The noodle is well braised and flavourful. It was good with or without the chilli sambal. It‚Äôs worth the travel there. The hawker centre though packed with lunch crowd, was airy.\n\nI also had a plate Hainanese chicken and rice. The chicken is served with tau Kwa and generous serving of scallion sauce. Chicken is moist, tender and well cooked. Very delicious.",
