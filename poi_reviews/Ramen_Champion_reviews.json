The broth was flavourful and the noodles cooked al dente. It seemed that the noodles were made in-house. The entire bowl of ramen also came with a Japanese boiled egg cooked to perfection. With a great salty flavour and the yolk was watery. The char siew was thick and flavourful as well.\n\nThe prices were reasonable. Simply decorated and appropriate service standard.",

Frankly, i had no idea what my wife ordered. I just eat whatever dropped on my table. Enjoyed the soup, doesnt leave a strong taste in ur mouth which usually  urge 1 to drink water after.\n\nLike the waitress, calm, matured n good flow. Doesnt rush to get job done. Nice vibe.",
