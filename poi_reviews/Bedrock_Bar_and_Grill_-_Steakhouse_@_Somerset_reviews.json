      "text": "It was a dinner celebration for a friend‚Äôs birthday. We pre-ordered a tomahawk and it was cut according to the weight we could handle, 1.9kg bone-in. We got a couple of sides to pair - a potato mash, Mac and cheese, broccolini, and mushrooms. The tomahawk was beautifully seared with the charred bits adding a nice salty smokiness to every bite. We didn‚Äôt get wine because we were driving but on hind sight we could have as it would have added some acidity to our rich meat and buttery sides. Nonetheless, the meal was enjoyable and the room allocated was cosy enough for us to be apart from the bustling side of the restaurant. The service was attentive and impressive as well. Bedrock is still one of our preferred steak houses.",

Best part of today's dining experience was being attended to by Gary, who was sincere, attentive, and added his brand of humour to our interaction. Won't be long before we're back again!",

They let us dine at 9:45pm and let us stay 45 minutes past closing (10:45pm). Service is great. You know it‚Äôs a real steak house when they don‚Äôt serve rice. I posted food-in-progress so you can see the actual. Service and food are really top notch.",
