Best of all, you can still get a pack for just $3. There's always a long queue, so be prepared to wait about 10 minutes, but it's well worth it.",

      "text": "Our favorite roasted chicken rice stall in Singapore. The roasted chicken is tender and very tasty. The char siew here is amazing with a good mixture of fats and lean meat and is very tender. The taste is sweeter compared to most other places.\nThe chicken rice is aromatic and the rice is perfectly cooked. However, it is a little oily and that is what prevents the rice from sticking together.\nA queue usually forms by 11 am but the line moves quickly.",

      "text": "Got to know of this chicken rice stall on my previous trip to try the wanton noodle stall right next to it. Seems like a popular stall as there was long queue for this chicken rice stall. Happen to pass my this area and was craving for chicken rice and decided to give this stall a try.\n\nReached the stall slightly before 12pm and was greeted by the familiar long queue. There was at least 15pax ahead of me, but it moved pretty fast.\n\nOrdered roasted chicken breast with charsiew. Cant remeber how much i paid. Rice was frangent and not too oily. Most importantly the rice was flavorful and fluffy. Had the roasted chicken breast, it was flavorful and wasnt dry. The charsiew was quite good as well. Chili sauce quite spicy but goes well with meat and rice.\n\nOverall, the chicken rice is pretty good and would highly recommend.",
