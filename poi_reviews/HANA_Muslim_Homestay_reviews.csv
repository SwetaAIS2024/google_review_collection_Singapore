gee rozi,5,"The house is big, clean and beautiful. 4 rooms in total and have aircond. only the living room is not air conditioned. Hope the owner can install an air conditioner in the living room for comfort. The house is complete with crockery, cooking materials, iron, kettle, microwave, towels, washing machine, toileteries and mats. I just want to tell you a few things. First, can we not put a mirror in every room? We have to go to the bathroom to dress up. Both curtains cannot be completely closed. There is an open space at the end of the curtain. If you don't notice the curtain, outsiders can see us in the room. More so at night when the room lights are on, right? I found the curtain rod installation in the master bedroom short of the window. This is the reason there is an empty space at the end of the window. It's a bit noisy at night when you hear the sound of vehicles because it's close to the highway. Overall it's ok to sit here. There is a guard who looks after entering and exiting the park. They are very strict. Entry and exit are monitored by scanning the driver's face. Very good for the safety of the residents there and also visitors.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104908978021329495477/reviews
