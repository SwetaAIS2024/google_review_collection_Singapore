Ami T.,4,Accidentally found this coffee shop. The friendly couple who runs the shop are very passionate about coffee. Nice selection of hot and cold coffee as well as some sweet and savory bakes. I had the cold sparkling Americano which was very nice. Note: more of a takeaway cafe.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111333597975079052719/reviews

Worth trying everything here and especially the sourdough bread",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105879446939271534269/reviews

Irfan Rinaldi,4,"A small coffee shop in Pasir Panjang, conveniently located by the bus stop.
The place is quite small and does have some stools to sit but it's more for order on the go.

Ordered flat white twice was really happy with the coffee taste and quality. The service was also very warm and friendly. Pricing wise is moderate, a cup of flat white cost $5.50... It is still reasonable for the quality.

They also sell some pastries, tried the pain au chocolat, it was just OK. They also have cheese cakes, which was recommended by the barista. May try next time when I'm craving for some dessert.

I'm wondering if they could make Magic or Piccolo latte, will try asking on the next visit.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108831676133691772919/reviews
Michael Wong,5,Visit Pantry@Pasir Panjang today. Had my usual dosage of caffeine and Flat‚òïÔ∏èWhite really helps to boost my energy and their speculoos cheese cake was awesome. Love the biscoff topping that goes well with the cheeseüç∞cake. A great combinationüòã and a great way to start the day. Will come back again to check out their Bagels.üëç,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100628855007802068343/reviews
