Supreet Kini,5,"Homely bowl of dry Fishball noodles.

This stall is run by an old couple. One of the more popular stalls at Jalan Batu Hawker Centre.

There was a line of 4-5 people, some of whom had multiple orders. Total wait time on a weekend morning was around 20-25 minutes as uncle prepares each dish freshly from scratch.

Asked for Mee pok, which was nice and chewy. Chilli was good, not overpowering.

Fishballs are not handmade, but nice. Comes with generous amounts of fish cake and sliced pork. Generous with the spring onions too!

Shiok!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105328280516267995599/reviews
Sean Goh,4,"Discovered this stall that sells old school mee pok inside the Jalan Batu hawker centre. Noodle starts fromSGD$2.50. This stall is run by elderly couple, there was a small queue formed when I was there. Noodle was alright but have a slight alkaline to it. It comes with the standard ingredient of fishcake, fishball and lean meat. Overall, it a decent bowl of noodle.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews

K C LIM,4,"Cheap and good fishball mee pok topped with some minced pork, slices of fish cake, fried shallots etc.  The mixed chilli sauce with black vinegar and soy sauce tossed together with the mee pok gave a taste of old school-days nostalgia.  Very affordable at 2.50 plus additional $0.50 for extra fishballs although it was factory supplied; not many places in Singapore where you can find such prices these days!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116765759611338492885/reviews
