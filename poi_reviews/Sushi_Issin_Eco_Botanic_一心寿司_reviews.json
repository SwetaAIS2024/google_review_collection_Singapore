      "text": "Because of the 4.7 high reviews given for this restaurant, I decided to give it a try as I was in the vicinity.\n\nBut, it was so disappointing.\n\nTheir salmon avocado taco had so few toppings on top, while the rest are all rice. And it cost 28.90\n\nSecondly, the Tonkatsu Ramen was worse. Bland soup taste, over soggy noodles. Although the pork char siew was great, the star was the soup, isn't it??\n\nSames goes for the Char Siew Don. Rice was plain dry rice, no sauce, nothing. And can't digest properly.\n\nSeriously, how did this place have such a high rating of 4.7 over 535 reviews??? I don't understand.",
