Soh Wee Kian,4,"Not too bad Roti Prata, Masala Dosai, Murtabak, and Teh Halia, yet to try other stuffs, itâ€™s 24 hours so, not too bad. But surely not the best in town, but as itâ€™s nearest to my home vicinity, this is the first choice for me if I want Indian food.ðŸ¥¸",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106902344927258494810/reviews
J Liew,1,"Food is decent.
Terrible service by the staff, a simple order of maggi goreng and teh ais still can mess up by just bringing the maggi. Even after finishing the food, drink still had not arrived. Tried to get their attention to remind them, a couple of them saw me but still didn't care to check. Got fed up and just wanted to pay for my maggi and leave, then they had the gall to still charge me for the teh ais. Then asked me if I wanted to take away.
Save your time and money for a better time elsewhere.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104496113329569688830/reviews

techno tronic,1,"I ordered a plate of Thai fried kway teow ( seafood ). To my disgust, the prawns taste so bad and rancid. They actually served spoilt seafood seafood for human consumption. I approached the man behind the cashier whom I assume is the person in charge of the outlet to tell him that the prawns had gone bad. The man doesn't seem to care. No apologies, no concerns at all. The best part was, the cook didn't even know if those prawns can still be use for cooking. He said he just saw them on the table and assume it could still be use. He picked them up and proceed to use it to prepare my meal. Not only was I affected by the meal I had, what makes me unhappy is how the person handled my complains about their food. They couldnt give a hoot.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111222995271651514321/reviews
