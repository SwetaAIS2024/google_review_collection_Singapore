If you don't care using other people straw, this restaurant is for you. Had to cut it to prevent other people experiencing the same as me.",

      "text": "I had always drove past this restaurant late at night after my massages but never really stopped to eat or drink anything. Tonight, decided to try them out.\n\nBy the way, it’s the only eatery around the area opened till late. I visited at 2am plus and there was still a crowd in the restaurant. Saw many people having shisha here as well. Ample seating space though and right beside the parking lot. There’s loud music playing at the background which we found it rather annoying as we needed to scream to simply talk to each other. There was also a large tv screen featuring football matches. Would have preferred the background music to be softer.\n\nOrdered the roti John chicken and my friend ordered the teh Tarik. Honestly the roti John was pretty good, oozing with sauce and mayo and the dish came with serving of fries and coleslaw, not your typical roti John serving but we appreciate it. Understand from my friend that the teh Tarik was fragrant and tasty but I only had the teh o kosong ice which was standard.\n\nPrices were reasonable and I believed we would visit again.",
