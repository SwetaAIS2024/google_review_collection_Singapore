bc goh,4,"Since I found myself needing gynaecological medical attention in late 2015, Dr Tseng has been managing my issues, which included surgical procedures. I am thankful for the happenstance of having him as my GYN. He is attentive and a wonderful listener who is thorough and purposeful with his questions. He is also clear and detailed with his answers, explanations and advice. Dr Tseng's care and concern for his patients extends beyond the consultation room into the operating theatre,  assembling a team that ensures comprehensive support during and after procedures.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118346294907630261102/reviews

Chew Qianhui,5,"I have been under the care of Dr Arthur Tseng for many years to manage my health. From the beginning, Dr Tseng took all my concerns seriously and explained my blood work with me line by line. He has never been dismissive with any of my concerns and genuinely cares about his patient's health.  He is warm and caring and makes me feel safe.

I believe that due to regular checkups with Dr Tseng, I had no issues in getting pregnant. Dr Tseng became my obstetrician and my pregnancy was smooth despite having some complications. My delivery was comfortable and I had a very speedy recovery. My C section wound has healed beautifully and my baby is healthy and now 3 months old :)

Dr Tseng's assistant Rati is a lovely and has the kindest soul. She  truly cares for Dr Tseng's patients, and always make me feel safe despite being in a such a medical and personal setting. She is responsible and professional in managing the clinic as well!

Dr Tseng is an expert in his field and a skillful surgeon. You will definitely be in good hands with Dr Tseng & his team.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104789740992216675588/reviews
