Omelette would be crispy and generous with succulent oysters while char kuey tiao would be dark and well fried. Black carrot cake was lacking in egg though, but compensates with generous portions. Probably would take a few years off your life if consumed frequently, but still recommended!",

The oysters were large and perfectly cooked in a light batter. The generous amount of coriander and tangy chili sauce complemented the oysters perfectly.",

Taste wise, black carrot cake not too sweet and good balance of savoury and fragrance of cai poh and egg.\nMy son had the white version and he said its  very good.\nI like that carrot cake was not too minced up and retained its chunky blocks.\nOne of the best ones I ever tasted. Can eat!",
