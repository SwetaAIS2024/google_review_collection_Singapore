The peanut butter and mint chocolate had a nice mix of creamy and refreshing, the buttermilk waffle was sweet and buttery, and the cold brew white was a perfect blend of coffee and cream. A great spot with tasty, unique flavors!",

I highly recommend the pistachio ice cream!\n\nThey do offer a 5% student discount, in theory, but singing up for it requires downloading an app and going through a sign up process that took too long and required too much information, so I never completed it. My suggestion to management: offer a 10% discount for anybody with a student card, out of fairness and respect to the students, without trying to acquire data or harass us with a newsletter. Your profit margins surely allow for it.",

      "text": "Heavenly flavours and crisp texture (from chocolate bits)\n\nFood rating: 10/10 üç¶\n- oh my days im telling you when this is the best ice cream spot, this is the best ice cream spot! We ordered the stracciatella, which is milk ice cream with chocolate bits, as well as stracciamenta, which is mint ice cream with chocolate bits. The milk ice cream had such a smooth consistency and had none of those little ice crystals you would find in one of those big ice cream shop chains. And the stracciamenta‚Äôs minty taste was like just nice and it was very soft. Also tried the pistachio ice cream at newest and it was one of the richest and smooth ice creams ever so you can try that as well! Each cup of ice cream is $5 and premium flavours are $6, which is lowk very affordable at this day and age for something of such high quality. They also occasionally have special flavours like Dubai chocolate or strawberry shortcake which ranges from 10-12$.\nword to describe food: OHHH YES\n\nService rating: 9/10 üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n- despite the crowd, the staff are still respectful and do their best to serve the customers with care and consideration, ensuring all orders are fulfilled with quality. These young ones are still able to work so efficiently and the waffles and ice creams come out before you can even walk back to your seat. The drinks do take awhile longer as it takes more time to make, so don‚Äôt grumble!\n\nAmbience: 10/10 üå¥\n- i think burnt cones is going for a more industrial look with their exposed concrete look - where it is unpainted and untiled, yet smooth. This really adds to the simplistic aesthetic where there‚Äôs no abstract design that might overwhelm your eyes with complex stuff all around you, which makes it a fairly good spot for more serious discussion or causal conversations with minimal distraction. Really good dessert spot for families and friends after a good meal too!\n\nOverall rating: 10/10\n- Vibes immaculate, amazing food, you will confirm be back bahaha (nus branches also have new menu item of cakes!) All sweet tooths arise and support burnt cones ‚úä‚úä",
