Yumma Papa,4,"Visiting for the first time after hearing great reviews about the coffee here. Ordered an iced latte and banana bread.

Iced latte ($6.50)- Tried the Peru beans which promised light, fruity notes, but the taste was really quite bitter and the notes were difficult to make out. However, I'll want to try their hot latte once more given how it might be a bad day.

Banana bread üçå ($4.50) - Was pretty yummy! I love that they heat the bread up for you, and it tastes fresh, moist and chewy. Only wished it was a slightly larger slice!

Papa says: üëçüèº coffee unfortunately didn't serve, but will give it another go next time.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108010673177262824909/reviews

Caleb Cheah,5,"Nice but small coffee store located next to Alexandra Village food centre, can smell the aroma of coffee when walking in!

Staff were friendly and knowledgeable, recommended the Ethiopian coffee beans to go with my iced latte ($6.50), which was strong and not acidic!

Strongly recommend to get a cuppa from Kyuukei if you‚Äôre in the area, as the coffee is consistently good!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113550379597608370516/reviews
Beau Blas√©,5,"I cannot recommend this place enough! Some of the best, most interesting coffee I have ever had. They also have some of the best and highest quality matcha I have ever tasted. On top of this they have an amazing and friendly staff. Overall, if you are looking for a great coffee or matcha, with a cozy atmosphere, you have to go to Kyuukei.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107156971758650069241/reviews
Jed Lim,4,"Great bakes here, esp when they are served hot! I like their banana bread and lemon olive oil cake! Coffee is decent for me though nothing too outstanding. Service was great as they are very sociable. It is a small outlet and they are lean on manpower so they could be overwhelmed when many orders come in.

It‚Äôs also cool that they can do a pop-up stall for events too!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117253079624937810015/reviews
