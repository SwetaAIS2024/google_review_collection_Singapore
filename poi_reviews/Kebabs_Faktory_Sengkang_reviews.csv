Masmerizeme,5,"Service given to me by Yam & Ameer was fantastic. Regardless of the noise at the background due to the constructions that is happening, they patiently took my orders. The food looks good. My 1st time trying it. I'm sure it'll be awesome! Thank u for the service.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106236958573875009474/reviews
Fatema HS,5,The location of this place is great and so is the food if one loves shawarma.. thr chicken Tikka wrap was great 5/5. The burrito wrap was also great. The bowl i suggest should be eaten fresh and not take away. In all really enjoyed the wraps as well as the falafel and the sauce with falafel.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113870925852700827790/reviews
Ain Zainal,4,"Kak mariam was so friendly & informative.

Food wise i think they should check their freshness daily, this is my 2nd time purchase & i can feel that the sauce was not kept fresh.
1st purchase the whole tomato was spoiled, 2nd purchase was the mint mayo.

Other then that protein is so flavourful & yummy keep it up.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112306021223041458604/reviews
ZX Soh,3,"Food & service are sometimes lousy. I order in advance through their website, but they don't bother preparing my food until I arrive. The baklava, despite selling at 2 for $5.90, is incredibly small & full of oil & sugar (could've spent that $5.90 on 2 plates of chicken rice). The salads are nice & worth the portion though.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113106022533222081293/reviews
Gayathri Prakasan,1,"0 star for customer service. I recently visited Kebab's Factory at SengKang Grand Mall and had a disappointing experience with the customer service. The staff member who took my order seemed rude and unfriendly. When I ordered the signature bowl, she asked me to specify the options in an abrupt tone. I felt that a more polite approach would have been to explain the available options. Additionally, when I asked for clarification on the price, there seemed to be a lack of clarity.
The staff member also didn't include the bill in the takeaway cover. However, I was fortunate to have another staff member intervene and assist me in a kind and helpful manner.Unfortunately, the staff member, an elderly woman, was extremely rude, warranting a 0-star review. I hope management takes this feedback seriously and addresses the issue to improve customer service.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105632351154467755693/reviews
