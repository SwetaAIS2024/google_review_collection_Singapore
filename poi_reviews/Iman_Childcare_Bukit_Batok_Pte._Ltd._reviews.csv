siti nuraini,1,"Went down on Sat to enquire, all seems good till the teacher went like we don’t shower the kids here  & we don’t allow parents to join on excursion.

I tried to call in on the following Mon & Tues and no one answered the phone.
I managed to get thru on Wed and talk to the centre admin.
I brought up to the admin about the no showering & how it should be made compulsory ( personal hygiene and all ).

I was surprised when she mentioned that the centre been practising this way ever since Covid???!!.
She even mentioned she will checked with the supervisor and get back to me.

It’s been almost a week plus and yet no update.

For the amount of monthly fees that this CC demand, it’s just a downside that we are not getting even the most basic thing - that is the showering part.

Other private CC - the monthly fees are a few hundreds lesser but they practise the basic hygiene still.

Overall - they really need to chg the no showering rules.
It’s totally ridiculous.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117089229239520435444/reviews
