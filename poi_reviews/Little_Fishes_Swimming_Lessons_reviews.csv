Vera S.,1,"I’ve shared this feedback with them via WhatsApp but did not get a response after a week. I also suspect many of Little Fishes reviews were bought and not from real customers.

“We left the class 5-10min in because my daughter was in distress and I did not feel that Steven had the patience to build trust with young children (my daughter is 2 and it was her first time meeting him + first swimming class in her life).

I wanted to let you know about my experience so that perhaps Little Fishes can help new children (and parents) ease into the experience in a more pleasant and sustainable manner:

1. Take the time to talk to parents and child. I was trying to introduce myself, my daughter and my husband to Steven but was kinda brushed off. He just said ""Ya Ya Ya let's start. Bring her into the water.""
I think especially with young kids, it's important to allow them to ease into the experience at their own pace, and it is also the trainer's responsibility to put in effort to build trust with students and parents. There was no briefing/explanation/expectation setting and he didn't even talk to my daughter (aka his student) but we immediately jumped into maneuvering my daughter.

2. Physically grabbing my daughter and moving her into specific positions right in front of me without asking for permission (which is why having a conversation before a first time's class is so important). Can you imagine if someone took you to a new place with new people who asked someone else (and also a male) to physically put you in a position and made you do something odd without any context?
I did talk to my daughter about going for swimming class, telling her let's listen to the instructor's instructions and try our best to follow, but I certainly did not expect to have someone force my daughter physically. He physically moved her (without my permission) when he obviously looked scared and uncomfortable. I'm pretty sure he didn't have ill intentions but I also think that he did all that from a place of impatience without considering what works best for the child.
Maybe a more constructive way to approach a first time student is to give them space to just observe the class first.

3. My daughter said ""no, I don't want"" multiple times in a very nervous way. In an unfamiliar situation with strangers, if she says no, it means that she's not comfortable, maybe she's scared and she is not just trying to be defiant. Steven just completely ignored her, and went ahead to physically maneuver her. Would he do that to an adult? Probably not, so why would he treat a child (in front of her parents) with less respect?

4. ⁠Steven said to me ""I need the cooperation of the child. If not, nothing can happen"". I totally agree with him, but I don't think that that is a realistic expectation for toddlers who he is meeting for the first time, in the first minutes of class. I'm not sure about Steven, but I certainly have not met a toddler who immediately embraces strangers.
He also mentioned ""no hugging"" multiple times - this could have been mentioned in a pre-class brief. (I'm sure my daughter is not the only toddler who does that), and perhaps he could share with parents ways to respond when the child clings on to them in class, and how Steven would work with the child who wants to cling on to their parents. My daughter was holding back tears and I am shocked that Steven seemed desensitized.
If he lacks the understanding, patience and skills to connect with toddlers, then maybe he should only be teaching older children and adults, not toddlers who are not as emotionally developed.”",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101106037729720200750/reviews
Karan Khinchi,5,"Been taking my kids to coach Steven for sometime now. They both were non-swimmer and now can swim independently and confidently. He blends the approach of being patient, funny and tough according to the situation and ability of the kid.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107990076560946912282/reviews
