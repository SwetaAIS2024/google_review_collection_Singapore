Josephine,5,"This was my second time at Hotel Equarius and it did not disappoint! The service was impeccable, and Alhan was delightful when he checked me in. He provided detailed information about Sentosa island and how to get around the island during my visit. He also took time to say hi and asked how my stay was, as I was walking by the front desk on numerous occasions. The pool was beautiful and the towel attendant had a great sense of humor. I wished I got his bane. The rooms are  huge and I loved waking every morning to the view of the forest and the cable cars. I highly recommend the hotel!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108824014189468632442/reviews
Jojo,5,"This is definitely one of the best hotel in Singapore! Great experience. Staffs are friendly and attentive, room is very spacious, transportation is made easier with shuttle bus, pool is clean and big, free mini bar with various drink options.

My girl vomitted at night as she wasn’t feeling well, and the cleaning service is so fast. The staffs are not frustrated that they have to clean at night, and they are so caring and concerned for my girl. Highly recommend this hotel. Nothing to complain about.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104022125856484020049/reviews
Faisal Almousa,5,"An excellent hotel with a strategic location near top attractions like Universal Studios, Water Park, and Sea Aquarium—must-visit destinations. The hotel offers a convenient shuttle service around the island, making transportation easy.

The staff was exceptionally helpful and welcoming. A special thanks to Ibrahim, who assisted me when I fell ill, quickly guiding me to the nearest clinic, accompanying me, and ensuring I received proper care. His kindness and professionalism were truly commendable. Highly recommended!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105760888186031054928/reviews
YT,5,"Stayed at this hotel for the first time, and it was an amazing experience. The hotel itself was really, really pretty and exceptionally clean. The service was absolutely tip-top, with staff who were friendly and attentive.

One of the highlights was the balcony outside our room. It wasn’t just big—it was really, really spacious, offering a beautiful view of the cable cars. The view made it such a relaxing spot to unwind.

The room was equally impressive—super spacious with a luxurious feel. The bathroom was large, featuring a nice bathtub, which was perfect for a relaxing soak after a long day.

Overall, the stay felt very luxurious, comfortable, and worth every penny. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a great hotel experience!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116335289933602715039/reviews
Amber Lee,5,"Nice hotel for staycation, have a huge gym and a pool too. The staff even made an effort to open the gym earlier just for me, kudos to the staff and service is excellent. A bit pricey though, the room service I ordered 5 bottles of tiger and it was around $101. But of course it is to be expected for a 5 star hotel and overall great stay!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105577754098553274789/reviews
