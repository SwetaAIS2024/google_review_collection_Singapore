Not much footfall but it distance to a nearby hdb estate helps in getting people to buy groceries. Just a small mall in bukit panjang. It is accessible with many bus services plying the mall.",

      "text": "I give this place 4 out of 5 stars. It does have the 5 stars potential but it is just that there the crowds are just not getting to this place for 1 reason - Sheng Siong is not too popular among the residences in both Teck Whye and Bukit Panjang but Mindchamps and Mr DIY should be enough to draw in those that prefer a quieter place to spend their money. However, this is definitely the place to go to for a lazy morning, weekday or weekends since it is just not as crowded as nearby Hillion Mall or Bukit Panjang Plaza, where most people prefer. Fun Toast is there with ample tables, Encik Tan, a Bakery with prices that are less than those of the 2 mentioned above. Lastly, the LRT station, Phoenix is convenient enough for most people.",
