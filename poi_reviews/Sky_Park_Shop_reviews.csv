Liliana Popa,4,"Marina Bay building inside you can find souvenirs of good value. Caps, key earrings, soft toys, post cards and different types of souvenirs.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114208148244315784808/reviews
Dave Glover,2,"PRETENTIOUS! Don't pay for skypark it is not worth it to be treated like a second class citizen. Just jump in any lift at the Sheares Link end of the building and hit level 57. There are viewing platforms, costs nothing. Amazing building and good views but very elitist and overpriced. Have a quick look and head to the beautiful gardens by the bay. Cloud dome is spectacular. Worth every cent",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106931129033320024694/reviews
