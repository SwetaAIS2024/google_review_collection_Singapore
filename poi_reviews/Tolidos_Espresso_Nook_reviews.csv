The brunch menu offers a variety of options, from classic dishes to unique creations. The **avocado toast** is a standout, perfectly ripe avocados on artisanal bread, topped with poached eggs and a sprinkle of chili flakes for a bit of heat. The **French toast** is another must-try, generously dusted with powdered sugar and served with fresh berries and maple syrup.

Melissa Eisner,5,"Was super craving a simple and yummy breakfast … so I hit up my list on Google Maps and chose @tolidosnook. This place has had awesome reviews and have wanted to go for a while.

Let’s start with the coffee - it was so well balanced. I got an oat milk iced latte and it hit the spot on this warm Singapore day. My friend ordered the peppermint mocha, and it was as Goldilocks says … just right. Not too sweet, no overpowering peppermint taste. Yum!

On to the food. If you’re a basic breakfast babe like myself, the classic eggs were great. Creamy and full of flavor, nice chicken sausage, crispy bacon and tasty baked beans that were not too sweet. If you like the kind of breakfast you don’t make at home, go for the shakshouka- rich in flavor, smoky, nice amount of sausage.

Waitstaff was helpful and great with service. I think this place will make the rotation!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117316308946167178763/reviews

CT,5,"Reached on a Saturday morning at about 11am. Waited for half an hour for seat.

Interesting menu with some special dishes. Ordered the rosti and tom yum scrambled toast. Flavourful and absolutely amazing to our liking. Thumbs up and I'll be back again for sure.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114311926943524656933/reviews
