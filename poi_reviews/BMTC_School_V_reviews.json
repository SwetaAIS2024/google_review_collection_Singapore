Kway teow soup with rice noodles was light but refreshing with fish balls and tofu, and without MSG as not thirsty after eating it.\n\nFor the first 2 weeks, lunches and dinners were so good and so much tastier than any civilian cai png with 2 meat/fish and vegetable (often brocoli and not the cheap type or cooked until mushy) and other varieties like Western food and Bak Kut Teh. It would have been 5 stars if not for airline bentos, which were literally made in China, during the 3rd week.",

      "text": "Holy cow the boomers really don't like it when quality-of-life improvements were up to the army lifestyle. \"Back in my time\" K.\n\nDo I think this camp is perfect? Obviously not, nothing is. But it's better than Tekong obviously. The trainers here *do* treat you like human, to say the least, and give the care that you'd need. That said, this is still an army camp, so there's obviously things and habits you need to change to fit to this lifestyle obviously (one that I myself can't even conform 100% because of some things that I don't agree with myself, but that's just an opinion)\n\nBunks have Wireless@SG WiFi, so you're good to go for any internet things, just note that it isn't 100% coverage for *all* of the camp though :)\n\nHonestly speaking, I kind of enjoyed my time here. Not a lot of regimentation, but that doesn't mean you can just laze around and not do anything. You still gotta be on your toes for the trainers and yourself obviously.\n\nThose that want to keng, it's up to them. Not my problem because it ain't me. You're just one step closer. Do what you have to do, or don't.\n\n(I would like to post photos, but obviously it ain't allowed Îµ:)",
