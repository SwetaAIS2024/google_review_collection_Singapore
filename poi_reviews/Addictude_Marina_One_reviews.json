      "text": "Yearning for a good sandwich on a Friday on end my work week. Googled and found this sandwich store at Marina One. Walk-in ordered over the counter, to avoid lunch buzz I decided to order for takeaway. Had an espresso that’s pretty good since I saw a good espresso machine La Marzocco. I bought the sandwich at 12.30pm, had the sandwich at home at 1.45pm, and it tasted good. The sandwich bread (Sourdough) was grilled to perfection (I can imagine if It was consumed fresh), and the filling was generous with sufficient cheese stuffed in it. They offer quite a few different sandwich type, egg mayo, Teriyaki, Hickory BBQ etc.. The service staffs were efficient. Overall service good.",

Although I am expecting melted cheese but it’s good enough. The coffee is really good, I drank 2 cups. Will definitely come back for more.",

The almond croissant may not have been very fresh. Good service by the staff who are efficient and polite. Price wise I paid $10 which would be on the high side.",
