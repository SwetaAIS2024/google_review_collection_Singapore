      "text": "Tiong Hoeâ€™s coffees maintain their standards with their friendly baristas with their nicely done brews. Even the tea has a timing for customers to know when to start sipping their teas.\n\nItâ€™s sometimes hard to find good bottled cold brews and their Amber Black tastes good (La Linda batch), not too diluted, as fragrant as you might find with a freshly made hand brew.\n\nItâ€™s definitely a delight for grocery shoppers, wished there were more room for seats. Iâ€™m always glad to spot a Tiong Hoeâ€™s coffee stand! Thanks for the lovely coffee always!",
