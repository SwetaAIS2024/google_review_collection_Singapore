      "text": "Handlebar: A Motorcycle Haven with Stellar Decor and Great Vibes\n\nRating:\n\n• Atmosphere: 5/5 (Cozy, inviting, and uniquely themed with a fantastic motorbike aesthetic)\n\n• Service: 5/5 (Attentive, friendly, and excellent)\n\n• Food: 4/5 (Above average food with a great variety of options)\n\n• Drinks: 4.5/5 (Vast beer selection, with 'Suicide Mug' a clear favorite)\n\nOverall: 4.5/5\n\nAlright folks, Handlebar, a long-standing Singaporean establishment, has relocated to Lock Road, but it retains its charm. Donkey remember its previous location in the Sembawang/Woodlands area, easily accessible to motorcyclists. This time, our friends and us visited the new Lock Road location to watch the MotoGP. We've been to Handlebar many times, and this visit solidified its place as a favorite.\n\nThe decor is truly outstanding, a five-star rating is well-deserved! The atmosphere is cozy and inviting, with a unique and extensive motorbike theme that permeates every corner, even the restrooms. The service was excellent, attentive, and friendly.  Their beer selection is vast with 'Suicide  Mug' being a clear favorite among regulars. We sampled a range of dishes from their menu, Guinness Draught, 1664, cheese fries, fried pork belly, and blossom onion rings, to name a few. While the food quality was above average, the extensive variety available is a major plus.\n\nIt's a fantastic place to relax with friends, especially if you appreciate motorbikes. The combination of great food, a unique atmosphere, excellent service, and a wide selection of beers makes Handlebar a highly recommended establishment.",

      "text": "Hidden within Gillman Barracks, this bar offers an unique experience for motorbike enthusiasts and curious visitors alike. The bike-themed decor is creative and immersive, with even the restrooms adding a quirky, memorable touch. The space is well-suited for a fun night out, with large screen perfect for catching live sports, especially soccer, over drinks with friends. There's ample seating, both indoors and alfresco, making it easy to settle in and enjoy the atmosphere.\n\nThe staff were genuinely welcoming and attentive, which added to the relaxed, homey vibe. However, the food fell short of expectations. Dishes like the BBQ ribs, fish burger, and fried cod fritters were either too greasy or overly glazed, making them heavy and unappealing. Unfortunately, the meal detracted from what could have been a perfect evening, as I found myself losing my appetite as I ate.",
