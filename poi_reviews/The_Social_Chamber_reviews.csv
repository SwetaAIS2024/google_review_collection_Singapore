Terence Ng,1,"A VERY VERY DISAPPOINTING EXPERIENCE.

Need to share this with everyone who decided to come to this place.

On 14th Feb, me and my partner made two bookings for two different room.

A one hour for 11pm.
Another 12am-9am package.

Me and my partner reach that day around 11:30 and we went ahead to unlock the room but failed dud to the system error, but we hear noise inside and knock on it,  for the first booking only to find out that there is a customer inside. When we spoke with the customer we are let known that the customer was previously from another room beside and got switched over to ours BY THE STAFF.

Staff allowing this type of scenario when the system should be able to check that there is a booking. Does that make sense to all of you that possibly considering to go for their service? Even in the scenario that me and my partner was late, the room shouldn’t even be allowed to switch out since We already paid for it to reserve.

Red flag #1.

On to the red flag #2, at 12:05 we went to another room for our booking and tried unlocking  it, but failed to. Heard noise inside again and knocked. Finding another customer inside who mentioned that they have a booking until 1. What’s this nonsense? If it was occupied they could have clearly stop or assign another room when I’m booking online.

Red flag #3,

Very unresponsive management. Text them at 12:04am, only to receive a reply the next day at 1PM. Send them an email also, but yet to receive a reply.

Red flag #4,

Management is blaming the whole issue on it being unmanned centre and I have to knock. Which I did, but the system is overlapped in their bookings.  So if there is a system overlap on that day, I have to wait? Just because my booking is 12-9? I only book it value for money.  I asked for a refund but they push away the option of it and used their non-refundable policy. Which is to me, ridiculous.

They did however offered an extension of package but would you dare to waste your time with your partner in fear of system being overlapped again? Make your own decisions and spend your money wisely.

I have. attached all the screenshots for your references to judge the situation",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117353119650155552810/reviews
