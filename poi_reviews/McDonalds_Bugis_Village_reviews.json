However, if you're looking for a quieter, more spacious dining experience, you might prefer other McDonald's branches or nearby cafes.\n\nThank you, God Bless",

It’s much better option for me with sufficient seats and comfy enough spots to enjoy a dine-in meal. Staff are all very friendly and cheerful. My meal was prepared in less than 10mins during a peak hour and I could find seats. They also recently renovated the space so it’s definitely much spacious and also organized in a way.",

      "text": "We visited McDonald's at Bugis Village on 21 February 2025, at 1.45pm. When we entered the store, a waitstaff was assisting an elderly customer in front of us with the self-service kiosk. Even though we ordered self-collect, because there was a lot of food, a staff served our food to us. After we were done eating, she helped us clear our table and asked us how our experience was.\n\nOur experience was fantastic. Even though the store was busy, we received our dine-in order quickly. Our dine-in experience was enjoyable. The seats were spaced far enough apart to where I didn't feel claustrophobic. Moreover, the seating area was clean and the pick-up counter, tidy.\n\nWe even made a couple special requests to our burgers, and all were fulfilled to the tee. The fries were prepared perfectly, not too soggy but also not too dry. I also liked the limited time Ovaltine McFlurry from the store. They served a generous portion of ice cream and mixed the crunch topping into the ice cream evenly.\n\nThank you to the staff at this McDonald's for making our day!",

Despite the crowd, I managed to enjoy a super delicious McSpicy along with some sides and drinks. Singapore really does McSpicy better. Luckily, I was able to secure a spot to sit, which felt like a win in such a packed place!",
