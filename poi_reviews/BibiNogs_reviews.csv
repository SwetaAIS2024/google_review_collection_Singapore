Janice Tan,5,"My LO and I attend the parent accompanied Mandarin Babes class twice a week, 1.25h/session. Love the teachers as they are all very friendly and enthusiastic. My LO always looks forward to the class. I was so impressed that I signed up for their 3 hour programme, 4 times a week for the following year.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101119883907062697248/reviews
