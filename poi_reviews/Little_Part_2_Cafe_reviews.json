Service was abit lagging due to manpower shortage but we expected that since it's mother's day.  But good effort from the waiter to make good as much as he can. See him running around and trying his best to serve. Will go back for sure.",

The lamb was perfectly cooked and the mint sauce a very nice accompaniment. The shepherds pie had generous meat, corn and carrots and tasted great. The mash on top was just a touch dry.  The drinks selection is quite wide for alcoholic and they have unique choices for non-alcoholic. The service was fantastic, friendly and quick. Overall a great place! We will come back.",

      "text": "I had high hopes for this place, especially after reading all the positive reviews, but my experience was far from satisfying. I decided to try the calamari rings, and for $12, the portion was incredibly small‚Äîonly about 4-5 little pieces. The calamari itself was a huge letdown. It wasn‚Äôt crispy or fragrant as I expected; instead, it was rubbery and soggy, making it unpleasant to eat. For $12, I would have expected much better quality, especially considering how tiny the portion was. üòû\n\nThe truffle fries were another disappointment. I was looking forward to enjoying that classic truffle flavor, but the fries had no taste of truffle at all. Instead, the truffle oil was mixed into a mayonnaise dip on the side, which was confusing and not what we were expecting. We don‚Äôt like mayo with our fries and were hoping for the fries to be covered in truffle oil, not to have to dip them for the flavor. To make things worse, the mayo itself barely had any truffle flavor. Paying $18 for what was essentially plain fries with a side dip that lacked flavor just didn‚Äôt seem worth it.\n\nOverall, the quality and portions of the food were disappointing, especially given the price point. I really expected a lot better.\n\nFor spending close to $90 for a meal, the experience wasn‚Äôt enjoyable or worth the price. Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to others.",
