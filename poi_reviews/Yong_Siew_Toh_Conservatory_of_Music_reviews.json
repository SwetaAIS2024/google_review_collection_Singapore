The lighting and accoustics enlivened the performance.\n\nThe first row of seats at the balcony (row AA) had an obstructed viewing due to the metal bars in front. Unfortunately this information is not being communicated on their booking map, so watch out!",

      "text": "I cried at the last piece of music performance...\n\nIt was one of those journeys of life where I picked one of the students from the school. She (Ms Sim) was on the way for her class and she shared to me that she was performing in the Asian Civilisation Museum. A small ensemble and I just can't miss it.\n\nI think it was divine appointment when I checked the website there are 4 tickets left. I quickly booked one and then decided to stop working and went home to cleaned myself up. Later, I checked the same website, all the tickets are gone.\n\nWhen the students start playing, instantly I was totally drawn into the music. Every pieces of music performed on that afternoon were marvellous, some classics of the 1800s and pre war music.\n\nIt was then the last piece by Kevin McKee - iron horse that has impacted me deeply. It was so moving and it brought tears to my eyes. I have been so moved by music before. Bravo to the school, teachers and students.",

But was shock and taken back that being a conservatory hall at NUS , a clearly spoilt TV was broadcasting the live festival for those international participants while waiting outsideâ€¦ very disappointed on that.",
