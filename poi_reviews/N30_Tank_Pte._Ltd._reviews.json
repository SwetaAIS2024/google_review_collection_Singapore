Was quick to replace it and brought the media and glass the next day. The installers were very experienced and professional. No pushing for reviews unlike other companies that skew reviews in their favor.",

      "text": "I've bought several customized tanks from N30 over the years. These have been 5 foot to 6 feet including sump and cabinet. I've always been happy with the workmanship--including the cabinetry. It's best to email them first and then go down with some planning, eg position of tank, dimensions, can it fit through your door? etc. N30's always been attentive but I don't expect a first time aquarium keeper's education from them. My tank is still with me. I've even engaged them for heavy duty shelving to store 8 x 2ft plywood sheets--including with rollers--heavy duty stuff. They're a good choice for customized tanks.",
