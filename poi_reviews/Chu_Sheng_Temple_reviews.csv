Bernard Ng,5,Avery big and beautiful temple housing many different deities. Very crowded during the end and beginning of the year where people pray to Tai Sui for protection and good luck. It is certainly worth a visit.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101880648598605916152/reviews
Low Soon Kuan,4,I like the place as it is near my flat. There are a lot of people worshipping there during first and fifteen day of Chinese calendar. They offer vegetables meals on these days too. They give out red packets to seniors in this area. They give out scholarship to students in the neighborhood too. Sometimes they show Chinese wayang at special occasion like Chinese New year or mid- autumn festival. Good for residents and their families.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114238281415823050127/reviews
