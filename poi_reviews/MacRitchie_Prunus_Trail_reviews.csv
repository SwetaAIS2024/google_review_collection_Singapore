Forest BK,5,"🍂Prunus Trail is a shorter version of the Petai Trail.
🍁The Prunus Trail starts near the entrance of the MacRitchie Nature Trail and manders along the MacRitchie Reservoir water edge.
🍂Meandering against the forest backdrop, the trail's surrounding is rich in biodiversity of the catchment's secondary forest, including the Simpoh Air and Sendudok plants.
🍂Hikers are treated to the views of the water body and people kayaking.
🍁The scenic trail is shady and cooling with the occasional breeze.
Fun fact:
🍁Simpoh Air a.k.a CB leaf is found in secondary forest in tropical Southeast Asia.
🍁Before plastic bags were in use, the leaves of Simpoh Air were widely used as food wrappers.
🍁They can still be found in use on some food, for example, tempeh.
🍁The seeds of the Sendudok are used in the famous ""Poh Chai"" pill 保濟丸 to treat diarrhoea in the Chinese traditional medicine.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Ashar Malik,5,I have rated this place as easy - but it really depends on the weather. Windy day is good to visit - otherwise it’s incredibly humid. Mosquito sprays and sun screen is recommended. The trail is amazing - helps get away from the urban Singapore to get a feel for nature. All trails around the central green area including this are definitely recommended.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116290833534624404519/reviews
Alexander Reinaldo,5,"Easy to Medium (when wet after rain) Trail, yet offers serene and peaceful ambience with lots of greeneries, you go with high pace and when tired, just stop and rest at the bench situated along the trail and enjoy the gentle breese and relaxing waves.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108446373348289716691/reviews
Kevin M,5,"Great views and can normally see some wildlife along the trail. It is a boardwalk off the ground that connects to the longer MacRatchie reservoir trail. Follows along the waters edge. The Prunus Trail is about 2km, but can be combined with other trails to be longer. I go here often to start my hikes.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106594784695526480551/reviews
blackcoupe,5,"A shaded boardwalk with beautiful views of lush tropical forest and waters of the reservoir. The trial is very well maintained and suitable for both old folks and children. People are strolling along, while some are having a jog. If we observe carefully, sightings of monkey, tortoise, squirrel, birds, and even wild boars are possible. It is a good trail to spend for an hour so strolling in nature. The Prunus Trail leads to Petai Trail after 1km plus from entrance of the trail.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117507784141300452476/reviews
