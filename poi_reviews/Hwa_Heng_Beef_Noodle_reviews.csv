Alvin Li,4,"Pleasant surprise to find Hwa Heng here as my mum is bugging me to bring her eat HKM.

My previous experience with Hwa Heng was at Bendeemer, so that was a while back.

I must have forgotten but the small bowl is already substantial. We got the mixed beef bowl, which comes with beef balls, beef slices, beef tripes and beef shank.

Food was at the right temperature and the caramelised soup was flavourful and sweet.

It was then I realised that this coffeeshop used to be 'smaller'? Because I spotted my Thai wanton mee nearby.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101636040394390892825/reviews
Junius Chng,1,"I was excited to eat the beef noodles as I saw somebody else eating it and the soup looked delicious. However, when I bought a bowl of Beef Noodles Soup, the beef was hard to chew and the soup was tasteless and bland, almost dilited with water or something.

My mum ordered the Beef Noodles Dry and the gravy in the noodles was too thick and the noodles were just so-so.

I don't recommend buying this. Take your business elsewhere.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108725847050683182097/reviews

Catherine Lim,5,"This newly opened Hwa Heng Beef Noodle outlet is located in Blk 134 new coffee shop within 10 minutes of walking distance from Jurong East MRT (Exit A) near the CPF Building.

I was pleasantly surprised that a 'small' bowl of $9.50 of Signature Mixed Beef Noodle was generously served with slices of beef, beef balls, thick tendon and tripes, bean sprout,  with some salted vegetable and peanuts.  I had to share with my niece who is a bigger consumer... It works out to $4.75 per person - Value for our money!

It is a balanced and nutritious meal, as beef enriches blood and strengthen muscles. Tendon is good for joints n firming complexion too!

The fragrant herbal soup was steaming hot and delicious. We asked for an extra  bowl of soup which was given FREE!

The young staff serving us was very friendly, courteous and has excellent customer service!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102013336552452788788/reviews
