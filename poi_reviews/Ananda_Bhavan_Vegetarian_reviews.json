      "text": "This south india food place is in the Changi Business Park area. Very close to MRT station, Park Avenue Hotel.\n\nThe south combo tastes good. Idly, sambar and vada all tasted good.\n\nThe service team is average. A combination of self-service and delivery to the table. One needs to place an order at the counter. A person will deliver the food to the table but not things like coffee, water, cutlery etc. They gave me tea even after explicitly asking for coffee at the counter. Lack of attention by the counter staff.\n\nThe price is good. The breakfast combo is economical.",

Even hot water was required to be paid when requested for. Pathetic service",

Food is hygiene and healthy.\n\nOne good and opportunity is they provide plenty of Chutney and Sambar, some are wasting. They can ask and provide or keep a small volumes at each table to avoid food.\n\nStaff are excellent they are humble and courteous.",

Noticed this on couple of my visits. Seems they are exhausted. Believe either good rest (if that doesn’t happen) or training to serve with a simple smile would be helpful. Don’t get me wrong, there are few staff who are eager to help and serve.( My observation- the ones who are not in the regular uniform are better, but am not sure what’s at play here. They might either be part timer staff or upper management .)\n\nAlbeit that -good place to have nice vegetarian food in SG.",
