Sagar S,4,"Cendex centre is good. Economical tea,  coffee in huge quantities.  However for newbees, the smell in the hawker market is very bad. For the people used to it,  it's nice,  cheap and cost effective.  Overall a visit to this centre will not be regretted. Can visit when free.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112033768221185162446/reviews
