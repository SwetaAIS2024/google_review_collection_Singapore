S C,5,I think this place sells pretty good chicken cutlet! I bought the set at SGD7.80. Was pleasantly surprised that the chicken cutlet tasted good even on its own. It was marinated well. The garlic bread was v fragrant and buttery and the other sides were good as well!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111642671544096036079/reviews
Eric Wong,5,"Visited on 1 Sep 2022 for lunch and ordered the chicken chop rice.. pleasantly surprised that the rice has a deep aroma similar to pineapple rice.. really tasty, but a bit pricey at $7.80",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117691308830861443080/reviews
CCS,3,"Absolutely, THE BEST, in this ulu corner of Western Singapore.

Their menu's variety of fried chicken will satisfy most cravings. Their unbelievably low prices will surprise everyone. Their service - super quick and super friendly   - will make the queuing and raucous hordes of beer guzzling uncles bearable.

Yes. The environment of the coffee shop is, umm, PG21 on weekend evenings after 7pm.

Support these young men. They deserve their success.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
Hanafiah Wahid,1,"Not very pleasant staff for a place with food that’s pretty good.
On first account, after ordering, was left standing there with staff not acknowledging whether he’s taking the order or not. Everyone was given a device that would ping them when their order was ready but I was left standing in confusion.
On second account, he doesn’t even acknowledge me after taking my order l. After 10 mins of standing by the store trying to get my order in, I decided to just not bother. Don’t know what his deal is but could definitely tell he doesn’t want to take my order when everyone else’s order way keyed into the POS but not mine.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109010759935932903956/reviews
