Ivine Ong,5,"We are incredibly grateful to Dr. Ho for his expertise and care in treating our daughter, who had been suffering from persistent nerve pain in the elbow since 2022. Despite multiple consultations with a pain specialist at a public hospital and being prescribed medication, we were never given a clear diagnosis and treatment plan.

Through a recommendation from the ward staff, we were referred to Dr. Ho — and we’re so thankful we followed through. During our very first consultation, Dr. Ho was able to accurately diagnose her condition as Cubital Tunnel Syndrome. His patience in listening to our concerns, and his clear explanation of the condition and treatment options, gave us much-needed clarity and confidence on the way forward.

Dr Ho has made a difficult journey much easier for our daughter, and we highly recommend him to anyone in need of a knowledgeable and caring specialist.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114725934617550811647/reviews

Christina Chan,5,"Experienced pain in my lower body for a few months which did not improve after a couple of visits to the GPs. Subsequently, went to Dr Diana and she was able to diagnose the root cause (degenerating and slipped disc) and recommend treatments to prevent the pain from affecting my daily life. Felt safe in her care and got treated with nerve root injection and pulse radiofrequency. Would definitely recommend Dr Diana.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101093481507531200552/reviews
