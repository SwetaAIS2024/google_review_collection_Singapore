Lift to get to all floors, reception desk is on level 2 with friendly staff that have good knowledge of Singapore. Very close to lots of restaurants and a couple of shopping centre's. Not a luxury hotel but very good for the price. Free WiFi (need a code when you check in) and air conditioning both worked well and were much appreciated, room has a small fridge as well.",
