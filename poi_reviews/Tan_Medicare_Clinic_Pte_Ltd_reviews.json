      "text": "I only went to this doctor because he was one of the GP under my company's insurance policy. I dreaded visiting him because of all the bad past experiences my family had with him. Nevertheless, it was my first time visiting him and yeah, such a bad experience. I came in with a bad sore throat and some body aches. He took an ART on me and he literally was stabbing my nostrils. I've done ART at regional centres before so I knew how the ART is supposed to be done. Definitely not like how he does it. Then came the consultation, he just swiftly sweep through listening my breathing through a stethoscope which barely rests on my chest for 1s. I wasn't even breathing that hard. And I was shocked when he didn't even bother to check my throat for any inflammation. The medication I got prescribed were (1) lozenges, (2) muscle ache medicine and (3) runny nose medicine. FYI, I didn't have any runny nose!! And there was no throat inflammation reduction medication or cough medicine. And here I am leaving this review and coughing. Now I have to resort to seeing another doctor. I highly DO NOT recommend visiting him.",

My father had a heart attack and went to see this doctor, but the doctor didn't even call an ambulance or anything.\n\nAnd regarding ART test for COVID, it was not stated that art test is not covered under company insurance, and it costs $20 per test? That's ridiculous. Highly unethical price gouging.",

The 2 receptionists are super helpful to help me check whether I could claim under my company's panel of clinics as it was my 1st visit to this clinic after shifting house. The entire consultation process was v pleasant and fast as I reached before the clinic reopened their 2nd session after lunch. Was in so much pain when I visited the clinic so thankfully the consultation process was smooth.",

Nevertheless, the headsup was appreciated.\n\nThe reason why the queue is so long is because Dr. Tan was spending the time to explain to the patient the illness.\n\nI appreciate the service.",
