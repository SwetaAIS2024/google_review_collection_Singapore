Marc Singh,3,"unfortunately, not a great dining experience here. the last i visited was maybe 2 or 3 years back and i really enjoyed it, i feel standards have dropped off ever since. the crispy hamburger tacos in particular were very bland and had no flavour/seasoming whatsoever. everything else, including the sushi rolls, were average in terms of flavour and quality. service however was decent, and i quite like the ambience and decor of the place.

personally, i would visit again to try the other dishes and hopefully this was just a one off experience.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111474566471418870196/reviews
Edward Leong,5,"We were looking for a place to have lunch for my wife’s birthday and wanted to try something different. While in the Orchard area, we decided on Tanuki Raw.

I ordered the famous Beef & Beef Tongue Tanuki Bowl set, while my wife had the curry set. Both sets came with miso soup and salad. The beef was flavorful, though I found the slices a bit on the thin side.

Overall, the atmosphere was nice, and the food was solid comfort Japanese cuisine. Free-flow tap water was available, but we also ordered a passion fruit tea, which was refreshing. A good spot for a casual meal!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111383115996077609476/reviews
YT,5,"I’ve walked past this restaurant many times while in Somerset but never went in until just a few days ago. I’m glad I finally gave it a try! We ordered the beef don, salmon don, and curry chicken katsu, and everything was really, really good. The flavors were spot on, and each dish had its own unique appeal.

The interior of the restaurant is minimalistic, yet stylish. I especially liked the bar area situated near the dining space but away from the kitchen—gave the place a nice, relaxed vibe. The staff were really friendly, which added to the pleasant experience. Plus, the restaurant has a great view, making it even more enjoyable to dine in.

One downside is that the prices are a little on the pricier side, but overall, it’s definitely worth it for the quality of food and the overall experience.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116335289933602715039/reviews
Faye D,5,"We walked in on a Friday evening without any reservations and the staff got us a table quickly without hesitation. The service is excellent, no complaints at all. They were very attentive, polite and thoughtful. They also engaged in some banter which was a refreshing thing to experience in local customer service.

We gave feedback that the burgers need a bit more seasoning, and this feedback they gladly took with humility and gratitude, without sounding defensive. Other than the burgers lacking some extra salt, everything else tasted very good. We also ordered burger tacos and mentaiko fries, and cocktails.

The place is cozy with enough tables and acoustics seemed ok. The restaurant is close to the mall’s public washrooms which was quite convenient.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117512748362444652085/reviews
