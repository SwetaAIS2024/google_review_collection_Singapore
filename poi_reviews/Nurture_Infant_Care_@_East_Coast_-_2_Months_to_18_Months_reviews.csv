claire gomez,5,"The teachers and staff here are simply amazing! So patient, engaging and attentive to the babies, especially my baby's favourite teachers Gina and Sharon. The routine care is excellent (diapering, feeds), and the fun activities are carefully planned and executed - not usually done for infant care but carried out excellently here. When my baby first came at 4 months old she was rejecting bottle feeding even at home, but the staff patiently syringe fed and spoon fed her milk until she eventually took the bottle, greatly easing my worries. The regular photo updates are a lovely bonus too. My baby loves coming to school and I know she's well taken care of!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110137134742381011849/reviews

CMT Events,5,"Our daughter attended Nurture Infant House @ East Coast last year, and we had a fantastic experience! The registration process was smooth, and Ms. Lyn was incredibly accommodating and welcoming, making us feel at ease from the start. Elsa settled down almost instantly, which speaks volumes about the caring and attentive teachers. We also loved receiving daily photo updates of her activities, which reassured us that she was happy and engaged. Highly recommend this center to any parents looking for a warm and nurturing environment for their little ones!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103711486078047581526/reviews

Melvyn Leong,5,"This infant care may be smaller brand as compare to the larger, more established brands in the east, but it truly shines with its exceptional team of teachers and premium care quality. The administration is seamless, and the communication between the school and parents is managed remarkably well. Since transferring our child here, I’ve had absolutely no complaints. The level of care and cleanliness consistently exceeds our expectations. I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone considering it—look no further!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111128197534464313448/reviews
