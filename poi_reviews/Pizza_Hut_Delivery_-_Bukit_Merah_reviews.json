However, when I arrived about 5 minutes late for collection, the food wasnâ€™t warm at allâ€”it felt cool to the touch. It seems the food might have been prepared too far in advance to manage the crowd, which was disappointing. The pizza had hardened, making the experience less enjoyable. I hope they can improve this for future peak periods.",
