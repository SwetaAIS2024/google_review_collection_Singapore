ABDULRAHMAN ALTURKI,5,"had an excellent stay at this hotel. The property features a unique and sustainable design, and the rooms were very clean and comfortable.
The service was professional and prompt, with friendly and helpful staff.
The location is ideal, as it’s close to major attractions and events, making it easy to get around and enjoy the trip.
I highly recommend staying here, whether for leisure or business.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102574571898698613089/reviews
Didem Yıldırım,5,"We believe Organic Hotel is one of the best places to stay in Singapore. It’s a clean, elegant, and nature-themed hotel. Our room had everything we needed, and the view was quite beautiful. The location was very central — within walking distance to metro stations and shopping malls. We had no issues with transportation or getting around. The most surprising thing for us was that plastic bottles were not allowed inside the hotel. Since we visited during an earthquake period, the pool was closed, but they offered to take us to another hotel if we wanted to swim. However, we were more focused on exploring Singapore, so we didn’t really miss it. The only downside was the breakfast, which was quite weak compared to the rest of the experience.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115987040548064814705/reviews
Rhys Burmann,5,"I mean is this place really have to be reviewed? It's amazing. Everything about it is amazing. The rooms are super luxury. The pool area and the spa, my first spot event of my life, was spectacular. The location is great. You don't really need to leave the hotel to have a great dinner. And the buffet. OMFG the buffet was stupid crazy. Great place accommodating service everyone was on point with the service. And of course you can't beat their ethos for a five-star hotel with a ethos of theirs of Social and sustainability it's really good",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111692744668134326644/reviews
Sonia McMaster,5,"After flying in from London, the Park Royal Pickering was a welcome place to spend a couple of nights to break up a longer travel period.  As we had booked well in advance and fixed up the account, upgrades were applied.  Staff were friendly, incredibly helpful and responsive.  Room service meals were nice with quick service and this is available until 11pm.  After 11pm, there is a supper menu through to the morning.  Short walk to Chinatown and markets.  Many shopping and dining options close by.  Hotel's infinity pool was lovely for a cool dip and while I didn't use it, there was a good gym available as well.  Really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102856457445583204400/reviews
Daisy Chan,5,I like the lime restaurant here. There is a buffet at noon and the dishes are very rich. The atmosphere is also very good. It is right next to the china town point and the subway is very convenient.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108242334498009274302/reviews
