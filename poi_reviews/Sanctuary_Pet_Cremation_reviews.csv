Penny Chia,5,"I wanted to share a review and also thank the Sanctuary Pets team for supporting us through the process of my dog's final journey across the rainbow bridge.
The service levels were very professional yet compassionate and attentive (without being overbearing) at the same time.
The tranquil environment made this difficult time much more manageable for me and my family. üôèüôè
We like that there were birds in the background, singing the final song for my dog.
The post cremation process was done with alot of care and none of it felt rushed. A shout out to Rachel and Russell who helped me with the process.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101498175644493859870/reviews

Mingli Fong,5,"Dear Russel and the Sanctuary Pet Cremation Team,

Thank you so much for the care and professionalism you showed during Paco‚Äôs cremation on 14 May 2025. It meant a lot to our family to know he was in such good hands.

Paco was with us for over 14 years and saying goodbye wasn‚Äôt easy‚Äîbut your warmth, respect, and thoughtful service made a difficult day just a little bit easier for all of us.

We really appreciate everything you did.

With gratitude,
The Fong Family",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114592992456446373017/reviews
victorinawoon,5,"It has been close a month since my experience with Sanctuary Pet Cremation, and while I'm still recovering from my grieve, I'd still want to take the chance to thank the team for being so respectful and professional in the way the whole process as handled.
From the very beginning of arranging for a vet to my place, to the collection and subsequently the cremation process, everything has been very well handled and there has never been any pressure or rush from the team which I was really surprised.
Hence I feel that they deserve this review based on the end to end experience I had with them.
I'd highly recommend them if anyone is looking for a wonderful team who can help with the rainbow journey for your beloved pet",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100628758586221096393/reviews
