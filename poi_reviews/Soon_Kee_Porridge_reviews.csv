Charlene and Serwin,3,"It's decent teochew fare. Portions were not big so I would consider it to be fairly pricey for the amount paid. Quality was so-so.. good thing is extra bowl of porridge cost only 40c. Free but limited parking on site, but visitors clear quite fast. Btw they changed name to Soon Soon?",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107974447753826801541/reviews
Noel Ong,3,"Inconsistent pricing.

Paid $3.60 for 1 meat + 2 veg

Came a month after and paid $6.40 for 1 meat + 1 egg + 1 veg

How is the increase of $3 for an additional meat justifiable?

Food quality is sub-par. Better teochew porridge options around the area.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110863565134207388932/reviews
Boon Chong Tan,3,"There's a variety of selection for teochew porridge. Standard had dropped but still taste alright if you are craving for it when you are near the area.

Daron TNG,5,"Teochew style porridge with options of steam fishes and other dishes ðŸ˜‹ reasonably priced as well. Satisfying the crave.

PS. It's located in a coffee shop, this should be the expectations of the 'service and atmosphere'.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103933534662286887940/reviews
Ann Tan,3,"Soon Kee porridge is located along thomson road and they are famous for their steam fish in teochew style. The fish they served is fresh and tasty. They are also famous for their braised pork belly. Unfortunately, the vegetables they cook are too oily including their fried eggs. Car park is small and limited hence it's a challenge to eat there if u drive. Not convenient for handicapped as it is a very old coffee shop, it doesn't come equipped with handicapped parking lot nor path.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109266329925822226338/reviews
