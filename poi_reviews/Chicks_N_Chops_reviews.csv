Leo Lee,5,"Old-school Western food with a nostalgic, home-cooked vibe! I tried their grilled chicken chop, it's $6.5. I really enjoyed the grilled 'hey'â€”it had that slight crunch from the grill that I love. The portions are generous, and the prices are reasonable!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100662117956023313720/reviews
Alvin Mah,4,"If you like your chicken chop on the drier side like me, then this stall maybe what you are looking for. The chicken chop is old school Hainanese style, lightly covered in flour but still very crispy. The sweet and sour sauce with onions and pineapples is simply the perfect match. Not too sweet or bland. For this amount of serving at $5.50 today (Dec'22), I think it's quite reasonable compared to most other western food stalls. Please do be patient because the stall is operated only by one person.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101731562623200370370/reviews
Shaolin Leong,4,"Grill chicken chop & fish and chips are my daughter's favorite ! $6.50 a set no charge for container.
Their fries are crispy too ! Even when packed !! Much better than McDonald's !
Price is reasonable in current context!
Owners have been in Empress Market for at least 35-40 over years.
Currently there are 3 western food stalls in our market each has their own specialty!!! Lucky me ! Closed on Monday.
The cleanest oil ! Unlike ...........let's not mention names !",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116211953093285724040/reviews
Marcus Ang,5,"pretty great for hawker-western standards. chicken cutlet's batter is airy and crispy, well seasoned and best of all theres no oil residue from the fry.

comes with a tangy tomato sauce which resembles the sweet and sour pork sauce from the tze char sauce, thou we find it slightly overpowering the fragrance of the chicken.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111145722549856734783/reviews
