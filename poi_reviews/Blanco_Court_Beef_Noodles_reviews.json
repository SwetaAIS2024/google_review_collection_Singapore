      "text": "Kitty and I were craving a late night bite after our trip back from Malaysia. We decided to stop by Blanco Court Beef Noodles, which is located in a coffee shop near our house. We were intrigued by the stall since it was a recent addition to the coffee shop after a renovation, and it seemed like a great place to grab a quick and satisfying meal.\n\nI ordered the Superior Beef Noodles, which came with braised and blanched beef slices. Kitty opted for the Beef Steak Noodles.\n\nThe food was tasty and cooked well. The beef steak was perfectly medium-rare, and the noodles were flavorful. However, the prices at Blanco Court were a bit steeper than what we're used to at other coffee shops. The price may be even higher than the food court. While the food didn't quite wow us, it was definitely a satisfying meal.\n\nWe appreciated the fact that the coffee shop is open 24 hours, making it a convenient spot for a late-night snack or supper. The stall also  provided a chinchero condiment for us to dip our beef or add to our noodles, which complemented the flavours nicely.  One suggestion for improvement would be to add more bean sprouts to the noodles.  It would really enhance the flavour and texture of the dish.\n\nOverall, Blanco Court Beef Noodles is a good option for a quick and satisfying meal, especially if you're craving a late night bite. We enjoyed the food and the convenience of the 24-hour coffee shop, but the slightly higher prices and the lack of bean spouts from this stall kept it from earning a full 5 stars.",

The soup was flavorful, though it wasn’t served piping hot. I added extra beef balls, but they seemed a bit pricey at $3 for 2. The chicken wings were freshly cooked, served hot, and delicious.",
