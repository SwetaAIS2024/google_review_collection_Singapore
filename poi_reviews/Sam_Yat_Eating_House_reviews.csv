Tan Bak Hai,3,"I recently stopped by and was a bit let down by the dim sum, which didn’t taste as fresh as I had hoped. Also noticed that the coffee is now priced at $1.50 — a bit on the higher side for a simple coffee shop setting. I appreciate the atmosphere, but I hope the quality and pricing can be revisited.

Reyno Christian,5,"I came here after visiting the Chinese Garden, ordered Kopi O Kosong Hot and Iced, 2 Eggs and tried the Tiong Bahru snack beside the aunty coffee stall.

Not so long as the rain was coming, hot coffee and half boiled eggs were a perfect combination for that morning.

Bizley,1,"TOTALLY AWFUL EXPERIENCE!!! 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻

Visited on 19 Mar for breakfast w/ my family of 3. Due to comfort reasons, my 2 yo child prefers to sit on an (adult) chair instead of a child seat.

Halfway through our meal, the staff informed that we need to sit separately, I complied as the staff were strictly following instructions (from my conversation w/ 2 aunties, they claimed that they're instructed by the boss).

I also saw a similar situation where 3 young patrons were asked to sit separately when one of them was pulling a chair to the table. Kudos on the good enforcement efforts by the (strictly following instructions) auntie.

While leaving, I saw a similar sitting arrangement w/ a family of 3 but NOTHING was done by the staff.

Due to my unpleasant experience of facing double standards & selective scrutiny, I went to raise my case to a staff of such malpractice.

Sadly, the reason I was given was ""I don't know which staff told you to sit separately"". I then asked the auntie if the family would need to wait for the (enforcer) staff to appear?!?! as the ""boss's instructions"" were clear as daylight. After saying my piece, I left as not wanting to make a scene as the aunties can't and doesn't want to react to (individual) situations than follow a scripted guide of the ""boss's instructions"".

I've always liked the coffee at this joint but after today's experience I'm adamant that today's bitter aftertaste would stay for a very long time.

If our cravings for dim does arises, I'm pretty sure this would no longer be our preferred  choice.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100088118189646789432/reviews
