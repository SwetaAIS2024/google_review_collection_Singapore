Update review: True they were nice but i once called them to make an appointment and this lady was super rude. Two of them actually. Super super rude. Donâ€™t work as a frontliner if you canâ€™t respect & be nice.",

DrDenas is always so calm, welcoming and reassuring, providing sound advices and although he doesnt deliver my babies (as he's not based at my usual hospital), his diagnosis and scans are always very accurate.\ngrateful to have him and the team around in this neighbourhood :)",
