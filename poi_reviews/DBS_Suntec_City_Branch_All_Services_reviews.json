Just to add a name to my savings account I need to make an appointment personally at the branch & the next available appointment is the next day! Which means we have to go to the bank twice just for transactions. It’s crazy totally not acceptable. There’s also no way to make this appointment online or over the phone. Why do they have to make it so inconvenient for their clients?",

I was just trying to explain to them my school told me when I asked about applying for DBS bank account said I really didn’t need a written letter for DBS and I could use other documents. The lady decided to cut me off when I spoke and spoke in a manner that was patronizing and mean, saying you will immediately fail the application. When I asked for clarification, she seemed extremely impatient",
