Hting Khoo,3,"Many board games, small place. Do make a reservation beforehand. Was there from 12.50pm to 4.10pm on Sunday, $12 per person ($3 an hour) Started getting more crowded around 1+/2pm. Slightly difficult to find the location as the blocks are close together. Not original games. Players tend to take off their masks here.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108611523918295000126/reviews
