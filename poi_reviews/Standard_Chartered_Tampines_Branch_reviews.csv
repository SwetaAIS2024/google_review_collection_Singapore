Jerryl Seow,1,Beware if you are thinking of applying for any StanChart credit cards! Wow! What a way to force you to pay for credit card annual fees. The phone service will say your request is declined while the app will also decline your request. Well done StanChart for improving the service for yourselves!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109625272934813540748/reviews
Alicia Lin,1,"Although an appointment to change new notes was made for 12pm to 1pm, I reached at 11.57am. Despite so, I was made to wait at the branch until 1.54pm and my turn is still not called. The customer service at this bank is extraordinary.

You need to make sure you are super free to be able to spend hours and hours waiting here.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100701069816367544128/reviews
Stacy Por,1,"The worst banking services provided.
No smiling face, not interested to serve n replying her handphone messages while opening a new account. No further explanation how does it works for this new account and its interest rate entitled. If there is option to give no star, I will do it.

Fortunately, the bank enquiry lady is more approachable but she is busy with customers in queue.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112085372778064868736/reviews

2jovan yin,5,"The attitude of the staff is very good, because the bank account number is needed to enter the salary, call the hotline, and the staff calls to help solve the problem. They are very patient, very friendly, and I like it very much.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100420925567423494901/reviews
