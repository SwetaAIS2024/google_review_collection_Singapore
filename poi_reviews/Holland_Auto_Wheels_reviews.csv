Martin Ang,5,"My Korean car had an AC problem which is not cold. A very general problem which varies. Went to 2 workshop and authorised agent. Agent quote was 1k-2k+ including diagnostics fees. Another 2 workshop help to charge AC gas but lasted only 3 weeks and said might be this,might be that, change the cheapest to trial and error....dun seems confident.

Colleague recommended me to this Holland auto. When reached, I was thinking is he trying to bring me to holland? Anyway I'm here so give it a last try. They did check and found the root of the problem. They showed me the leak but I dun really understand it.

For the parts usually need to get a set for a certain parts in it, he manage to avoid buying the set, and instead ordered alternative parts,repair for less than $500.

Conclusion, after 3.months, aircon still working that I have to give a thumbs up for this workshop.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108641262290679583447/reviews
Simon Leung,5,"We have an old Mini Cooper and the aircon was not working.  We bring to a few workshop and all said the aircon fan needs replacement .   I happen to come to this workshop for a battery changed and the boss said can help me check .  Long story short ,  he managed to find out that the aircon fan was not spoiled ,  it is just no electricity pass to the fan .  No other workshop is able to identify this and they help me save a lot of money by avoiding changing the entire aircon fan.   Good job and we are very happy with their service !",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105648375908725679762/reviews
