Surprised that they served the whole duck drumstick with thigh as it is and not bother to chop into smaller pieces. The duck was not soft enough that you could use fork and spoon on it. The broccoli is tasteless and not soft enough. As for the soup, realized it was not double boiled so can't complain that the pieces were not soft enough.",
