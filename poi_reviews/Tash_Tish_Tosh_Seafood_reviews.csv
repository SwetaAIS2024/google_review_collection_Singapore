Kaori Ginger,4,"Went for lunch just now with family. Overall was not bad. The portions were generous. Service wise, okay. Had a hard time deciding what to order as there are toooooo many items on the menu!
ü¶¥ Battleship tulangü¶¥ was something special and I would like to recommend, however the pita bread, I wish it could be slightly more charred...

The ¬πNasi goreng Kampung was good, and the medium portion had a great portion that could keep 3-4 eaters well-fed. ¬≤Nasi goreng Tomyum was rather a little different from what we usually had elsewhere, it's sweet and spicy. And luckily we should choose the spicy level, which is very considerate. ¬≥Kangkong balachan was carefully cut, not those big and messy ones you get at those local tze-char stalls üòÇ, I kinda like it here. ‚Å¥Buttermilk prawns came with a nice crispy texture, the gravy was sweet and great to pair with the extra bread we ordered. ‚ÅµCalamari remain crispy even after 30 mins into our meal. That's nice. For the ‚Å∂Sambal stingray, it does have a big portion, good for a table of 4-5 person. Could see it's done deep fried first, then grilled. The sambal on stingray was nice to pair with our Nasi goreng a as well.

Anyway, had a great time at this place. And we had to take away our leftovers because the portions were really alot!

Denise P,5,"a great place for halal food!!! came here with around 10pax for a birthday dinner and had a lovely time! only gripe was the kitchen didn‚Äôt serve 3 of our dishes sadly and we decided to cancel, yet in the end they gifted it to us for free as it was prepared already:( thank you so much tash tish tosh team for this despite the oversight!!!! truly a testament to the great service and great food this place serves!

aside from that, the portions were also really huge and we loved the tulang (baby battleship)! the dough for both the tulang and the pizza were great too! seemed like it was handmade and was a very soft, doughy, yet flavourful dough! also really enjoyed the seafood like the squid! was extremely fresh and great:)

would definitely be back! great ambience too:) really really commend the staff for the patience and kindness! (no pics of the food as we were already done by then ü§£) p.s. the restaurant also offers free parking right outside!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103566865878713991322/reviews

Amir Hamizan,1,"The new menu is deceiving that it shows Prawn in the tom yum pasta, but in writing say grill chix. Despite the great vibes of the place, the service is slow and the new menu has alot of wrong item plus unavailability during a public holiday. Disappointed with this experience for a family lunch",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112207423232295001640/reviews
