Lydia Wu,5,"I recently had the pleasure of viewing Stella's fantastic artworks, and I was absolutely captivated by the experience. Her mastery of acrylic on canvas is evident in every piece, where each brushstroke tells a story and radiates elegance. Stella's unique style transforms even the simplest of strokes into extraordinary works of art that truly stand out.

What struck me the most was the depth of inspiration behind her work, which clearly comes from a place of inner peace, rich life experiences, and a deep sense of faith. The way she captures these elements in her art is nothing short of inspiring.

Stella’s artworks are a testament to her talent, creativity, and spirit. I highly recommend anyone with an appreciation for art to experience her work firsthand. You won’t be disappointed!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108208705454554902266/reviews
FT FBI,5,"Everytime when I have a WOW moment with Stella, I will always ask her this question, ""did you buy additional insurance for your hands?"" Her replies is  'I am still learning' a humble, down to earth and always looks after others feeling with an angel soul.

Apart from her makeup, eyebrows embroidery, private chef service and this time make me admire her even further is her magnificent artwork. I highly recommend Stella should have an exhibition to showcase her another talent - painting Well done.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110426097336779040097/reviews
