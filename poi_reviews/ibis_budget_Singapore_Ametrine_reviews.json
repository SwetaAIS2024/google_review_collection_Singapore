      "text": "I stayed in Singapur for 4 nights alone. Staff is very nice, room service was very good. The room was small but equipped with a large bed, good pillows, blanket and drinking water from the tap. Also with TV, kettle, soap and even toothbrush kit.\n\nThe only downside was the mold on the ceiling, which was a little discomforting.\nAlso the walls are thin and you can hear your room neighbors.\n\nThe hotel is located in a small street between the MRT stations Kallang and Aljuned. Both are 15 mins away on foot, which is quite far.\n\nLuckily there is a bus stop, which brings you directly to downtown area in a very short time. Donâ€™t bother taking the MRT, take the bus.\n\nAround the corner is a 7-11 and a washing salon, where you can wash and dry your clothes for less than 10SGD.\n\nNearby is also a Shieng Siong (supermarket), where you can buy cheap water bottles. The prices at 7-11 are way too high for water.",
