      "text": "Six Avenue Porky Prawn Noodle is a must-visit for lovers of rich, porky prawn mee loaded with premium ingredients. Their signature broth is simmered for up to 14 hours, starting with freshly fried prawn heads to create a deeply umami, full-bodied base.\n\nChoose from a variety of hearty bowls—including their signature & limited edition Noodle bowls, each in a combination of fresh prawns, prawn paste cake, pork ribs, pig tail, pig skin, liver, kidney, intestines, and more. Whether you like it dry or soup-based, each bowl is a flavour bomb. Their dry version is another crowd favourite, so tasty with their addictive sauces & house-made chilli.\n\nWith fresh ingredients and unlimited broth refills, it’s no surprise queues form early—so go hungry and go early!\n\nHighly recommended for a good bowl of prawn noodles!\n\nSix Avenue Porky Prawn Noodle – other Outlets:\n•\t15 Anamalai Ave S279985 (flagship)\n•\t323 Bukit Batok St 33 S650323\n•\t417 Fernvale Link S790417\n•\t681 Hougang Ave 8 S530281\n•\t130 Jurong Gateway Rd\n•\t146 Jalan Bukit Merah S160146\n•\t269B Queen St S182269\n•\t146 Silat Ave\n•\t61 Telok Blangah Heights S100061\n•\t177 Toa Payoh Central S310177",

      "text": "If you enjoy a hearty, pork-filled prawn mee, Sixth Avenue Porky Prawn Noodle is definitely worth checking out.\n\nWe tried their Superior 12 Porky Prawn Noodle, and it was packed with an amazing variety of ingredients — prawns, prawn paste, spare ribs, pork slices, pork tail, pork skin, heart, liver, kidney, intestines, and bean sprouts. We went with the dry version and had it tsukemen-style, dipping the noodles into a rich, flavorful broth that’s been simmering for 14 hours. It was incredibly satisfying!",

Very generous with their portions - I got the $6 special prawn noodle and it has 2 full prawns (not those halved kind), good amount of pork, 1 cube of prawn paste and 1 lil cute shrimp (I thought it was an accident to have it in there but turns out my mom has it in hers too!)\nAll in all, a good, satisfying and value-for-money meal!\n\nThey're part of the Sixth Avenue Porky prawn noodles chain, btw.",
