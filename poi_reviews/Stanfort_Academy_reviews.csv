Shwe Sin,5,"I have been studying at this school for over a year, completing both DBM and ADBM programs. The teachers are incredibly knowledgeable and never fail to reach out their students whenever needed. The staff is warm, welcoming, and always ready to assist with any concerns. The school provides valuable practical experiences outside of the classroom, including visits to expos and industry events. These opportunities not only enhance our learning but also expose us to various career paths and possibilities. In addition to academic focus, the school organizes outdoor activities that help students relieve stress and build stronger connections with one another. My time here has been filled with unforgettable memories, and I am truly grateful for the experiences I’ve gained.
I highly recommend this school to others, and I’d like to thanks to the entire team at Stanfort Academy for their support and dedication.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101252173998625914341/reviews
