Gator,4,We decided to have dinner here and trying out some restaurants that we did not try before. They served some kind of noodles and the lady was telling us that it‚Äôs Sichuan styled noodles. My wife ordered one with salted vegetables and I ordered the mapo tofu. I should have ordered the noodles as well as the broth was really tasty. The noodles was also kinda special. The mapo tofu was quite a disappointment. Don‚Äôt taste authentic. But the noodles were really worth a try. Prices were reasonable.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
MOLLY CHONG,4,"Food wise are good, generous portion. We ordered 2 for 3 sharing without refilling the rice noodle. The fried pork tastes good but the portion is small. Tomato soup with fried egg is fantastic. The soups are even tastier with vinegar added which makes it more intense.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114095330355138855580/reviews
dolce bibobi,3,"More of a 3.5 stars for me. I ordered the sauerkraut rice noodles and flavour-wise, it‚Äôs not as strong as I would like it to be. Felt like a watered-down soup which wasn‚Äôt very nice. However, they are very generous with the ingredients, the soup came filled with so much ingredients I think there was enough for two person üòÇ

A plus point is also that they provide free flow water and plum juice as well as appetizers (pickled vegetables).

Hope they improve on the flavours because everything else was good, good service and clean environment üëç There‚Äôs also free WIFI available which is a plus.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113755863430044252682/reviews
wanjia s,4,"We ordered the beef broth, tomato broth and sour vegetables broth and all of which taste great. Portion was also generous, we didn't had to refill the noods.
The only down side was the wooden spoon. A lot looks mouldy / dirty. Hope they replace it with metal spoons in future.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111211550390715346631/reviews
