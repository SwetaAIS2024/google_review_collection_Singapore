Zila Zila,1,"Been living here all my life
A few weeks back they taken the store next to them which is the bakery

At that time I was revamping my house and was thinking of a very long time to see a toilet rack
I even took picture of it just to compare if online was cheaper

Holding the big rack and small rack while thinking in my head which is best I may be a woman but I did all my house drills and such myself so I need to think what is best

I HAVE BEEN BUYING SO MANY THINGS AT THIS SHOP for drill bits and without fail I will spend $50 and above getting my items here

I have to admit i took a long time to think but FOR HEAVEN SAKE,u guys have lots of camera and how can I steal such a big metal 2 tier item?its not a small one mind u 31Lx36 H

Cos when I finally decide to buy and hold it out to go next door to pay A MID 30s Chinese chap grab the item from me and put it at the cashier as I am following him to make payment

FROM THAT DAY ONWARDS HE STARE AT ME WHEN EVER I GO IN AS IF TO SEE IF I AM TRYING TO STEAL ANYTHING.AND WE UNDERSTOOD EACH OTHER GLARE VERY WELL

THERES A DAMN BIG TV ONTOP OF UR CASHIER TO SEE IF ANYONE STEAL
NO COMMON SENSE AT ALL TO TREAT UR CUSTOMER LIKE THAT

after that I avoid going here and nearly one month later I go in to buy a disposable Tupperware cos the other small household shop ran out

They talk in Chinese indicating that I have return
Mind u
I am fluent in Chinese even if I am Malay
And I really feel disgusted and appalled that I was treated this way as I was senior security officer at a gov place before I resigned

That offended me a lot

And if anyone is wondering who I am referring to
There is this guy on a ladder with the back facing the camera in the main photo.
Found the  rack at Japan home for much cheaper today.

Not returning,have a lot of items but the staff treat u like a criminal
Iâ€™m innocent till proven guilty that treatment is so not needed!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114952084892767502398/reviews
