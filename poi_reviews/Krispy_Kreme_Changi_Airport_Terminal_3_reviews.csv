Vimal Pandya,5,I visited airport today to drop-off my parents at terminal 3. I forgot to bring mask since i took grab. While going back i needed mask to travel using MRT. I bought Krispy Kreme donuts and gently asked girl on the counter if she had spare mask. She immediately gave new one from pack. Really appreciate customer service and satisfaction was guaranteed. One happy customer walked out even before tasting donuts. PS: donut was also good.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115350047609671972764/reviews

Averse XboxVersion,1,"Horrible service, told me that cashless payment wasnt allowed because he already closed the terminal early, only cash was allowed. so i went to draw out cash which only took a minute because the atm is opposite the shop. when i came back he said, ""cannot leh i already counted the cash"" ???? mind you this was 9:40pm they close at 10pm.

5mins later called me back for the purchase when he saw me typing in this review... please re-educate your staff not to be lazy",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103468608507257145091/reviews
Heidy Crystal,5,"I liked eating donut there. The donut was very soft and rather too sweet from me, but i liked it heheheh.
Better and way better from Krispy Kreme at Jakarta, Indonesia.  The price is twice from Jakarta, but the taste was Very Good.
(Don't want to eat at Jakarta's counter anymore)
