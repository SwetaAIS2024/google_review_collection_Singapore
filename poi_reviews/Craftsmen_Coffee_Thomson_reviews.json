Was served by Melody and Jacky, who were patient and efficient in taking my order and serving the food :) Highly recommend for anyone looking for great coffee and a chill place to unwind!",

They have several outlets over the island.\n\nThe cafe provides quality and reasonable price coffee. In fact, the latte is cheaper and tastes better than the Starbucks across the road. The Novena area has a good variety of cafes. Although not necessarily the top cafe, Craftsmen is still a worthy choice, esp when they close later than other specialty cafe.",

      "text": "For context, I came to Craftsmen Novena this morning, around 12pm for a short brunch with my family since it was a public holiday. We had the Grilled Chicken French Toast, Smoked Duck Pasta, and also the Acai Granola Bowl. Food was satisfactory and portions were surprisingly generous and filling!\n\nSeated right in front of the bar, I observed quite a few things while waiting for the food. I was especially impressed with their service and attitude, especially during peak hours when the place was bustling with orders. Despite the high volume of customers and the pressure of busy times, the staff remained calm, collected, greeting everyone they served with a smile.\n\nWhat stood out to me most was their ability to handle everything so smoothly, even when things got a bit hectic. Orders were taken quickly, and my food arrived with minimal delay. Although the 20-30min wait time was visibly unpleasant for some, it was understandable from how busy the restaurant was. There were customers who would complain loudly to the waitresses, and the customer next to me even stood up and walked right up to the bar demanding to speak to someone in charge. We could hear their whole conversation from our seats! I think the staff really demonstrated impressive patience when dealing with such frustrated customers. Not only did they remain patient and understanding, they kept a smile on their face despite the complaints and overflowing requests to \"hurry with the food\". You can tell they truly value each customer’s experience, and that kind of commitment to service really goes a long way.\n\nManaged to chat with some of the staff while they were serving my coffee and food, as well as when the busyness died down. Even managed to learn the names of some of them! The ones who made the coffee so beautifully were Melody and Jacky, and those serving the food efficiently were Darrel and Janelle.\n\nOverall, I am grateful to have been met with such a pleasant experience at this cafe. Will definitely be back soon, thank you to the staff and to Craftsmen, for providing us with such exceptional service and food. Be sure to say Hi to them when you go!",

      "text": "Visited on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. It was crowded but there was still space that I got a table immediately when I entered.\nGot showed to a table and seated and scanned the QR code to order food. Was just about to complete the ordering suddenly the staff asked me to shift to another table and asked me to reorder the food again.\nHad a look at the menu and there was quite a variety of items to order. There were quite a few dishes I wanted to try but could only choose one as I was alone and wanted a quick meal.\nEnded up ordering a chocolate almond croissant even though they didn't have the original almond croissant,  a taro latte and a fried chicken waffle.\nFirst came the drink and I thought it was quite average. It wasn't too sweet hence was okay but was a little lacking the taro taste.\nThen came the chocolate almond croissant which was okay. Not so much of a almond taste but there was a bit of the chocolate melted in the centre of the croissant.\nLast came the chicken waffle. Presentation wise was rather plain so I actually doubted if it would taste good but it met the expectations. The waffles was hot and crispy at the sides and the chicken was quite juicy. It felt kinda dry overall and that was when I realized it was missing maple syrup and I asked for it when they don't even serve it with the dish.\nService could be improved. Food was decent. Maybe would visit again as I was also interested to try the fish and chips.",
