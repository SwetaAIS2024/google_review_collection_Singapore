"lacrymosa ,",5,"It has been a pleasure to study in this school. I really admire how the school make an effort to listen to the students’ feedback and improve accordingly. I’ve gained invaluable insights shared by the lecturers and my classmates. They are engaging, fun and interactive. The practicum centre that I was attached to, was an eye-opener for me as I get to experience working in a special needs school as a shadow teacher. It has given me great opportunity to continue working after graduating and expand my connections in the special education industry",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110911726936315394710/reviews
