      "text": "Very disappointing experience at this KFC outlet for takeout. Despite there being fewer than five people in the store, I waited nearly half an hour for my breakfast order. The staff preparing the food seemed disorganized, repeatedly walking back and forth causing more delays. I only ordered two meals, it took such long time for the second order to be done. By the time the second meal was ready, the first order had already gone cold. The food quality was way below expectation, both orders were prepared sloppily. Save your time and dine at a different KFC outlet.",
