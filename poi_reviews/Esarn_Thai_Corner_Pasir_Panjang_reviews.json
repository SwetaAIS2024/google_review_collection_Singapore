The wait time for food was reasonable—around 10 to 15 minutes. It’s usually full.\n\nThe food is reasonably priced, with large portions and authentic, rich flavors. One dish is enough for two people. We had Clear Tom Yum Soup and a Small Crispy Omelette (recommended), both of which were very generous for two people to share.",

Today, I brought a few colleagues because I missed the food, but I was disappointed to find that the standard has dropped. The minced meat was too salty and not spicy, the kang kong was not spicy, and the tom yum was more sour than flavorful. However, the pork and desserts were still good.",
