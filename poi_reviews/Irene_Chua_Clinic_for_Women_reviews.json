      "text": "Visit Dr Irene chua to check her clinic out(She not my gynae as i didnt choose her). I fell sick and ate the medication she prescribed ( not useful btw). To my horror, i was told by a GP that the medication that she prescribed me were of grade B ( in pregnancy chart, Grade A measuring 100% safe for fetus). I had totally no clue about the grade differences and Dr Irene did not explained to me anything about the chart and the grade of medication. The GP told me that pregnant lady cant take drowsy medication but Dr irene did prescribe me a drowsy one. It's really very unprofessional of her.\n\nI'm so glad i didnt choose her. Reasons for not choosing her back then was also becuz i felt that she was not very detailed during the check up. The check up was basically just 5 mins of scan, told me everything normal and then another 15mins of chit chat (\"Bonding\" time w clients kinda feel).\n\nBecuase of the medication incident, i when to google more about her and found out bad reviews about her unprofessionalism/dishonesty. Thank god, she's not my gynae.",

When she arrives at the delivery ward, everything set in motion is very smooth and I feel super safe in her experienced hands. Highly recommended! And will come back for yearly check ups.
