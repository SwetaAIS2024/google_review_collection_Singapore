This is one of my favorite brands and it is disappointing to get treated in such manner. I hope they see this review and try to improve service without judging customers walking in to their business.",

      "text": "Bought the shoe in the middle above the sales sign. Turns out the pair is not part of the Sale they are having so I asked if he store manager if they should consider having a separate shelf for the sales item and not put something that is not on sale 17 centimetre from the sign. He said that that’s not how it works. I paid full price but it would have been great if he agreed and said they would consider this moving forward. Quite misleading and will not return to this shop. Have bought Lacoste sneakers for the last 10 years but maybe I need to change brand. I wanted them to dispose of my old shoes but he said there is a trash can outside the store. I left them at the counter and walked out. Any recommendations on other brands, anyone?",

Said the store don't do repair and I might as well look for a seamstress on my own. The way she put it is so rude and defensive. Even refused to hear me out. It is clearly a quality issue and I am appalled that Lacoste do not have after sale service. Bad customer service and extremely bad sales person attitude!",
