      "text": "If you’re a meat lover, GO K BBQ at Bukit Timah Plaza is an absolute must-visit. I tried their Wagyu, and the marbling was insane — melt-in-your-mouth levels of rich, buttery flavor. You can really tell the meat quality is top-notch across the board.\n\nOne of the best parts? The staff actually cook the meat for you at the table, so there’s no stress about overcooking or undercooking anything. You just sit back, relax, and enjoy perfectly grilled bites every time. The service was super attentive and friendly too, which made the whole experience even better.\n\nHighly recommend this spot if you’re craving Korean BBQ done right!",

      "text": "Recommended by a friend and really enjoyed the food here. Rice cake stew is super big serving and one of the highlights for tonight. Seafood pancake, I prefer it crispier hence grilled it further. I dont eat beef hence tried their aged pork. Pork belly is better than the pork neck as I prefer less tendon. Nice to have their expert staff grill meat for us. Yummy melona after! Will come back, make sure to reserve :)",
