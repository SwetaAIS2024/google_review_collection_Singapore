Quite dry and stale (and I suspect this is not a fresh slice as the auntie did not pick one from the display, but from somewhere inside the store). Auntie‚Äôs service was also quite rude - she firstly told me to order right away (even though there was no queue behind me) and as I was reaching up to collect she asked me sharply to pay (my transaction had just gone through). This is singapore - I am not going to steal your food and run away‚Ä¶ do not recommend visiting this place.",
