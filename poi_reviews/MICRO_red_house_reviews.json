      "text": "As a big sourdough bread lover (and former home baker) it took us some time to find a good bakery in Singapore.\nAt MICRO red house we found what we wanted and we have been regulars stocking up sourdough every couple of weeks.\n\nBesides their sourdough, their baguettes are very good, as well as the selection of pastries and breads they sell. Staff is amazing, especially Lisa who I could also text to reserve an order.\n\nAll in all, we‚Äôre big fans of the team at MICRO red house and their menu! Would highly recommend visiting if you are in the area.",

      "text": "Absolutely delightful experience! The sourdough was perfectly crusty and full of flavor, paired beautifully with expertly cooked eggs. The gingerbread brownie was a showstopper‚Äîrich, spiced, and utterly unforgettable. The grilled cheese sandwich? Simply stunning, with a gooey, cheesy center and a perfectly crisp exterior. To top it off, they offer free water, which is a thoughtful touch. A must-visit for anyone who loves quality food and attention to detail!",

One of the more famous cafes in Katong area. Very distinct red paint on the outside. Can‚Äôt miss this place if you are around the area. Outdoor seating available too. Not too suitable on a hot afternoon. But for morning breakfast or brunch it‚Äôs totally ok. Overall a very nice cafe with good food and pastries and coffee. Barista looks experienced and coffee is on point. Only grouse is that it‚Äôs a bit overpriced for my liking, but which eatery is not nowadays? üëÄ Visit on a weekday or non peak period cos lots of people come here to eat. It‚Äôs one of the tourist attractions around the area. 328 Katong Laksa and the famous Sri Senpaga Temple is just round the corner.",

Micro Bakery offers a wide range of breads, pastries, and brunch food. I got their famous sourdough and also tried their pastry and cake. They provide free water.\n\nBig Breakfast ($27.00)\nLove the sourdough and the creamy scrambled eggs. The sausage is flavourful and the mushrooms are well seasoned. The dish is accompanied by fresh salad that adds a delightful crunchiness. Butter, salt, and pepper are provided on the side.\n\nCroissant ($4.00)\nThe croissant is crispy and flaky on the exterior. It has nice buttery taste.\n\nBanana Walnut Cake ($6.50)\nThey are generous with the banana and walnuts, The cake has a nice sweetness from the bananas, complemented by the crunch of the walnuts.\n\nWorth a Try\n‚úÖ Definitely Returning!\nMust-Visit!\n\nüìç63 East Coast Road #01-06, Singapore 428776\n\n#singapore #singaporefood #sg #sgfood #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #sgeats #sgfoodblogger #sgfooddiary #katong #joochiat #sourdough #microbakery #microredhouse",
