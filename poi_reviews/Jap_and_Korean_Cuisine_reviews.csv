Sean Goh,2,"Limited stalls open at the Bedok South Blk 16 hawker centre on a Sunday afternoon. They one of the limited stalls that were still operating. This stall has been around for quite sometime. Stall is operated by an elderly lady. Menu is pretty much similar to those Korean/Japanese food stall in food court. Price starts from SGD$4.80 onwards.

Ordered item no.11 on the menu which is Teriyaki Chicken and Saba fish bento. Paid SGD$5.50 for my meal. Didn't had to wait since there was no other customer except for me. Presentation of the food was mediocre. Teriyaki chicken was pretty small piece, it was crispy but there was barely any sauce. Saba fish probably fried a few times, as a result it was very dry.

Overall, food was disappointing, don't think  would patronized again. In the same hawker centre, there is another stall selling Japanese cusine.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Isaac Leong,1,"Utterly regret paying $11.40 for very bland food with questionable quality of ketchup and mayonnaise.

3.30pm on a Mon afternoon - almost all stalls closed. #3 just arrived home after a day camp without lunch.

Was thinking of either chicken rice from Peng You or duck rice from Koon Kee (both their duck rice stalls are good - elder brother's stall also has yummy kway chap), but #3 insisted on trying this stall.

Ordered ebi tempura udon (for #3) & salmon egg omelette rice (for me).

Service was satisfactory both in terms of friendliness and promptness.

1st red flag: salmon in real life was noticeably thinner, shorter & narrower than in the picture. Actual thickness: about 5mm only.

2nd red flag: ketchup squeezed onto omelette appeared transparent (not opaque) & lightly coloured red (not thick & dark red) - it looked like red-tinted starch glue used in art and craft.

3rd red flag: mayonnaise for ebi tempura is runny, not thick.

On first mouthful, worst fears confirmed: everything served was bland. Even #3 commented that the ebi tempura tastes like cardboard.

This stall is not for me. My first & last time.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114342170990044311358/reviews
Jeffrey Toh,3,"Ordered Oyako Don. The food was mediocre.
However the boss was friendly and the service is good. The service is fast as there is no other customer.
The atmosphere is a typical of what to expect at a hawker centre.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100135414257150010506/reviews
