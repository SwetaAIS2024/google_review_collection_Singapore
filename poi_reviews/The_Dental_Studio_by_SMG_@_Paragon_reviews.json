Dr Lynette was very experienced, and my teeth have turned out nice and white and as even as can be hoped for with my fluorosis, with minimal discomfort during and after the Zoom whitening. The staff at the clinic were also friendly and helpful with after care instructions. Thank you for looking after me!",

Dr Joel Huang is a very patient and kind dentist. He did his best to keep pain and sensitivity to a minimum level. After scaling and polishing he very patiently addressed all of my queries and is very knowledgable. I would recommend this place to all of my friends! Thank you! :)",
