LP Pua,4,"This Nasi Padang stall is located in Singapore Polytechnic Food Court 4. We ordered 2 plates, costing $3 for 2 vegetables and 1 meat, and $5 for 1 vegetable and 2 meats. Overall, the dishes were quite flavorful and tasty. For the price, it's definitely value for money. An added bonus is that the food court is air-conditioned.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
