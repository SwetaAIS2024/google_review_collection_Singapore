Victoria Anne U,5,"Being in healthcare, I found out about Dr James Wee through my routine ward work.

I had the privilege of being an insider - I get to observe his patient care, read his reports and observe the after op care of his patients. One thing I notice about ALL his patients, is that NONE of them complain of pain post-op.
Hence, I decided to seek a second opinion.

No regrets!!
Dr James Wee is amazing!! Heâ€™s extremely patient and he really takes his time to explain thoroughly what was happening to my knee.

Eventually I got my ACL reconstruction done under him, and like he promised, it was a routine operation without surprises!
Heâ€™s is straight forward to the point and doesnâ€™t focus too much on building excessive PR - which is what I appreciate!!!
(I dislike doctors that spend more time on PR rather than treating their patients)

You can expect a consultation with Dr James to not just be fun, but incredibly robust - he explains the diagnosis from head to toe, and elaborates thoroughly his intervention methods, quoting various studies and protocols.

Post-op wise, most (or in fact all) of his patients discharge the following day. Post op instructions are clear and straightforward, and medications are generous.

Overall it was a very well structured, straight forward  organised experience.

A HUGE bonus for me was his incredibly team of clinic staff.
They are so responsible and thoughtful, and incredibly organised.
Every appointment to date, theyâ€™re always smiling, welcoming me with warmth and joking with me through my nonsense and melodrama ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. Appreciate all your efforts and care!!!!!

Thank you so much errbody!!!!!!!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108628634138640337908/reviews

During my appointment, Dr James was incredibly attentive and really took the time to listen to my concerns. He asked thoughtful questions and took a detailed medical history, which made me feel like he truly cared about my well-being. When it came time to explain my diagnosis and treatment options, Dr James did so in a way that was easy to understand and helped me feel confident in the plan we developed together.

Throughout the consultation, Dr James continued to be a great listener and was always available to answer any questions I had. He was patient and supportive every step of the way, which made a huge difference in my overall experience.

Overall, I would highly recommend Dr James to anyone looking for a compassionate and skilled orthopaedic specialist. He is truly one of a kind and I feel lucky to have had him as my doctor.

Fabian Low,5,"I cannot express my gratitude enough for the exceptional care and expertise provided by Dr. James and his remarkable team. I recently faced knee and ankle injuries that left me anxious and uncertain about my future mobility. Dr. James not only put my fears to rest but also guided me with unwavering confidence and compassion.

From the very first consultation, Dr. James exhibited an extraordinary depth of knowledge and an incredible ability to explain complex medical matters in a way that I could easily understand. His commitment to exploring every possible avenue for treatment was evident, and he left no stone unturned in ensuring that I received the best advice and solutions for my injuries.

What truly sets Dr. James apart is his surgical skill. I underwent surgery for both my knee and ankle, and the outcomes have been nothing short of miraculous. His steady hands and precision have given me a new lease on life, and I am on the path to recovery with newfound hope and optimism.

Moreover, the support staff at Dr. James' practice deserves accolades of their own. Their warmth, professionalism, and dedication to patient care have been instrumental in making every step of this challenging journey more manageable.

I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. James to anyone seeking top-notch orthopedic care. He is not just a doctor; he is a true healer who has transformed my life for the better. Thank you, Dr. James, and your wonderful team, for your unwavering commitment to patient well-being.

With immense gratitude,
Fabian",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114116333818209941080/reviews
