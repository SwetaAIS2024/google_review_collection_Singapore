Hans Tibboel,5,"I had a very pleasant stay at the hotel. It's housed in a nice colonial building in a scenic part of town. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The room was clean and quiet and the bed comfortable. I liked the free-to-use handy that comes with the room with unlimited data on it and free calls to several countries. Coffee, tea and drinking water are complimentary in the room and so was the first complete minibar.
Breakfast was good (excellent coffee machine!), I recommend the local dishes as they were freshly cooked and very tasty.
Overall a very pleasant stay.

Marcella Nicolini,5,"The hotel is located in a legacy building in a nice neighbourhood, very close to the lavender MRT stop, easy to reach from the airport. The rooms are spacious, breakfast is good and they give you a handy phone to be connected when you're touring during the day.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105453325451460108953/reviews
tedjames,4,"I chose The Sultan for our 5d/4n stay in Singapore because it was reasonably priced and conveniently located near some of the places my wife and I wanted to visit. Our Room 118, was at the ground floor, secluded from the noise of the street, and beside the fish pond, which we liked. Staff were very friendly and helpful, specially the guy at the One Bowl resto who served us breakfast and conversed with us in his limited Tagalog when he learned we were from the Philippines. We also appreciate that they allowed us to check in early.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109145274553623670665/reviews
