The rate pink intestine really isn't as tender as braised, nor was it nicer.\n\nThe soup i am kinda devided. On one hand it seems plain in a good way but it still feels dilited.",

No effort to refry some items..\n\nSoup tasted like water and msg.. though we opted for the dry one\n\nThe ytf and chilli sauce is not bad tho, wouldnâ€™t mind if feeling healthi(er) and living around the corner.\n\nService is fast, but minimal effort.\n\nThe place is infested w houseflies, i find myself waving my hands while in eat for almost all of the times..\n\nDefo wouldnâ€™t travel down, there are much better ytf out there at more affordable prices.\n\nDmg for 2 (10 pcs): $11.20",
