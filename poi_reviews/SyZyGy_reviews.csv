Foodie Luwee,5,"Syzygy introduced me to the exquisite world of Armagnac, a hidden gem from Gascony, France. Unlike its more famous cousin Cognac, Armagnac boasts deep, multi-layered notes that make it a true delight for the senses.

We’ve tried :
UN-Oaked Armagnac ~ clear, pristine spirit that's both smooth and sophisticated.

+ Tenareze Chateau De Pellehaut 30 ans (30 years old) ~ My absolute favorite, with unparalleled complexity and richness.

UHaut Armagnac Chateau d'Arton La Reserve ~ A beautifully crafted blend, perfect for special occasions.

I Bas Armagnac Domaine d'Esperance 18 ans ~ Aged to perfection, offering a symphony of flavors.

Each sip was a testament to the exquisite craftsmanship of small local distilleries in this lesser-known region of France. These Armagnacs are not only expensive and luxurious but also incredibly smooth and delightful - even those new to brandy, like many women, would fall in love with them.
Perfect for gifting, these spirits are best enjoyed neat, allowing you to fully appreciate their complex profiles.

The passionate team at Syzygy, especially Jeremy, made the experience unforgettable with their deep knowledge and welcoming spirit.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117767049392619138213/reviews
Kevin Ou,5,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

I recently attended the exclusive Dartigalongue Tasting Experience at SyZyGy, and it was truly unforgettable.

Guided by Mr. Benoit Hillion, Director of Dartigalongue Armagnac, we embarked on a journey through the rich flavors and history of Armagnac.

The selection of vintages was exceptional, from the UN-Oaked Armagnac to the rare 1967 Single Cask Selection. Each tasting was expertly paired with gourmet canapés, enhancing the complexity and character of the Armagnacs. Mr. Hillion's insights into the centuries-old traditions of Dartigalongue added depth to the experience. Highly recommended for any Armagnac enthusiast!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106809677972159487260/reviews
