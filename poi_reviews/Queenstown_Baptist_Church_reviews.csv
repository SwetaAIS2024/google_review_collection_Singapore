Peter Parker,5,"I felt very welcomed and warm during my visit. The people are friendly without being weird. I felt their sincerely and joy in getting to know you.

The preaching is Bible centred which I enjoyed much. A church that takes community work seriously and at the same time offering “an open welcome door” policy. No obligations at all.

Children program are available too.
It’s a nice family church. Young and old are welcome there.
