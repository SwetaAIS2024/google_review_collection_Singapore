Online Vigilante,1,"Went in to have a look at their Yale products at Kallang shop. Mall with the least footfall, yet 3 staffs just stuck to their seats and pretended not to notice me.

Might as well go set up in an industrial building.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109269083328520695829/reviews
