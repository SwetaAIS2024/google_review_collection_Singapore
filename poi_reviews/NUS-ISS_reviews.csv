Koo Matthew,5,"Attended a course there by Sam via virtual classes.
I must say he is one of the best adults trainer I came across. Coming from a non IT background I expected a very challenging experience, but Samâ€™s lecturing style and pace made the course very enjoyable. His dedication and sensitivity for participants to learn bridged this gap. His vast knowledge and experience allow us to relate theories back to our workplace scenarios. He took great patient to explain and simplify things for us.
At the same time guiding other advanced learners making sure every one learns well.
It is a great pleasure to be in his class, super friendly and motivating and he inspired me to continue this journey on data science.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114839184514269642331/reviews
