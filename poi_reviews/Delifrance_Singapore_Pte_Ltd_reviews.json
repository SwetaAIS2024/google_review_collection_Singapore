      "text": "Pathetic food, pathetic serving and ridiculous policies. Went to takeaway pasta at the Westmall branch for my 2yr old as she wanted pasta. Was told I couldn’t buy a kid’s meal because they needed to see my kid first. Even then, there are some who may not want to eat a full meal and a kids portion would suffice. Ok fine never mind.\n\nEnded up purchasing an adult’s pasta for $12 (including adding mushroom). The portion was pathetic and not even 30% of the takeaway box. My kid could finish it and still want more.\n\nIf you want to offer kids meals then offer. Don’t use the pretense having to see a kid to make customers pay adult price for kids portions. I doubt there is a difference in portion between the adult’s vs kid’s meal.\n\nYou don’t see a certain fast food chain say they need to see my child before I can purchase a happy meal.\n\nStaff herself was dour and gloomy. Like she had not other choice but to be there.\n\nThis is why I will never feel sorry when I hear any F&B outlet close. Because usually it’s well deserved for prioritizing profits over common sense.",
