Jeannie Koh,5,This place is a trap!! Albeit in a good way. Haha. You will be pampered to the enormous variety of biscuits and crackers you can find here and at truly affordable prices (Yes they are cheaper than outside retail). Sometimes they carry specialty biscuits and its really nice. The lady (I think the lady boss?) is really friendly and helpful if you’re stuck on what to choose. Recently bought the salted egg roll and its super. Its 鸡丝咸豆沙饼 is really good too. I never leave this place empty handed cos it has everything (a kid to a adult) one loved to eat.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101960274797057785659/reviews
dongdong sausage,5,"Hidden gem underneath a HDB flat. They have a lot of old traditional cookies (from your Singaporean / Malaysian childhood) and also some newer stuff like kueh bangkit. Just ask the stall owner for recommendation, they are very friendly.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100435973847957114936/reviews
Brian Ong,5,"This is a biscuit distribution store. They sell lots of varieties of biscuits and their service is always friendly. Plus you can take time to have a look around the store for the prices.
The biscuits aren't prepacked, so you can have flexibility of buying just a tiny amount or a larger amount, all according to how much of the biscuits you want, they are then packed on the spot.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112053722108803512489/reviews

Joshua Groenewald,1,"Bought one packet of Iced  Gem Biscuit at the vending machine in bishan with my gf to eat as a snack watching a late night movie and we both ended up spending the entire night nauseated ,sitting by the toilet bowl throwing up - not sure what happened as this was my childhood favourite. Please check your stocks as this package was one month away from its supposed expiry date",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103547140814649293978/reviews
