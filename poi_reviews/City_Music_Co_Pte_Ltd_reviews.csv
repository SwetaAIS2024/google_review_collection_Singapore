Z,5,"I had a blast of a time over the 2025 Founder's Day Sale, thanks to Timothy. It's a joy to have a salesperson who is truly well-versed in the products and willing to patiently share his knowledge and passion.

I was so happy with my purchases from the first day of sale I went back the second day with my whole family, and managed to grab a friend along too. On both days I had great chats with Timothy as I tested the instruments. The best thing about Tim is that unlike salespeople from a well-known competitor, he doesn't make you feel like he's just spending time with you to make the sale. The other staff members were friendly and helpful as well.

It should also be mentioned that the staff did not hesitate to serve my 11-year old son who sneakily approached one of them without me knowing regarding a guitar he saw on their website via one of the in-store computers. When I discovered what was going on, they've already taken the guitar out of storage to let him try!

I total I bought two guitars, a bass, a digital piano and some accessories. Guitarists and bassists should check out the oft-overlooked G&L, some truly quality instruments from the mind of the legendary Leo Fender, at outrageously affordable prices, even without sale prices.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103950144687202766016/reviews
Francis Lee,5,"Before I start. I wanna give a big shoutout to LIONEL (City Music) for his patience, expertise, experience , and awesome customer service.

I was shopping for a guitar on Thursday and already certain brand and model in mind. Went to SL to look for a particular brand but was told that they don‚Äôt provide demo/display if they have no stocks. Was asked to wait and come back 2-3 months later for it.

Feeling disappointed with their ‚Äúhospitality‚Äù I went to the 2nd location (City Music) to test out the other brand Martin that was also in my considerations.

While I was in the show room browsing, Lionel who was with another customer buying a Martin approaches me to offer his assistance. I told him my budget and probably because of his experience, he immediately recommended me a few pieces all within my budget and some small stretches which I‚Äôm still comfortable. He did a great job explaining and introducing to me. I did not buy that day.

After some consideration over night, I‚Äôve decided to pick up the Martin SC-10 and I contacted City Music again and I bought it. I totally love that guitar.

On top of its magnificent craftsmanship, this SC-10 delivers a bright and clear sound and exceptionally
good sound projection while playing unplugged.

I would definitely come back to CM and for Lionel for my future needs.

Strongly recommended.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113883564892434624363/reviews
Mohamed Farid,1,"I have been a customer of City Music since the store was at Peace Centre. Over the past year i have bought an acoustics guitar, korg keyboard, 2 mackie mixers and many accessories. Recently i have bought a Mackie Monitor Bundle online. Today, i went to the store to purchase some TRS cable to connect my CRX3 to my Mackie mixer, to my surprise after hooking up the cables, the speakers are not working and is actually spoilt. I have an event coming up on during the holidays and there are no way to solve this as the store is close during sundays and PH. They asked me to come to the store for repairs or exchange after the holidays and after my event. In the first place why would they have sell something which is not working. Its a hussle to go down to the store as i am working single parent. City Music should have checked their stocks and not sell damage goods!!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105354117438466557478/reviews
Tan Loh KS,1,"Had a horrible experience - purchased a pair of Rokit 7 studio monitors recently. The Security seals had been broken, outer and inner boxes had been dented/damaged, product lining had been clearly torn and restuck back together, EQ LCD stickers clearly removed and carelessly plastered back, head hair (could also possibly be other undesirable bodily hair as well) and dust particles found in speaker port. Speaker also comes with a moist/musty smell.

Similar to previous negative reviews highlighted, we called in and got routed to their online salesperson Dickson who was downright egotistical and rude from the get go. He insisted that we should still go ahead with this set. He even arrogantly remarked that as long as the speaker works they have the right to dispute and deny our request to have it replaced with a new set. He also expected that we haul the speakers over to them by ourselves.

The next day was spent fielding several calls with their sales manager mike and sales director yeegn lougn. In summary, given the condition of these speakers and to protect the integrity of the local community of musicians/people here, we had requested that the speakers be disposed of (even by their staff if need be) so that this particular set of speakers would not have the possibility of being resold (worst case scenario being that they end up on the market again post cleaning and repackaging as brand new); for obvious moral/hygiene reasons. If some poor unfortunate soul should end up receiving this set of speakers - completely unaware of the state they were in before and this resulted in the product having a shorter lifespan due to how they were kept/handled before, it would definitely go against consumer fair trade practices.

Ever since moving to their new space at Sims Dr, it seems things have declined. Even what city music once touted ""limited lifetime warranty policy"" for their Martin guitars from the previous era; recently one of their staff had quickly dismissed as absurd and never existed unless you lived in Nazareth Pennsylvania. This is despite the fact that the guitar in question was in fact sent to city music historically under said warranty policy, which resulted in a slight buzz developing post servicing/handling. We were just following up on this and instantaneously shooed away by one of their staff over the phone, who brazenly told us there will be charges even to check it. He pushed us to get it fixed at 3rd party shops as they might not even be able to help us with this issue. We had eventually sent it to other skilled guitar techs in SG and have since resolved the issue.

Director yeegn lougn had acknowledged lapses and misgivings on the part of city music for both incidences, but for the most part seems empathetically absent and only interested in dollars and cents. Through our hours of conversation, it became obvious that the relationship and trust that had been built over 2 decades (20 years) meant little beyond his own interests. We implored him to protect the integrity of our community by disposing of said product (which clearly does not meet QC standards if claimed to be brand new), and although it would cost him nothing to do so, he simply refused and chose to offer us a discount and beat his competitors' prices instead of just doing a straight refund and actually addressing the more pressing issue of responsibly preventing other musicians/people from ever receiving this controversial product.

When will you realise this is about the betrayal of the relationship and trust we had built with your brand for the past 20 years and a question solely of ethics and social responsibility?

We'll let the pictures do the talking. It really pains us to write this review but absolutely necessary for the sanctity of the music trade.

Together, we can all make a difference with our choices. City music this is a call for you to wake up and change things for the better. We only ask for your understanding, commitment and a sense of righteousness for your tradespeople",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112238912013208320142/reviews
Melissa L√™,5,"We recently visited the store, and was fortunate to be served by San, who was incredibly helpful and friendly. After some consideration, we decided on the Epiphone Casino, and Lionel was great with the setup. Even though the store has moved from its previous location, it‚Äôs clear that it‚Äôs still thriving. The atmosphere is buzzing with energy, filled with young, up-and-coming musicians and passionate music lovers testing out instruments. The vibrant team of staff is always on hand to assist, creating a welcoming environment. I'm thrilled to see the store continuing to do so well! Happy Founder‚Äôs Day ü•≥",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113741052669173092270/reviews
