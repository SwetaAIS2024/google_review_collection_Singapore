Jasper Lee,4,"This old rustic apartment exudes charm with its vintage vibes, though the lack of a lift means climbing stairs is a regular feat. However, the effort is worth it as the spacious swimming pool offers a refreshing escape. The standout feature is the excellent carpark arrangement, ensuring hassle-free parking. What truly sets this place apart are the fantastic neighbors, particularly the Level 4 couple. The Husband's daily routine involves holding onto his toast box and cruising around on his Brompton bicycle, adding a quaint touch to the surroundings. His occasional feat of carrying massive speakers from Level 1 to 4 displays dedication and a passion for music. Their friendly demeanor and unique habits make for a vibrant community that enhances the apartment living experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102089657520508690519/reviews
