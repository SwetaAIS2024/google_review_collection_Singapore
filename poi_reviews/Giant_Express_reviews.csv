It’s me,1,Unhelpful staff no body cares for the self serve kiosk / left the customers unattended even already call for assistant for voucher claiming . Then need to queue again for manual counter and ended up the staff said one voucher can’t being used which is ridiculous.

C S,3,"Good thing is it’s 24h. However it is really very small. They don’t have many things. If something runs out, they don’t restock within the day but next day. Whoever comes in the morning gets the best pick, but working adults that come in evening or night will get leftovers or not have the groceries we need. The mama shop beside got more variety at times. E.g. Wanted baking soda, they don’t have but the mama shop have.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100949760937596920244/reviews
D J,3,Small store and convenient. Keep changing around the store? Why? Has to be method to the madness. One question tho. Why no more Ritz crackers? Only the junk ones with fake cheese. Bring back the original!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114305518256233464252/reviews
Dr. Martin Karnolsky,5,"Giant Express is the local place. Not just a shop. Around is a wet market, Marine Parade Town Council and something very interesting.
