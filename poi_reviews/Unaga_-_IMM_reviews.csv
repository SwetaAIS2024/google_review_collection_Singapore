Agilan Vijayendran,1,"PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUY FROM THIS SHOP!!!!

1. Whatever you do, never order the chicken balls. They are crunchy af and full of chicken cartilage. This is exactly what it's like eating tjr left over cartilage, all minced together. Waste meat. I ordered 2 skewers of it and to be fair, I tried majority of them before spitting it out. Imagine raw cucumbers. This is crunchier than that.

2. Do not be fooled by the size of the packaging. The whole reason I got this was, I saw someone purchasing it, saw the size of the takeaway box, fell for the gimmick of the pricing. You may refer to my pictures on the packaging. Barely 40% of the packaging was with food.

3. Took two staff and a long time to figure out how to even key in the order on the POS machine.

Overall, horrible horrible food quality. Basically like eating trash. Misleading packaging. Terribly slow and under trained staff.

Let's hope they don't stay open for long.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118036326995303000388/reviews
