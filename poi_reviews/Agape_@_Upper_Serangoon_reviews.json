      "text": "My son goes to Agape Little Uni since 20 months old (Smart Toddler) and now he is in N2. He is always happy coming back from school. He enjoyed playing with his classmates. And he loves his teachers (Teacher Sam, Teacher Shane) very much. During Meet the Parents sessions, the teachers shared with me critical information about my son’s development and things for me to note and act upon. I would not hesitate to recommend Agape Little Uni to anyone.",

      "text": "I sent my girl to this school since she’s infant. Special shout out to N1 teacher Yilyn, who’s her English teacher who is caring, loving and dedicated! My girl loves to go school everyday, always excited to share her weekend stories with her teacher. That tells how much she enjoys her school.\n\nThere were also activities involving parents , such as Mother’s Day and Father’s Day event. Where we get to bond with her friends’ families as well as school teachers. It’s so heart warming to see the bunch of bubbly kids playing together and knowing they are so happy at school.\n\nKeep up the good work, all the teachers!",
