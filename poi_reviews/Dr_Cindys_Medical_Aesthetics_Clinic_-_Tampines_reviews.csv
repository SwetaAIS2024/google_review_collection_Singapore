Sharon Kam,5,"I have been visiting Dr Cindy Tampines branch for a few years. and I must say, it was nothing short of an exceptional experience. From the moment I stepped through the doors, I was greeted by a warm and welcoming atmosphere that immediately put me at ease.

Dr Clement is professional and knowledgeable and he would advise the appropriate treatment for me. He will take the time to understand my concerns and goals before recommending personalized treatment options.

Priscilla and the staffs were friendly and approachable. They will always greet me with a smile when I visit the clinic. They also made sure I am comfortable and checking if I am cold and if I need additional blankets.
