yaangria boss toilet,1,"I was here back in 2018 idk how it change but from what i can say, the teachers are abusive that time i didn't finish my food they ask me to eat from dustbin i fell sick the next day.

Yvonne Ng,5,"My girl attends the student care here. The teachers here are kind and responsive. Everyday when I pick up my girl her teacher will share with me what she has done for the day. My girl enjoys her student care time. She adjusted to the student care quickly as well, thanks to the teachers there. Her chinese has improved ever since she attended the centre. I'm happy with that as I told the teachers that I would like her to improve in Chinese.
My girl loves the lunch served here, which is such a big bonus point for us as she's a picky eater.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106627452248603529879/reviews
