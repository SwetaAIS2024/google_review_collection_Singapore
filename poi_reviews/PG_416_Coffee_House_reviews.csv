T K,1,Normally I don't give bad reviews but the Cai Png Store (Mixed Vegetables Rice) is really too much.I don't bother if they attitude is bad but it is different when you indicate one pricing on the side but charge differently once the food is ordered and give a vague reason why it is so much more expensive.It is just A DISHONEST WAY to run your business.ONE MEAT and ONE VEGETABLE for almost $5.00?!!! Seriously do your customers looks like FOOLS to you?!!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114469168911472126039/reviews
Eric ong,5,The fish ball noodles stall has been in operation for at least 40 years. The portion is more than usual for the price of $2.50. The laksa is equally good and worth trying.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118287077822086640160/reviews
Chee Kiong,5,"The 5 stars is for Pandan Gardens Fishball Noodles (PGFN). I find its dry sauce is very matching with its white/flat noodles whereby its a harmony of taste between the various ingredients. I started eating it about 6 years ago and I'm willing to travel from North East all the way just to have it. Its other branches though may use the same sauces but I find them different as compared to the original.

Anyway this coffeeshop has a wide variety of food too. The prata in the morning, cheap chicken rice and sze char for the lunch and dinner. If you fancy drinking beer while eating ribs, you can also go next door to Ministry of Ribs. Nuff said.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102894000794903429883/reviews
