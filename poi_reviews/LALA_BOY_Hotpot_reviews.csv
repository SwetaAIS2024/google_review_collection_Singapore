WPin P,5,"This is my first time trying out lala hotpot … and OMG this is now one of my fav food! 🤩

The lala hotpot is really good - cooked over charcoal giving it that X-factor yummines 😋 the soup is 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ nice balance of flavour, not overpowering not too bland … very yummy

The pork belly is nice & fresh - not too thinly sliced & not too much belly fat 😁
The vegetables are fresh & decent size portion too.
The only thing I didn’t quite fancy is the fish paste - the flavour is ok but don’t really enjoy the texture. Will try the shrimp paste next time.

The service is pretty good too - attentive but do note that quite a number of the workers are foreigners, so their English & Chinese are not great.

And I love the ‘hanging tissues’! And they also provide free snacks.
Highly recommended, will definitely be back again & again & again ….",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117893368337848889092/reviews

Gator,4,"Drove past this restaurant many times and finally got to try them out yesterday for dinner. We had the lala hotpot and added some other dishes like pork belly and some vegetables.

The broth was good as the lala served was fresh. We added some Chinese wine which patrons could readily used placed on the condiments table.

Service was very friendly and forthcoming which we appreciated. The price was reasonable.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
Eric Kee,4,"The soup base is slightly gamey with the pork taste, their home made chili was nice, fish was not that fresh and lychee pork was nice. Team members were attentive and helpful.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112727920133358300431/reviews
CF Ngim,5,"Good service as regularly top up soup. Soup taste nice, not too salty and a bit on peppery side. Nice touch with the fire show of cooking lala giving the soup a smoky taste. Lala was fresh, not muddy unlike past reviews. Enjoyed the idea of hanging tissue (a different touch). Overall, the ingredients were fresh, recommend fish skin, pork belly, canbage and bean curd rolls. Nice touch of snacks at doorway, service crew was friendly esp the Chinese guy. Spent rm160 on 4 adults (did not eat too full as keeping tummy for dessert), left feeling satisfied. Never pressured to order more. Price a bit high for Malaysian standards to visit on regular basis due to location. Was 80% full on a Sat evening.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111256153224868812922/reviews
