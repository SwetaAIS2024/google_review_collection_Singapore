Elna Tan,5,"This is a mix of commercial with B1 industrial units . As a B1 industrial space - it truly is where you will find functionality meets convenience and accessibility. Situated within 3 mins walk to Tai Seng MRT, commuting is a breeze, ensuring seamless connectivity for employees and clients alike. With TOP in 2011, it remains clean and modern, the corridors are neat - suitable for business clientsâ€™ visits. What sets the light industrial units apart are those with north / south -facing orientation, allowing abundant natural light to flood the space, fostering a productive and vibrant work environment. You find a good mix of creative tenants from tailor, dance studio, to events company here.
Tenants appreciate the attached bathroom in every unit.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104513226543032200659/reviews
Jo K.,1,The female toilet on level 1 is distressing to use. Two out of three toilets can be used. One toilet seat is blackened. The other has a Toilet door that has no lock. The taps run at a trickle so cannot wash hands effectively. ðŸ¦ ðŸ¦ ðŸ¦ ,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106223395921756091650/reviews

Taming Nettles,3,"not a fan of this place. claustrophobic and walk-ways are dark. feels real sketchy. parking isnâ€™t the best. option to park behind the building and walk all way round or hope the parallel parking lots are available which are few.
came here only cos the Tupperware service centre is here.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104750991587458727342/reviews
