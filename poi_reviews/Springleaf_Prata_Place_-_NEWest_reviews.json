For the teh masala, even worse, for the price of $2.70, was expecting taste much better than the hawker side, but was just mehhh‚Ä¶ and worse , the portion they packed was not even 3/4  cup full when I poured it out at home! Felt cheated this time . The least you could do with the price hike, be fair to consumer . üôè",

I have to say the curry tasted sour and the quality of the prata and murtabak quality has severely deteriorated. The kosong prata was too oily and dense. The Bee Hoon Goreng was bland and very greasy. The murtabak was too oily compared to the last time I had it there. Maybe the chef was changed but I‚Äôm definitely not going back to try it again.",

      "text": "It's the most crispy prata in Singapore. The taste is nice and 2 choices of curry (fish/chicken) free flow. Furthermore,  the curry is unique and they kept them in a warmer where at anytime you dine in the curry is warm/hot\n\nService deserves compliments because it's Q and order style. Unlike other places where you take a seat first and when comes to ordering you became invisible and nobody is taking orders. Give a thumbs up for the thoughtfulness of the ordering style. ü•∞üëç",

The only downside is that the curry doesn‚Äôt quite compare to the one we had at Railway Mall, and the coffee is just okay. However, the service and ambience here are much nicer than at Railway Mall. Overall, I would definitely recommend it!",
