      "text": "+ A poster outside says that 40% of the dough in this restaurant chain is made by People with Disabilities (PWDs), with 100% as their eventual target. They're also partnering Rainbow Autistic Centre on the Seeds Cafe.\n\n+ There's a stopwatch-button game at the cashier counter. The idea is to hit the button such that the timer indicates an exact specified fixed time. The male casher was kind enough to let us try a few times, but we only got within 0.01sec of it.\n\n= Food quality was ok\n\n- Preparation time was long.\n\n= Prices start from $1.40 for plain prata. No minimum order. Chicken briyani start from $8.50.\n\n+ Free-flow fish curry and chicken curry sauce at the dispenser station.\n\n+ Very close to the Wild Wild Wet main entrance.",

      "text": "Great food quality and service from this outlet! Been patronising this outlet since it opened. The staff there are friendly and hardworking. Special mention to Sudarsan for his good service. We couldn’t finish our murtabak and asked to takeaway. He did for us willingly and joked with us. He even asked us if we need curry even though we only takeaway the 3 small pieces and he really packed curry for us. Highly recommend to come here!",

Also, after waiting for so long, we still got the wrong order (1 less egg prata as shown in the photos).",

      "text": "Springleaf Prata Place is hands down one of the best prata spots in Singapore! The menu is creative, with both traditional and unique modern twists – I highly recommend the Ultimate Murtabak and Plaster Blaster. The prata is crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and full of flavor. Their curries are rich and perfectly spiced.\n\nThe staff is friendly, the service is quick even during busy hours, and the place is clean and well-maintained. It’s a great spot for breakfast, late-night cravings, or a casual meal with friends. If you're in Singapore and love prata, Springleaf is a must-visit!",
