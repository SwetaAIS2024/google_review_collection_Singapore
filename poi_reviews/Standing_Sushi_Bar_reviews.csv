R T,5,Had the omakase at 108. Good value for money. Food was good and service was excellent. The air-conditioning was T working well but the staff made an extra effort to bring in an air cooler and were very apologetic. This type of service is indeed admirable.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103062359122634624279/reviews
Ruby Peng (wanderlustruby),5,We loved chef Hugo for our Omakase experience! It’s so nice he can introduce each item in both English and Chinese. Loved every dish! We tried the starter set but would totally come back for the premium set,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111061924363706483960/reviews
Marc Singh,4,"came by standing sushi bar for dinner and had an enjoyable experience, as we always do. probably the best casual sushi place around — good variety on the menu without being expensive, good flavours, and very convenient location.

we had the salmon with ponzu & chilli roll, salmon sashimi, firecracker roll, prawn king maki roll, and wagyu with ponzu chilli sushi. the firecracker roll stood out, and the wagyu sushi had that rich, melt-in-your-mouth bite. overall, the food was very decent — enjoyable but still has a bit of room to improve in terms of taste and quality.

service was excellent. staff were warm, attentive, and genuinely made the meal feel more enjoyable.

will definitely be back when I’m craving good and affordable sushi without the fuss!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111474566471418870196/reviews
Wee Han Tan,5,"One of the best places to have salmon sashimi without breaking the bank. They have a promotion every Mondays and Thursdays where one portion of sashimi (5 slices) is 3.90++. Although the size of the sashimi slices have become smaller over the years due to inflation, it is still worth it to come here! They also have set meals that are very worth the money and promotions for sake and beer. If you're coming for the salmon promo, come early to avoid long queues. Also, they close pretty early, so come early to avoid disappointment!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113994885645615349944/reviews
Irene Lim,3,"Standing Sushi Bar at Odeon Towers offers a range of Japanese dishes, including sushi, sashimi, and robatayaki. While the menu features a variety of options, the pricing is on the higher side, with main courses ranging from approximately $16 to $27.  The quality of the food is generally acceptable, though it may not consistently meet the expectations set by the price point. For instance, the Chirashi bowl and mixed sashimi bowl have been noted for their quality, though some patrons feel the servings could be more generous.  The restaurant does offer promotions on certain days, such as discounted salmon sashimi on Mondays and Thursdays, which can provide better value for money.  However, outside of these promotions, the overall dining experience may not justify the higher costs for some customers. In summary, while Standing Sushi Bar provides a decent selection of Japanese cuisine, the combination of its pricing and food quality may not offer the best value compared to other options available in Singapore. ￼ ￼",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105804445185126817371/reviews
