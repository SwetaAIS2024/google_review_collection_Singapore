Stefanie Sun,5,"Dr James is very professional,responsible,and friendly.
I had suffered knee pain for a long time, By chance I went to see dr James, he gave me PRP injection and some medicine. After the PRP injection the next day, I didâ€™t feel any pain in my knee. Now I can runï¼Œcan do exercise like usual.
Also I went to his clinic to see cough, covid, eyesâ€¦.. He is a trustworthy and reassuring doctor. I thank him for keeping me away from pain.
The clinicâ€™s staffs are also friendly and patient. I have never seen they shout at the patientã€‚
Highly recommended!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111895557468751948983/reviews
Cao Cao,1,"1. I had a terrible cold, the doctor spent around 3 min asking and observing. Done.  He prescribed medicine of SGD170, while it was later proven only the antibiotics was useful, and the other 5 medicine was not necessary.
2. My wife got cold. He gave medicine without warning the side effect of causing insomnia. My wife suffered very very bad insomnia for ten days and only realised that it was caused by the medicine because she saw another doctor today.
Overall, irresponsible, unprofessional, completely NOT recommended.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109882669602451729562/reviews

A.u.d L,5,"Dr James is very professional, caring and trustworthy. He truly cares for the patients, offered practical and great advice. He goes extra miles to give us a call and follow up on our health matters.  Iâ€™m grateful to Dr James - he has helped my boy whoâ€™s suffering from knee joint pain for a year. We are glad to chanced upon his clinic, even though we have moved out of Kovan area, we will still go to Dr James if we require medical treatment.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100673765044947466805/reviews
