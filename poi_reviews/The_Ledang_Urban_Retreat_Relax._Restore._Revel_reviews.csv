Liza Shane Rauf,4,"Good spa for massage and plan to do my pedicure manicure next time. And there is a nice cafe that serve Malay, Chinese and western cuisine. I love their Masak Lemak Daging Salai. Thumbs up. Will coming back again. Next time go for swimming and try to use their gym facilities.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105476768296249897790/reviews
Xuan Kok,5,"I had to spend a little bit of time to find massage locations that serve pregnant ladies and I chanced upon Urban Spa. We were initially suspicious of the location as the place looks abandoned. However, it turned out to be a great experience. The retreat centre itself was well maintained. I like that there‚Äôs shower available. The massage was great, my husband and I both loved our masseurs, mine was Carla and his was Dan. Will definitely visit again in the coming weeks or so!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106383000621684398005/reviews
Leonard Teo,4,"Good, with room for improvements. The clubhouse is nicely designed and the pool is good. Though the water in the pool trends to get dirty very quickly, probably due to maintenance being far between. Restaurant service is so so but the food is fine.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108378507127098537837/reviews
David Marchand,1,"Since it's been leased out and abandonned for few years  this place has became not interesting at all and not even what it was supposed to be at the initial stage by UEM unfortunately...

It's such a shame as this place has such a tremendous potential and to see what it is becoming after such a huge investment it's a pitty. It's not even a club anymore, not a place to enjoy for nearby residents and not really an event place either.

For now avoid it at all cost and hopefully this will be taken over by some new more capable tenants in the next period of time for us to enjoy again the great place it once was.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107055401803141687565/reviews
