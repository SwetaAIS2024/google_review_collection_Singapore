My wife loves the Black pepper crab, it was fresh, not overcooked and restaurant standard. I personally like their salted egg sotong; stir fried to perfection. Service was great and I was always greeted with smiles while the lady took my order. Thank you again Chuan Hai Seafood for the delicious meal! Best Zi Char in the West!",

We really enjoyed the pork trotter bee hoon and the steamed crab was on point and perfectly cooked. The lala soup also had a nice pepper hit. Prices were also reasonable. Will definitely revisit.",

Food is fabulous and portion is good. The steam fish is good and fresh but the sauce is a bit salty. Prawn paste chicken is crispy and not too salty.  The tofu and deer meat is nice. The kailan is nice and we love the generous toppings of fried garlics. We wanted to cut the cake at the table and the staff were nice to provide us with paper plates and fork. We will be back to try more dishes.",
