      "text": "Great coffee and toast keeps me returning for more despite multiple price hikes over past 5 years. BUT be warned that they almost always screw up my order. They either forgot or send out my items to others my mistake. T Even with little crowd, they cannot send out the items correctly more than 50% of time, esp the toast. More often than not, my toast or egg turns cold as I wait. Needless the say my coffee too. I recount 8 of 10 times I felt this way. Even if I requested to collect all items all at once, it gets ignored and I get item by item. Then they slip upüò≠.\nOddly, when they are able and you sit nearby, they serve you the items, dare not ask for more but still the errors persist.",

For coffee, it's quite rich which is more suitable for morning.\nI also tried another type of kaya bun but was a bit disappointed because the bun itself is quite moist and less airy.",

      "text": "My favorite place to have a traditional Singapore breakfast sets. Although price is at higher side than other stalls selling the same sets, this stall is never lack of patrons. Do expect long queue on weekends and public holidays.\nThe coffee here is good and strong. Half-boiled eggs was cooked in perfection, still juicy but not too watery. Must try here is their kaya butter toast: a crispy toasted bread, spread with fragrant kaya jam and tops with slices of butter that melts in your mouth. Yummy!",

Kopi is great and the owner and staff and really friendly and cheerful. It has a nice vibe to it and always a pleasant experience. Thumbs up üëçüèΩ",
