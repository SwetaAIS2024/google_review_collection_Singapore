David Wong,5,"Steven and Warren are by far the most professional car specialists I met. If without their meticulous and professional service to troubleshoot my new 2nd hand car in time, I would have to end up overhaul my whole engine. Even my previous servicing at agent never realised the seriousness of my issue.

It is clearly they have strong passion in the work they do and Steven is always so patient and prompt to answer my many questions. Did my configuration of DRL, LED Headlights, Intelligence Accelerator, normal servicing etc and so far all are really value for money as their prices is reasonable considering their level of expertise. They also won't recommend things they honestly think you won't need.

Final conclusion I believe they should be the top in what they specialise in Singapore - Mercedes. Just visit them and you will know why they are so good at what they does.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117509461354450986725/reviews
