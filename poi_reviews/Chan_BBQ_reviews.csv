S W,1,"Like all other reviews have mentioned, their food is not up to standard. Stingray is not fresh, and the portion is so small. The sauce for the Lala is super diluted and each clam has residues of water when you open it up. Most of the clams are empty as well",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101680285403210562045/reviews
