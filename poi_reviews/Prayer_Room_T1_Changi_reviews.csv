Nursafuraa A.talib,3,"Guide to Prayer Room at Terminal 1
Go to Departure at Level 2 (use lift) will arrive near counter no. 8.
After that, go check in luggage
Then, you may go to immigresen > scan passport.

Turn right, you will find sign board prayer room. Follow that sign board, find escalator near Hall D and go to Level 3.
Turn right again and you will see toilet. Stop for wudhu in the toilet. There is dedicated area for ablution in there.

I used hotel slipper so my shoes will not wet. There is telekung and prayer mat inside.

Next go straight find the prayer room.
