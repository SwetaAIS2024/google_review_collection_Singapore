WaiLeng Lee,4,"Where all you need that is natural and without ""extras"" to harm our body is sold in this little shop.  Includes various supplements (highly recommended if you're looking for real stuff eg. vitamin eg. D, K , supplements for bone, eyes etc... ),  vegetables, nuts, daily provisions (food and non-food) are available here.
I love their natto miso, and vitamin C from S. America forest which is unlike those commercial ones readily available containing artificial ingredients.  It may cost more but in the end healthier for our body & no hidden costs.
Another hidden gem is their most knowledgeable staff ! Happy shopping...",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105350220043493872013/reviews
