yesmine ang,5,"""I recently ordered takeaway from this KFC location and was thoroughly impressed! The staff were incredibly kind and friendly, making the experience even more enjoyable.

I was also impressed by the newly renovated store - it's now super bright and spacious! The modern atmosphere definitely adds to the overall experience.

Of course, the food was finger-lickin' good as always!

Overall, I highly recommend this KFC location for both dine-in and takeaway. Keep up the fantastic service and delicious food!""",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114901438026280889732/reviews
Pier Koh Ming Chang,5,"Would like to commend on the manager of Lot One’s KFC — Katherine. The app somehow changed my location to another location and she still tried to make it work instead of having me travel all the way to another branch just to get my food. Patient and kind and knows what to do when there’s an issue.

Thank you Katherine! :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117162333493342084046/reviews
Dee Cee (The Dead Cockroach),3,"The place was recently newly renovated, although I don't see the need to.

There's not much changes except new kiosks, and some chairs were switched to benches.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114499637556582554619/reviews

Ikhwan Isnawan,1,"UPDATE: I I’m going to write my review this. I order kiosk at 7:20pm after I run errands from Unity pharmacy shop. At around 8:20pm I was standing too long after 1 hour to make my payment by cash. Many customers are waited 1 or 2 HOURS to get food on time after order were mixed up not in sequence. 2 staffs are rude & bad attitude.

And also NO sprite & no ICE at all. To use my Coke instead. That I order 8676 my receipt. Won’t come back again. After my food receive @ 9:42pm is 2 HOURS & 20 minutes.

I give ZERO star.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115945221732432905702/reviews
