I like the kimchi soup and bibimbap.\nAcross the hall there’s more options like Vietnamese and Indian and it’s less busy. But the Vietnamese is not good.\nThe drinks line is always long. They have lots of little fried dim sum items.\nThere’s also dessert / milk tea here now for a good price.",

      "text": "So glad they finally moved the claypot rice stall to the main dining hall. By far the standout among stalls in this cafeteria. Been treating myself countless Friday evening dinners after a whole week of hard work with the consistently tasty herbal claypot rice soups.\n\nOther notable meal is from the new Taiwanese stall which offers more variety compared to its predecessor (also of Taiwanese food). Not only sells typical large breaded fried chicken, but also braised meat, Taiwanese sausage, and even filled guo bao (a relatively rare treat here in SG). The portion is generally somewhat smaller though. The Xi'an noodle stall is also pretty good as well.\n\nMost other stalls tend to be overpriced for their quality of their offerings though (common problem among Koufu stalls) - the mediocre cai fan with $6++ one-meat-one-veg being the most notorious offender. The drink and dessert stall are okay though although not so special.",

Wouldn’t say they are very good also but the rest of the food is so bad in comparison. Just walk 15 mins to NIE for affordable and nicer food if you have time.",
