Let's dive in yeah..\n\nFood:\nNice and it's not the best from what we had eaten from others but hey, its a good effort yeah.. and we enjoyed it nonetheless..\n\nService:\nSlow is something that we will describe. Many of the customers talk to each other and commented how slow it was just for their order. Cashier and dispatcher was also helping in the kitchen..\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe koufu location is a great place to have your meals.. it is just that there is a need to focus on this stall due to the speed and cooking process .\n\nAll in all, we appreciate that there is a Korean/jap food here.. but we will appreciate it more if they can smile more and prep faster.",

The salmon/chicken and the sotong dish that we ordered, the salmon is sliced so thin and the chicken portion is small about the size of 2 chicken nuggets put together. The sotong portion is equally small and not fresh with mostly consist of onions. Totally not worth paying.",

It clearly wasn't the food delivery rider as the bags were tightly sealed and every other item was untouched. Ridiculous standards.\n\nFurthermore, the food that arrived tasted horrible. First and last time purchasing from here. Would give zero stars if I had the option.",
