Kar. P.,5,"Came to try because of the high ratings, and it did not disappoint!

We ordered one dry and one soup you mian, one fish ball $5 and one pork ball $6.5, both were delicious and the soup was flavorful. Would be even better if they could provide more vegetables but overall it was a satisfying bowl of noodles.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110359293819628026788/reviews
Sean Goh,4,"Check out this Ban mian stall that is considered relatively new at this Hawker centre. Always notice this stall but didn't get a chance to try it until today. They have 7 different types of Ban Mian to choose from, and prices start from SGD4.5 onward.

I ordered the sliced pork version with you mian. The portion of noodle was quite generous. Sliced pork was tender and the the meatball was well seasoned. The bowl of noodle also came with the mani vegetable. The soup is also flavourful and I finish it.

Overall. This Ban mian is definitely above average, and I would recommend it.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Steve,5,"This ban mian is surprisingly delicious! The noodles were al dente and the perfect Q! The fried shallots and the black sauce (dry version) complements the noodle well! Portion is good and they uses mani cai!! Soup is light with hints of anchovies

I will come back again to try out their soup version",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108679347901594276134/reviews
Serene Tan,5,"Nice dry ban mian $4.50
I like the Q texture of the ban mian and savory dark sauce. Vege is mani cai. Chili paste gives it a spicy kick. Soup is light and tasty with no added MSG. Recommend.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107538103583075098533/reviews
