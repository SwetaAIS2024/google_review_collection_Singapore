G Y,5,"A must visit if you’re at NTU! Amazing architecture that never fails to disappoint in my opinion, though this was my first time visiting.

The tutorial rooms within are very nicely designed too - each table has 2 buttons which are used to toggle the connected computer (I presume) during presentation. Thankfully I think the rooms are unlocked during Open House day so I got to have a peek inside.

Water dispensers (both hot and cold) are also available outside washrooms.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111376056027123649376/reviews
Aakash 21,4,"The overall experience of the building is nice. You have daylit spaces as well as dim spaces suiting to the kind of lighting you prefer. The overall architecture and Design by Thomas Heather wick is fabulous. It's a craft piece in its own. Definitely recommend people to visit the space, it's free for all. The building looks over the biggest Engineererd timber building, the New Business School building in NTU.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114609485503548538073/reviews

Isabelle K,5,"For those who are curious, this location has a lot of tutorial rooms for classes. You can also come here to study independently during your free time.

If my memory serves me well, level 1 has a ""communication cube"" (also known as the ""COMM CUBE"") where you can go to ask for assistance with your thesis, project report, résumé, etc. A/C is also present inside.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103399878952112985784/reviews
