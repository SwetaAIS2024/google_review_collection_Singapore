Ice RJ,3,"As someone who works in the area, I highly recommend Sinfood for a quick, affordable, and healthy meal. This mixed rice and vegetable meat shop offers a variety of dishes that can be enjoyed  in budget.

Personal favorites include their delicious Tomato Egg and Lemon Chicken. The food is freshly prepared.

However, I do want to note that the curry chicken can be a bit of a letdown for those who are sensitive to strong chicken smells. so if you're particularly sensitive, you may want to opt for their fried chicken dishes instead.

Overall, Sinfood is a great option for a healthy and  affordable meal in Changi Business Park. Give it a try!""

TESSA,1,"$9 Cai fan meal with small portion - 2 veggies and 1 fish.

I recently visited this cai fan (economic rice) stall, and I have to say that I was really disappointed.
While I was expecting an affordable meal, what I got was nothing short of shocking in terms of pricing. For just two vegetables and a small portion of fish, I was charged $9.

The vegetables were decent but nothing special â€” standard cai fan price, though portions were on the smaller side.

In terms of taste, it was passable, but definitely not worth $9. I've had far better meals at other cai fan stalls at a lower cost. Too much!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103919242036366223640/reviews
Chen Johnson,1,"If I was served bad food and poor coffee at a mixed rice place, I'd just grimace and take it. But the fact that they're now fishing for 5* reviews is a scummy business practice and I think lends itself to misleading advertising.
So here's a picture of today's coffee. Normally, this barely toes the line between super roasted and burnt, and today it fell on the wrong side of the line, which happens about half the time.
When I DO order econ bee Hoon and kway teow, my supposedly deep fried ingredients either come to me bone dry or swimming in oil, and always room temperature. Bear in mind that this is before 8am, so I have no idea how a large pile of food can get cold so fast.
Despite this, the place sees a long line every weekday, which is a reflection of the lack of other food options at this price point rather than its actual quality.
This place won't give you food poisoning, but I'd suggest other places (Changi City Point is next door) if you have actual functioning taste buds.
No, I don't need free ice cream either.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102009231607870899791/reviews
