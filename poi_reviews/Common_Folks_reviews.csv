Yen Ming Yek,5,"I absolutely love their pizza and gelato – both are always fresh and delicious! The cappuccino is superb, and the barista even crafted a cute rabbit latte art, which was such a lovely touch. The spaghetti was good, though I think it could be a bit better, but still quite enjoyable. Overall, a great experience!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116464226112617605739/reviews
Beary Beary,5,"Very Reasonably Priced

On a weekday at lunch, this was the only restaurant at the Grassroots club. The others happened to be unavailable that day.

First thing I noticed was how friendly and sincere the customer facing folks are. Food is ordered at the counter but they will serve you when your food comes.

The western food served was at a great price - $11.90 for fish and chips, $8 for 6 pieces of chicken wing. There is also a 1:1 beer promotion amongst other offers.

The place is quiet and cosy. Definitely great for a
nice and quiet place to have a chat.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101788329090998743221/reviews
Kwan Hi,5,"Quiet, comfy and simple.

There are days where you want something fancy and extravagant. In others, you may just be seeking for an easy option to fill a void in your day, and Common Folks offers just that. I ordered a Mocha and a Carbonara, providing much needed comfort amidst a rainy day. The atmosphere was also pleasant on this Saturday afternoon, with the other patrons and staff just minding about their day. Overall, a very peaceful option for anyone to seek refuge from a busy day.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107688744818507250363/reviews
Deborah L,2,"Quiet cafe with a huge area. Nice staff but service was slow as they were understaffed. Food came in like > 20mins.
Had high hopes for the dishes but their pasta was sadly flavourless :( didn’t had any tomato flavour and sauce was mild and thin too. The baked rice was decent and peppery, but had nothing special to it.
Ice cream with waffles was generally nice, waffles was hot & just slightly crispy, got different ice cream flavours and some weren’t that nice, either unexpected taste or that it tasted q artificial. Would suggest their black sesame and earl grey tea flavour if you’re getting ice cream.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111237743627442597899/reviews
