She carefully treated me for my plantar fasciitis, and after just six therapy sessions, I noticed significant improvement‚Äîsomething I didn‚Äôt expect so quickly. With two additional sessions, my pain is now almost gone, which I hadn‚Äôt anticipated happening before flying back to my country.\n\nI must mention that Ashika is very sweet and friendly. I really enjoyed our chitchat during the therapy, which helped me feel more comfortable and open with her.\n\nAdditionally, all the staff members are professional, polite, and well-mannered. I am very happy with their service and highly recommend them. Thank you so much!",
