Would also like to commend her for helping our son who was sick to make sure we were looked after.\n\nThe rest of the team at the booking desk were also awesome and friendly (Halim, Nova, Ayu, and Lindah).\n\nOur family hope to come back to Singapore next year and will definitely be back on the zip line for another round ðŸ˜ƒ",

He was incredibly supportive and motivated her to overcome her fears, guiding her step by step until she achieved her first flip! His friendly and approachable nature made the experience enjoyable and memorable for both of us. Thank you, Adi, for going above and beyond to inspire confidence in my child. Highly recommended!",

All the staff we talked to was so kind, huge shout out to Lucy especially!  Would recommend bringing a clear bag to put your phone in to take a video or photo so you can take your own photo.  For early bird tickets book a day ahead!",
