Dream11 Dream,5,"1. The hospitality staff is excellent. Especially Ralph Ng who helped us a lot during our check out with big bags and kids. Rooms are well maintained with pleasant city views.
2. Small Hand wash is preferred compared to soaps because of hygiene reasons.
3. A heated pool would be a nice add on to be used any time of the day or late evening. Day time usage was excellent.
4. The in house laundry and dryer was a massive help.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116210734911740610756/reviews
Kerin Parker,5,"Great location, close to the MRT and in the heart of Chinatown.

Staff are friendly and the food was great.  As always, we were well looked after by Ivy in the Executive Club Lounge.  She is a great asset to the hotel. Unfortunately we missed Alice in the restaurant this time as she has also looked after us well in the past. We look forward to returning soon.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110818666562358842023/reviews
Tee,3,"⭐⭐⭐☆☆ (3/5)

The shower, bed, and view from the Executive King Suite were excellent. The late checkout at 3pm was a great bonus, and the three pieces of laundry per day included was an excellent bonus. Check in and check out was super quick and super easy.

However, there were quite a few issues that impacted the stay. On the day of checkout, a pram suddenly appeared in our room two hours before we were due to leave at 1pm, taking up space we needed to pack. It was frustrating and unnecessary. More concerning was that our door was somehow unlocked with all our belongings inside, which was a major security issue. The executive lounge was disappointing, with barely any snacks available, and when they did appear, they were gone within minutes.

Breakfast was a complete mess in both the lounge and main dining area. The biggest concern was the sick staff member at breakfast who was coughing uncontrollably while handling all the cutlery, maskless, and still working for three consecutive days despite giving feedback to staff. This was unacceptable and a serious hygiene issue.

Overall, I would stay again for the location, price, and spacious room, but I would absolutely avoid breakfast. Service and hygiene standards need to improve.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102336351798737738855/reviews

Santosh Sudha,5,"Amazing location! Lovely staff and value for money. The rooms are basic but sufficient enough, the rooms are bigger than most 5 star hotels in Singapore. There’s a direct pathways to Chinatown MRT and Clarke Quay MRT, as well as loads of food places nearby. Reva and Yvette were really friendly and helpful. I would recommend if you are staying in Singapore for a few days.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118187920514008473635/reviews
