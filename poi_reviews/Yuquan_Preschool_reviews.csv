Wan Ee Chua,5,"Both my boys attended Yuquan pre-school. They absolutely love their time in Yuquan. They enjoyed the learning in class. Trs inspired them to find out more about general knowledge. This school promotes care for the environment and actively involves the children. They have unique farm to table dining experience where they contribute to growing and farming vege in the school garden. This is an amazing garden where learning comes alive. Not only do they grow food on it, they observe creatures and insects that grow in it- science in action. After graduating from Yuquan, they Wld always reminisce about their times there and pay visits to their favourite tr, Tr Lee San.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115327289034800421878/reviews
Chan Rachel,5,"Yuquan preschool is a wonderful school that truly promotes bilingual education.
I am grateful that my daughter who has just transferred over in K2 has progressed very well in mandarin within a short span of time.
She used to be extremely hesitant to speak any word of mandarin and yet she is now able to converse with me in mandarin.
Yuquan has also taught her well in Art, English and Mathematics.
Teachers are very warm and nurturing. My daughter looks forward to school daily and will be missing it once she graduates to P1 next year.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114559292920276038021/reviews
Maggie Kuang,5,"My little girl has been with Yuquan since PG. She has been happy from day 1 and progressed well both in Chinese and English. This lovely little preschool has a special Chinese language program which uses the founder’s own education material and approach and works really well. My daughter is K1 currently and can already read a lot of Chinese characters and probably a hundred of Chinese idioms. The small class size, neighbourhood feeling (non-commercial), the lovely garden and outdoor playground, “auntie-cook food” (non catering) and of course the teachers who seem to genuinely love the kids and their jobs are all why we like this preschool.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112772303918751723724/reviews
Ethan Li,5,"I found this school by chance while walking around looking at preschools near my house. I rang the bell and the principal showed me around. The first thing that struck me was that the children all greeted me without being told and they all seemed so happy. I knew that I had found the right place for my children. Both of my children have attended Yuquan from playgroup up to kindergarten. The homely environment and most wonderful teachers treat them like family and have instilled in them the right values of respect, courtesy and empathy besides the usual academic stuff. The intensive curriculum in mandarin has laid a very strong foundation for their future. Today my children are very confident in both chinese and english and far exceed their peers in all other aspects. Soft skills like gardening, taking care of insects and school outings gave my children the joy of learning and going to school.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115435088741186728651/reviews
melanie chen,5,"If you are looking for a preschool with heart, a place where your child will learn happily, pick up strong academic and social skills, as well as moral values, Yuquan Preschool is definitely the place to go.

My two kids are currently with Yuquan Preschool - K1 and K2. We love the school for so many reasons but here are the Top 3 reasons:

1️⃣ Bilingualism - Most schools have a strong focus on English which is the main language used for perhaps 80% of the curriculum. In Yuquan, I believe the split is closer to 50-50, which is key since children pick up languages the fastest in preschool. My kids are effectively bilingual and are very strong in both their spoken and written English and Chinese.

2️⃣ Nurturing, warm environment - This preschool has a homely feel. It is a small establishment - just one class per level, so everyone knows each other very well, akin to the 'kampung' spirit. The older kids (K1s and K2s) get the chance to take care of the younger ones, who in turn socialise and learn from their big korkors and jiejies. We can tell that the teachers there, especially the Principal, are full of passion. They love the kids and treat them like their own children. They are loving yet firm, instilling in the children good values and habits. In turn, you can see the trust and love that the children have in their teachers. My kids actually miss school while on vacation, and they are always demanding that I share their photos with their teachers.

3️⃣ Holistic curriculum - We love the fact that Yuquan Preschool included a wide range of activities within the curriculum at no extra charges (i.e. inclusive in the school fees). Examples include melodica, table tennis, calligraphy, and gymnastics. In addition, the children also do gardening in the school's mini garden, and harvest the crop (bittergourd inclusive!!!) for their lunch!

Two thumbs up for Yuquan Preschool! Keep up the good work!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112924724905887712138/reviews
