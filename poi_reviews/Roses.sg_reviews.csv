tanchi,1,Not good experience. Did not deliver time as agreed  on valentines day despite placing order well in advance. Affected my entire dinner plan and wife did not recieve flowers as planned but only well into the late night (2100) when we were at a resturant as I wasted many hours waiting at home (should have been delivered from 1300-1700). First time using Roses.sg and it was disappointing and would not recommend to friends or family. Will not use in the future and will use other companies that I use in the past that are more reliable. Just not a good experience.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103602696684681239224/reviews
