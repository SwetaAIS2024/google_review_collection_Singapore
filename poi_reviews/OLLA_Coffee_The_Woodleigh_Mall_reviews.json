      "text": "Home of the Singapore 🇸🇬 Barista Champion 🏆 2022! Ok lah, in true-blue Singaporean Fashion, I had to come by and try this out! 🤣 Lol\n\nConveniently located 📍next to Woodleigh Village Hawker and at the ground floor of Woodleigh Mall 🏬, you will find this nice little café. Took my breakfast 🍜 at the hawker and came by to have my morning cup ☕️ and they are just 3️⃣ mins across 🛣️ the Hawker.\n\nCafé : Woody 🪵, Cosy ☺️ and Bright 💡. It’s not huge but it’s warm and very welcoming. Clean 🫧🧼of course and the seating 🪑outside are pet friendly. (I sat next to a nice Poodle 🐩)\n\nStaff : 2️⃣ of them served me. Lady 💁🏼‍♀️ took the order and prepared my cakes 🍰 while the guy 💁🏼‍♂️, the barista, prepared the drinks. Very friendly, smiling and was more than happy to run some recommendations. Regret, I should have taken my breakfast here as well. Sometimes I wish I had 2️⃣ stomachs, the menu 📝 looks so good!\n\nCoffee ☕️ and Cakes 🍰 : The cakes were nice and moist. Especially the chocolate, it hit the notes with the coffee ☕️. The Lemon 🍋 Cake 🍰came with a tiny cup of concentrated lemon juice and OMG, it was so strong 💪, lucky I didn’t pour it over the cake. Both were very nice and refreshing.\n\nCoffee – Round 1 : Filter / Pour Over …. We ordered both options from Brazil 🇧🇷 and Colombia 🇨🇴. I preferred the Colombia which gave off a robust taste of Fig, Plum 🍈, Persimmon and flowery 🌸? (Guessing) Brazil was sweeter with hints of Sultanas 🍇and Peachy 🍑or Apricot? They both complement the cakes and it was well prepared.\n\nCoffee – Round 2 : Café De Olla (Spiced Long Black). Ok ….. This one is totally out for me 🙅‍♂️. It’s too “herby” 🌿🪴 for me…. If you allow ✅ me, it’s almost like drinking Chinese 🧧medicine. The Chai and Spices were just too overwhelming for me to the point, I couldn’t appreciate the coffee. Skip!\n\nI will be back to try the rest of the brew, perhaps a more conventional Latte or Americano?",

One sip of that rich, roasty flavor, and I was hooked.\n\nThank you OLLA.",
