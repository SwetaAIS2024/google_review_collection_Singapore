Sarah Too,5,Dr Moses Lai has been my familyâ€™s doctor for 8 years. He is capable in managing my dadâ€™s diabetes and takes the time to teach my dad even things like diet and foot care. Definitely one of the more caring doctors who has a heart of gold.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108083757111149452039/reviews
Nia Wish,5,Went there just for covid vaccination so should be free of charge. Was expecting maybe there's some hidden consultation fees or something but indeed it's free of charge. Booked the appointment time but reached there earlier and was called just right on the dot of the timing which was great because it meant no time wasted. There's a cute nurse at the counter as well. Was expecting poor service because it's free but the young male doctor was professional and great consultation was still provided during the vaccination procedures. Highly recommended.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110715418717891565642/reviews
