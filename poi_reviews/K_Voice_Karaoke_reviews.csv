Kaleidoscope World,5,"I can confidently say that weve been around every single karaoke place in Singapore and K-Voice has one of the best sound system you'll ever find in our little red dot. I Promise you! I am a singer and i really like the sound quality, very smooth and easy song navigation via QR code. Literally wide range of song choices which we didnt find in most of the karaoke outlets we went to and whats really cool is that you can choose songs from YOUTUBE to sing along! This one is really very shiok one!  You will also be welcomed by the nicest couple owner Ms Yen and Towkay Steven who untiringly greets everybody with a big smile and  warm family-like  service. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109676567250652552612/reviews
JASMINE KIM,5,"Medium room able to fit 5 of us!
(You can imagine how spacious it is! )

Song list very up to date, can even use YouTube to search your favourite new songs that is probably not listed yet.
Owners at counter are very welcoming!

With the promotion, we paid $76 for 3hours of hearty singing!
Will definitely come back again if we are nearby! :))",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116238566634113413867/reviews
Neil Nicholas,4,"This is a cool place to come for a nice Karaoke time with family and friends.

Room is clean and sound system is great. Easy to use app for songs selections and more.

Though please take note that there is ‚ÄúNo Outside Food or Drinks‚Äù allowed. Wish they would update it on their Facebook page as there was a question asked about brining in food and it was ‚ÄúOK‚Äù

Owners are friendly and always giving a smile which is üòçüëç

Will come back again üëçüëç and also recommend all to come here for some fun.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108231980969965564177/reviews
