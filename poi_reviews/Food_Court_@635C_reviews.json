      "text": "Only come here for the western food as it's affordable and good. However the drinks shop lady is the rudest person I've met in my entire life. Wanted to pay by cash but I was short of a dollar so had to paynow and it took me a while to open my app as the reception was slow. I asked the lady politely \"$4 correct?\", she paused and looked at me for 10 seconds before saying \"I said $4 what, I told you multipe times.\" in a very irritated tone and proceeded to 'confirm' with another customer. Even the customer seemed taken aback and had to just shrug it off. She told me 1-2 times but is it so wrong to confirm again??? It slipped off my mind when I had to open the payment app.\n\nThe drinks are also overly expensive priced at $2 for the amount they give. I won't be coming back again.",
