His patience and ability to break things down make learning enjoyable, whether you’re a beginner or looking to refine your skills.\n\nHighly recommend if you’re looking for a great golf coach!",

I had a persistent hooking issue for my long irons and woods for quite some time. But after my first trial lesson, (signed up after) I had manage to resolve my hooking issue with Coach Syafiq. He also focused on my ball striking ability to get the compression upon impact. Very happy with the outcome of the trial lesson!",
