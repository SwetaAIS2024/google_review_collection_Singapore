Jamil Hossen,5,"If you‚Äôre at summer camp, you can buy snacks at the canteen. This kind of canteen is a little shop. At the canteen, you can buy little things like potato chips or a can opener. A canteen is like a convenience store. The other kind of canteen is good if you‚Äôre going on a hike ‚Äî fill it up with water and put it in your backpack, since there probably aren‚Äôt any of those other kinds of canteens out in the woods.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101213289591733924216/reviews
