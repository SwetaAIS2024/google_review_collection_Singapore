Wendee Chng,1,"Unpleasant experience buying caifan at this stall. They charged me SGD5.30 for 2 vegs and 1 chicken, that was freaking overpriced! The worst part is, when I reach home only to find that one of the veg (fried bittergourd) was already spoilt, it became sour and sticky. Damn irresponsible for a food stall to serve spoilt food for consumer. Definitely not gonna buy from this stall again!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109865007976769004275/reviews
BK Tan,1,"Expensive!!! As others mentioned, food prices are not labelled. Was feeling for bee hoon in the morning and ordered curry chicken and this fried pork? But when coming to payment I saw on the register they put it as fish and charged me $5 instead the price for the actual dish. Total for the dish came to be $6.50 for some curry chicken and pork. I confirmed with another staff that the price is correct and he said is correct and got me some extra pork and initially only 3-4 slices.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100759686258728376520/reviews
Kermit Goh,1,"Server is a China woman. Super rude and speaks with a brute tone. Food is lousy and expensive too. Paid $6.5 for 2 meat and a veg.

The 2 meats are minced pork+tofu (more tofu than pork) and fried bacon. The bacon is sooooo tough and it tastes gamey.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117539656240048086509/reviews
