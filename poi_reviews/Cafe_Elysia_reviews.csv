Poca Hontas,2,"The ambience and view on the 42nd floor is great. There is a manageable selection of drinks, primarily canned and bottled. The caf√© was tasty. The staff was very friendly.

Unfortunately the food isn't good. Instead of (Western) fast food, it would be a good idea to offer local, fresh food. With the feedback that the food was inedible, the staff was also a little overwhelmed. They did their best to satisfy us, but unfortunately the choice of ingredients and method of preparation is not good. You can make improvements here.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114076750695530815337/reviews
