      "text": "Dr Brian‚Äôs wholehearted commitment to optimising his patients‚Äô well-being is evident through his meticulous assessment of patients‚Äô symptoms and selection of appropriate investigative tests for accurate diagnoses and timely interventions.\n\nMy 71 year old mother had been seeing another cardiologist for many years, and despite regular check-ups, her heart valve regurgitation issue remained undetected until it progressed to the last stage of ‚Äòsymptomatic severe‚Äô. We decided to consult another cardiologist and it was truly a godsend that we were recommended by my mum‚Äôs GP to see Dr Brian Khoo, who promptly discovered the severity of her valve disease in the nick of time.\n\nMy mum‚Äôs health deteriorated very quickly, but Dr Khoo managed to stabilise her condition (through appropriate in-patient medication), so that she was well enough to undergo a heart valve replacement surgery with relatively low risk.\n\nDr Khoo recommended an excellent cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr Kang Ning, for my mum‚Äôs operation, which turned out to be a great success in solving her heart valve problem. With top-notch care from these two remarkable doctors, my mum recovered well enough to resume driving 5 weeks after her open heart surgery.\n\nDr Brian‚Äôs tireless dedication to safeguarding his patients‚Äô health also shines through in his attentive monitoring of my mum‚Äôs post-op condition and careful adjustments of her medications. He is always reassuring, encouraging and patient in his explanations.\n\nWe are immensely thankful for Dr Brian. His exceptional professionalism and kindness are truly first-class. We highly recommend him to anyone in need of a heart specialist!",
