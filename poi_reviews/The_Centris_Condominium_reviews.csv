CHLOE LOW,5,"Very convenient to enter the Condo after alighting from Boon Lay MRT. Many schools nearby such as Canadian International School, Frontier Primary, River Valley High and few others Primary and Secondary schools as well.

Sheltered & linked to Jurong Point via Residence glass entrance from B1, L1 and L3 near Malaysia Boleh. Greenery landscape is well maintained with big pool!

Can be more convenient for delivery drivers and visitors by providing a few more pieces of furniture in lobby! ☺️",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113430267715691507167/reviews
MrA,2,"Lots of construction which resulted in air and noise pollution. It’s going to adversely affect the Fengshui of Centris. Being a leasehold condominium, remaining lease is about 80 years.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112008289267740134602/reviews
Faye Cheang,3,"Located next to Jurong Point and walking distance to Boon Lay MRT station and bus interchange. Quite convenience but old Condo. Gym is rundown, smelly and small with minimal equipments. The best part is the huge swimming. You can walk to JP without worrying raining or sunny day is thru basement parking at 1A. Alternatively, You can go to level 5 which is also connecting to JP. Hope management can improve the gym.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109031139763319733926/reviews
