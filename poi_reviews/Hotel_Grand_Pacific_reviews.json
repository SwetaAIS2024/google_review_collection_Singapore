With little time and much to see, he was outstanding  in advising and providing local knowledge to enhance our experience . We were very grateful.\nThe position of the hotel is excellent being central and close to the large Bogus shopping centre.\nRooms were spacious, clean and functional.\nWe would highly recommend  this hotel.",

It's very convenient for traveling by MRT or bus, with a bus stop right in front of the hotel.\nThe staff were nice, the room was clean and larger than those in other nearby hotels. The gym was a bit small for me, but the restaurant was excellent.",

But the bathroom is more of an older design. The view is great, thereâ€™s 2 layers of windows.\nThe pool is compact and great. It is a 2m deep pool. Given the prime location, the value is extremely good.\n\nThe only issue I encountered during my stay was with the room key card. Despite my stay being valid, I had difficulty accessing the room, elevator, and gym.",

Every day, Velu went above and beyond to ensure our comfort, assisting with taxi bookings and offering invaluable advice on sightseeing, shopping, and dining options. His friendly demeanor and extensive knowledge truly enhanced our experience. Additionally, Lyn at the check-in counter greeted us warmly and facilitated a smooth check-in.\n\nThe buffet breakfast was good, offering a wide choice of dishes that catered to all our tastes.  The guest rooms, were quite dated in decor, but were clean and comfortable and provided value for money (as the hotel was cheaper compared to others in the vicinity).\n\nOverall, Hotel Grand Pacific provided a pleasant stay with excellent service, particularly from Velu, whose dedication made our visit memorable. We highly recommend this hotel for travelers seeking a centrally located accommodation with attentive staff and great value.",
