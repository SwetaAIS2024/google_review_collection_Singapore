Lisa T,5,"Checkout kiosks are much faster. The “buy 1 get 1 free” sign at the kiosk was confusing. In the end, I bought two tubes of L’Oreal 32H infallible matter cover with 35% discount.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101998729191684176802/reviews
Cheryl Tee,5,"I needed to get some gauze bandage but I was with my dog in a pram outside the store. Kate (trainee staff I think) was handing out pamplets at the store entrance. When I approached her help to make the purchase for me as I was unable to leave my dog outside, she gladly went to grab the stuff for me. She even made multiple trips to let me see the options available and even to help me get my membership details. Really very kind and helpful gal. Made the shopping experience so much better and efficient for me! Thank you Kate! Keep up the good work! Happy says thank you too!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116420129163467840222/reviews
