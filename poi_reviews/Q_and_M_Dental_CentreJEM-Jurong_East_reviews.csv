Claudia,1,"They did teeth extraction for my husband, did not prescribe antibiotics at all?! Not sure what or how they did the extraction but had to rush to the A&E for emergency surgery due to infection in the gum causing a blood infection as well.

Doctors in the A&E mentioned that if we had delayed it further it would have been more servere. He had to be hospitalized and put on Hospitalization leave and is still currently in recovery and visiting NUH's specialist for follow ups.

Did extraction on 10th April, went to A&E on the 13th due to extreme pain and swelling to the point he could barely eat, drink or even swallow.

Paid $500+ for extraction, painkillers, xray and a nice visit to the A&E shortly after. Kindly be advised before you visit them, experiences may differ from yours.

Shu Jie Ho,5,"Had a great experience with Dr. Willis Cheng!

I typically have sensitive gums that tend to bleed during cleanings, but this time was different. I walked out with perfectly clean teeth and hardly any bleeding.

He asked several times if the pressure was comfortable and if I needed breaks, which shows his commitment to the customer to not rush through the session.

Highly recommend!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100322731077517829094/reviews

Siong Meng,2,"Came here with the intention to remove both my top and bottom wisdom teeth due to pain and was recommended by my previous dentist to remove them for hygiene reason.  DR JONATHAN is very truthful and detail to describe the complication involved in removing the wisdom tooth. But to me, he talked too much and was very arrogant in certain manners which made me felt intimidated. The process of removing the wisdom teeth was painless because of the anastatic.  I cannot even tell the doctor is working on the top or bottom tooth. The whole process was completed in less than half hour. However, as I was writing this review, I start to feel some pain when the numbness subsided. Took the prescribed pain killer to reduce the pain. Spent over a thousand to remove my wisdom ðŸ˜„ good thing is amount is partially claimable through mediasave. Lastly, the clinic can be very cold for certain people thus please bring along warm clothing if you need to.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114075970380476081405/reviews
