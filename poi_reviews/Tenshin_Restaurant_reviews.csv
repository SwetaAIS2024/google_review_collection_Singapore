Isabella chen,5,"Ordered the tokusen tendon for lunch, it was expertly done. Each piece had its own texture, perfectly fried on the outside and steamed inside in its own juices. The prawn cake added a nice, bouncy contrast to the lighter crisp vegetable tempura. I think it all went very well together. Itâ€™s a well balanced lunch set.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108183653579425218635/reviews
Stephanie Wong,4,"We enjoyed the tempura omakase, especially the seafood selection. The tempura batter was light and crispy - which makes it very different from the usual tempura you will find in regular tempura places.

We ordered the Hana set priced at $130++. Not much description on the ingredients but the different types of fishes served were delicious.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102299102225370126629/reviews
Angel Huang,4,"Nice small restaurant was recommended by my friend to try their tempura. Came with my girls for sat lunch. The tempura batter is very thin and crisp, pretty well done. The set is generous. We didnâ€™t like the red miso soup as the taste is too strong and the salad sauce is overpowering. Overall good experience. Nice and cosy environment but rather small so better make reservations in advance.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103805216619298637548/reviews
J. L.,4,"Quick tempura lunch fix at the restaurant. We ordered the Tenshin Lunch set - Mixed tempura (5-6 pieces mix of prawn/vegetables) , Salad, Mini Tendon, Miso-soup, Pickles & Dessert. Tempura was nicely battered and fried to perfection, light and crispy, definitely did not have the gross oil taste that you get at some tempura restaurants who reuses the frying oil for a couple of days.

Whilst the entire meal was good, it definitely did not blow my mind. Prawns were a lilâ€™ tough from the frying, vegetables didnâ€™t stand out either - it just felt like normal fried vegetables, wasnâ€™t exceptionally sweet or anything. The mini tendon was the star of the show, perfectly fried prawn cake with sauce over rice, absolutely delicious. Lotus root salad was yummy too.

Ambience was nice, has a peaceful quiet Japanese omakase restaurant feel. Service is good.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108808507979454469679/reviews
J T,4,"1) The cheapest proper tendon set is 70 dollars++ ðŸ˜„ðŸ¥ºðŸ˜„which comes with soup and salad.
2) not a big portion but it tastes fantastic! Especially the fried prawn is well marinated. Overall not oily at all.
3) please call for reservation.
4) lotsa people ordered sashimi unfortunately I canâ€™t eat raw uncooked food.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109766105226457615073/reviews
