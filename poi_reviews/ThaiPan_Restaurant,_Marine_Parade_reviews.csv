Jiayan Xie,5,"Was recommended by a friend. Prices are very reasonable. Servings are generous (items in pics are small size). Taste is good, not oily or salty. We will definitely visit again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110776496018875454319/reviews
J G,5,"Visited this place on Wednesday 20 Nov. Glad to learn that they are back @ Mandarin Gardens, w new items on the menu too. We ordered our usual favourites. Love the wet horfun, has the fried wok hei Chao tar taste. My family loved the dry horfun. Other dishes to try is the cereal chicken (can add more cereal will be nicer), the butter chicken & broccoli. Food came fast, staff were efficient & attentive. Aunty Karen even came over to our table to ensure everything was good. Will definitely keep coming back like last time!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103689009046237488530/reviews
eclairfastpass,5,"Food is great, have eaten multiple times. Most dishes are above average and delicious. Typical Tze Char food.

Service is great, very attentive even when place is busy. Was sneezing due to the spices and staff caught on and gave me more tissues unprompted.

Atmosphere isn‚Äôt the best as it usually crowded and noisy but nothing you can do about it.

Definitely worth a visit if you are driving, or living in the area. Otherwise nothing that special to travel down for I guess.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113850770444289937489/reviews
Yk Mistry,2,"Overpriced Local fare. We ordered a set for 6 people SGD $168/-
- Worst prawn paste chicken i ever ate.
- the mojito that was part of the set was really a task to down.
- We had to order extra food as quantity was not at all enough!
yes the view of the pool etc is good.

Dont think we are going back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116856047640333176712/reviews
Elgenia Wong,5,"PSA: Thaipan is back at Mandarin Gardens! The owner said the condo management asked them to come back üòÇ Well-staffed for dinner and the dishes came quickly. Ordered butter squid, JD pork chop, cereal chicken and jade tofu üëçüèª A tad pricey with small sized dishes starting at 15-18 SGD, but a good place for family dinner if you‚Äôre in the East Coast area!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115007838898671943194/reviews
