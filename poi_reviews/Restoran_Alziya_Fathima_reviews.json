      "text": "The Goreng Goreng dishes is nice. Ayam Penyet is nice but the salad is very roughly cut in big pieces. Not presentable and not so easy to eat. The Ayam Penyet sambal is nice. The Ayam Penyet Soup is rather cold. Nasi Goreng kampung is nice. At 8pm on a Sunday night, the rice dishes are so pathetic. Better to have cleared up the dishes and focus on Goreng Goreng. The fried chicken still have quite a lot but look not appetizing. That's probably why that was the only dish with so much still available. Ample parking lots available on a Sunday night and pasar malam night. Very clean restaurant. Just 3 tables of customers on a Sunday night. Does not accept eWallet payment. Cash payment only.",
