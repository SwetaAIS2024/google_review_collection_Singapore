Richard W,4,"Come here for the views. One of the restaurants at the rooftop of Marina Bay Sands that let you access these views without staying at the hotel. Minimum spend of $30 per person. The food and drink were nothing to write home about. I‚Äôd rather have a regular laksa over the laksa spring roll. The tripe was delicious but that bread was sopping wet with oil.

Waitstaff should be encouraged to ask bartenders for customer recommendations. I stated my preference as spirit-forward, bitter, and herbal, and the server recommended the Amalfi gimlet. ü§£ So random! I rolled with it anyway. The drink was unbalanced, too much citrus and not enough syrup, and way too little gin by modern standards‚Äîdid they measure out the ingredients at all? It sucks to pay that much for something I can make better at home.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100281625767956045510/reviews
Annette Goh,5,"The view at Spago Singapore Bar is absolutely stunning, offering a breathtaking panoramic view of the city skyline and beyond. It‚Äôs the perfect setting to unwind, whether you‚Äôre enjoying a sunset or the vibrant city lights at night. As for the food, it was nothing short of spectacular. Every dish was beautifully presented and packed with incredible flavors. From the appetizers to the main courses, everything was prepared with such attention to detail, and the taste was even better than expected. A truly memorable dining experience with both great ambiance and exceptional cuisine!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114506275307748985421/reviews
Tan Wee Leong,1,"View is ok but partially blocked.
Food Menu is very limited.
Waited very long ~30 min for the food while the place is half full at lunchtime.
Food looks nice but taste is below average for the price.
Wagyu is a total let down not sure how is this Wolfgang Puck.
Also they are supposed to give complimentary parking for spending but we were not offered.
Definitely will not consider this place again.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115962897970300371171/reviews
Eloise,5,"I always take guests to Spago, as it really is a special location!

I really like the food and drinks selection at Spago, my favourite is Rough Love Cocktail - it is a must try!!

The ambiance is sophisticated and the views are stunning, adding to the overall experience. The price point isn‚Äôt the cheapest, but fair considering the location and quality of the food and service.

If you‚Äôre looking for a place to enjoy with friends, or celebrate a special occasion, with the best views of Singapore sky line, Spago is worth a visit.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101045665016454507066/reviews
Ania Michalska,5,"Visit at sunset, wonderful. Very professional and friendly service. On one side the view of the sunset, the city and the infinity pool, and on the other side the view of Gardens by the bay. A wonderful place to celebrate and celebrate special occasions‚ù§Ô∏è

You have to make a reservation and spend minimum 30$ per person. Worth it üôåüèº",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109585385098913930739/reviews
