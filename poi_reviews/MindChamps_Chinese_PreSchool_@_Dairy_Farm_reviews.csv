hendri leung,5,"An excellent pre-school for our son. Although we just moved to Singapore early this year and our son did not speak neither English nor Chinese, the teachers are really patient in teaching and caring for him. All the staffs are very warm and friendly. The curiculum is also very balanced in education and playing portion. They also have music, culinary and art school. The indoor playground and gym is the favourite place of our son. Overall, we are very happy and satisfied with MindChamps @ Dairyfarm and our son loves to go there, which is for us the most important thing.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107179218465968340343/reviews
Samuel CY Ong,5,Pretty new school with caring teachers. Academic pace might be quite fast and intense for kids. Might be challenging if the kid came from another school that was not so focused on academics.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114050726889333350588/reviews
shane tay,5,"Mindchamps Chinese is a new preschool along the dairy farm vicinity. It has huge, big and clean classrooms with extensive facilities such as a gym for them to practise their motorskills and an indoor playground called ""Mindscape"" for the children to run and roam freely within the obstacles and slides.
The teachers and principal give a very warm, friendly, accomodating and family-like positive vibes. My son looks forward to going to school each and every day!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116108360056025493170/reviews
