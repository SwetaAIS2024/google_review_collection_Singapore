Richard TS Lee,5,"The after-sales services at Rheem is EXCELLENT! This is my second Rheem electric shower. The first one had issues (from installer, and the unit) and Rheem fixed it fast with no issues! The second one had broken shower head (plastic) twice, but Apple was a great help in resolving! Only issue is Rheem should make sure their hardware is more durable! But customer support is really the BEST!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102379419067684595432/reviews
Derence LYE,1,"Their hotline number be it service,  sales or marketing is ringing but no one pick up the call. Luckily I did not buy their product if it is faulty do not expect them to attend to ur need. With this kind of services better shop other brands for peace of mind.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100812817118410351832/reviews
Jason Goh,5,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ms. Applelyn for her swift actions when she handled my request call on my EHG30 leaking problem this morning. After all necessary clarification, she immediately arranged for technician to attend to me in the afternoon. Technician, Mr. Vichi and his partner came on time and all problems are rectified within an hour.
Ms. Applelyn needs to be highly commended as she handled my call in a very professional way even on Monday where it is always a busy morning on a new week. A big pat on her shoulder for her work.
Mr. Vichi, with is service partner not only attended the call on time, but they also managed it within an hour. Their professional actions do save us alot of time.
To Ms. Applelyn, Mr. Vichi and team, thank you very much for the help given.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101005964114657416738/reviews
Marcus Lee,5,"I bought and installed this Rheem Instant water heater RTLE-33M as recommended by my colleague. It was a trusted brand with long history. The two instant water heaters was installed at my two bathrooms during home improvement exercise by HDB.
Initially had some water pressure issues so called up the Customer service hotline. A CS agent by the name of Applelyn attended to my call. She was courteous, patience and very helpful. She addressed all the concerns I had and referred me to their technical advisor who kindly advice me to adjust the regular knob at the inlet pipe which solve the water pressure issue. The asistance didnâ€™t stop there, a few weeks later their technical personnel called at my residence to check on my water heater to ensure I am satisfied with my purchase. I am truly impressed by their professionalism and customer service, it is truly second to none.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112186884059955408922/reviews
