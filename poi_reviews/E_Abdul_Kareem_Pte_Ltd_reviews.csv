Tuck Weng Wong,5,"My go-to framer Farook. Quality frames at very reasonable prices. After sales service is top notch as well. Went back to him to clean up a framed jersey which somehow got dirty. He initially refused payment but I had to pay him. For his expertise, time and effort to help me. Thank you Farook!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107288010203513721788/reviews
