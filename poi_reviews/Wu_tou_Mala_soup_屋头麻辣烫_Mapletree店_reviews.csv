Inaccurate operating hours needs to be updated. went at 4pm and staff said they’ve been closed since 2.30/3pm. Staff mentioned there’s no customers so they usually close by 2pm+.

Legitimately the best dry mala I’ve ever had. They put peanut sauce, lots of garlic and some chilli padi and that combo with your ingredients brings out all the dimensions of flavour. Can’t stop thinking about it",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108026263555624761723/reviews
meow meow,1,"Order via foodpanda self pickup option.. went there 20mins later, they did not cook ours. They just keep serving those in the queue, after 40mins then the lady went to see the foodpanda receipt orders, however she still did not prep our food but those in queue kept getting their food first. Waited for 1 hour and we have to cancel the order ourselves. Do not buy from this stall via self pickup. Horrible experience and this is the second time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111495332186107512017/reviews
Davison Lee,5,One of the nicer mala stalls in Singapore. Definitely a hidden gem in Singapore. The mala soup is is flavourful and unique. It is not as spicy as other mala broths. Definitely worth it!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107951886736747598990/reviews
