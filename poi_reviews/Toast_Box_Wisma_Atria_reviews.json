      "text": "Terrible service, food and atmosphere. Long queue and the staff really got attitude. The tea and coffee tasted 90% water 5%coffee and 5% sugar. I thought there should be a standard ratio or protocol for each coffee process so the taste will almost be similar with different branches. We also mentioned its dining in but still put the coffee in a plastic cup. If they don’t have a serving cup, they should have mentioned it or probably put a signage that all orders will be in a paper cup.\n\nOverall, I’ve never had a ridiculous experience in toastbox other than this one.",

I just wonder why can’t they help customers to put the spoon when serving the eggs. Usually the other Toast Box outlets do that. They also don’t look happy doing their job. Coffee is super bitter which is unlike all the Toast Box I went. Thankfully the toast is still good.",

When approached the staff for it, the auntie was just standing there doing nothing and shouted “it’s there! Take it yourself!” Blatantly rude. She was not even doing anything - just people watching yet can’t even help the customer with a single fork. Wouldn’t recommend this place.",
