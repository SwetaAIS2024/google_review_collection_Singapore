Sek Lan Neo,5,"Iâ€™ve been visiting V Medical Aesthetics for almost 1 year + now. Main treatments are leg hair removal, facial enhancements, and hair growth therapies, and I couldnâ€™t be happier with the results! The treatments have worked wonders for me, and the best part is that the pricing is really reasonable and transparent.

The staff are always so friendly and welcoming, making each visit comfortable and easy. I really appreciate their attention to detail and how they take the time to ensure Iâ€™m happy with everything. The aftercare has been top-notch, which shows just how much they care about patient satisfaction.

A big thanks to Dr. Jonathan as well as all the ladies stuff for making every visit so great!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102320625315582359868/reviews

Azizul Kamal,5,"Dr Jonathan Wong has been my aesthetics doctor for just over two years. Throughout this time, Iâ€™ve done a variety of treatments ranging from laser treatments (e.g. Pico) to injectables (e.g. Botox). Iâ€™ve also done the non-doctor administered treatments administered (e.g. V Refresh). My experience on all these has been excellent, especially in terms of the standard of care. Coming for your first aesthetics treatment can be daunting as you donâ€™t know what to expect, but ever since day one, Dr Jonathan and his staff have made me feel comfortable with the process and satisfied with the results. Iâ€™m confident in saying that Iâ€™ll continue to stick with Dr Jonathan for my aesthetic needs.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113357044651560583771/reviews
