Daniel Kou,1,"Terrible service. NEVER buy from this company.
Ordered a laptop two months ago. No delivery. Emailed THREE times before I got a useless reply telling me there is no stock left. Why am I even allowed to place an order in the first place? Do they not track order amount to stocks? They then suggested that I buy something even more expensive. I emailed back asking when they will restock, if my order will be prioritised in that case, and is it possible to get a refund. Took another three emails to get a reply. The reply chose to only answer one of my questions. This is a terrible company, guys. Just don't buy from it.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100560299907634756466/reviews
Noor Aishah,1,"Genuinely one of the worst customer service I've seen, ordered a computer 2 weeks ago, no confirmation email...no update...called at least twice a day only to pick up 2 weeks later and to tell me that they arent sure on when the computer will be sent out. i have school starting in 2 weeks......dawg...and they dont reply to emails too?? like how you gonna put a number and email and yet not update us on the big purchase. it was close to $2000 and yet the accountability was 0",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117403105766035656086/reviews
Malu,1,"Sold me a faulty adapter and did not take it back within the return window because it worked on one of their devices.
The staff was very rude and did not want to assist further.

Update: I went to the store with the faulty adapter. After trying it on a monitor where the adapter was visibly not working, we tried the other port on my Notebook.
It seemed to work. So the rude store worker concluded that it must be a port on my notebook.
But it is not, as I tried a lot of different adapters on both of my notebook's Thunderbolt, and every single adapter worked flawlessly every time.
Only this adapter: 1. Sometimes fails to provide power pass-through, 2. Delivers a jittery image or 3. Does not work at all
The store experience was, again, terrible, rude. They didn't let me finish my sentences and kept pointing to the adapter, trying to get me to say that it works.
I will not go back there, and I would advise everyone to buy technical devices anywhere else.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101362766742400467922/reviews
Georg B,5,"Very pleasant and attentive staff, not so many people. Better selection of colours and sizes than in the library. Bigger store overall too, definitely would recommend coming here over the library.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109722010266123120178/reviews
Gregorian Jerahmeel,5,"A nice place to buy merchandise or souvenir to bring it to your hometown or country. Very friendly staff and easy to find. Just use 95 SBS Bus from Kent Ridge MRT station (exit A), then drop on NUS Science Building.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107418663327323900477/reviews
