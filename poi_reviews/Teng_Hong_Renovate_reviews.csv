Joel Ng,5,"We contracted Teng Hong to do an overhaul of our 3BR Condominium. It was an old condo with the last renovation done more than 10 years ago. Rayen helped us tremendously from the planning stage till the end. We had no Interior Designer so she literally had to play that part as well, and she offered many practical suggestions which we eventually adopted. I was particularly impressed with her willingness to accompany us to the various shops and offer her professional advice from a practical perspective while retaining aesthetic considerations. Overall, we felt that it was value for money and the pricing was reasonable with very good service offered.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104806059091091066981/reviews
Adeline Leong,5,"Our 2nd time engaging Teng Hong Renovate for our home renovation & definitely there are no renovation nightmares!

Established good working relationships with Diana and team, communication was always clear and any questions or concerns were addressed promptly and most importantly resolved. The team always took extra miles to help whenever we faced any issues.

We are extremely pleased with the final outcome. The quality of work was outstandingâ€”every detail was handled with precision and care. From the initial planning to the final touches, it was clear the team took pride in their craftsmanship.

We would strongly recommend Diana and team for anyone looking for high-quality renovation work.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100063020830283318559/reviews
Devika Mukherjee,5,"We renovated our first home (resale) with Teng Hong Renovate and Jun Hao managed the project from start to finish. We are very happy with the end result. The entire renovation was smooth with regular updates given by Jun Hao.
He made a lot of effort to truly understand what we wanted and gave us helpful and practical suggestions throughout. We added on quite a few things along the way and he always accommodated our requests and more importantly kept everything on schedule despite our short timeline.
The quotes provided were reasonable and pricing is competitive.We did the electrical, plumbing, carpentry and redid the entire bathroom including tiling. The quality of the workmanship for everything is good.
Would highly recommend working with him!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106636280361322071334/reviews

Tricia L (IG: 3travelog),5,"I was recommended by a friend to engage Teng Hong Renovate and I will have no hesitation to recommend them to all my friends as well!

First, we were living overseas when we contacted THR and I was put in touch with Rianne, who despite the huge time difference, was able to organise an initial call & quote.

Second, when we returned to SG, Rianne quickly organised a site visit to get the exact measurements, etc. so timing was perfect! She also took into account all my specific requests regarding measurements.

Third, we engaged THR for a small project and regardless of that, Rianne and the team did not treat it as such. Other IDs may eschew smaller projects because it may not be worth their time & effort, but I never felt that this was my experience with THR.

Lastly, I appreciated that THR was able to install the cabinetry within two days. Super fast & efficient!

Once again, thanks Rianne and team!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105123071772086751190/reviews
