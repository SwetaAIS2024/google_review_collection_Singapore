Last week 1/12/2023 my fianc√©e sent me a waybill containing DSLR CAMERA üì∑ and till the moment the india custom department had being requesting for commercial invoice, I have sent every document they requested of me but up till this minute they are still requesting for the commercial invoice because the invoice your office issued to my fianc√©e was rejected 8 times I uploaded it to the link and email sent to me by the india DHL New Delhi branch . I consider this as a poor service. I urge and Please your team to look into this issue as soon as possible.",

Subsequently when I called to schedule a pickup, I was told that I would have to pay a $328 for 4kg even though the items in the box is worth only $120 and no more than 2kg. The customer service officer insist that I should pay for 4kg just because the box could carry that weight regardless of how heavy the items i have placed inside weigh. I am trying to figure out how reasonable this is.",
