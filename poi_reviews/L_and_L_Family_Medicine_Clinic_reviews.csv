G,5,"Been seeing Dr Low for past 30 years. His genuinity, patience, and experience is over and above any other doc i've seen. The wait at his clinic might be seem long to some, I would say to each his/her own. There is free choice for anyone to go elsewhere for consult etc. In my own opinion, Dr Low and his wife are well worth any wait.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113115281677147026399/reviews
