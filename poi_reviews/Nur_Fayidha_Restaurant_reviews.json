Most of us enjoyed the praha- one was with mushrooms and another was cheese. One family member had the best ever chicken nuggets ever. There are vegetarian options available.\nService: 3/5 - the first day we visited, a family member waited over an hour for his soup which was eventually cancelled. Another ordered fried rice which took forever. That rating was 2/5. The following day was better.\nAtmosphere: 3/5 - outdoor seating without fans\n\nThe place is located off the main drag which meant reasonable prices.\n\nThose with mobility issues will have challenges with steps.",

That said it's flavors were very dense and maybe a bigger portion would have been too much.\n\nI got a egg wrap thingy not sure what it was but it was good.\n\nGood value for sure in an expensive city n",

The place was peaceful and not too crowded at night, making it a comfortable spot to dine. Cleanliness was acceptable, though there‚Äôs room for improvement. Overall, a decent choice for a late-night meal, especially if you prefer a quieter environment. Would consider returning for another visit.",

Nice ambience, parking was also easy especially at late night, no issues, weekend expect to be crowded.\n\nLatest: I was overwhelmed by the gesture of one of the staff admitting some of the mistake and politely resolve the matter üëçüëç had upload his pic :)",
