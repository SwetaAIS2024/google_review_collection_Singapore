Pei Yun CHENG,5,"A humble looking salad bar and cafe at TTSH Integrated Care Hub with excellent service and fresh salads.

Nice presentation too. The get-away spot for a comforting meal especially when we get too hungry. Located very close to the shuttle bus waiting area..We won't miss it. Worth checking out when in the area. It is well-known for the Baiye Tofu!

I ordered a salad bowl mix-and-match to the ingredients I fancy and I was delighted.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108591583130740588237/reviews
May Lim,5,"Chance upon this place via google
Today is my 2nd visit to this salad place for lunch.
It has different varieties to pick and match your bowl. Tuna chuck (meat option) is a must order. Sides and meat are freshly made and the fruits options are sweet.
Great place to chill and the staffs are super friendly.
I wish they will be opening a franchise at SGH ðŸ˜¬",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107164793487319350155/reviews
Jackie Choo,4,"Rena and her staff are friendly, helpful and meticulous when dishing up orders. The toasties (mushroom or chicken with melted cheese) on toast (white or wholemeal) comes hot, scrunchy & so yummy. The spiced tea (ginger, masala or cardamon) is slightly sweet, smooth and comforting. Together with a chocolate croissant or cinnamon swirl for dessert, what a delicious meal. Discount for Merdeka generation too. If you are feeling a bit down, the chicken soup for the soul beautiful images & wisdom scrolls on a loop on the large LCD TV on the far wall. Nice touch!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113500670173166548397/reviews
C J,5,"Friendly owner who explained how their salad bowl works. They have usual toppings (corn capsicum, various fruits) but echoing other reviews, the potato/spicy potato salad + black fungus are delicious! Meat toppings are shredded and I went for chicken which has an old school salt/pepper taste.

Overall enjoyable. I also recommend the sparkling rose tea which is like bandung without milk. Space is quite quiet and comfy to, so may eat in next time",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110554708714277249584/reviews
Mike Sun Boxuan,5,"The salad and pasta bowls were really good!
All the ingredients were fresh. A really beginner-friendly place to be introduced to salads and greens.

During my first time there the store owner was really kind and helpful and introduced all the toppings and dressings to me

The teas served there were also exquisite :) please do consider going there to eat when youre in ttsh!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118126088715920464925/reviews
