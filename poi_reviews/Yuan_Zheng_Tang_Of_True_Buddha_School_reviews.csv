Vincent Su,5,"I'm a regular devotee at this temple. The toilet is superb clean (I don't know how they did that), Aircon is at good temperature and very tidy place for prayers. They have very consistent prayers for high king avalokiteshvara (Guan yin) sutra every Thursday, and Vajrasattva 100 words syllables mantra regularly. On good days, they can host up to 50+ devotees. A real good place for anyone who want to cultivate and seek refuge with the True Buddha School!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117702380031407104428/reviews
