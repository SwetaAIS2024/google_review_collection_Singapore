      "text": "Plaza Singapura is a great shopping mall with a wide variety of stores, restaurants, and services. The location is convenient, and the mall is well-maintained with a modern design.\n\nHowever, one downside is the lack of seating areas for resting between shopping or waiting for someone. This makes it less family-friendly, especially for those with young children or elderly companions. Adding some benches or resting spots would greatly enhance the experience.\n\nOverall, it‚Äôs a good mall with potential for improvement!",

I‚Äôve come here multiple times and eaten at the food court, restaurants, and bought stuff from stores and I‚Äôve always had a good experience with everything.\n\nIn difference seasons/holidays such as the new year, Christmas, and such they do beautiful decorations that are worth seeing if you‚Äôre there. The location is great as well being near the underground MRT and multiple nearby bus stops in front and to the side of the mall. Overall it‚Äôs a wonderful shopping mall to visit when in Singapore.",
