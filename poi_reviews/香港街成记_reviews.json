The salted egg prawns were fresh and tasted alright. The sweet & sour pork was just acceptable. However, the fu yu you mak was without wok hei and the ginger lala was a disappointment. Service was friendly and efficient.",

They knew I had dietary restrictions\nMost of my photos are takeaway food cos I usually don't finish the whole portion at lunch so I bring back home about two thirds almost everyday",
