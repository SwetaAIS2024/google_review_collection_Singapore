Timothy Tan,5,"Exceptional Care from Dr. Roland – A True Neighborhood Gem!

I cannot speak highly enough of Dr. Roland! As a friendly neighborhood general practitioner, he goes above and beyond to provide outstanding medical care. Unlike many doctors who rush through appointments, Dr. Roland takes the time to thoroughly explain medical conditions, ensuring that his patients fully understand their health and treatment options. His approach is not only knowledgeable but also incredibly compassionate, making every visit a reassuring experience.

His prescribed medications are always effective, and his diagnosis is spot on. Whether it’s a minor illness or a more complex health concern, I always feel confident in his expertise. Beyond his medical skills, Dr. Roland’s warm and approachable nature makes him a trusted figure in the community. It’s rare to find a doctor who combines professionalism with genuine care, and I’m grateful to have him as my family physician.

If you’re looking for a dedicated, patient-focused, and highly skilled doctor, I wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Roland. He truly is one of the best!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106767812443756078374/reviews
adi hill,5,"I attended Procare Clinic on Sunday with my two daughters. It is not easy to find a clinic that opens on a Sunday. I was also happy to find they offered the HPV vaccine that I wanted for my girls (more comprehensive than the one they offer in school).
We had a great experience. The counter staff was helpful and friendly. The doctor was fantastic with both my girls, the doctor was kind, patient and understanding. The doctor really put them at ease.
The doctor explained everything thoroughly to me and was very knowledgeable. My daughters wound is healing very well with the cream that was prescribed.
It is definitely worth it to travel to a good GP. We will be back :  )",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114142535096973571101/reviews

JT,5,It’s really rare to find a doctor who takes the time to answer your questions in detail and provide available options with empathy and compassion. I was there to get my vaccinations and Dr Roland Xu was very patient and friendly the entire time. Really appreciate it!
