Shane,4,It is a pet friendly cafe. I was able to see dogs getting sent for grooming and for their playtime. The food was decent and the drinks were good. I liked the vibes from this place as there was nothing too fancy. The staff were amazing though very polite and friendly. If you own a dog and your nearby do try visit this cafe.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103516199892428463591/reviews
Sheen Cher,5,"Absolutely love OMD Cafe & Bar! Not only is it pet-friendly, but the food is also amazing! From pasta to ham & cheese croissants, matcha lattes, and chicken chop‚Äîeverything we tried was delicious. They even serve food for dogs, and my pup Mochi couldn‚Äôt get enough of the Porkalicious! One portion wasn‚Äôt enough!

Great food, a cozy atmosphere, and a perfect spot for pet lovers. Highly recommend and will definitely be back! üêæ",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108631126783137464960/reviews

Impressed with the standards of food served (really good for a pet cafe!) and service rendered by the ever friendly Ariel and team.
