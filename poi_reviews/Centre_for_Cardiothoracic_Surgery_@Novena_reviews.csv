Bernadette Lim,5,"A Long Overdue Thank You to Dr. Lim Yeong Phang

This post is long overdue, but our gratitude remains as deep as ever.

From 2022 to 2023, Dr. Lim Yeong Phang was not just my daughter‚Äôs surgeon‚Äîhe was our family‚Äôs source of strength, reassurance, and unwavering support during the toughest time of our lives.

When my daughter was transferred to Mt. E Novena from Mt. Alvernia Hospital, she was in critical condition. Dr. Lim immediately performed an ECMO procedure to keep her alive, buying us precious time. When she eventually needed an LVAD implant, he was the skilled hands behind the life-saving surgery. But his care went far beyond the operating room.

Dr. Lim went the extra mile in ways that words can‚Äôt fully express. Knowing the immense stress we were under, he even helped with external matters so that we could focus entirely on our daughter. Every single day, without fail, he visited her a few times daily, constantly monitoring her condition and adjusting her care plan. He was always the first to arrive and the last to leave, ensuring that every possible contingency was accounted for. Even when things weren‚Äôt looking good, he always had a backup plan‚Äîhis foresight and expertise gave us hope when we needed it most.

Even today, Dr. Lim continues to check on my daughter, proving that his dedication doesn‚Äôt end when the surgery does. His professionalism, compassion, and relentless commitment are exactly what every patient and caregiver needs in times of crisis.

Thank you, Dr. Lim. Though this message comes late, our gratitude will always remain. We are forever indebted to you for saving our daughter‚Äôs life and for standing by us every step of the way. üôè‚ù§Ô∏è",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104319245492218333835/reviews
