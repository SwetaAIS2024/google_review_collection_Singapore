I W,4,"First time I am trying Kaffe & Toast anywhere in Singapore, on my wife's recommendation.  They have a nice standalone cafe at Alexandra Hospital.

The food here was surprisingly good!  Certainly nowhere near as bad as other reviews and overall rating would suggest.

Their Mee Rebus Beef Brisket & Tendon ($7.80), Singapore Laksa ($6.80), and Laksa with Grilled Chicken ($8.80) were all very flavourful.  The gravy/broth was thick too.  Grilled chicken was juicy.  I can tell that they put in a lot of effort into creating their dishes.  Portions were generous too.

I would have given this place 5 stars, but deducted one star because the Laksa broth and Mee Rebus gravy were a tad too sweet for my liking.  It is a matter of personal preference.  I can imagine a person who likes sweet Laksa broth to fall in love with their dish.

Overall, the entire family was pleased with this stall.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107686746966044708528/reviews
Jason Chin,3,"Drinks are fine although the half boiled eggs too watery. However, the Chee Cheong Fun is way below acceptable standard. Taste so powdery and feel like it is not fresh. I wonder does the staff on duty check and taste them before they sell it. Chwee Kueh also cannot make it. Shall avoid this brand in future.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112189524531828956588/reviews
Hassan kojek,5,"Hands down, the best toast I've had in a while! ATKaffe&Toast truly delivers. The toast was perfectly toasted, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Paired with a delicious spread and a cup of expertly brewed coffee, it made for a lovely breakfast. The cozy atmosphere and friendly service were added bonuses. Highly recommend at kaffe & toast(Alexandra hospital) for a tasty and satisfying breakfast treat!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109532996969254011422/reviews
Kevin Ang,4,Have to give credit to this food joint for offering a variety of warm food that is definitely more heartening than sandwich from 7-Eleven or the vending machine. Local toast and drinks also available.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111247294128726535324/reviews
"Akira, Tze Wei Toh",3,"3-Star: Similar to other outlets but healthier choices... brown rice, no fried varieties... Personal preference is taste over nutritious, haha

5-Star: Staffs are very polite and put in their best",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108105127814017692955/reviews
