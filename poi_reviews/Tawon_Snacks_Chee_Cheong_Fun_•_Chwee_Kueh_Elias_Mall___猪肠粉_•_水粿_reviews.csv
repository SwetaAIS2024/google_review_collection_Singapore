LP Pua,3,"We ordered Chee Cheong Fun, Chwee Kway, and Yam Cake. While the base flavors were similar to those from other stalls selling similar dishes, the sauce and condiments were distinctly different.

Yeung Jasmine,5,"Came here for breakfast on a weekday and ordered Chee Cheong Fun & Chwee Kueh. They gave me plenty of sweet sauce and  preserved radish, yet it's not very salty kind.
