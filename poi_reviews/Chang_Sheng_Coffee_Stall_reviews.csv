Ron Ng,5,Ordered kopi siew-dai (coffee with less sugar) from Chang Sheng. Their coffee is robust local roasted with slight hint of coffee bitter and no sourness. The consistency is just right unlike some which can be very watered down. Feel free to chat with the friendly lady at the stall!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102898821791109530498/reviews
Alvin Choo,5,"Saw a constant queue at this stall and decided to give it a try. The kopi was only $1.10 (as at end Aug 2022).

It's surprisingly good considering the price. It's much better than your typical coffee shop kopi and doesn't have the sourness or siapness. The balance of coffee and milk is also just right. Will probably order frequently from them if I'm dining at the hawker centre.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
