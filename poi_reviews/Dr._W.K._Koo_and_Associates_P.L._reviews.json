Queue  up!”  (how rude!). There’s a line that goes around the corner of the clinic. What’s the point of setting up appointments if everybody is treated like a walk-in (and rudely at that!).",

      "text": "Receptionists are terrible. First they gave me wrong direction. They told me to enter Jurong point, and go uob and turn out. That exit is locked! When I figured my way and enter. I told the young lady I am there for preemployment check. She flipped through a few pages then asked the aunty. That aunty without even checking just told me, “don’t have don’t have go home”. When I insist I am scheduled for one, she yelled at me, “base on what”. I told her I was told to come so please check properly. Only then she pick up the phone and called someone then realised I am supposed to be there. She is so terribly rude. I think the previous poster is mistaken. They r not discriminating foreigners, they just have terrible attitude. When I sat down with the doctor. His first words were “what’s your problem”. I was stunned. I told him I don’t have a problem. You buzzed my queue number so I came in. Then it was silent all the way while he check my heart rate. Then he just said “finish. Can go”. This place is really atrocious. Please don’t make your employees come here for checks. For goodness sake.",

You can only see boxes of tissues, medical supplies piled up to the ceiling and the main entrance. It's more like a warehouse. A sign at the main entrance will direct deliveries to the backdoor. But there's no one inside, I always wonder how any deliveries are made and for what?!",
