      "text": "Alot of inconsistency in town council officers' replies. One property officer initially told me she would look into my enquiry and hope the unit owner will remove his unnecessary potted plants from the link bridge on level 8. Then a few weeks later, same PO said it's ok to leave the excessive number(20+) & big plant pots with massive thorny bougainvilleas on the link bridge as if this unit owner also 'owns' the link bridge. Contacted a more 'senior' PO with the same enquiry and to check if they are setting a new precedence for unit owner on level 8 facing the link bridge to use it for his own purpose? I thought the link bridge is a common area which should be kept clear of any clutter. I asked if that meant that other unit owners can also use the link bridge for their personal purpose such as placing plant pots there. Surely, if the TC allows this for this unit , then it should be allowed for other owners too. This officer said that he will 'call me back next week' & no follow-up call for more than 2 months now. Just sweeping matters under the carpet is just very poor & unprofessional service.",
