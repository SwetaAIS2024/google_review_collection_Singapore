David Oon,3,"One of the better Heavenly outlet

Love the prata here. Crispy, fluffy, light and not oily. Curry is thick and savory enough. Always here for that. Kopi is great too.

However, service can be slow and don't even think about it if you don't have at least an hour before departure time.

Atmosphere is chill and comfy.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111461636018977333111/reviews
Miklos,4,"Had the mee reebus, pricing is pretty decent considering the ingredients that goes with it. But portion is a bit insufficient.

I ordered a kaya bread and it's pretty good.

Went back on my 2nd visit, cause there is something in the kaya toast I had previously that kept me yearning for it.

Overall, very rustic and beautiful deco making it a good place to sit, chill and enjoy my kaya toast set.

The bread is pretty good. The tea is passable but the egg seems cold to me.

My subsequent visit, I find the curry chicken to be pretty good and portion of the veg is good.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102392172058235258162/reviews

Syafiq Karnain,4,Had an early dinner here before catching my flight. The main I had was just okay. Nothing to shout about. But their banana cake was surprisingly delightful. Baked to perfection.
