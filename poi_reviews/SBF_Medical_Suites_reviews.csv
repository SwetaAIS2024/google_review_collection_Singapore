Sook Fong Hoe,5,"First visit to Novahealth SBF but repeat consultation with Dr Clarus.
My mum n I are patients with Dr Clarus, I have shockwave therapy did on my trigger finger, results are amazing, my recovery is 90% after the therapy. For my mum, she has impressive results too with the massage targeting at the right group of muscles, she is now able to walk longer distance without pain.
Thank you Dr Clarus for the great service ðŸ˜Š",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104813288490228124562/reviews
