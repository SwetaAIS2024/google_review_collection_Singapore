Renathy Rao,1,The salted egg pasta was disappointing.  Nothing close to what was mentioned in the menu. The chicken was not fresh and it was not crispy chicken. There was no chili padi at all and it was so watery.  The turkey bacon cabonara was also so watery with hardly any turkey bacon. The food quality has dropped tremendously over time. It's a shame that they cannot maintain the standards.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101495903684400362852/reviews

SeRl J,4,"The staff were really busy cooking and serving at the collection and cashier counters.
The place got noisy all of a sudden because a group of 12-13 youngsters were being loud. The venue filled up quickly because it was dinner time, around 6pm.

The BBQ wings were not good.üëéüèª I wish I had ordered fried wings.
The crispy skin chicken chop is still tasty. It cooked nicely. üëçüèª",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105979257825954890753/reviews
Nur Khairunnizzafiqah Iskandar Zulkarnain,5,"Food portion is good for the price.
Definitely tasty, been here a couple of times.
Finally they upsized the size of the glass for the drinks, so money's worth. Just think they shouldn't charge for asking for mayonaise üòÖ Otherwise, nice ambience.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103464566741784999028/reviews
Freddy,3,"Been to this outlet several times since I move nearby in Aug 23. Visited today for dine-in 31 Dec 23 and discovered prices have went up a bit with the change of menu. Some good items such as Penny with Crispy Chicken, Chilly Crab Pasta are no longer available. Choices are lesser and no longer economical as before.

1) Chicken Chop is dry and hard, fries were cold.
2) Fish and Chips portion shrink
3) Truffle Mushroom paste creamy and good taste
4) Bacon Penny was good too",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113533906938342017824/reviews
