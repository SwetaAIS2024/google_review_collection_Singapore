Sean Poon,1,"Had ordered the Lamb Kebab. There's a basic in cooking! Having the right cuts of meat is one. Trying to bbq a part of meat, which is chewy, a big taboo unless the chef knows what they are doing. One star for the seasonings, that's all.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104302598059978578735/reviews

Jonathan Akm,1,The service is really bad and always missing item whenever we order . Seems like doing it on purpose.  The portion is too small but expensive . Not going to eat again in this dragonfly shop .,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113535802579514294669/reviews
s,1,waited for 30 minutes just for the food. the people ordered infront of us already got their food and yet ours still cooking. what is taking them so long just to get the food cooked? unacceptable. the lady taking the order also needs to get her service improved. i repeated myself 3 times just for her to key in the order. will never visit this store again,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114145742189334237285/reviews
