Ashley Liew,5,"Excellent array of international foods at this food court at Terminal 4 of Changi Airport. It is on the highest floor, 2M. Cashless payment options are encouraged. There are baby chairs available too. Food is as cheap as you can get for the airport area. Love how clean it is and the comfortable aircon. Love it is just beside the gallery for watching planes too!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews

Emily Wu,1,"Don‚Äôt order at the Chinese noodle place. The vegetables are so brownish that they looked like zombie vegetables while are frozen long over time‚Ä¶. The bottom looked like starting to rot already‚Ä¶ (The real food is much more brownish vs how it looks in the picture. )
I didn‚Äôt dare to eat more than 2 pieces, in case I got stomach upset during flight. I hate to waste food but unfortunately this is just too bad.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106977322180502311713/reviews
