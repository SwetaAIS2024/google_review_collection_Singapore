Winston Ho,4,"This stall is located in a corner coffee shop in a quiet neighborhood of Commonwealth estate, that was built in the 1960s.

They sell economical noodles (bee hoon, kway teow and Mee) which you add on other food items such as luncheon meat, fish cake, chicken wings, Chinese sausage, popiah, ngoh hiang, sunny side up egg and stir fried vegetables.

I usually come after work to get dinner takeout, as they close around 7.45 - 8pm.

I usually order:
- Bee hoon, which is tasty by itself
- Kway teow and mee, good combination to pair with the bee hoon
- Chicken wings: These are big in size and yummy!
- Sunny side up egg
- Luncheon meat
- Stir-fried vegetables: I got the long beans which were good.

Not forgetting their chilli dip which is good too. Goes well with the noodles and chicken wings. üòã

You can also dine in for your meal and enjoy a bit of nostalgic Singapore.

Recommended!

Michael Lee,5,"About 10mins walk from common wealth mrt.
Rundown kopitiam but do give the vintage vibe.
Queue was long when we reached but food was served quickly. Like everyone said here, the fried chicken wings are the best. We managed to get the hot and crispy fried fish fillet.

Service by the store is fantastic and he's well mannered.

For 2 normal sized plates of noodles, 4 chicken wings, 1 fillet and 1 ngor hiong, it's only $11.40!

Will return again!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114470968673659962003/reviews
MOUSE AK,3,I haven‚Äôt visited for at least more than 4 years. Price gone up compared to years ago for sure. But it‚Äôs the food that I was disappointed. Only chicken wing is still hot and nice. The rest are not as tastier as in the past. Beehoon not cooked well so very tough. The cabbage is very sweet instead of fragrance. The otah still ok but not spicy. The fish cake and luncheon meat is standard off shelf. So this may probably my last visit to my old memory food place. I paid sgd6.50. Their off day is Sunday.

owen,4,"A great chicken wing - Nothing less, nothing more

Was walking past to eat the (more superior) Ah Kee Beef Noodles. Decided to get one chicken wing ($1.60) for a bite to see the hype.

The temperature was slightly warm, wished it could have been piping hot but I guess this is the nature of economic bee hoon where the dishes are left out on display, so I consider myself blessed.

With the first bite, there was a capture of a great taste and a slight heat releasing from the wing itself. While the chicken wing was tasty, I couldn't help but consider the lack of distinction this chicken wing had. I can tell its a great chicken wing, but I cant necessarily tell its an Eng Kee chicken wing.

Overall while I enjoyed the bite, at $1.60; Would I consider coming over from Commonwealth MRT to eat the beehoon here with the chicken wing? Maybe. However, to queue for a while? That would be a no.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101656162678057556658/reviews
YY,3,"Finally found a day to have this long awaited chicken wings - and we thought it was rather good.

‚è∞ arrived around 12 on a weekend and the queue stretched outside the coffeeshop, and had to wait around 10-15 minutes before we were served - they do accept online orders too so that might have slowed things in some ways though someone else is working on that front

üçó the chicken wings were definitely the highlight of the show - very crispy and flavourful, largely cos it‚Äôs eaten hot too

However, the rest of the dishes and ingredients weren‚Äôt much to shout about - in fact I have had better otah and beehoon elsewhere, which pretty much pulled the overall score down.

I don‚Äôt think I will return, but if I‚Äôm craving for the chicken wings I may get it on its own since it‚Äôs really good on its own üëçüèª",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
