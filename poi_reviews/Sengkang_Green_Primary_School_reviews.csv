Irene Mathavan,1,"played against their basketball senior girls team (2025) very ugly behaviour, they were very rude and aggressive. No manners at all. I fell down on the ground during the game and they started laughing, we lost to them in the end. Very arrogant behaviour towards us after the match. Please teach your children proper etiquette and how to act during a match.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105444477472109083137/reviews
Winnie Li,1,"Thruout the years, except for Ms Beh who have left, who put in effort to send regular emails to update the progress, alot of the times I heard teacher on MC, teacher not here, teacher goes on leave, relief teachers. The overall grade was very bad as well, compared to other kids in other school for PSLE. Was it the teaching method?  Neighbours and some other parents share the same thoughts too. With teachers who can't bother to reply parents emails.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116944603491276590248/reviews
NuHAF,1,"Not a good school who made the parents wait outside the gate when  we came earlier than 1030 for the PSLE Results. Cmon lah, have some compassion for the parents who were waiting outside. Would not even let us wait at the canteen. Never had a good impression of this school from beginning. A backward school. Management committee of the school, please review your process. I've never come across a school who treats the parents like they don't matter.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100796772853438321362/reviews
