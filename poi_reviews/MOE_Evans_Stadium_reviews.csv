Ceremonious Houseplant,4,"A decent stadium equipped with an American football field, a 6 lane running track, car park via the Ministry of Education, some sheltered seating and toilets.

The fields are well maintained, but the running tracks are slightly dilapidated at the time of writing (Feb 2025)

The field is publicly available 24/7. While the field lights are not turned on at nights, the ambient lights provide some lighting for late night and early morning activities.

The toilets are a little outdated, but well equipped with showers, changing areas, and are well maintained.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108226536188302632148/reviews
Ashley Liew,5,"Been using this stadium literally over the decades since around 2008. Can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the best maintained track and stadium but it does its purpose. Love that it has minimal restrictions on entry so it remains to me the most accessible track for running, even in the early hours of the morning. Always a wonderful meeting place for the run and sport community. Tennis courts for booking too!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
Tony Foo,4,"This stadium was packed with many running groups and well patronised. Despite the condition of the track its location is convenient for many athletes. Unlike those near housing estate, you do not have parents with kids strolling around. Users therefore can focus on thier training and also be motivated by the other around the stadium. üëç",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101587111082855824614/reviews
Marc Paquet,5,Still can't understand why this running track was closed for 2 years during COVID.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115948901075086007150/reviews
Derek Wallbank,3,"Track is in need of repairs. Several lanes have cones around segments of rubber in disrepair, while rubber is bubbling up in others.

Additionally, several runners go in opposite direction to flow, which regulars tell me is a common occurrence. It necessitates one or both parties avoiding each other and could be solved if all ran in the same direction.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115408090321523440951/reviews
