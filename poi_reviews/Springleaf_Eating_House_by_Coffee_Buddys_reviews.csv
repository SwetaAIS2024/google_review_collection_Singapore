TCH,5,"Today I came to try the Roast Pork stall here.  The tenderness and juiciness of the Roast Pork and Char Siew just melts in your mouth.

You still get the crisp char taste after biting into the meat!

You have many soup choices here too!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102467592239988127131/reviews
C L,5,This is a special mention of the economic rice stall. I may look like a delivery rider but I am not. I could sense that the server gave me extra portions of food without charging me extra due to his kindness and empathy. I am giving him a good review to thank him for his kind act.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100389401089113866419/reviews
