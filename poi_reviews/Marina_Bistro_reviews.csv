Rajesh Kuan,5,"This is a nice spot to unwind. I was a little surprised that the Nasi Goreng Istimewa was already sold out! Next time, I'll aim to arrive earlier for dinner. The service was good; they even gave alternative recommendations when certain dishes weren't available. And if the food we order is a lot they will advise. l didn't know their potion is surprisingly large.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110934531258946296528/reviews
Leong Sook Ting,5,"A great place for a leisurely meal with a holiday vibe by the sea! Thumbs-up for the butter chicken briyani, chicken satay, beef hor fun! They were well seasoned and tasty. The pork chop was a little bit tough but still yummy. The garlic truffle fries was a generous portion of fragrant goodness.
Overall, a meal with a view and happy atmosphere :)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100303798994004759726/reviews
Dave,5,"Visited Marina Bistro with my family over the weekend. I used to come here occasionally when I lived in the West, but it had been a long time since my last visit. This time, I came not just for the restaurant but also for a drive around the scenic marina area. Now, visiting as a husband and father, it felt quite nostalgic.

We arrived around lunchtime and enjoyed a great meal under beautiful weather. We ended up ordering a bit too much, but my son loved the food and had fun following the robot server around. The staff were consistently friendly and especially kind to children, which we really appreciated.

The food itself isn’t particularly unique, but it offers good value for money. The portions are generous, and there’s a nice variety of local dishes. It’s a great spot to drive out of the city for a relaxed meal. Would definitely visit again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109027836781136798029/reviews
Telescope User,3,"Have been in this bistro for many years. Used to visit more often then last two years. Today revisit. Atmosphere is the same (quite impossible to change), Food is the usual. The two beers, tiger was fantastic and fresh. The Edinger dark was not right, sour  tast. The restaurant later mentioned the barrel has been two days.

I need to start developing a new checklist to ask, e.g., the freshness of the draft before ordering (also recommended to you :-). It would be good to offer me discount or replacement of the non fresh, even I asked for. Service and food rate can go higher with these considerations.

Really nice and fresh draft Tiger beer.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105378429083931078691/reviews
B M,5,"I brought my family tonight here to celebrate my son‘s 16th birthday as well as to see another part of Singapore that none of us have seen before. The night was fantastic and MG, his service was tremendous. He is a true credit to the establishment. Thank you so much for making our family feel welcome and special.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105612424668560294295/reviews
