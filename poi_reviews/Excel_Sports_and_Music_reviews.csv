Keith Ong,5,"The gym located in excel centre is probably the best gym i have ever visited. They have a range of equipment brands from Cybex, RealeaderUSA, Freemotion, Hammer Strength and Hoist. This gym also has a ladies corner equipped with glute machines. My personal favourite machine was the HOIST CHEST PRESS machine, great stretch and squeeze on the pecs and it has a self lift-of system which is perfect. Gym has 1 toilet and male and female locker room separated. Really recommend if u are a bodybuilder.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116977191530181845096/reviews
