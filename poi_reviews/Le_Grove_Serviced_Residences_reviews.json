      "text": "I stayed at Le Grove Serviced Residences with my best friend, and it was such a cosy escape! Tucked away in the Orange Grove neighbourhood, it’s incredibly private yet still close to town. Do note that it’s a long walk from the MRT station tho, and there aren’t any convenient stores like 7-11 nearby. So GrabMart it is! The rooms are spacious; perfect for hosting a little brunch session with friends. We made pasta and steak using the well-equipped kitchen, which had all the equipment we needed. Didn’t get to try the breakfast since we kept sleeping in, but the overall vibe was so chill and relaxing, it felt like a getaway from Singapore. Just a heads-up, it’s a serviced apartment, so there’s no room service, and cleaning is only done on weekdays. There’s also a $$$ deposit so make sure to prepare cash or credit card! Overall I’d definitely come here again.",

      "text": "Amazing room at a good location 5 min drive to orchard road. However, the lack of flexibility from management has made a poor overall stay. We have to cut our stay short from 7 nights to 5 nights due unforseen circumstances. The hotel does not allow partial refund as be book from Agoda and not direct. We contacted Agoda, and they are willing to get in touch with the hotel to solve the issue. Nevertheless, the hotel decline to assist even though we told the change in date on our second day which leave plenty of time for the hotel to sell the room.\n\nDefinitely a disappointed to the management. We got a reply from Tong Min Yee which blamed us for booking through Agoda and tried to convince us to book direct??? Does not make sense if Agoda tried to help why hotel can't assist?",

      "text": "My wife and I recently spent about a week at Le Grove Serviced Apartments on Orange Grove Road during our two-week holiday in Singapore, and we were pleasantly surprised by the experience. Despite being a 3-star accommodation, it truly exceeded our expectations in many ways.\n\nThe location was convenient, just a short walk from Stevens MRT, which made getting around the city easy. The apartment itself was spacious and thoughtfully designed for the price. The layout was functional, with a separate sleeping area, living space, and a narrower kitchen area. The kitchen was well-equipped with a microwave, cooking hob, fridge/freezer, and enough plates, cutlery, and cooking utensils to prepare basic meals.\n\nWe were impressed by the amount of storage available, making it easy to unpack and feel at home for the week. One of the additional perks was the self-service laundry room, which we used twice during our stay. While the washing machines worked well, the dryers were a bit underwhelming and didn’t dry our clothes as effectively as we had hoped. However, having the option to wash clothes was definitely appreciated, especially on a longer trip.\n\nWhat really stood out was the overall comfort and value for money. Despite later staying at a 5-star hotel, we found ourselves preferring the experience at Le Grove. It offered everything we needed for a comfortable, extended stay at a fraction of the price.\n\nIf you're looking for affordable, spacious accommodation with convenient access to public transport in Singapore, we would highly recommend Le Grove Serviced Apartments.",

      "text": "If you’re simply looking for a place to sleep, this accommodation might work for you. However, if you expect in-hotel service or a memorable experience, this might not be the best choice. They provide just two small bottles of water at check-in, and even if you’re willing to pay, no additional water is available afterward.\n\nIf you choose to include breakfast, be aware that it’s only served until 9:30 am, which may not be convenient for everyone.\n\nOverall, I believe there are better options available than this one.",
