I recommended him to someone down with shingles and had the same good comments. A very effective and experienced doctor! Also a team of good staff there too.",

I felt in my heart, i was in good hands, finally & thankfully!\n\nThroughout my hospitalization, Dr Wong never once made me felt afraid or instill unnecessary fear about my liver condition.\nEvery report that came back, he very confidently shares with me, what are the diagnosis and his plan treatment.\nAbsolutely removing any elements of worries and putting me at total ease.\n\nAfter my discharge, he continued with outpatient treatments, sharing clearly on the goal of treatment | the medication required | length of time and the results we should be expecting. And Dr Wong is spot-on as based on each medical review after.\n\nMy hubby & i, is very thankful & grateful to  Dr Wong.\ni was able to just focus on the recovery & healing.\nHis humorousness side always brings on laughter & there is always an air of reassuring calm that all is in order under his expertise care.\n\nDr Wong is a very well poised and confident doctor, in my heart.\n\nMy gratefulness & appreciation to Dr Wong & his team of lovely nurses for their kind dedicated care during this period of time, even during the festive season.\n\nExtremely blessed to recovered well!\nThank you Dr Wong & team!\n\nPatient Yong P.S",
