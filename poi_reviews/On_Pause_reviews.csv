Zhou SC,5,"Had an amazing breakfast with our JRT at On Pause cafe on a weekday morning.

A fantastically pet friendly environment with both non-aircon & aircon seating available.

We had the ""all-day"" breakfast plate and mushroom truffle soup, which turned out to be absolutely delicious! 😊 Food portions are generous and it reminds me of lazy summer morning cafe brunches back in the UK!

Our JRT had a free ""PupCup"" containing whipped cream & honey! She slurped up the whole cup in a jiffy! 🐶

We will definitely be back again soon! 👍",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101113298838587728236/reviews

Jamie W,5,"I frequent On Pause a little too much for my own good. I was drawn to this place initially as it’s dog friendly which makes for a good spot to enjoy a nice lunch/breakfast with my dog. Over time, I’ve come to enjoy the food, ambience and the warm service from their team. I have tried a number of their items on the menu and is really fond of their Prawn and Guac tartine. Not sure if their portobello burger is still on the menu but that’s a good one too. Banana chocolate cake was really tasty too. I only wish that it’s easier to find a parking spot there!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111972747533251569870/reviews
