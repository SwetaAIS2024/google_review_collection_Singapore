G A,5,"This is my go-to clinic—super convenient as it’s just beside the MRT station. Nurses and doctors are friendly, approachable, and accommodating. The clinic itself is quite small, so it can get crowded during peak hours. Best to visit during non-rush hours if you want a shorter wait.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110239616130172309842/reviews

Ng Lee Beng,5,"I suffered a cut on my head when I was rushing through my gate. My son, a doctor working at a hospital emergency department, noted that it was a gaping wound needing stitching. We arrived at this clinic  near to my home, requesting whether he could stitch me up with their materials at the clinic. The doctor Dr Eileen and all the clinic assistants were  most helpful to provide all the necessary materials and the clinic room for our use. They were very concerned about my general condition and took the trouble to provide tissues to help clean up my hair and general appearance after the procedure, a seemingly small point but I am very touched by their empathetic concern. Heartfelt thanks to Dr's Shariffa and Eileen and your support staff for your quick response and flexibility to my call for help!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116260703801737104278/reviews
