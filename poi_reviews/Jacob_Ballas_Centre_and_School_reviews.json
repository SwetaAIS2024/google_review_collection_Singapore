It is a stupid law because you can easily find images of the synagogue on Google. Please learn from Chased-El Synagogue on how to earn goodwill, as they not only opened doors to the public to learn more about Judaism but even allowed photography inside (let alone outside).",

While standing opposite, I noticed the beautiful glass window so I took a photo of only the top part of the building. When walking towards that side of the walkway with Google map on my phone screen (because the temple is apparently on that side of the road), the guard deliberately walked towards the gate and yelled at me “NO PHOTOS. STOP.” I don’t see any “no photo” sign. If there is, they should make it big, if they isn’t then they should make one. If nobody is allowed to take pictures of the building, might as well cover the whole building.",
