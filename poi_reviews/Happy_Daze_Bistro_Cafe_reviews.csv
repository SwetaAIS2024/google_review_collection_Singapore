Kannan Balaiah,1,"Terrible fish and chips i ever had.

I strongly suggest not to try any food there .

Ordered a fish and chips for 26$ it is such a salty food i ever had.
And they don’t even bother when i report also

Only drinks Ok.
Still it depends on person. Some people may like salt so go and enjoy there for salty dish",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104869579109666216557/reviews
Ben Loy,4,"Pretty good selection of drinks. Food is pretty good, acceptable, but not the most value for money. Seems like a drinks after work area in the neighborhood",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115067595425147527913/reviews
Jiak Papa,4,Nice and cozy place for some beef and chill. It’s also a good place to catch some EPL games here. Finger food are tasty to go with your beer.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110691633906800161127/reviews
Fickle Travellers SG,4,"TGIF!🍺 It's been such a long time that we had Hoegaarden Rosee! What a treat! 🍻 We must agree that it's a girly beer and we ❤️ it!

We totally enjoyed the fish and chips! 🐠🍟 Super fresh battered fish! So deliciously yummy 😋

We also had the buffalo wings  (read: winglets, cos it was not the whole wing) Nicely done with a generous amount of sauce 👍

If you're not into sitting on high tables and chairs, walk further in and you'll find dining tables and cushioned seats.

Great service too! We were undecided but the service staff were friendly and approachable. Kudos to the team! We'll be back for sure 🥳",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107700181983239747780/reviews
