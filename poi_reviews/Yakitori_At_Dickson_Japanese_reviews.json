Sticks are well grilled and the sauce that accompanies the meat is tasty and good. Overall, good quality of ingredients used. Prices are very reasonable too. Will definately come back again for more.",

Heard from the other stall/Tze char workers that the business don't have a standard start work hours, this is extremely bad, as our entire family left for other food with huge disappointment. It took you years of effort to build a reputation & took 30 minutes (our driving time) to ruin it ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž",
