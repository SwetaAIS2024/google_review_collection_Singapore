irws,5,"Amazingly delicious nasi padang, the lontong curry was so fragrant, pleasantly coconuty taste w the right amount of spice! Their belachan stands out too and packs a punch! I recommend their fried chicken wing, simple marinade but truly delicious. They offer a variety of classic side dishes and I would have love to tried the rest too!:)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115523853910288402037/reviews
