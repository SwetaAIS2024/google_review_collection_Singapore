Siang Hock Kia,5,"Yew Tee Park is just minutes away from where I stay and it is where I normally go for my runs. The wonderful running track around the Park is about 450m long. The trees provide ample shades for my runs. There is also one of the longest slides I have seen in Singapore, and very popular with the kids. Lots of other facilities amidst the serene, well used and well loved Yew Tee Park.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115249856012771202641/reviews
