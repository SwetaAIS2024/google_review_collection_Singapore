Vasu on the go,5,"Dr.Clara Ong is one of the best gynecologists I have ever encountered. She doesn't delay the process and will do all the necessary tests and procedures to diagnose the problem quickly. What else does a patient need who is eagerly waiting to figure out what is happening to them?  It's not just Dr.Clara Ong. All the nurses assisting her are courteous and friendly, so with no second thoughts, I highly recommend visiting Dr. Clara Ong's clinic not just for pregnancy-related matters but also for all obstetrics and gynecology issues.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107120173911792021152/reviews

C T,5,"I find Dr Clara Ong to be very meticulous, thorough and prudent. She uses a straightforward & educational way of explaining things, which was very helpful and assuring. She didn't push for anything unnecessary or excessive. So far her medication worked well and has helped to improve my condition. For all these assuring reasons, I could entrust my confidence in her diagnosis and care.

Service & support: Dr Ong's staff are very caring, helpful and efficient.

Convenient location: Located in The Woodleigh Mall (Woodleigh MRT station).

Ambience: new, cozy, bright, clean, comfortable seats, and has its own toilets üöª",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113655893327780797256/reviews

Audrey Low,1,"Avoid this Specialist all cost if possible. I was referred from GP to do further checkup today for a scope and in the end I was lectured for the whole session of not able to differentiate a scope and a scan of medical terms. If I am able to understand in layman terms I wouldn't be following up with a doctor. This specialist is rude and curt in her response throughout the session when I tried to ask further on some medical terms. Not to mention, her procedure skills is bad. She make me go through 45 min of procedure complaining I was tense and she is unable to scan properly but not realising her whole personality is curt. A normal procedure of 15 to 20 mins lasted 45 mins.

I do not know where are the positive comments from, but this is not what I received from her poor attitude today.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106024620849750975463/reviews
