We visited on a weekday morning,  restaurant was rather empty. The foods were served in reasonable time and the staffs were friendly.  Good to visit. Car parking available at the HDB neighbourhood next to the committee centre.",

It’s situated on the ground floor of Tampines North Community Centre and boasts a new, big and inviting space for dine-in. Typical fast food fare but it’s a nice space to hang out in. And oh, it’s open 24 hours so great for late night hangs!",
