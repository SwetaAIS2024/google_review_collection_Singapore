Melanie E,4,"The food was so delicious that we came back here two days in a row!

Food: 4/5 - we mainly ordered breakfast items. Most of us enjoyed the praha- one was with mushrooms and another was cheese. One family member had the best ever chicken nuggets ever. There are vegetarian options available.
Service: 3/5 - the first day we visited, a family member waited over an hour for his soup which was eventually cancelled. Another ordered fried rice which took forever. That rating was 2/5. The following day was better.
Atmosphere: 3/5 - outdoor seating without fans

The place is located off the main drag which meant reasonable prices.

Google Account,5,"Pleasant meal and it was open late. I enjoyed my meal but found the portion of the noodle dish a little small. That said it's flavors were very dense and maybe a bigger portion would have been too much.

I got a egg wrap thingy not sure what it was but it was good.

Good value for sure in an expensive city n",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110340963552353778517/reviews
LEE,3,"Went for supper and found parking along the roadside. Ordered prata and teh tarik. The prata was decent but not as crispy as expected. However, the teh tarik was rich and flavorful. The place was peaceful and not too crowded at night, making it a comfortable spot to dine. Cleanliness was acceptable, though there‚Äôs room for improvement. Overall, a decent choice for a late-night meal, especially if you prefer a quieter environment. Would consider returning for another visit.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100197091380215637681/reviews
Mike Shary Production,3,"The last time I came here the food was badly serve, it's not nice, but recently I went and tried the mutton biryani, it's awesome, glad that the food was cooked with passion now, I hope it will stayed this way, for the vibes, it's good as there was outdoor sitting next to it. Nice ambience, parking was also easy especially at late night, no issues, weekend expect to be crowded.

Latest: I was overwhelmed by the gesture of one of the staff admitting some of the mistake and politely resolve the matter üëçüëç had upload his pic :)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103129479237663736934/reviews
