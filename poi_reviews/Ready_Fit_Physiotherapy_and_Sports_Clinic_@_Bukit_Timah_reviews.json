The heat therapy provided instant relief and I was happy that I learnt several techniques to manage my backache with targeted exercises and lifestyle change. Initially I was worried that the aches and pains would affect my performance at work but nowadays I am able to work much better.\nIt was my first time visiting a physiotherapist and I did not know what to expect, but Daryl is friendly and able to put one at ease. The clinic is very well equipped with high tech equipment tooðŸ˜Š 10/10 would recommend!",
