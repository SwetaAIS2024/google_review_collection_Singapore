Big Roy [eatwithroy],1,"Always ordered from this stall but my last Foodpanda order was a disappointment. Came in a 7"" takeaway bowl and every ingredient is much lesser than before. Really not worth the $20! Taste is still good but they are cutting on portions with a slightly increased price per item. Not good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114399014237804415281/reviews
Shane Wang,4,Ordered the mala xiang guo via Foodpanda. The food is reasonably priced and the portions are decent compared to other stalls that I have tried before. Ordered the less spicy version and it came just right and very tasty. If you are in the area do give it a try.

Julia Naung Naung,1,There are a lot of sands on food two times already. First order also got a lot of sands and we thought the delivery man dropped the food. And I ordered same food as before today again  but the food got really really a lot of sands and totally can not eat. How can the restaurant do like this kind of food? Lack of hygiene as Singapore. I will never order food from this shop.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110456035537545111372/reviews
Kelvin,4,"Food quality:
+ More 麻 (numbing) than 辣 (spicy). Even for 中辣 (medium spicy) there wasn’t much kick from the chilli
+ Fish mala xiang guo are tasty and fish is tender and fresh
- Their spicy chicken aren’t that good
- Food here is rather salty

Food portion / Price:
1 meat $3, vege $1 for mala xiang guo
Fish mala xiang guo $22 shareable for family of 4

Service:
Order, pay at counter, and self collect when buzzer sounds

Crowd:
Don’t be fooled by lack of queue due to the buzzer; there’s ALWAYS a queue!
