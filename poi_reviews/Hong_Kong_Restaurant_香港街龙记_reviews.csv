SL Wong,4,"Honestly, the food was quite yummy, and I think i enjoyed my dinner here. The portions are definitely a little bit smaller than usual standards but overall quite tasty. The kam heong fish was good, it was fragrant and spicy. But I would consider asking for fish fillet instead of fish head.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105996375849930329549/reviews
Esther Loh,5,"Came here a few times and I think the curry fish head is really nice 👍
The sauce is just the right texture and right taste for me.
But today ordered the 星洲米粉 and it’s a little disappointing. The taste is ok but the bee hoon texture is quite hard and chewy.
The 苦瓜炒蛋 I think not bad as well. Even thou today the chef didn’t cook the taste evenly. But I think I’ll still come back to try other dish and review 😂

Update:
Tried the Lala bee hoon and it’s surprisingly nice plus Lala is big.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113731489003917763911/reviews
Andrew Lan,3,"Horfun was a humongous portion at $17. Could have fed 5 people! Surprised by the wokhei in the kway tiao. Prawns were tiny, totally unlike the pics shown. Ingredients are not generous enough. Xinzhou meefen is a pass. Not enough taste. Charsiew cut too small for a good taste. Lemon chicken is too hard. Too much batter. Sauce is just passable. I miss the old stall!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101327065772656168114/reviews
Retronala,4,"Not bad to satisfy your need for local zichar... was abit salty to my liking though I asked for less salty. Still good to go!

Johanna Chow,5,"I admit this isn’t the best Tze char/ fish head steamboat place but eating 5/5 because it’s a rare gem in Pasir Ris!

Fish head steamboat red grouper @ $62. Fish is super fresh. Soup can be more flavourful from the start, but after some time of boiling it’s really quite good.

Highlights: sin chew bee hoon and san lou hor fun — wok hey was amazing. Fried baby squid is a must get too!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104436666547405320865/reviews
