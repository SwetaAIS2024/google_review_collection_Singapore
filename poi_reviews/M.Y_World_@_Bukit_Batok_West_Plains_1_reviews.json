They notice her milestones readily, share feedback at regular intervals, and the half-yearly portfolio that is shared with parents contains specific milestones and phrases that my daughter uses.\n\nThe schoolâ€™s facilities are new and modern and the layout is spacious and bright. The school is also very prompt with updates about covid, HFMD and other health concerns  and issues. Our daughter enjoys going to school very much! Thank you My World for being a great place for her to learn and grow.",

Asked them questions in the app, including the VP, but they don't bother to reply.\n\nPromoted to K1 CARING and the N2 teachers (admin and management too) didn't bother to pass down important instructions, such as wearing mask when child is in the centre, to the K1 teachers.\n\nBasically, the attitude of the lot in that centre is very poor, blatantly show not-my-responsibility attitude toward us. Gotten a couple of feedback from my child's friends' parents there that the centre's organisation and management are appalling.",

      "text": "My child was in Infant care to PG and then to N1 in this school. Just to share within a year of opening, they have changed 3 Principals. From IFC to PG, I had good experience with the teachers and the first Principal who is known to be motherly but she left shortly after. My kid also enjoyed school during the PG times. The teachers were good. However things started to take a turn for worse after the second P came in, unfriendly and no empathy for kids and parents. My kid was transiting from PG to N1 in December and was injured but no proper care or concern was given, and the Second P gave all sorts of excuses and have no intention to support parents in their concerns and worries. Little did I know she was already serving her notice period but still that was very unprofessional of her to push the blame to the kids for rejecting proper first aid care. Parents was not informed as well until I discovered the wound myself. I escalated to HQ and originally they said the sch ( which is the P) will take it up but I was furious that they didnâ€™t wan to take up the case themselves as ultimately we go to HQ for a reason , because the P wasnâ€™t able to handle parents concerns and feedback well. Eventually, we withdraw our kid as we are not comfortable with the level of care by the N1 teacher and my kid dread n had nightmares every night. I Didnâ€™t ask for cctv or go to Ecda since we are already withdrawing. Was a disappointing experience. The new P who has joined recently and according to my friends who still have kids there, they had recent bad experience as well with the P. In summary, with the recent experience, I wonâ€™t recommend the school now.",
