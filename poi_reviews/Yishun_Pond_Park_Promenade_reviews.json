Kudos to NParks planners who pioneered the concept of linking up the \"pond\" with the park across the road, sand integrating in the Safra clubhouse.\n\nNParks also retained the original trees, shrubbery, and edible roots. During durian seasons, scavengers have been known to hold all-night vigils. Heartlanders can even expect tapioca and various edible greens growing wild here. But harvesting may not be a good idea.",
