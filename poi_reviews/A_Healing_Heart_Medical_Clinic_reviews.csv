Honest Opinion,5,"I brought 2 bags of medical reports to ask for second opinion of my heart condition 2 months ago. To my surprise, the nurses and Doc took effort to scan and went through! The other 2 heart clinics didn't even bother and wanted me to repeat the tests. Dr Gerald also took time to explain to me my medical condition and finally I understood. Most importantly, my medications were adjusted and I am beginning to regain my stamina. 2 thumbs up.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101359687739051102785/reviews
Xavier,5,Brought my mum to see A Healing Heart Medical for her heart problems that she has consulted many doctors in Indonesia and Penang with no improvements. I have become so jaded with doctors but Dr Gerald proved me wrong. The precision and effort put in by the doctor was even more admirable even with his usual nurse away. I will definitely recommend A Healing Heart to my other family members.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115517684651708009605/reviews
mingang1,5,"I have been a patient of A Healing Heart Medical Clinic for over two years.

Dr. Gerald is highly professional, well-versed in meeting his patients' needs, and extremely thorough in his evaluation and prescription.

The nurses are very friendly and patient and execute their roles with the highest standard of care. All aspects of the business are administered in accordance with respective medical SOPs.

I am grateful to have found such a company in which I can place my professional trust in concerning my health and overall well-being. My experience here has been far better than that of other private clinics. Much appreciated to the doctor and staff!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108206190253997237708/reviews

Z -,5,"Lovely space that feels nice and welcoming, even has elevator music in the waiting area.

Nurses are friendly and comprehensive in doing their triage though it is quite time-consuming (took about 10 minutes, then saw doc who had the same questions and more).

Doctor is really nice and caring, and patiently went out of his way to explain some drug interactions to me (which my prescriber did not, and I really appreciated!)

Never had a doctor's visit that I would describe as ""pleasant"" like this before! Would definitely be recommending this clinic to my family and neighbors.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113046573423469443838/reviews
