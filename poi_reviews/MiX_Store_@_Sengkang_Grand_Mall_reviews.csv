Kitty Meow,5,"I'm new to their store. Today went to get all the Sanrio soda drink.. is was so adorable and I like it. And their cartoon ice cream looks very cute too. But unfortunately I didn't bought them I scared it will melt on my way home.

And I didn't know it was a small outlet. But from the outside looks big. üòÖüòÖüòÖ",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112442654968174059206/reviews
William Lu,4,"I thought it was a self-service store by seeing the counter until there was one staff there helping to key the payment amount manually for the payment terminal for the cashless transaction.

Variety of products are good, from multiple countries, Korea, China, Japan, Thailand, etc.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
Getrunning ‚ÄúFoodaholic‚Äù Now,5,"The Malay and Chinese lady staff here are very friendly. I love the variety of cute korean products, some even come with a cute souvenir/toy inside the sweets box.

Indrani Rani,1,"the items in the shop are interesting & i had fun looking around & wanted to get some stuff, however i didn‚Äôt feel like purchasing anything because of how rude the salesperson was. it was a self service checkout machine & i was trying to make payment via paywave, i may have accidentally pressed the wrong payment option & she was so rude about it saying ‚Äúwhat u press, must press this one‚Äù with a really bad attitude. i hope the management can look into this & hire staffs that are willing to work in a customer service oriented environment.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117387134780470983514/reviews
