The instructor was really kind and generous and gave a lot of pretty flowers for us to choose from! She was also very knowledgeable on her craft.

Phyllis Jedidiah,5,"booked a private session to celebrate my momâ€™s birthday and it we had such a lovely time ðŸ¥°

Julia is such an AMAZING host! sheâ€™s was super patient in guiding us to create our own candles (which smell so amazing!!)

fyi, she uses premium quality essential oils! (thank you for being so generous, Julia)

the acrylic art pouring activity was also really therapeutic. we didnâ€™t just paint, Julia asked us meaningful questions to help us connect with our emotions during the process. was an interesting experience :D

added a cheese & meat platter which was absolutely tasty ðŸ¤© never thought that creating art would go well with snacks but now iâ€™m never doing any other way ðŸ˜‚

thank you so much for the wonderful experience Julia! your graciousness and kindness shines forth in even the smallest attention to detail ðŸ¥°",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115960196206651862156/reviews
