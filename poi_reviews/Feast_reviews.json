Temperature of the mushroom soup can be hotter as only lukewarm when served, but tastes great, and we like it.\nKnowledge of the cashier can be improved as she is not able to answer the ingredients of food we asked and is not sure about the coffee and tea all day promotion. End up we not buying any coffee and switch to other choices.",

      "text": "A very mediocre at best -  to grab a snack if youâ€™re absolutely starving after flower shopping - if u really canâ€™t wait to move onto somewhere else.\n\nThe food standards is varying. The bread slices that came with my soup were as white as a face smothered in suncreen with white cast ðŸ¤£. Whereas the table beside me had golden brown toasts.\n\nThe truffle fries truly a joke. As you can see in my picture the cheese - literally u can count how many little bitsâ€¦ would rather no cheese at all if they are too cheap on costing to give an appropriate portion of decent cheese. Fries have no taste of truffle either. Save your $2 and just get regular fries.\n\nTables were cleared but not wiped down. Sticky and dirty - I had to clean it on my own.\n\nThe latte was subpar tooâ€¦\n\nNext time after flower shopping, Iâ€™ll take a ride out to other food options. Waste of moneyâ€¦ even worse waste of my calories.",

Nice ambience and plenty of seats\n\n+ Wide variety of dishes but prices are high, which is somewhat odd unless the restaurant operator is not Far East Flora itself but renting from the latter (breakfast set $6.50, Egg Benedict $14.90, Asian Laksa/ curry chicken set $11.90, pastas $17.90, Waffle ice cream $5.90)\n\n= Parking available at d Far East Flora side of the building but given the limited lots per floor, you may need to drive pretty high up to find lots.",

Not crowded when I was here but I suspect that this wonâ€™t be the case for long once more people find out about this gem. Great place to chill, read your newspaper on a slow Sunday morning. Pro Hack: They offer $0.50 black coffee with your breakfast.",
