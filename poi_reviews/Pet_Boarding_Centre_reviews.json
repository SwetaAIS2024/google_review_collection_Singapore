The place is very clean and the staff knows what they are doing :). Cayden has cancer and the staff took very good care in making sure he takes his medications timely. Once again, thank you everyone at pet boarding centre for taking care of my fur baby. Highly recommend and cayden will be back again. :)",

      "text": "My cats were under their care for 4 days. Upon arrival, was a bit concerned due to the dog noise and vicinity, but indoors it was very clean with no smell and I saw that the other cats in other rooms were lounging and rolling on their backs comfortably. They sent me daily morning videos to show how my cats are doing and I could see within two days even my more anxious cat was relaxed! Regina is clearly a cat lover and can hear her speak adoringly to my cats. I'm really impressed with the service and care they showed for my fur babies.üôèüôè‚ù§Ô∏è",

Initially apprehensive, we decided to visit the center first and Regina was incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Despite the loud dog noises in the vicinity, the center itself is very conducive for cats. I had a fantastic experience, receiving daily updates including photos and videos of my cat. I'm confident that my cat also had a wonderful time there. I highly recommend this center for cat boarding!",
