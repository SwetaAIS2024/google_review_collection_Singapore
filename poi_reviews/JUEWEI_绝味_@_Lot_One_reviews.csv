Jessica,5,"Ordered Kelp Knots & Duck Wings via Foodpanda delivery for $1.99 delivery and loved it so much! The food portion is just right for one person’s meal and the mala spice level is just right.

Just unbox and pour contents onto a plate, microwave for 1.5 minutes and you’re ready to go!
Personal favourite has gotta be the kelp.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101155769435742692907/reviews
