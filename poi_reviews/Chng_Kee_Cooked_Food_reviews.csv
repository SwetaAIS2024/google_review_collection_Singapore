AC Chan,5,"This steamed meat patty is a dish that‚Äôs close to my heart ‚Äî coarsely chopped patty made with a good balance of fatty and lean meat, giving it that perfect springy texture. ‚ù§Ô∏è the generous slices of black fungus, salted fish, and dong cai [a.k.a. preserved cabbage] that are mixed into the patty ‚Äî
pure comfort in every bite! üòã",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
Leonard Lim,4,"My wife and I tried the fish tail curry ( they ran out of fish head $25 at 6.30pm!) and prawn paste chicken $8 ( har cheong gai). The price is higher than the other Zhi char stall a level higher but more than compensated by the generous sized fleshy and super fresh fish tail. The curry was naturally sweetened by the onions, eggplant, and okra, and has just the right sourness including a couple of unripe pineapple slices. We slurped up almost all the curry.

The prawn paste chicken pieces are slightly bigger than the stall on the 3rd stall, and definitely more juicy.

There are many zhi char stalls in the same food center so it's tough competition. But this one has won my heart.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101173751535810787329/reviews
Jem T,4,"Bought the curry fish for takeaway. It‚Äôs spicy, fresh and it cost $29 for the tail part of the red snapper. Comes with plenty lady‚Äôs finger.

Gary Pak,3,"Wow a slice of fish, especially half of it was taken, $26 very expensive to sell it at this price by hawker centre stall... faint... 1 time is enough although the taste of it and freshness is good üòå probably the stall owner see me as a big carrot head LOL üòÇ",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112249485964616889077/reviews
