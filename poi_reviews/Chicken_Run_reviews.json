      "text": "I always see the place crowed, so I decided to give it a try. We decided to order the medium chicken pot with level one spicy which cost $21.90 for 2-3 person sharing. Customizable options with three levels of spiciness. The thick brown broth goes perfectly well with rice. They will top up the soup, which turns the pot into a steamboat. Additional-on is available for the steamboat. The prices range from $1.90 to $3.90. Besides that, we ordered egg fried rice with honey chicken chop. The taste is average. Maybe next time we can consider their lunchtime promotion.",

The fish was pretty firm and delicious, and dip it with their chilli sauce for an additional spicy kick! Good for sharing between 3 or more people!\n\nNext, the chicken pot was saucy, the bubbling of the gravy by itself looked very appetizing already. Taste wise was not bad, the meat was pretty tender and nice chewy texture. Other ingredients were fresh, crunchy and sweet. In my opinion, the meat size was slightly small, if only the meat was a bit thicker, and throwing in a bit more dried chilli then I think would be perfect. It still tasted quite nice in general! Good for sharing between 2 or 3 persons given the portion of meats, the chunks of fish from the fish pot was more satisfying and sufficient.\n\nStir fried baby spinach was fragrant, fresh and savoury. Quite good, veg lovers might appreciate it more!\n\nThe pork belly was nice, coated with aromatic minced garlic sauce along with fresh crunchy cucumbers. Overall taste wise still has room for improvement though.\n\n‚ú® Ambience wise: Felt slightly like Song Fa Bak Kut Teh or Dian Xiao Er restaurant, Chinese restaurant vibe!\n\nü§µüèª Service wise: Great!\n\nüíµ Price wise:\nHot and sour fish pot(M) ÈÖ∏Ëæ£È±ºÈîÖ $23.90\rChicken pot(M) È∏°ËÇâÈ¶ôÈîÖ $21.90\rStir fried Baby Spinach ËíúÁÇíÁÆ•Ëèú $8.80\rPork belly with Crushed Garlic ËíúÊ≥•ÁôΩËÇâ $7.90",
