Divyanshu Mahajan,4,It should be called The Garden of Lost Fame at Bukit Peropok. It’s a small garden with outlook of the west and has the tower for a better view. It opened in 1970 for foreign VIPs to ascend to the highest point in the west and plant a memory of their visit as a tree (the first tree was planted in 1969 and the last tree was planted in 1984). It’s quite peaceful and is usually not crowded.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110651958606620480842/reviews
Wesley Wong,3,"The garden has a few trees planted by some famous people, like the royal family from UK. But other than that, nothing special there. You can spend some time to find out who planted the trees there.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107433449088212182977/reviews
