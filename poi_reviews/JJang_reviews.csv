Phyllis (Phy),5,"We had a wonderful dining experience at this Korean BBQ buffet! The food were fresh, flavorful, and well-prepared. From the tender meats to the delicious side dishes, Taste great with their sauce in particular. The only downside was limited choice. The outdoor ambience was another highlight — very soothing, clean, and inviting, making us feel relaxed and welcomed from the moment we stepped in.

Both my kids and the elderly members truly enjoyed themselves. The staff were kind and attentive, and the environment was comfortable for all ages.

The price is fair considering the quality and variety of the food. Highly recommended — we’ll certainly be coming back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103768221575801164786/reviews
