In fact, every strand of beehoon and ingredient coated with the gloriously rich, thick and savoury peanut satay sauce is pure awesome-ness!",

      "text": "Queued for 10min and ordered $5 satay bee hoon.\n\nComparable with guan heng cooked food satay beehoon but is a different take. Satay sauce is more savory than sweet if that's your take you probably prefer this.\n\nMeat was thinly sliced so the lack of tenderness wasn't obvious. Cuttlefish goes well and provides extra dimensions due to the bounce. Definitely not spicy and the amount is not the largest.\n\nWhat i feel can improve for me is that the sauce and noodle can be less viscous after all the mixing. It clumped up too much so ended up with noodle lump rather than noddles. Nevertheless a good tasting plate of satay beehoon",
