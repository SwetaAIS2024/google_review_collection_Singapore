      "text": "The pizza that I ordered is really disappointing. We order Pizza 1 V which stated in the menu that it comes with mozzarella cheese and added extra topping for pepperoni. As you can see from the 1st photo the pizza served to us, it comes with only tomato sauce and no cheese. We checked with the service crew and was told that the cheese is mixed in with the tomato sauce. We really don’t taste any cheese on the pizza, clearly it was not added. They quickly offer to pass us some parmesan cheese flakes. The sourdough is good tho. For the price of $27.50 for such a lousy quality pizza, it’s totally not worth.",
