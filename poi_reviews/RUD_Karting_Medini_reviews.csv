Bhaskar Singapore,5,"It's wow what a fantastic racing track. Truly international experience.

Lot of accessories also provided like Balaclava, Socks, gloves and Helmet Cameras also.

Ensure to have sports shoes compulsory, suggested to bing your own Balaclava or purchase once and keep it with you.

Ride is awesome, kids, teens and suitable for age groups.

Really exciting and fascinating. Nice cafe also near to hangout.

Best time to go is evening or night and no rain. If it rains ride will be cancelled and no refund.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118414779972405165627/reviews

yt yt,5,It was my first time go karting and I would 10/10 come here again! The staff were very friendly and helpful. Loved that they had free storage for us to put our stuff in while we were go karting! The cafe was pretty good too! They had private rooms which seems like a good place to hold small parties,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108444301745598175330/reviews

Belden Phang,5,"Had an amazing time at RUD Karting in Medini! It was my first time trying go-karting, and I had an absolute blast. The experience was everything I hoped for and more. I highly recommend the Stage 1 kart, which packs 8 HP and even has pop n bangs!! It was such a fun surprise! ü§© The karts are very well maintained, and the price is fair for the quality of the experience.

The staff were super friendly and helpful, making sure everything ran smoothly. For anyone who's a first-timer, this place is definitely worth a visit! I‚Äôll be back for more karting fun for sure! üëçüèª",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101780301414388104995/reviews
