Mun Chong,5,"Small chocolate fudge cake is delightful
Cake is soft and very fresh
Must buy whole cake only
Fudge is not sweet so we like it very much
It might be my imagination but there's a trace of salty? on first contact with taste buds
Anyway we demolished it easily... Fudge only looks heavy but it's very light in reality. I could easily eat 2 slices in one sitting (which I did, to my surprise)
Highly highly recommended and will be back for the durian",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103491652776344320179/reviews
Xen,5,"I have tried both the chocolate and durian cakes from Jane's Cake Station, and neither has disappointed me. The chocolate cake was really fudgy and rich, yet not too sweet. The durian cake was also rich, as the filling is made with actual durian flesh. Highly recommend! Thank you for providing us with such amazing cakes ",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117238660526454589569/reviews
Issa Mauricio,5,"Called at around 2pm on a Monday to see if there’s still a cake available to purchase. They said yes and we went down by 4pm to pick it up. We got the chocolate cake which tastes like a dream! The cake is super soft, airy and moist even after slicing into it and having it in the fridge for a day. The chocolate isn’t so rich that you can literally have 2 slices in one sitting and not feel like you’ve sinned. HAHA
1 whole cake cost us $42. Will be back to try their durian cake next time!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108900948281187168831/reviews
Ervin Tan,5,"I bought a chocolate cake here for a family member’s birthday. The chocolate aroma was so rich and inviting, and the texture was incredibly moist and soft.

The taste was just right, not too sweet, with a deep and satisfying chocolate flavor. Everyone at the party kept going for second servings, and even the kids loved it.

This cake definitely added a special touch to the birthday celebration, and my family has already decided that Jane Cake Station will be our go-to for future events. Highly recommended for anyone looking for delicious cakes!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115027766127033291414/reviews
Anthony Gunawan (R'Borne),5,"Still a bit speechless after tasting .. i love it much. Smells very fragrant. The soft creme at the top & bottom compliment the cake itself somehow. Aftertaste of the durian is there, really enjoyed it. The cake entirely not too sweet, none of the flavors are overempowering. Good balance in my opinion. Pricewise, definitely worth the experience. Coming back for the choc cake next time ..",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113982447075945401846/reviews
