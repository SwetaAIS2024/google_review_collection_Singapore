Hazel Chan,5,"Maplebear Hillview was a wonderful preschool for my two children. My elder child was there from K1 to K2, and the younger one just graduated after spending more than four years there. We had the pleasure of having Ms Pearlyn as their form teacher from K1 to K2; she was nurturing and kind, and brought out the best in the children. The other teachers who taught my children, such as Song Laoshi, Ms Pam and Ms Ella, also left an indelible mark on us with their patience and care.

The K2 Graduation Concerts were also remarkable as the teachers conceptualised, scripted, directed, designed and produced everything in-house. From the elaborate stage performances pre-Covid to a movie musical in pandemic times, the teachers demonstrated creativity in showcasing the young talents under their care. Thank you, dear Maplebear Hillview teachers, for the memorable experience!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117852846968797437693/reviews
