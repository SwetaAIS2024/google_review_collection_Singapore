What a nice touch.\n\nOf course the price is on the higher side, but there‚Äôs Safra discount here. Paid $15 for my chicken briyani set meal and teh tarik. Only gripe is the tandoori chicken portion could have been better, but otherwise everything was really tasty and wait staff were extremely proactive.\n\nThank you, will be back to try other dishes in future.",

The fish head curry was also surprisingly good! The portions are generous, except the tandoori chicken and the service is friendly. Highly recommended for authentic Indian flavors!",

However, when I received my food, it was a different gravy, and I immediately realized that the correct item was not provided. I was not informed that Chicken Chettina was unavailable, and instead, I was given black pepper chicken without any prior notice.\n\nThis lack of communication is both dishonest and misleading, especially for a regular customer like myself. I am very disappointed by this experience and hope that you will take this feedback seriously to avoid such issues in the future.",
