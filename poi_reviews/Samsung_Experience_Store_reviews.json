      "text": "I purchased a phone with a screen protector on wednesday and there is already a chip on the protector. When I checked with the person at the cashier, he didn't even bother to look at me or the phone and said that it is like that and they don't have any issues so far. I generally have  a very good experience with the staff but this is horrible service of just one person who i believe is the manager. I don't expect a replacement but at least some attention given to a customer is needed. If you cannot be bothered with a customer with queries and have feedback on your product, then it is quite disappointing.",
