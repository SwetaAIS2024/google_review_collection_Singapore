      "text": "I was at the airport in the morning, and Heavenly Wang was one of the few places open for breakfast. I usually get the curry rice—one of the best, in my opinion. Their kaya toast is also good.\n\nThis time, I tried the rendang, but it was a bit salty for my liking. The Milo, however, was great—just the right balance between Milo and milk. The environment is nice, and it’s Halal too. Whether it’s packed in the morning depends on flight departures, so it can go either way.",

Came back from U.S. and miss local cuisine.\n\nDecided to go with Heavenly Wang as it was right outside (very near) the carousel where I collected my luggage.\n\nOrder Laksa Set with Large Iced Milo and Kaya Butter Toast.\n\nLaksa had lots of ingredients Prawns, Fish Cakes, Tau Pok & Bean Sprouts. The Laksa gravy was not the best (seems to be missing coconut or have too little of it) but after a week in U.S. it tasted really fantastic.\n\nIced Milo cannot go wrong. Full of Milo in the drink. Enjoy it thoroughly.\n\nKaya Butter Toast is good but lacking in Kaya Jam.\n\nOverall a good price of $13.70.",

DRINK ONLY!” He continuously talking without even look into my face - he completely ignore and scold me.\n\nI am genuinely shocked by his behavior and manner. What took me personal was, there was this lady (probably local) who came before me. He served her nicely and even can make a nice joke with her. Racist much?\n\nWhen I go to GMB to leave a review, I am not the only one who dissatisfied with the service here.\n\nNot even tasting the food, but if the server has this kind of behavior, then what kind of food that he will serve?\n\nI also not sure if management really takes care of the reviews, since some reviews about the service has been there for a long time. Yet, I still have this kind of experience.",
