Tan Li Ting,4,"Starting with its iconic rainbow of Ang Ku Kuehs, Madam Ang KK by Old Seng Choong has expanded with a vibrant new dine-in concept at Parkway Parade.

The menu is a true celebration of local flavours, from comforting Nasi Lemak and Dry Mee Siam to exclusive treats like Sambal Prawn Petai and Fish Otah. Pair it with their signature hazelnut-infused Kopi and end with an irresistible selection of sweet treats.

A spot for both nostalgic foodies and new generations craving a taste of Singaporeâ€™s rich culinary heritage!

Highly recommend: Dry Mee Siam
Note: Limited Seating available",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104947271214129334571/reviews

Nicole,4,"Bought 2 pieces of ang ku kueh and they came in a cute plastic bag, the skin is thicker and for how shiny and oily it looked, it was not as oily as expected. Not bad. The typical flavours are cheaper (less than $2 per piece for mung bean or peanut) while the unique flavours cost $2 or more ($2 for black sesame)",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108204282386072127455/reviews
