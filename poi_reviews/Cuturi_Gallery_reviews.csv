Yufan,5,"Came for the Summer Art Show 2023 two weeks back. First art show Iâ€™ve attended. Nice cosy place with youthful vibes! Iâ€™m impressed by how young all the artists are. Didnâ€™t feel any snobbish vibes during my visit. And had a nice time just observing the paintings, interpreting them and inferring from them however I liked.
