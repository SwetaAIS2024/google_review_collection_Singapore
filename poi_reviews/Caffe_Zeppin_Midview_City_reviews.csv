BEE (Nobody),4,We were passing by and happened to give this cafe a try. Would says a fusion type of jap cum taiwan cuisine.  The chicken chop and fries were crispy and good. Calamari was good also. The fish and chip was nice except would prefer a firmer type of fish meat. Staff were friendly and atmosphere cozy. Would recommend to give it a try if you happen to go be around this area if you never try before.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102420973825775377538/reviews
Lily Kho,5,"We’ve been regulars at Cafe Zeppin for quite some time now, and the food has always been consistently good. Today, I noticed my usual Unagi Don seemed a little smaller than usual, so I gave some feedback to the staff. I was really impressed by how seriously they took it , they listened sincerely, conveyed it to the chef right away, and even offered a small replacement along with a warm apology.

Their genuine care for customer feedback and excellent service truly stands out. It’s this kind of thoughtfulness that keeps us coming back. Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108506571257677039404/reviews
Isabelle Tay,4,"Very nice cafe with good food while you're doing your errands here! Food and drinks were affordable and taste good too! Fried stuff were probably frozen but its well cooked and comes out piping hot. Bubble tea was good too!

Staff were very friendly as well. Only thing is they dont accept credit card so do take note!

Will definitely dine here if im running errands around this area!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104140455507701408773/reviews

Matthew Yang,5,"Came in for lunch, had the promos which is really value for money. Definitely must try the Mentaiko Spaghetti and truffle fries. If you're in the area, the food won't disappoint.

Many choices for drinks, the Boba tea is not too bad.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104153784519796056235/reviews
