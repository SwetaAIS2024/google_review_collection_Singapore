Kelvin Teo,3,"Coffee blends are decent and they do serve a good cuppa. Dining environment is comfortable, well laid out and clean. I do question the service, or lack of. And I do hope the barista would stop his bl%@dy annoying habit of rocking the dosing lever on the grinder, or consider upgrading to an automated unit. We are paying to enjoy the environment (aside from the coffee) too.

Otherwise, %Cafe is a good place for your coffee fix.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103803856797782576531/reviews

Adelle Lin,5,Spanish latte was great. Reasonably strong but not bitter. Just the right amount of sweet. Croissant was very flaky and delicious,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105094839609265602400/reviews
