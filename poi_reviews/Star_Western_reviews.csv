Rachel,5,"Went twice and found the portion pretty reasonable for the price, the chicken chop was well marinated and I enjoyed the meal!
There was a small surprise to see luncheon meat in the baked beans. The rice, garlic bread were also tasty which goes well with the protein option.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108150863685911296817/reviews
Lionel,4,"Ordered the pork chop for $10 at this 24-hour Western food stall. A little pricier than usual, though it does come with an extra egg. What‚Äôs great is the convenience ‚Äî self-ordering kiosks and credit card payment available, which is a plus.

Coffee shop is a little too small though",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114987248048361781546/reviews
Ming Wei Lee,5,"Nice western food setup at this young vibe coffeeshop. Ordering is a breeze as they use a self checkout kiosks, may mean harder to customise but it was relatively easy. Food portion is good. Chicken chop rice was delicious. For the pork chop, felt they put so much sauce that I could hardly taste the pork but it was still good nonetheless. Parking is relatively a challenge but gets better when it's later in the night.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107724540457866476907/reviews
Chong Zhen Ling,5,"Absolutely delicious. Don‚Äôt compare to atas western restaurants which charge GST.
I have ordered pork chop(2 pieces) instead of the ‚Äòmust try‚Äô chicken chop and I must said I am damn impressed of the generous serving and thickness compare to other kopitiam (cheat feeling).
I also notice there were some unhappy customers frustrated about the ordering system/kiosk malfunction. Just a suggestion to the store, maybe install more than 1 kiosk machine in case one breakdown.
Have tried fish & chips and chicken chop on separate days‚Ä¶honestly a bit average. Just a personal preference, pork chop is my ‚Äògo-to‚Äôüòù",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101067679023357000686/reviews
Richard Sng,4,"Paid $9 for a plate of black pepper chicken chop. I thought it‚Äôs a bit pricey but am surprised the portion is quite big with a sizable piece of chicken with a sunny side egg, delicious fry, baked beans, breads. The pepper sauce is savoury, chicken chop is very tender, perfectly cooked, very tasty. The generous portion is good for a satisfying meal. Overall taste is good. Totally worth a try. The coffee shop is not big, seats are limited, best to avoid peak hours.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104370439475671977562/reviews
