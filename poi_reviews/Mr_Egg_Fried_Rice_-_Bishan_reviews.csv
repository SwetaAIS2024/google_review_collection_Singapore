Cheng Huan Chang,5,"If Justice is best served cold, then this fried rice is best served hot. Because the juiciness and tenderness of the pork chop only last while it is hot. So do eat the fried rice here fresh and hot, instead of take away and enjoy its special chili that charges extra if you want more. It is a special chili made of fried garlic with chili sauce which is not found elsewhere and makes you crave for more. Truly a store that deserves a 5 star for its food.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102407814083102415334/reviews
Yun Xiang,4,"Fried rice with pork chop at $7.2.

Generous portion of pork chop. Pork chop is tender and juicy. Very well marinated.

Egg fried rice taste is average, less fragrant.

Chilli adds some kick to the dish, especially to the fried rice to enhance the lack of fragrance.

Overall, I find the rice and pork chop a little oily. But still this fried rice is above average and serve relatively fast after order.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100471045446290739173/reviews
Derrick Lin,5,"One of the best fried rice you can find in coffeeshops. I order pork cutlet fried rice and the meat was really nicely marinated and tender. Ask for chilli for extra flavour, so nice that you can eat the chilli on its own, super crunchy.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105989843156970934066/reviews

Gasper Chan,4,"Tender chicken chop with tasty fried rice!

Tried this place as I had a sudden craving for fried rice. It’s located in a coffeeshop, prices are slightly high for a coffeeshop. Food was tasty and the chicken and pork chop was tender. Chilli crisp was good as well!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116187504655013802323/reviews
