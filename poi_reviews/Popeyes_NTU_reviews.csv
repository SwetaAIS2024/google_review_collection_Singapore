Ruoxi Chen,3,The fried chickens are too oily. I got three pimples on my forehead the day after eating the chicken.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116119465298095138973/reviews
Lim Lex,1,"The food from this Popeyes branch started out great and I loved the chicken sandwich. Now the chicken batter is hard and no longer crispy, chicken is stringy and dry, they are not generous with the sauces, and the mash potatoes is a pathetic amount compared to the past. They should review their policies since their sales figures should be an obvious indicator of their failings.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110386063034739469638/reviews
L H,2,"I was today years old when i realise that popeyes WINGS are SOOOO SMALL. Like the size of nuggets. Bought the 4 pc golden mala spicy chicken wings for almost $10, and the portion was PATHETIC. Went to the counter, and the staff explained it was because the supplier gave them SMALL WINGS. I think she pitied me because she added 1 more wing for me. The picture shows 5 pc but in actuality it was MORE PATHETIC than the picture.
DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WINGS. PATHETICALLY SMALL. DAYLIGHT ROBBERY.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112403698934115987287/reviews
