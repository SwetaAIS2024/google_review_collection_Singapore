      "text": "Ordered their Yuan Yang Fried Carrot Cake ($6) and Fried Oyster ($8).\n\nAm not a fan of chunky carrot cake - their carrot cake has pieces that tend to be on the larger side.  Having said that, their carrot cake is not at all oily.  In fact, I had more oil on my face when I was an adolescent than the oil on their carrot cake.\n\nSo I'd say their carrot cake is not too bad, though certainly not among the best I've tasted.\n\nTheir Fried Oyster was a disappointment to me, although my wife felt it was \"ok\".  The dish was oily and the flour was clumpy.  Quite unlike other Fried Oyster dishes that I have tried, and not in a good way.\n\nYuan Yang Carrot Cake:  3.25/5\nFried Oyster: 1.5/5",
