Jane Chai,5,"I recently stopped by McDonald's for a quick lunch.  I ordered a Filet-O-Fish, Chicken McCrispy, and a side of corn.  Everything was fresh and tasty, prepared quickly, and the service was friendly.  The McCafé coffee was a nice addition to the meal.  The restaurant was clean and well-maintained.  A convenient and satisfying dining experience.  I would definitely recommend this location!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104795166523709536305/reviews
