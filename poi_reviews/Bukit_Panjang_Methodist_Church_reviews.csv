Ryan Lim,4,"Not sure u if this is for Bukit Panjang Methodist Church Kindergarten. Both my kids attended nursery and kindergarten here. The school has shift back to their old school after renovation. It look spacious, cleaner and brighter. Overall a better environment for the kids. Except for the drop off area is too small for car to make a turn and lack of carpark compare to the old school. And also to climb up to 2nd floor for the school.

The school door is lock, so no stranger could just enter with someone from inside unlocking it.

The teacher are definitely good for their jobs. As I seen and follow them as a parent volunteer on how they teach and guide. The meals portion provided by the aunties are also adequate. Morning session starts from 830am to 1230pm. Which is great for the kids. They could have lunch after that and a noon nap.

There also field trips for them almost every term to farms, play area etc. Which is great for education. And they also provide additional lesson after school but at additional charges.

However, school fees been increasing every year. Hopefully they won't increase so much although I understand the need for the increment.

Overall, my kids grew well and most importantly enjoy their happy childhood here.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104241289288533138211/reviews
