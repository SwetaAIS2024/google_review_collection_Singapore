      "text": "I've been taking saxophone lessons at CYL Music Studio, and it has been an amazing experience! Special thanks to my teachers Joanna and EJ, whose deep knowledge and extensive experience truly stand out. They have a remarkable ability to break down complex concepts into simple, manageable steps, making it much easier to improve my playing. Their guidance has been instrumental in helping me achieve my goals.\n\nWhat sets CYL Music Studio apart is its commitment to fostering a vibrant musical community. Beyond individual lessons, the studio offers events, workshops, and additional classes that expose students to various aspects of music. This holistic approach has broadened my perspective and deepened my appreciation for music as a whole.\n\nI have been with CYL since its days at Burn Road, & now at Waterloo. I highly recommend CYL Music Studio to anyone looking to grow musically, whether you're a beginner or an experienced player. The supportive environment and talented teachers make it a fantastic place to learn and explore",
