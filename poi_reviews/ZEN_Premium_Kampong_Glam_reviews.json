The room was clean and quiet and the bed comfortable. I liked the free-to-use handy that comes with the room with unlimited data on it and free calls to several countries. Coffee, tea and drinking water are complimentary in the room and so was the first complete minibar.\nBreakfast was good (excellent coffee machine!), I recommend the local dishes as they were freshly cooked and very tasty.\nOverall a very pleasant stay.\nüòä",

Accommodations were well above average clean & quiet, updated and nicely appointed. Breakfast was included. My room had a mini-refrigerator & kettle, iron & board if needed, clean bathroom & great shower, with comfortable bed. breakfast included.  All staff members were extremely friendly, courteous, and helpful.  I will definitely stay here again for sure when I return to Singapore.",

I hope they would add some popular drinks in the minibar next time ‚ò∫Ô∏è\nIt's so close to the famous Kampong Gelam shopping street at the Sultan Mosque. We'll definitely be back to book at The Sultan - our new favorite accommodation in Singapore.",

Our Room 118, was at the ground floor, secluded from the noise of the street, and beside the fish pond, which we liked. Staff were very friendly and helpful, specially the guy at the One Bowl resto who served us breakfast and conversed with us in his limited Tagalog when he learned we were from the Philippines. We also appreciate that they allowed us to check in early.",
