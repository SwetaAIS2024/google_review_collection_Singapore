I am most impressed and relieved by how well my bettas had been looked after and how fit and strong, they have become... üòçü§©\n\nMy sincere gratitude and thanks to both Roy and Averyl! üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë® They were very proactive and were kind to update me regularly via video clip, about my bettas' well-being and physique.\n\nAveryl üòá is a true Guardian Angel! She is knowledgeable, calm, elegant and very experienced about bettas! Through my discussion with her, I learnt a lot about how to take better care of them. I feel comfortable and assured by her capable hands and sweet nature. Roy üë¶ on the other hand, is a people's person. Jovial, kind and charismatic and very approachable. It's easy to see why customers are loyal and business is smooth and steady...\n\nBoth my bettas look happy, healthy and content. I feel they are in good hands while I am away, and I am truly blessed! üôèüòáü•∞üëçüåàüêüüê†üåπ‚ù§Ô∏è",

Visiting Singapore as a Medaka enthusiast from the Netherlands, I was warmly welcomed by Roy and he shared his story about selling Medaka at Betta Bros SG. He gave great advice, but at the same time he also lets his customers enjoy the views of the fish while he works in other parts of the store. Roy has a broad collection of Betta fish and a unique range of Medaka fish for sale. Definitely recommending to pay a visit when you‚Äôre into fish and in Singapore!",

Quietly hidden away from public view from the main street but situated within a nice clean building.\n\nDid not take any photos of the shop but U can tell the tanks are well kept n maintained. All the Bettas are in excellent shape n health.\n\nMet Roy, the owner of the store and was seeking advise on choosing a Betta fish as a beginner for my 3yo to start her 1st pet/aquarium experience. Roy gave a very insightful introduction and we made the decision to go with a Dumbo betta.\n\n1 month in, our Betta is healthy n happily living in a small community tank with a couple of corys and snails.\n\nDefinitely a good place to start your Betta aquarium journey.",
