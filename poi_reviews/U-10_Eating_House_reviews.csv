elayna chin,5,"Nice hawker in Ubi, always packed with working people during lunch hours. Wide selection of food options from mix rice, chicken rice, vegetarian, fish soup noodles, pork knuckles, Vietnam cuisine and Malay food.

I always go for mix rice (1 veg + 1 meat @ $3.5), or Malay rice (1 veg + 1 meat @ $3-5) occasionally will settle with shrimp spring roll ($3) as a snack

Love that they have indoors and outdoors (facing carpark and main road) area so I can bask in the sun during chilly days.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105460859948112165491/reviews
Hui See Tan,5,"My ice tea xiu xiu dai is refreshing at merely $1.20 and super friendly operator.

The rather new stall’s Taiwanese five spice pork with a beautiful sunny-side-up using local farm egg plus a small portion of Sichuan style lightly mashed cucumber all at $5  - fantastically matched and delicious.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117292748772524201120/reviews
Alvin Terence,4,"A clean coffee shop with a good range of food that’s priced reasonably!

Had the roasted chicken rice (although I asked for steamed but it alright) which was value for money — $3. The chicken was a little salty but I’m cool, the rice was a little oil but I’m cool. BUT the peanut soup was the highlight and the saving grace to satisfy my afternoon hunger.

Will be back for affordable chicken rice and to try the other stalls.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112360951278222659719/reviews

财仔,4,"The coffee/tea w milk is still at $1, should be the cheapest in this area.

If u r there on Mon or Wed, do try the vegetarian Hokkien Mee w egg, probably the best vegetarian HKM. It's selling out fast, be there before 1pm if u want to catch it.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118164009612697578866/reviews
