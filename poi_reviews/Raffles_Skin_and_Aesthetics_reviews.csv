wei,1,"Horrible. Doctor Low is super unprofessional and unbothered, as if she doesn’t wanna be there. Basically telling me to self diagnose, saying that people who have the allergy already know it? No? I have had friends who have had allergies and not know it? I came here to ask for help for her to tell me what’s the problem, or what might potentially be the problem. But instead, she just kept telling me that testing is a waste of time, she will do blood test but most of the time blood test is fine. Then just asked me to take anti histamine for 6 weeks and SEE HOW…and her tone…wow totally rude and dismissive. Wasted $200, don’t bother coming here if you don’t know what ur problem is…apparently the doctor cannot determine ur problem either.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104508191751491395413/reviews

Brian13,2,"The care is professional. They are good in what they do but the time management is bad. It’s fine to wait as some cases take up more time. I get that. But having to wait when booking the 1st morning slot is just sad. As the same happened before! (booking the first slot and the doctor showing up late), I left. It’s just not respectful towards patients.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100278855322666007417/reviews
