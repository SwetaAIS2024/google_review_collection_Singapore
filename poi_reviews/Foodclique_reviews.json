Thank you uncle. ðŸ˜€ Fishball noodles stall is also not bad though haven't tried for very long. Environment is abit dirty but usually can't really find clean coffee shop anyway",

      "text": "Subject: Complaint Regarding Poor Customer Service at Tenderbest on January 2, 2025\n\nDear Tenderbest Management,\n\nI am writing to express my deep disappointment with the unacceptable behavior of your cashier at this location on January 2, 2025, at approximately 3:15 PM.\n\nMy elderly father, who is not as tech-savvy, encountered difficulties while attempting to make a payment using the QR code displayed at the cashier counter. Despite his best efforts, the payment repeatedly failed to register. Another customer, observing the situation, also tried to make a payment via QR code but experienced the same issue.\n\nWhen this other customer politely suggested that the QR code might be obstructed by oil or other residue, the cashier responded with an unacceptably raised voice. This display of unprofessionalism and a lack of empathy towards both my father and the other customer was deeply concerning.\n\nI believe that your cashiers should be trained to assist customers with technical difficulties, especially those who may be less familiar with technology. Furthermore, maintaining a professional and courteous demeanor, even when facing minor challenges, is essential for providing a positive customer experience.",
