Enivar,2,"I’m giving 2 stars instead of 1 because I generally like this FairPrice. It’s not overly crowded, and the choices are sufficient. However, my experience today was disappointing due to one staff member at the roasted section.

The $6.99 promotion for three flavors—Original, Sesame, and Black Pepper—was not clearly displayed above the chicken. Instead, the pricing was placed on another side of the brochure. To add to the confusion, there was also a BBQ chicken placed above the three-flavored chicken, making it unclear which one was actually $6.99.

When I asked the staff for clarification, he seemed frustrated when I didn’t understand the first time. If answering such questions is frustrating for him, did he ever provide feedback to FairPrice? Or does FairPrice choose to ignore these issues?

This is the first time I’ve encountered a rude staff member here, and it really spoiled my experience. I hope FairPrice improves its signage.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104218522311663481470/reviews

GuanHao .C,5,"Convenience, friendly staff, you could just buy all your daily needs at this supermarket.

Finding your daily necessities is a no problem! Foods are fresh, wide variety of foods ranging from canned to fresh fruits and foods! 💪🏻

The cashier recently has been upgraded to self checkout counter with cash and card payment too! Really a bonus! Save your hassle to queue and save your precious time! 👍🏻

Got trolley provided so if you are those who love to buy a lot of stuff, it's a bonus~ 😁

Oh yeah... If you stay nearby, its recommended to sign up for the NTUC member card and get rebates, and when I say rebates it's really a lot of rebates! Save and save! 💳

If you are bored alone at home, it can be considered a lepak corner for anyone! 😉💡",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103018143328053363767/reviews
Mun Chong,5,"Spacious and lots more offerings after renovation
Sushi-sashimi counter, roast duck char siew roast pork counter (pity the char siew packs were a bit too fatty, I asked at the counter for leaner cuts and the helpful reply was the char siew in the packs were the leanest on offer so I took it to mean he wasn't going to cut any for me and I helped myself to other stuff)
Yakitori, takoyaki packs
Smoked duck, black pepper chicken, honey roasted chicken rice packs
HK dim sum counter with solid char siew bolo buns
Lots more self checkout kiosks
Lots more vertical glass fridge displays
Very much enhanced shopping experience
