NancyRD H,5,"Very powerful message,  not sugar coated straight from Word of God,  people may not like cause it is not going according them, going it points where they are wrong,  so they can correct them.
If you want to be in heaven hear it and follow try to change yourself. Read your Bible , understand it, that says same thing.
Just not gone according to you don't blame.
True Word of God,  it shows you what you are and wants to change you inside out,  same like Him loving caring not blaming or hating
