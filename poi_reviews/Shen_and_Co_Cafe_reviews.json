Cappuccino is served in a thick wall cup keeps it warm.\n\nWhat's to improve?\nSome chairs with torn seats should be replaced or have a seat padding.\n\nVisit again?\nYes,.at non peak hours.",

When asked, staff was very rude and pointed to their sign at the cashier that they are having a break.  Perhaps could improve in your staff rostering so that you don't make your customers come all the way to the cafe and having to wait. I will never come again. There are better cafes around",
