Open up your eyes and see the world in a different light . You will enjoy. Not only the theater, snow city, kidstop, science center is just next to the theater. Moreover there is a Indian restaurant Phoenix there too for meals. The annual pass is very worth too. The kids will like it. There is also rock climbing activity too. There‚Äôs car parks readily available too.",
