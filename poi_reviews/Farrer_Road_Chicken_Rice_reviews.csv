Josh,4,"Run by an elderly couple, this stall offers roasted and white chicken rice options. Cash only establishment.

Had the white chicken rice (白斩鸡饭) for 4 bucks. While the chicken seems to be poached well, perhaps the rice needed more flavour. They do give a bit of taogei with the rice. Amount of rice can be adjusted without surcharge, so from a price point perspective this was pretty good.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109525553634627607435/reviews
Shaolin Leong,3,"Run by a couple , by 1:30pm everything will be sold out daily ! I prefer their boiled chicken but it seems that their roast chicken is more popular as the foreigners in this area like it.So they prepare lesser of the ""white"" chicken.
Chilli & soup is ok too ! Rice texture needs improvement ,but they don't charge for extra rice so don't KP lah !
Try it ! Singapore National dish ! Yummy! Don't like the usage of plastic fork and spoon when eating there .

Had chicken drumstick rice with chicken liver ($5.50) for breakfast, was quite good. Chilli was on the watery side & can be spicier.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107525471936198024/reviews
Shocho Shocho,5,"Excellent service is what this stall separates from ordinary ones. Chicken is juicy and tasty. Rice is firm and flavorful.
Chili sauce is one of the best in Singapore. Love it so much.

Chong Peng How,4,Chicken is good. The rice doesn’t have that oiliness of authentic chicken rice. The chilli also does have much punch.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117887121518253199345/reviews
