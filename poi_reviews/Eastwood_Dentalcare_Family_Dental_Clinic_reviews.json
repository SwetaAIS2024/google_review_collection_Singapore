She checked in on me throughout the procedure, which made me feel really cared for. Everything healed up great and I couldnâ€™t have asked for a better experience. Iâ€™d definitely go back to her. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "A visit to see dentist Dr Ang & A nightmare for my treatment â€¦.\nAs it was first time seeing her & her explanation to me was to  remove my crown molar to save my tooth     .\nCost total cost was $4k\nShe charge me $910 for the first job ..\nShe was a sole practitioner or an individual that works there\nIt took an hour for the drilling Iâ€™m able to withstand it without  her nurse\nto help me .during the drilling .\nNormally it alway a nurse to assist a dentist ..\nShe written a referral letter to recommend me to see an Endodontist\nAfter the treatment I felt pain & sensitivity  and I could not eat & wen she  call me  to check on my condition which I refused to see her again ..\nThe recomended Endodonist  was away for holiday @ I cannot wait for too long .  I have no choice but to see another  top notch Endodontist .\nThe Endodontist examined my molar tooth & found out there is a tiny hole .\nIt is no longer treatable and the tooth cannot be saved & will need to extracted .\nDr.Ang was so confident that the tooth can be save  and to come back to her for fixing of molar crown after my root canal treatment ..\nNow that I can recalled . Dr Ang did check on me prior to if I visited to see the Endodontist\nNow I understand , her drill broke abit of my molar tooth , due to her negligence and a tiny hair line crack  at the back of my molar .\nNot only she charge me a bomb for her service of 1 hr drilling    to remove crown molar tooth but left me a a big hole in my pocket !!!",

Minimal discomfort and she checks on you regularly if youâ€™re feeling ok. Made me feel comfortable and I was happy. Will surely visit again for routine dental check-up whenever Iâ€™m back in Sg",

I was given three shots of LA for my filling cause the pain was too unbearable.\n\nAlso the dentist gave me grey fillings which I have not seen in a long time. (Even years ago when I did my fillings, i had the white ones done) Later, i found out from other dentists that it actually costs less to do the grey ones than the white.\n\nMy experience here wasnâ€™t the cheapest and wasnâ€™t the most comfortable. Although I must say the receptionist was really polite and friendly. :)",
