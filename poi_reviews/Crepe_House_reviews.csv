Theresa H,5,"FOOD 5/5

Got this after our early dinner.  I chose the Banana Choco flavor which was imo the best combination. Not all parts were crispy, but still overall crispy. The bananas were super soft and sweet. The choco was very nice too, tho 제 남자친구 gets worried when I have chocolate since I am somewhat allergic to them :D

SERVICE 5/5
Staff was super friendly!

Would love to try other flavors. I probably will not choose savoury crepes tho, cos I really like sweet things.

This is the only location in Singapore. They do not open on Sundays.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103077620103588076248/reviews
Bow K. Techataveekijkul,5,"Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to find a wide variety of Thai desserts, with the main attraction being crepes with numerous filling options. They also offered Khanom Krok, Khanom Bueng, Khanom Quail Egg, Green Waffle Dessert, and various beverage options. We ordered Khanom Krok, Khanom Bueng, and pink milk. The Khanom Bueng was especially delicious when eaten hot and crispy. However, it’s best not to eat it before the Khanom Krok, as it’s sweeter and could make the Khanom Krok taste less sweet. The Khanom Krok received an 8/10 rating, but lacked crispiness at the edges, possibly due to being made in a takoyaki pan. As for the pink milk, we made sure to inquire if they used Bandung or not before ordering, and they assured us they used Thai Hale’s Blue Boy, which made me order it right away!

Overall, it was a great experience. The shop is relatively new, and the restaurant mentioned they are considering adding new menu items such as toast for breakfast. We’ve already requested for Khanom Tokyo already, but only time will tell if they follow through with the idea.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111615442808341027410/reviews
Kevin KW,4,"Came on the first week of opening so I think process is still getting warmed up. Came at 3-4pm and they ran out of banana so we got strawberry cream crepe
Friend came back another time and they had the Nutella banana crepe at lunchtime which was pretty good but it’s heavy so better for 2 ppl to share I think
Nonetheless not bad overall . Tho bear in mind it does take some time for them to make.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113538038005281311118/reviews
