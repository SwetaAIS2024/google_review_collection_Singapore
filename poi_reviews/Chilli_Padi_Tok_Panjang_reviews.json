      "text": "Probably won’t come back again. Pricey buffet of 28+++ don’t have a strong nyongya flavor. Laksa and mee siam is watery. Only beef redang is ok. The pastries can be improved, so far the coconut green long one is nice. Because there isn’t much crowd, food turnover is a problem. Some fried chicken left on the table become rough and cold, hard to eat so u must wait for the next batch when they top up for a better chicken option. Coffee is fine, tea is ok too. Oh ya if u are not having buffet with your friends, you have to sit on another table. No trust haha. They only give you one complementary bowl of big prawn and fried fish cubes. Probably to cut cost. Overall experience feels like eating in a nygonya cafe with a lot of decorations and music but after awhile, the variety of food feels about there. Btw they start chasing people away at 2.30pm!",

Worst there isn’t a single soul, I am the only table eating there at 1 plus. They start chasing you away at 2.30 pm . Not sure why business is so much worst from the past, this will be my last time visiting",

      "text": "The experience here was amazing overall. The Nonya set up was very cute and served a good vibe. The restaurant was buffet style, allowing f us to eat as much as we wanted. The food there was quite good, except for the laksa, which was not spicy enough (but it tastes so much better with the chilli added). The mee siam and kuehs were amazing, with the mee siam flavourful and spicy, and kuehs sweet and had a great texture. The vegetables tasted very good, not too salty and well cooked. I quite enjoyed the beancurd and aloe jelly too (those were sides placed with fruit). Fish and prawns cooked are refillable. There is coffee and tea there too. The free ice cream added to the experience.\n\nThis place is a great place to go with friends and family to go for celebrations or just for little gatherings.",

The experience is further delighted with kuehs and attentive staff. Ambience wise, I would be better appealed if it could offer a more cosy and Peranakan-themed environment.",
