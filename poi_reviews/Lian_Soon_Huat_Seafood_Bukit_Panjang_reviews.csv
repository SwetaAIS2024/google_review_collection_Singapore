linnie loo,5,"Great Value & Tasty Food!
I always enjoy coming to this Chinese food stall! The food is delicious and very affordable. The staff are friendly and helpful, making the experience even better. I also appreciate that they value their customers—during Chinese New Year, they even gave out free red packets as a nice festive touch. Highly recommended, and I’ll definitely be back!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105249333016667879005/reviews
Jolty,5,"Came here every day to grab dinner and the food is consistently good. Very nice local zhi char and very good portion as well. The food options are pretty wide and they always come piping hot and quick.

The location is very convenient, just 3 mins walk from Pending LRT. The aunties at the ordering side are very versatile to accommodate my requests for food options that aren’t on the menu, and payment method as I’m not used to carrying cash around.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118016600718871905475/reviews
ah siao,3,"Decent coffee shop setting. Quite clean and crowded on a Sunday evening.

White rice is okay, nicely cooked.
Salted egg pork is nice, slightly salty and meat is tender.
Minced meat tofu - tofu skin is a little thick, tofu itself is not silky.
Curry fish head is a no go - too much curry powder, not worth your calories. Fish is okay.
Kang Kong- most of it is the stalks, very little leaf. Won’t order again.
Cereal prawn- cereal could have been more spicy.
Prawn paste chicken taste just like normal fried chicken wings you can get from any fried chicken stalls.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117122252684175285400/reviews

c tzehow,4,"Walked past many times, and finally dined here. The fish head steamboat and prawn paste chicken is delicious.  The hot plate tofu and nam yu pork is acceptable.  Price is reasonable,  and the staff is friendly and patient.  Many tables and food came fast.
