      "text": "Dr Sim is a very experienced Dr who is technically strong. He is one of the two most senior surgeons in Urology Paediatric Surgery (the other one is Dr Cheah). My kid had a prior operation with KK which was a failure, so I went to Dr Sim for repair. The suture was neatly done and he kept the use of medication to the bare minimum (only antibiotics was used) but everything worked out fine. I appreciate the good judgements he made along the recovery phase, for that I consider him a very good doctor.",

      "text": "In my opinion this Doctor is not very skilled. He carried out operation for undescended testicle on my baby however even after operation I could see only one testicle downside. Upon asking him he said this is what he can do with it. He is not open to talk. Although charged thousands of dollars for operation we had to seek another surgeon for second opinion. I will never recommend this kind of doctor hence forth.",

Poor bedside manners from the doctor. Please refer to previous reviews before making a decision to see this doctor. Disappointing visit.",
