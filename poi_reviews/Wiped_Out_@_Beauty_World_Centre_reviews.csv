Hax Mays,4,"Nice hawker stall selling beers on tap. Price was affordable too. Got the Guinness first and to be frank, it wasnâ€™t good. Had other Guinness on tap before but this place is just not good. Ordered the Kirin next and this was much better.  Overall itâ€™s a good place to wind down and chill as the setting isnâ€™t in a bar. You can also order food from them or from the other stalls in the hawker centre.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115776232152336822036/reviews
Simon Ng,5,"Located on the top floor of Beauty World, it's a nice place for a quiet little drink. Erdinger on the tap is $10 whole night. Plenty of food choices from the food center.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117600983666386680386/reviews
K. Marchan,5,"We love this place, good service, good beer, they didnâ€™t have Blue moon last time but we had Kirin.
Affordable prices even after happy hour.
Smart people, they let you bring food from other stalls to their terrace but you keep buying drinks from them.
We hope they serve Blue moon on tap someday

Canâ€™t wait to visit again",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101033212447441266154/reviews
