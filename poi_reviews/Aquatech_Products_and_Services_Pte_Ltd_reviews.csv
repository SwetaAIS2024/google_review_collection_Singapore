James Allworth,1,"This company is *terrible*. Do not use them. In the three months that they were contracted to maintain the pool weekly, they failed to show up five times.

And when they did bother; their people did shoddy workmanship. For example: putting a pool railing back on that stuck out into the pool (see second photo). They didn’t clean the filter until I insisted, and that was disgusting (third photo).  More than that though, we switched companies and the new company tested the water — two weeks after Aquatech’s last visit, the pool was showing both acidic and high levels of chlorine. They had just dumped chlorine in.

You do not want to use them.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109762420782407605052/reviews
