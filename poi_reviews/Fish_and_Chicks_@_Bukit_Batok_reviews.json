      "text": "Terrible experience after a grab food order. Delivery was ok.\nAll the 4 food items we bought tasted so salty yet with no flavour. All the pastas, grilled chicken and lamb chops were so darn salty, impossible to eat. The fish from fish and chips was tasteless. Only the fries are edible. My 1st and my last order from this place! Its such a waste of money and a great disappoinment!\nI rated no star and please do not waste customers's money for food cooked and made of this quality.\nNot recommended for human consumption!",

Agio olio + fried fish was just nice - not too spicy, good amount of pasta and fish! Truffle carbonara + chicken was good too - was creamy but a lil dry (could be due to the fact that it was delivered and not dining in there). Will patronise this stall again\n\nHowever i find price a tad steep for a coffeeshop, but thought it was alright if i were to compare it with pastamania or sorts",
