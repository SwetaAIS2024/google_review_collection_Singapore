Their soft boiled eggs are perfectly done where the white is runny white and the yolk is runny and creamy.\n\nDishes are average but good portion.\n\nThe staff is quick to clear the finished plates so that the table is uncluttered. Appreciate this gesture.\n\nOverall enjoyable meal. ðŸ˜Š",

Egg plant in claypot is a must-try. We ordered the Small size but it was good for two people. The egg tart was also a hit with its creamy filling that doesnâ€™t feel like gelatin.\n\nThere were lots of tables inside and outside the restaurant. Queue is always long but fast-moving because food is served within 5-10mins after ordering. Just be prepared with cash since they donâ€™t accept card payment.",
