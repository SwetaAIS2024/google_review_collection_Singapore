She said must pay $0.20 for 2 chilli. I tell her. Even KFC will give because it make sense. How are you going to feast with many piece of chicken with ONLY 6 chilli sachets. Think about it. when i walk away she said out loud \"Complain Ah, Complain Ah\". So i am doing it now upon her request.",

Eventually I got it after 10 minutes. Grab it and when home. Turns out, half spring chicken is missing......I think the food packer got confused by the word \"pasta only\". Something needs to be done to the menu.",

(waited almost up to an hr today for chicken tortilla and fries lol.)",

It was just a simple request/question. No need to be rude lol.",
