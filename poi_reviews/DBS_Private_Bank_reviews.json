She made not only one, but several mistakes on my investment inquiries. The issue has not been resolved until now (> 1 month) and I have been calling to DBS customer support for more than 10 times. The response from the team at the branch was really slow. It was their mistakes but they have no ownership or responsibility in solving it.\n\nThe worst bank I have ever dealt with.",

      "text": "Supposedly the best bank in Singapore but the worst customer service. Tried to open a bank account online. Uploaded passport according to instructions. Took a week to respond that she needed to upload M'sian NRIC, not passport. She did so. One week later, DBS said need to upload passport not NRIC. Wrote to DBS to ask which to upload - passport or NRIC. After another week, customer service response - upload both documents, even though website only allows to upload one document. DBS staff poorly trained and slow to respond. They don't even know what is required to open a bank account! Horribly incompetent. Wasted 3 weeks and wasn't able to open an account. Will certainly not recommend DBS Bank to anyone going to Singapore. Went to a different bank. Opened an account within an hour.",
