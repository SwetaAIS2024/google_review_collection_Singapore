Zhi Dong Huang,5,All time favourite Fish and Chip. I have been eating this Fish and Chip for over 20 years. Their portion are huge. Do have patience if there‚Äôs crowd. Its worth the wait. üëç,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105767520730789478589/reviews
Chinese Moon,5,"When Swensons first opened in Changi Airport in the early eighties, I got a chance to eat the best fish and chips.  Lo and behold, one day during the pandemic, I chanced upon it again, right in my neighbourhood.  It‚Äôs the breaded type, crispy on the outside and soft in the inside.  Generous portion with tartar sauce, coleslaw, baked beans and French fries.

These days, whenever we feel like having a hefty meal, I will pop by and pack home fish and chips, chicken cutlet or chicken chop and finally tried the steak.  Everything priced affordably.  I see young parents bringing their kids for chicken wing and French fries treat mid afternoon.  Reminded me of when fish and chips was a treat for passing exams or doing well.  This place is really comfort food.  Service is extremely polite, fast and friendly.  Pack home also no extra charge.  Highly recommended!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106735384857518209558/reviews
Tanko Jiak,3,Randomly choose a western food place in the area. Never expect a decent meal from them. Steak was well cooked really fast in the cooking to table timing. Was not pack due to the outlook. But i quite a decent nostalgic western food place to choose and very reasonable price range. Quite impress for the amount i paid. Good job üëè,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101417658669432380086/reviews
Ts IV,1,"Thursday 12+pm lunch 0 custormers, yet don't even sell chicken wing.
Why is the shop even open? Then what do you sell? Close shop for good better.

Really miss the good old days ran by the original owners, nice old couple. These youngsters really destroying their legacy and business.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105049237173156407575/reviews
Alfred,1,"The Google opening hours says it close at 9:30pm, but for the past 20 times when I tried to visit at 8:30pm in the past 1 year, they 100% of the time always say closed and sold out, by 8:15pm or 8:30pm, I stays nearby‚Ä¶ (I emphasise strongly on the words 100% of the time)

Please amend your opening hours to until 8:30pm if you intend to serve until then, instead of posting FAKE opening hours.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102360934644525381651/reviews
