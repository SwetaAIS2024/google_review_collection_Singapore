M V C,3,The food is delicious. However I find it overpriced for what I have ordered. I would only go here when I am desperate for good Nasi padang at the area around Bukit Timah Plaza. I paid $9.80 for my takeaway.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112674708115043620553/reviews
Richard Lim,1,Food is average only. It is definitely overpriced. Beef rendang taste and chilli sambal on the sweet side. I get better nasi Padang with that kind of price. Will not patronise this stall again.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105966850788159518966/reviews
Mihwa Lee,4,"One of my favourite malay rice stall. Limited dishes, but everything I've tried is very good. Highly recommend the beef rendang, chicken curry and black ink squid (if available).
Limited seats unfortunately.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110254254438157902425/reviews
Chee wee Loo,4,"It's more like a nasi padang place, very modest looking venue but at $6.50 for a meal there are probably better options at the bukit timah market across the road.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115106752903650889875/reviews
Matthew John,5,"If you want nasi Padang around the area, this is the place to go. The variety of choices is great and is not too pricey.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100014579622739871118/reviews
