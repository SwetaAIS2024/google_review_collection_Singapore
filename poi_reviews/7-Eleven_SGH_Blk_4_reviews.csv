Khin Kyawt kyawt naing,1,"Hi , I m working in SGH block 7. Today 24.9.24 was a heavy rainy day on my way to work. My socks are wet so wanted to grab a pair of socks at 7 11 SGH block 4. I m wearing company uniform I was telling the sales that I m working here yet they asked me to show staff card. I just came from outside and rush to go to work. They do not seem like trust me then said that must show staff card then can get discount.

My question is do we really need to show physical card then can get staff discount at 7 11 at SGH block 4?",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116283336309000977115/reviews

Farid Zainal,1,"The 7-11 staff has a poor communication skill. I'm surprised by how she deliver her question to me.

She asked in an uncomfortable tone, ""Staff?""
Just that one word.

I replied nicely, incorporating a bit of joke, I said, ""kind of, and explain that I'm not always here, but I do send patients by ambulance here as I am a paramedic.""

She then said in a very rude tone and manner, ""so you want staff discount or not eh? Why you make me confuse? ""

I was like RIP English. Dalam hati, eh eh minah ni...aku tengah bad mood gila babs ni. Takpe takpe, niari hari kau.

Let my review appear as a rant. I just wanna close today and leave my anger here. I shall not shame her by mentioning her name. But hey, it happened today, like approx 2050hrs.

My message to her, hidup jangan sombong sangat, kita sesama manusia. Orang berbual baik dengan kau, kau takmu step macam aku Ade hutang dengan kau. Ingat Tuhan woi. Aku kalau nak complain boleh, but aku Ade fikiran. Lol, I wonder what's her childhood trauma?

Sgh 7-11, control and educate your staff so she can improve. It's a shame.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108413519309472375402/reviews
