Glad I made the appointment in the wee hour in the afternoon and thus it wasn't crowded at all.\n\nOne thing I really appreciate is that the doc (Dr. Taranjit) took a time to check my vaccination status and concerns, and discussed it with me. He was not only knowledgeable but also caring.\n\nIf there is one thing that could've been improved, I wish the HCWs wear a mask (even KN95 would do) since the space may not be well ventilated.",

Doctors do have the 'power' to make their patient feel better or feel worse. For my first experience in Healthveer, it is pleasant and I appreciate it!\n\nI am glad to found him on a Wednesday as my family doctor's clinic is closed on every Wednesdays.\n\nThe two ladies at the counter are efficient and courteous too. Both of them make a great first impression of the clinic.\n\n23 April 2025",

Its very unlikely to get such good service at other clinics.\nDr.Taranjit, made the whole section very comfortable. He listened to my medical issues which I highlighted and diagnose proper medication. He gave good explanation on the side effects of my previous medication which I was currently going through. Dr.Taranjit, didn't rush on the consultation. Much appreciated for good service. Well recommend clinic.",

      "text": "Had consulted 2 doctors and both increased my anxiety and decided to seek advice from Doctor Singh as I have read many encouraging and wonderful feedback about his professionalism and I needed to know what was causing my discomfort. Am really grateful to Dr Singh for his patience,attentiveness and explaining to me in details what was causing the symptoms I have been experiencing. This greatly reduced my anxiety. I felt more reassured after seeing him and he gave me ample time to explain my symptoms and the visit was really nice and I came out feeling happier and more positive after hearing his advices. When we went in he was very friendly and his welcoming presence put us at ease immediately and I know I can share without feeling hurried to end the visit. Thank you Dr Singh for your kindness and gentle composure and your smile meant a lot to patients who are worried and unwell. Thank you for making time to open your clinic on a Sunday. Your mandarin is also excellent and you are a great blessing to the elderly as they can communicate with you without any barrier.\nAlso wanted to thank the lovely lady Maya -clinic staff. She was really polite and gentle and definitely not fierce and uninterested as many clinic assistants we encountered.  Thanks Maya for the great effort to answer my enquires and helping to sort out the insurance issue.\n\nThank you Dr Singh. You are a wonderful doctor.",
