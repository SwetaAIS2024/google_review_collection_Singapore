Judy Bromley,5,"Fun family feel at this children’s rugby club.  Great modern facilities and even has an area with fans for parents and supporters to watch the players train and play. Despite being in the north of Singapore, it’s pretty easily accessible and only 15-20 minutes drive from Bukit Timah.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111413037876213166595/reviews

The ethos of playing fair and supporting your mates is one that really serves my children, and the wonderful volunteers + team give a strong sense of family.
