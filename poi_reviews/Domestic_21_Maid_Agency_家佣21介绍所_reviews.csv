Kaimin Khaw,5,"We were served by Emily at Domestic 21. She was quick, prompt, and accurate. Also appreciated her honesty, and her willingness to remain open all 7 days of the week. Fees are very competitive, transparent, and fair to the employer.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100203187711560181213/reviews
PL9009 L,5,"Domestic 21 Maid Agency is the best and honest Agency I have encountered so far. I heard of many horrible and irresponsible agencies but it's definitely not Domestic 21.

I have been using their services since my first born with the helper stayed with me for 8 years and subsequently many other helpers engaged through Domestic 21. My first born is 23 now!!

Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the Agency helped me with the return of my last helper in August 2022 and I  have since engaged a new helper, of course through Domestic 21 too! As informed by Domestic 21 beforehand, the helper is very new and may not have much experience but I am willing to give it a go with plan to teach and train the new helper. She is very smart and can understand our instructions very well.  I am so impressed with the high caliber of the helper and grateful to the Agency for such a good recommendation.

Thank you Domestic 21! Thank you Emelie! You are such a gem too!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116263939896922274583/reviews
