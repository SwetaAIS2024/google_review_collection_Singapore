Fred ‚ÄúFred w‚Äù woodhouse,5,"The staff were very fast and kind. The food started coming almost instantly after we ordered don‚Äôt know if it would be the same on the weekend. The food tasted delicious.
The food was fresh and fast but not brilliant. The restaurant is a good and reliable option for a meal and reasonably good value for Marina Bay Sans.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112142491582349625621/reviews
Benjamin Chua,5,Went on a Monday evening and the atmosphere was nice and cosy‚Ä¶ not crowded at all. The staff service was very good in suggesting the dish options. Food was a definite hit!

Chermaine Sim,5,"I had a wonderful dining experience here! The round tables are perfect for family gatherings, and I noticed they also offer private rooms for a more intimate setting. The food quality is consistently great, just like other Canton outlets. Love the roasted meat. The staff were friendly and attentive, making the overall experience even better. Highly recommend! üëçüèº",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117019491120351048850/reviews
Posh Pearl,4,"Service was prompt and polite, atmosphere bustling and lively.
Food wise, the pork collar in claypot was the star. The bouncy but tender texture of the pork was delicious and the dish was infused with wok hei.
The fish maw soup was hearty. The stir fried carrot cake was well done.
The steamed pork ribs was hard and had more
Fats than meat.
The batter of the deep fried brinjal turned soggy too quickly.
But it is still worth a revisit to try more dishes.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106728704755913363642/reviews
