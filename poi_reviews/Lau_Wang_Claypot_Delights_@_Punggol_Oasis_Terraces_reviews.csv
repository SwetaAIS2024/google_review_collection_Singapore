Michelle Koh,3,"Food standard had drop a little, the curry yongtaufoo totally not nice. Regret ordering that, should stick with the usual. Service is good, food was serve fast and hot. Entire area aircon leakage + aircon not cold. Not sure if this is mall issue or the shop issue. Eating claypot is already very hot, plus the hot environment, sweats quite a lot.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113005302051880474302/reviews
Shin Hwee Teo,5,"Lunch at Lau Wang Claypot Delights @ Punggol Oasis Terraces

Dropped by Lau Wang Claypot Delights for lunch and had a satisfying meal packed with rich, local flavors. The standout dish was the Sambal Seafood—spicy, aromatic, and generously portioned. We also enjoyed the Eggplant with Minced Meat, which was savoury and comforting, perfect with a bowl of warm white rice.

Another highlight was the Homemade Ngoh Hiang (2pcs)—crispy on the outside and juicy inside. The Pig Organs dish was bold and flavourful, though definitely for more adventurous eaters. For vegetables, we had the Nyonya Chap Chye, a classic braised dish that was both hearty and nostalgic.

To accompany our meal, we tried the Luo Han Guo and Lemongrass drinks, both served hot and refreshing, a nice touch to balance out the heavier claypot dishes.

Prices were reasonable, totaling $60.70 for a feast for several people. The service was efficient, and the food came out promptly. A great place for casual dining if you're craving traditional Singaporean claypot fare with a modern twist.

Where we sat, the aircondition was weak and we perspired. Too warm. However,  definitely return to try their other claypot specialties!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113234873140325754157/reviews
Eugene Fu,5,"Friendly staff and fast service.

Compared to their main branch, this outlet is air-conditioned so the comfort level is definitely better.

We frequent this place and the most popular dish is their sesame chicken.

We would normally order their egg plant claypot and also their fish in herbal soup.

No on site brewed coffee or tea.

Highly recommend visiting for good local comfort food.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103596486963652990522/reviews
