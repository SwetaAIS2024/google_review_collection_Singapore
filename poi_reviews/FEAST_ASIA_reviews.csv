Jason Ong,4,"One of the better buffet lunch and dinner is served in this restaurant, located within the Roxy Mercure Hotel at Parkway Parade.
The two times I visited were for lunch. The spread is great, and the food is fresh. My personal favourites include the Satay, Laksa, Roast Beef, Prawns, Steamed Fish and especially the Durian Pengat.
The staff were efficient and friendly, and definitely made dining here a pleasant experience.
It's very good value for money if you're an Accor member. Getting here is easy as the Marine Parade MRT literally stops outside the hotel.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101337983538091125134/reviews

wendy Lim,4,"Unparalleled service provided by Mr Eddy and Ms Kelly . Both very extremely attentive and helpful to diners and especially to elderly .
I was having dinner at the restaurant with my father and he wanted a ginger tea and Ms Kelly went all out to get the tea for my father . Even though she came back with ginger green tea, it was the effort that impressed me .
Thank you for the hospitality extended to me and my father .",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112986863309523227352/reviews
