Occasionally you can even witness unique species or breed of birds resting on the trees. Take a look below and here‚Äôs what I captured on the trunk of this ages long tree. Breezy afternoon with Yellow-tailed Oriole resting peacefully and allowing me to appreciate its beauty. Take a stroll when you happened to pass by this area and be awed by the serenity of this park. Live once, lively peacefully & beautifully!",
