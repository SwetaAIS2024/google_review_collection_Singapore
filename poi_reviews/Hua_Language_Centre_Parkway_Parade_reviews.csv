Teo Shaw Hoon,5,"My grandson has been attending the Hua language playgroup for about 2 months now. He loves the weekly sessions and has been asking to attend ‘Chinese Class’ at home!

As it’s a playgroup, an adult can accompany the child. I found the lessons as well as the teachers highly engaging and fun! My grandson started off a little shy of participation but over a short span of time, is now fully independent and actively participating in the learning activities such as the handicraft, role play and moving to the beats of songs and music played. He is also articulating the Chinese words after the teachers as there is often lots of encouragement and reinforcement within the class.

I am very impressed with how attentive the teachers are to each child’s learning needs. They are also very pleasant and caring! Thank you Bi Laoshi and Meng Laoshi!!

Thank you Hua for your quality lessons, professional teachers and reception staff (Joyce and Weng Khong) and most importantly for making learning a new language fun, and natural for my little gran!

emma chiau,1,"My daughter attended the holiday program last week (early June).
The admin was great and very helpful. However im not sure the teacher is fit to teach Chinese, or any subject. The schools assured me my daughter would have some guidance but the teacher did not pay any individual attention to the students and apparently also shamed a child who seemed to be on the spectrum several times during the holiday camp. This child cried during class and had to exit the class at one point according to my daughter. The teacher also got the whole class to rate every student. While this is a sensitive activity, I can see how this would work in a constructive environment that can help students build confidence under the guidance of a helpful and inspiring teacher. This was clearly not the case here as it appeared to be a shaming exercise more than anything else. My daughter being in an MOE school is very seasoned with various enrichment and holiday classes but she absolutely hated attending the holiday camp with this teacher. Needless to say I will not be sending her to this school in the future.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106890202845957231225/reviews
