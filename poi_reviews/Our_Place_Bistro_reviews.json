Nestled within the condo complex, it offers delicious food, warm hospitality every single day with only one day off a week, and a constant presence that makes it a go-to spot whenever you don’t feel like cooking at home. The name “Our Place” couldn’t be more fitting—it’s where friends can gather in shorts and slippers, enjoy a cold draft beer in total comfort, and feel completely at home. It’s simply a restaurant you can’t help but love.",

Sometimes, the food can be a bit too salty. If you want a dish with less salt, you have to tell the waiter to ask the chef to put less salt in your food.",

Roti prata was meh... Straight out of a frozen packet and was oily though the curry had quite a bit of kick to it.\n\nLunch and dinner options were better with a mix of local zhi char dishes and western food offered from their menu.",

The staff are friendly and helpful.\n\nJust need a change in menu and chefs before they close down!",
