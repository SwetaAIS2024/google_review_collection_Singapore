We then decided to sign up with them after seeing how much he enjoyed the varied class activities together with other children. Special thanks to Tr Stacy and Sam for being ever so so patient and inclusive towards my child. Our child has been asking to go for gym classes, and this is testiment of your good work!",

Price is slightly higher but given that hosting families can rest and socialize, it is still worth it. * Kudos to the team to help put up the decoration!",
