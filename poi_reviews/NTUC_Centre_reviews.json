      "text": "Searching for walking directions on Google to reach NTUC centre @ 1, Marina Boulevard from the nearest MRT station, Raffles or Downtown DTL17 Station seems to be showing only by walking on the road and no option was shown as using the subway  walkways connecting Malls and offices. The best way is to go to RAFFLES STATION, walk towards EXIT J....than when nearing exit J on your right the mall connect underground walkways will continue towards 1 Marina Boulevard. Just remember one can take the wrong turn when the walkways split..so keep watch on the signage on the walls etc..always look for 1 Marina Boulevard (noticed no signage showing NTUC)...one point to note is you may walk pass a lot of restaurants, cafes..a 7-11 store ...the automated SING POST CENTRE...and when you reach the destination, you are in the basement of the NTUC centre, near a Cafe and a NTUC dental centre.... THERE ARE SOME STEPS TO CLIMB to get to this level..or walk down a little further and get to the other end of the corridor where there is a slope..to walk up...The whole walk takes about 10 mins from the Raffles Station..a few stairs. (I WONDER HOW A WHEEL CHAIR BOUND PERSON CAN GET THERE??!!...).\nFrom the basement of 1 Marina Boulevard,\nYou have to use the escalators to go up to the ground level and use the glass doors, near the escalators, to \"exit\" the building. ( The glass-walled elevators, are connected to the building via canti-lever bridges at various levels. The elevators will take you to the 7th or 8th levels to the auditorium and conference meeting rooms.",
