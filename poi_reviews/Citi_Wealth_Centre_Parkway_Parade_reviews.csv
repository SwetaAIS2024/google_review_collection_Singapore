Y Teo,1,"I have given Citibank a very bad review in the past because of the non-existent customer service during covid-19 and after that.

I have closed my account except citi visa card.  Recently, we are all force to convert to e-statement, i.e., every so often they will reset to e-statement and customers have to waste time resetting  it back. Looks like citi is increasingly anti-business. Since citi has sold the retail business, you might as well close you credit card business. There is no short of credit card alternatives in Singapore.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117861354842549084047/reviews
