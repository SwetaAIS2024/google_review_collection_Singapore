Shreyan,5,"Very good place, Mcds Big Mac Shrine was awesome. Host allowed me to consume 15,000 calories in one sitting, but the next second, I got aggressively mauled by a bear-looking fellow who resided in the tennis courts, bro chased me for so long that by running from him, I burnt all the calories I ate. Amazing experience!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100363926721696539912/reviews
sam,1,"Horrible place.
Would give it 0 stars if I could. This isn't exactly what I imagined. Its a normal living flat with a room entirely dedicated to a shrine for the McDonalds Big Mac. When I inquired on why a whole room was in usage, they informed me that their son was too big to fit in the flat and he resided in the tennis courts. I wasn't able to achieve my desirable goal. I went to confront the owner in the tennis court. I met him, and started hurling words to him. He didnt even bat an eye or flinch. He released his gas on me. It was so stinky the entire tennis court evacuated. I had to run because I felt the ground shaking. This was a life threatening experience. Do not come here and especially DO NOT confront the big man in the tennis courts if you want to come alive.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105077508414049813572/reviews
