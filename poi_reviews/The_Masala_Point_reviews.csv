I just want to comment again,indeed a hidden gem. Veg south indian meals and boneless chicken and mutton is awesome. Honestly you don't need more that for good lunch.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115290970440195269125/reviews
zzubsg,1,"Overpriced Indian food , charge 50cents for curry and look at the sad looking so called omelette that cost $2.80, recommend to only eat their prata.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113215489564247084345/reviews
Sudarsan Sreekanth,5,"I thought of trying chicken Biryani, and they had seeraga samaba biryani as today's special, however, the rice was little undercooked otherwise all good. Personally I really liked the taste, flavour and quality. Also, tried chicken fry, which is also very good. Menu is limited, because of their new setup, hope they come up many items soon.

Good service and will look to visit again.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116266088528956497886/reviews
Jacqueline,5,"Although their menu is limited, this stall met our expectations as someone who prefers crispy prata over chewy ones. Not only were the pratas crispy, but they were also more aromatic than the ones in the neighbourhood. For an extra $1, you can get their freshly brewed masala milk tea, which we enjoyed as well. The owners were friendly, inquired about our preferred sugar level for the drink, and also sought feedback on their food. We definitely see ourselves coming back for more.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117874191110003037272/reviews
