Shouldn't be faulted for that as we're all humans. Updated the rating :)\n\nPrevious entry: Indian (?) staff working was taking his own sweet time and even though I was standing at the counter waiting to order for 10mins, he totally ignored me despite him only dealing with only one plate of food. He only took my order once he finished with the order despite having plenty of time waiting and doing nothing and having no other customers. Food was okay I guess? Bought the Nasi Kari, would order again but would be mindful of these things if in a rush.",
