      "text": "Dear Clinic Management\n\nI am writing to express my concern regarding the service quality at Sungei Tangah Lodge. During my visit, I observed that the staff did not communicate respectfully or behave professionally, particularly towards migrant workers. This is disappointing, as every patient deserves equal care and respect regardless of their background.\n\nAdditionally, while the clinic‚Äôs d√©cor is well-maintained, the overall service experience does not meet the expected standards. A healthcare facility should prioritize patient care and ensure that staff members are courteous and professional.\n\nI sincerely request the management to take necessary steps to improve service quality by training staff to be more respectful and attentive. A positive and welcoming environment will benefit both patients and the clinic‚Äôs reputation.\n\nThank you for considering this feedback. I hope to see improvements in the future.",
