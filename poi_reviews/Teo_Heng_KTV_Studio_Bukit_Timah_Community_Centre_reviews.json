Decided to give Teo Heng a try since it is short drive from our home.\n\nFirst impression is the place is new and clean. As it is our first time at Teo Heng, we were figuring out how to use the system ourselves.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised that the reception guy came to our room giving us a short orientation on how to use the system. Definitely a plus on the service. üëç",
