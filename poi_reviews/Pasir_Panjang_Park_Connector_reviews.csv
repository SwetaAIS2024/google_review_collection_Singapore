Marilyn Lim,4,"The only park in Singapore where you will hear cars on expressways on one side and container traffic on the other. So can be noisy.  The artistic shelters showcase the historical significance of the place, very cool concept to do so since the port will move away in years to come.  By then, this park will be nicer with the open sea on one side!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114282561901443027974/reviews
Forest BK,3,"The Pasir Panjang Park connects Labrador Nature Reserve and West Coast Park. It is not quite connected yet at the front and end sections. But, once the Wholesale Centre and the Container Port move out, hopefully, it would be nicely connected up.
The Park, mimic the once sandy beach of Pasir Panjang with stretches of sandy vegetation.  Maritime artifacts like ship bollards, anchor, along with a canon, are featured. It also features a Nature Playgarden catering to the children.
Seniors will remember an old canon and the concrete railings at the old Pasir Panjang Park where, at that time, the shoreline was closer to the Park (before reclamation work)
Incidentally, a very small section of the Concrete Railings is still intact, behind the Food Centre. There is also an old steps leading into the water. The steps are at the canal behind the carpark, next to the Food Centre.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Emilie Yeo,3,"This section was opened early sept 2021.
Access to the park can be either through the pasir panjang food centre carpark or opposite PSA Horizon.
Not many people around I guess due to it being new and just a short stretch. There are distinct lanes for human and cyclists, small playareas dotting the linear stretch of the park. The park ends abruptly where the bukom terminal is. Not quite sure if in future it would connect to the adjacent park.
Nothing much here at the moment, perhaps wait till larger sections are completed. I took this path on the way to labrador trails to break the monotony of walking down pasir panjang road.
Will add on more once the other sectors open up and revise the ratings.
Otherwise, it is flat and wheelchair, prak friendly. It is also easily accessible either by mrt (pasir panjang) or car or bus.

SAAziz S M,3,"It's a nice peaceful and quite plane.
You can fly your drone here as its outside the NFZ.
Near the food center,  Pasir Panjang mrt station. You can see the pasir panjang container and ferry terminals nearby.
You can get to Vivo City and Sentosa just a by taking the train to Harbour front station.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117697808727089801385/reviews
Simon Y,3,"This park supposedly serve as a middle park connecting West Coast Park to Labrador Park which wasn't that seamless as you have to walk on roadside path for prolong distance at both end. Also, as a relatively new park, most of its tree are yet to grown big enough to provide shade along the path.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110316451866688483932/reviews
