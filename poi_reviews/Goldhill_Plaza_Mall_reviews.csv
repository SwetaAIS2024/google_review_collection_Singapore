Timothy Teo,4,Lots of construction going on at the moment (Nov 2021). WARNING: The carpark here has no grace period and be warned that there is no way to circle back when you head for the exit. Turning left towards the exit will have limited lots after that and exiting means $1.60 so option only is wait for a slot to open up among the 15+ lots in that section.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109273027791328273356/reviews
