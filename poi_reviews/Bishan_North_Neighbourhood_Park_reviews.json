There is also more safe space surrounding the playground for older children to play other games. The exercise area for adults and elderly is sited near a community garden. There is ample parking spaces in the multi-storey carpark that is just a short walk away.",

A solution to this may be to join in the kids' games so it won't be so boring.\n\nSince the playground is a ship theme, I had some fun pretending to be a shark trying to creep up on the kids.",
