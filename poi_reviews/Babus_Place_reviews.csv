Nic Merc,5,"I’m a bit biased—any place that serves Guinness Draught automatically gets a minimum of 4 stars from me. The calamari here is exceptional: perfectly crispy on the outside and tender inside. Plus, the staff are genuinely friendly. This is officially my go-to weekend bar. 5 ⭐️.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106351400977735209637/reviews

Philipp Bonkatz,5,"The best place in town!
Beer is great and at low price all day long, the Rendang is beyond amazing especially considering it’s a bar and the people who hang out as well as the staff can’t make you feel more at home! My living room! 🙏🏾😎",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115525539259040374233/reviews
