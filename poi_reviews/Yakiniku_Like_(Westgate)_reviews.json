I appreciate how you brightened my day. Keep up the excellent work; I strongly recommend it to anyone who is a smaller eater, but not to those who consume a lot.",

      "text": "Went for an early lunch.\nPlace was almost empty aside from 2 and a half full tables. We got seated at the same table (there was a sauce divider in the middle) as another group of 2...which wasnt great. They left before us but it was really disruptive to have the waiter clean the table while we were still eating on one side. Keep in mind there is a dining time limit so it's best to decide what you want, before you get seated.\nWe got the \"A5 wagyu karubi and rosu 100g\" set ($20.90) and the A5 wagyu misuji and US karubi 100g\" set ($22.90) with 150g rice each. Ordered an extra 50g \"Pork belly\" ($4.50). Portion size for a set is definitely not enough for one person, so be prepared to possibly order extra food. The meat itself was yummy. They are thin, so it's very easy to overcook it. The rice portion comes in 3 different sizes with no extra charge, we went with the smallest size which was enough for us.",

And definitely worth every penny.\nThe world needs more affordable table-top BBQ just like these.\n\nThe BBQ experience was one of the best we‚Äôve had. The heat was just right to cook the thin slices perfectly and quickly too. Most amazing thing was the lack of smoky smells during and after. Very well thought through bbq design whereby the rims had a vacuum to suck up the smoke and oil fires too. No worries about anything catching on fire.\n\nAWESOME EXPERIENCE!
