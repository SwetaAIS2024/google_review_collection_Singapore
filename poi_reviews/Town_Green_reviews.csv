Z QH,3,"I noticed that they recently added a new piece of artwork to this area. While I don't want to be rude, I have to admit that it is truly UGLY! It looks like it doesn't belong here and just like a random thing has fallen down from somewhere else. The artwork itself is great, can say impressive, but I don't think it fits with the surroundings. Hope this comment will get noticed. It's a waste to the artwork, and makes the lawn ugly.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108454271569344566736/reviews
