Matthew Lee,5,"I have tried Tai Wah's most expensive set meal at $9 with my wife and on my own. My wife is a regular at this Happy Hawkers coffeeshop as she is an early childhood educator at the nearby Agape Little Uni.

Objectively speaking, the set meal was worth it. Please see the attached photo. The noodles, wantons, soup, etc, were very delicious and fulfilling.

Furthermore, the two female stall assistants manning the stall were very hardworking and professional in doing their jobs.

Therefore, I highly recommend Tai Wah Pork Noodles for all ba cho mee lovers and those looking for a healthy, wholesome and nutritionally balanced meal.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103085852239067801925/reviews
Van tan,1,"Came here for the second time to eat their meepok but they are always close in the odd hours. If i had another outlet, I would go instead if it not the only outlet in northeast. Disappointed because I missed their meepok haish

Please indicate a notice if you are closing for replenishment or closing for the day instead of opening as and when you like.

The auntie in the shop also seem to look relaxed and unbothered",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115997834192385625286/reviews
Zheng Yi,2,"Food has been consistent, slightly above average. But service staff attitude is terrible, particularly the lady cooking, she had a spat with a customer earlier in the queue. When it came to my order she made a mistake, instead of being apologetic, she directed her frustration towards the customer, blaming for the wrong order. And cut off people mid sentence",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112761587896232881192/reviews
Joanne Cheng,5,"Easy to find parking with multi storey parking. And thus we were here for our lunch. Tried the noodle and was nice! But the service was not that good. China lady cooking the noodle was very unhappy with the auntie who is tending orders and cashiers. But the noodle was nice with chilli and vinegar taste. Each bowl was $5 and you can ordered their big speciality bowl at $9. There are pork livers, dumpling and meatballs. So is worth the price. We also ordered the fried sole fish for $4. I also asked for pork lard to go with the noodle. Noodle kuay tiao was QQ. And will revisit again to eat since nearby our house. ðŸ˜€",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110408957347137900620/reviews
