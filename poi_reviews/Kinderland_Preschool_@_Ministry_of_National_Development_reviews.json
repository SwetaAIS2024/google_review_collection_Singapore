      "text": "When searching for a school, I prioritize looking for a school with plenty of outdoor activities.\nOther key factors such as a supportive environment, providing phonic foundations, and musical development within the school curriculum are a huge plus. After visiting 4 different schools, we found The one.\nKinderland@MND had it all. Best of all, it is strategically located in town.\nMy girl started in the mid of Nursery in 2022, prior to that she was taken care of by her grandparents. Teachers and principal had helped her transit from home to full-day childcare extremely well. She was a shy girl prior to entering Kinderland. In just half a day of school, she transformed from a quiet child into a friendly confident one. She initiated hi and converse with my colleagues after school confidently.\n\nPrior to entering Kinderland, my girl does not know how to read. Within a short 6 months, by December, she is able to read story books for her age, credits go to teacher Beatrice.\n\nNow she’s in K1, she is able to read The Gingerbread Man storybook independently. I am extremely thankful to the teachers in school for her achievements, especially teacher Sally and Miss Sim. She does not sign up for any academic enrichment outside of school, her love for languages is natured during her stay in school. Teachers will regularly read story books and through activities impart knowledge through fun interactions.\nIf safety is a factor for you, I will love to share that Kinderland@MND is located on a floor that is almost exclusively for the school. I love the fact that it had 2 layers of secured access prior to safety checks, and children will be guided into class by the teacher on duty.\n\nAs a mum with a girl, I really like the fact that the classes adopt an open concept because child abuse will be visible to other teachers which will keep the children safe. A point to note, at the moment the school does not have a male teacher. Which is another plus point for me.\n\nI highly encourage parents to arrange a visit to the school to see it for themselves. The very key deciding factor is having a highly experienced and passionate principal leading the school. Principal Kelly shared her beliefs and vision for the school with me during our visit, and under her guidance, Kinderland@MND delivered above and beyond. She is very generous in sharing insight into children’s growth, exposure, and milestones with parents.\n\nBehavior and guidance – as a parent sending my child to a full-day childcare, I admit that I am dependent on her teachers to guide her in many aspects. I am very delighted to learn that teachers are firm, provide proper guidance when children misbehave, and provide feedback to parents so we can work hand in hand both at home and in school. If you are like me, you will appreciate having teachers bravely share weaknesses in your child so you can improve and support them efficiently. My child has grown to be a positive and encouraging child. She will stand up to state a point and also listen to others’ opinions. Share the joins of others’ success and self-encourage when faced with challenges. These are qualities she has picked up under the guidance of her loving teachers.\n\nI am extremely thankful to all the teachers who guided my girl. She always looks forward to attending school.",

      "text": "Thank you Kinderland @ MND for guiding and teaching Ethan during his pre-school days which has helped him in his transition to primary school. He has adapted to his primary school environment and routine.\n\nEthan has also expressed his gratitude to Kinderland for teaching him Maths which is his favourite subject. Having learned Maths and being proficient with it, he is able count and purchase what he likes in his school canteen. The independence which he has developed in Kinderland has also made it more manageable for him when he goes to a new environment.\n\nWe also wish to express our thanks to Kinderland for our child’s development. Being exposed to other children at a younger age has allowed our child to develop the social and community consciousness. We believe that it is beneficial for his growing years. And having an environment which is safe and conducive has allowed him to learn to explore things. This is an important consideration for us as parents as we wanted for him to experience things and pick up life skills instead of just purely focusing on academic achievements.",
