      "text": "A great place to stay – Euphony Gardens is highly recommended! Good relaxing complex to stay and chill after work. Ample safe space and facilities for ourselves, our dear kids, elders and pets. Jog, swim, ball games, or hit the gym, kids cycle around, elders strolling leisurely, owners walking their pets; it has a wonderful compound. Transport wise, good connectivity from MRT; ride 7 stops (8 mins) on bus 169, 860, or 980 from Springleaf MRT Stn or ride 5 stops (8 mins) on bus 169 from Yishun MRT Stn. In terms of food, there is a stretch of Shophouse eateries outside the residence, and Chong Pang Market and Food Centre is just a stroll away. And right beside Yishun MRT, there is Northpoint City, the largest mall in the North Region.",

Customer buy pet food or others and wasted the driver’s time and said the guard will not let you in, this is ridiculous and make people time wasted and get scolded all the time.
