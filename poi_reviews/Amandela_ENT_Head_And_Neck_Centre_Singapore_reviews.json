      "text": "Dr. Samuel Yeak is very professional and most importantly patient with patients. I have seen several esteemed (and pricy) ENT doctors in private clinics in Hong Kong but none is as articulative and approachable. He explains motivations behind each examination, potential operation clearly to a lay person like me, which showcases his professionalism. He is such a professional doctor who connects with patient, tries to eliminate information asymmetry, and empowers their patients to make informed decision.",

Dr. Samuel Yeak in particular egregiously charged my son and I over $500 for an ear cleaning which took him less than 30 minutes to perform for the both of us.   I did try to privately address it with him by email, but he did not agree, so I have the right to air my issue here as a result.   I’ll never go back to this doctor nor clinic.   Massive ripoff and frankly unethical in my opinion.",

Within a few lines he could hear by my breathing that i had a sinus issue and asked me to pay him a visit. 4 years later, after a sinus operation and years of immunotherapy, no regrets!",

      "text": "My son has been going to Amandela for a year or so and trusted Dr Samuel Yeak and his team.  Dr Yeak placed my son on an immunology Program toward end of 2019 which is to last 2 years.  The program requires discipline ingesting of an oral tablet daily.  My son last  visited Amandela ENT Head and Neck Centre on 13th August 2020 as a follow up for his sinusitis.  Amandela issued him 3 months supply of tablets which he kept in his bedroom for ease of taking.  As he was busy revising for his national exams, he didn’t realise till a few days back (1st November) that he had been taking expired medication.  So Amandela issued him 3 months worth of medication which expired in September 2020.\n\nWhen I called the clinic on 3rd November 2020,  Dr Yeak said that even though it is inexcusable, doctors themselves take meds that are 6 months past expiry.  Comforting words to a mother.\n\nFrom what I see each visit,  Amandela has about 4 front office staff helping with the administration and dispensing of medication.  Yet, not one took notice of the error.  I’m truly disappointed and surprised that this episode had happened.\n\nLesson learnt -  never trust your doctors blindly.",
