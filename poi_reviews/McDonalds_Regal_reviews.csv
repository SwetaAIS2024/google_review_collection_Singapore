xin xie,1,"I placed an order at 6:11pm, with the notification telling me that my order will arrive at 6:41pm. Knowing that it was the peak hours on a Saturday evening, I figured it might take about an extra 20 minutes. However, no updates were shown on the app even then. I called the hotline for a cancellation, where the operator told me I will be contacted by the store's manager.
The store's assistant manager (on 29th March 2025's evening) only called me 20 minutes later. He then told me that the order could not be cancelled, as the rider has already left the restaurant. From what I noticed while tracking my order on the app, what had actually happened was, the previous rider cancelled, and he deliberately waited for another rider to become available, just so he can tell me my order can no longer be cancelled. I told him adamantly that I still want my order to be cancelled, and that I do NOT want the rider to show up at my door, to which he agreed and promised.
Surprise, surprise, the rider shows up at my door five minutes later. I declined to receive the food.
I have no idea what circus they are running there, but I have been dealing with clowns every step of the way.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114030238464165423484/reviews
Kuangz,1,Have ordered Mcdelivery services and have a missing order of 2-Hash-brown. Riza the manager on duty told me that she will write in a email to the management team and refund for the missing orders. After 1 week no refund was made back to me. Useless manager and management team. Definitely won’t recommend this outlet to anyone.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113145818648687837730/reviews
LP Pua,4,"I dropped by the restaurant at about 7:15 am on a Tuesday morning, and it was 80% packed. I ordered the Egg McMuffin set ($5.50). It was a standard McDonald's meal, served to the table with a big smile. It was a nice environment to eat breakfast and get some work done.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Sarah K,1,Ordering through Grab for this specific branch is HORRIBLE! Waited for more than an hour! I even ordered at 6:25am which is not peak period. Ended up cancelling the order!!
