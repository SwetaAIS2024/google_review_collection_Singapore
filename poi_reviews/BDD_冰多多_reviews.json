They give sufficient quantities of ingredients for the price.\n\nWait can be long during the usual dinner peak hours.\n\nThumbs up! Highly recommended.",

      "text": "Looking to escape the heat, I spotted the stall while waiting at a traffic light. Their extensive menu offered a variety of shaved ice desserts, and I opted for the recommended Grass Jelly and Mango ($5.80).\n\nThankfully, the wait wasn't long despite receiving a beeper. The portion was impressive ‚Äì generous chunks of sweet, fresh mango with chewy grass jelly. Everything tasted delicious, but the shaved ice itself, though flavoured, was a bit coarse. Finer ice would have been ideal.",

      "text": "Rarely can find passionfruit desserts at Chinese desert stalls and so happy to have found my favourite fruit combination of passionfruit x mango! Contary to the low reviews I rly enjoyed this, toppings were plenty and fruits were fresh. The ice is kinda ‚Äúcrispy‚Äù and not the soft ice but it‚Äôs good. The ice is milky and not just plain ice/water which adds to the flavour. Overall will be back to try my flavours!!",

      "text": "Their mango coconut is so rich and creamy! The shaved ice is sweet and milky, paired well with plenty of pearls, mango cubes, and a scoop of fragrant coconut ice cream! Their ice is more crunchy and not so fine, so don't expect snowy bingsu ice standard! I love crunching it though.\n\nOn another day we tried their oreo cheesecake for $7.80. It had a small-sized cheesecake which was rich and heavy on the tongue. Lovely! There was a generous amount of crushed oreo and a scoop of vanilla on top. However, their shaved ice wasn't that sweet this time, just plain ice which was a little disappointing. End up like eating oreo with ice.\n\nWe tried their mango pomelo bowl for $4.80. The ice was sweet and slightly crunchy, topped with cubed mangoes and shredded pomelos. I love how the melted milk in the end is infused with the bitter pomelo flavour. Quite a large bowl also. Worth!\n\nI find this stall so worth to try every single delicious combination :) Just wish it doesn't melt so fast but that's Singapore for you üòÆ‚Äçüí®",

      "text": "I stumbled upon this hidden gem of a dessert stall in the local coffeeshop, and I have to say, it was a delightful surprise!\n\nThe desserts here may not come with fancy presentations, but they sure pack a punch in the flavour department. I tried their Mango Pomelo and Oreo Cheesecake - lovely without additional toppings. Perfect on a hot day!\n\nAlthough there was just 1 staff who had to manage everything on his own that day, he was very friendly and obviously took pride in his work.\n\nOverall, it's good value for the price. Worth a try if you are around the area. We will be back!",
