James C,1,"I ordered while this lady was busy counting money, maybe she was stressed or annoyed. Still, that’s no excuse for bad service. I asked for less chilli, she said okay but dumped a large amount anyway. When I pointed it out, she gave me a black face and rushed through the cooking. The fishballs and fish slices were still cold, clearly not cooked properly. If she’s not happy to work, maybe she shouldn’t be working at all. Not coming back.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113948410629452064347/reviews

Jonathan Lim,1,"Please train your staff. As a regular customer for many years, I have never encountered such a careless staff member. The auntie from China in charge of the cashier always keys in the wrong order with incorrect amounts or fails to pack the rice properly. Despite being reminded multiple times, there has been no improvement. Seriously, is this the standard of service? Has the management ever provided any training to her?",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114431803259278779481/reviews
