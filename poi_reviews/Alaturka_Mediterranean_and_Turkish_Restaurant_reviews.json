We shared a meze with flatbread, grilled meats, fish, and a few sides, and every dish was delicious. The atmosphere was really lovely too, relaxed and welcoming! Finished off with a kunafa for dessert, which was the perfect sweet ending. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for great Turkish food in Singapore! Would love to visit again :)",

Food is tasty and delicious, meat is tender but on the pricier side. The place indoors is small but atmosphere is good. Overall a pleasant dining experience.",
