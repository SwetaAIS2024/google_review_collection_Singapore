Simply shocking - $7.20 for an average serving of fried rice noodle (which was mass produced and ready cooked, they just reheat), with a slice of luncheon meat, and a stock of ngor heong and one century egg\n\nI don't know what manner of arrogance this hawker is in AMK but so far this town has little to offer.",

      "text": "Despite encountering a few negative reviews about the service, my personal experience with this establishment has been consistently positive over multiple orders. The highlight for me is the Bee Hoon, which boasts a smooth, delicate texture that pairs perfectly with the accompanying ingredients. Each bite is flavorful and satisfying.\n\nA standout on the menu is undoubtedly the prawn crackers—a dish so irresistible that ordering just one portion simply won’t suffice. Light, crispy, and bursting with savory flavor, they are an absolute must-try.\n\nThe rest of the offerings are equally commendable, with well-prepared ingredients that elevate the dining experience. Paired with a cold beer, these dishes make for an excellent and indulgent accompaniment.\n\nAll in all, this spot is a great find for casual dining and drinks, offering dishes that hit the mark for taste and quality.",

Items were fried to crisp, not oily at all too and perfect with their homemade chili sauce. Price maybe on the higher side, compared to other similar Wu Xiang stalls. Worth a try, if you are around this area.",
