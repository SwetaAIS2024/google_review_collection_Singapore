Suu Nandar Htwe,5,"This is my honest review of 49 SEATS based on my very first experience.

The food was absolutely delicious â€” every dish was packed with flavor.
Portion sizes were generous, and the prices felt reasonable for the quality and service we received. What stood out even more was their truly lovely service. The staff went out of their way to make sure everything was convenient and comfortable for the customers.

Highly recommend for anyone looking for a satisfying and pleasant dining experience!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117281977958514601776/reviews
Miralee Lin,4,"A rather interesting combination of food flavours. Tom yum salted egg spaghetti was interesting, it was also served with some seafood in it. Was rather happy with the fish and mashed potatoes. Fish meat portion was generous with some clam sauce/chowder and mashed potatoes tasted good.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114259448164798202211/reviews
Martin Low,5,"We came on a weekend and ordered the tom yum seafood pasta, the smoked duck aglio olio, and the salted egg popcorn chicken.

Food: the tom yum pasta was great. The spiciness is customizable, which adjusts the amount of chilli padi. We tried the 'bit more spicy' version and it was just about right. The aglio olio was sinfully good as well, on the oily side.

Service: After seating, order and pay at the counter before being served. Food came relatively quick.

Price: Objectively, on the higher end in price. However, it is relatively reasonable factoring the location and that there is no service charge.

Overall, I would recommend to try out when there are ongoing promos and discounts.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113894121481913544527/reviews
CK Cheong,3,Interesting decor - a modernist silver black white color scheme. Signature dishes are the tomyam pasta and fish & chips. Ordered the tomyam pasta which was tasty but a little too salty. The portion for fish & chips was generous; easily enough for two persons with average appetites. Good service,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114524725497942089541/reviews
