Serving size was reasonable.  The soup was savoury and not salty.  Owner was friendly,  food was prepared fast. Overall, we enjoyed their noodle.",

      "text": "Ordered the $5 fried Hokkien Mee and was surprised by the huge portion that come with 2 big prawns. The wokhei is decent but 1 down side is there is no sotong which is replace by fish cake. I ordered the wet version which you can also request the dry versions if u preferred.  The overall taste is very well balanced not too salty like some stalls and noodle is cooked just right...not too soft. The chilli is sambal chilli but not too spicy. If those that love spicy can ask for more the Uncle will gladly give u. Overall I give a 4/5 n definitely will come back for more. Pls take note of the operating hrs before visiting.",
