Will,3,"Ordered a chicken drumstick rice and a chicken breast rice.

Owner was generous and gave a big bowl of soup.

Chilli was spicy and had a punch.

My friend was v happy with the breast meat as they served it to her without skin.

For my drumstick rice, it was told the rice is healthier but I felt that it's overly grainy. The drumstick was also deboned but the bone was left there in an awkward way.

Although it is a drumstick, I find the portion quite same.

Total about $9 or $10.

But for the market to be just beside, there's chicken and duck rice that's more value.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118119525043286062929/reviews
C,4,"Teo Kee is a simple stall serving authentic Hainanese chicken rice. The rice was fine, but the chicken drumstick was excellentâ€”juicy and tender. Portions were decent. A straightforward, no-frills option for delicious chicken rice in the West Coast neighborhood.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
Stephen Ong,5,"The best chicken rice in Singapore.  This is a hidden gem not very well known to people, they run two stalls one in chinatown and one in west coast. Honest couple who just focus on cooking and good service - does not spend much on doing marketing or ads or building brand.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101503388389487701867/reviews
Wilson Foo,4,"New chicken rice stall in New Century Food House kopitiam along Clementi West Street 2.

Ordered steamed chicken drumstick rice with added chicken gizzards. $7. Besides normal poached boiler chicken, they also have poached kampung chicken but minimum order is for half a bird.

The chicken was succulent and juicy. Chilli sauce with ginger puree elevated the taste of the chicken. Gizzards were crunchy with no funky or bitter aftertaste. But they committed the cardinal sin of all food stalls serving rice - half cooked rice, still hard at the center of the grain.

I really liked what I ate, except for the rice so I hope this is just a one off mistake. Will go try again soon.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114263857328212431619/reviews
