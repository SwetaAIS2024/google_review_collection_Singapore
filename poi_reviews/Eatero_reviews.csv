P Loh,4,"No issue with service or wait time. There are only 2 people working and grilling food takes time. Taste wise ok but not exceptional.

Patriarchy of the western cat realm,1,"Im all for supporting local and all. Life is tough but so are others. To give such thinly sliced chicken and charging $8.90 for it. You are passing on the toughness to the next person. :(( i wish to support and come back again, but i need to fill my stomach and have energy to go to work.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107271520879508428861/reviews
