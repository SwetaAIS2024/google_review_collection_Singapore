Akshay Arora,5,"We had such a fun and memorable experience at Madame Tussauds Singapore! Visiting from Canada, we weren’t sure what to expect, but it turned out to be an absolute blast. We’ve been to the New York location before, and this one definitely lived up to the hype — in fact, it had its own unique charm and fun surprises!

The wax figures were incredibly lifelike and covered a wide range of international and local celebrities, making it both entertaining and culturally interesting. We especially loved the interactive sections and themed zones — they made the experience feel much more than just a photo-op.

Everything was well-organized, clean, and easy to navigate. Great for families, couples, or solo travelers looking to enjoy something lighthearted and exciting. Highly recommend it if you’re visiting Sentosa — definitely worth the time!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104677662181738761333/reviews
Vishwajeet R Kamal,5,"Madame Tussauds Singapore has a wonderful collection of almost life size Wax Figures of various celebrities including World Leader, Sports Persons, Actors and local people depicting Singapore tradition and history. It presents the Singapore city’s iconic landmarks, cultural heritage and life of people. Some of the Wax Figures are very realistic. One can take photographs with these figures. In between your journey, you will get a short boat ride as well. There is short Marvel 4D movie which you can enjoy as well.  Overall, Madame Tussauds Singapore is a wonderful experience of entertainment and culture, offering a memorable experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107253345714052605750/reviews
Vaibhav Jain,5,"Madame Tussauds,Singapore is located at the famous Sentosa Island. It's on a close,walking distance to the last Sentosa cable car stop. To me, it's a must visit place as it offers a fun and interactive experience, blending lifelike wax figures with immersive zones that celebrate global and local celebrities. Visitors can pose with wax versions of famous personalities from the film industry, music industry, sports and politics. Therefore, making it a great spot for photos and star-struck moments.
Highlights include the “Spirit of Singapore” boat ride, which showcases the city’s culture and landmarks, and the Marvel Universe 4D experience, where fans can engage with their favorite superheroes.

PS: - Highly recommended for visiting when in Singapore/Sentosa.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117299102484604813950/reviews
Krisnen Murday,4,This place can be fun if you let yourself go and see things through a child's eyes. But I personally think that some models really need to be replaced as they hardly resemble the real stars. Also maybe a good renovation would certainly be much appreciated by the visitors.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117810331747349391196/reviews
Vivek Agrawal,4,"It was good. The 4D marvel show was great. Most of the wax figures were good. Interactive sections were a little boring for me. Though they might be interesting for history enthusiasts.
My recommendation. It is worth adding in your itinerary, but may skip it if you are short on time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108990046934424242546/reviews
