Xen,5,"First time eating at this foodcourt cause itâ€™s rather unpopulated and the stalls are rather few compared to the one above.

Walked past the economic rice store and decided to try it after seeing the never ending customers and variety of dishes(will take pic next time)

Also they offer brown rice!! Which i rarely see in mixed veg rice stores.

Anyways, the price is insanely cheap, I got:
Brown rice(less) + tofu with meat on top + bean sprouts with tofu + pumpkin + steamed egg + sweet and sour pork with ah-zha + beancurd skin + hairy gourd = $8.60!!

I was damn surprised when I heard the price, and the portion they give is pretty huge. Would certainly patronise the store again.

Take note: they only accept cash!!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104000842156487678731/reviews

John Tan,1,"Bought this you tiao from the chinese snack stall.
The you tiao taste tough n cold like overnight leftovers.
How to be happy when they have the cheek to sell this kind of food.
Not about the $2 but just the kinda of integrity as a hawker.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112675070802819071194/reviews
