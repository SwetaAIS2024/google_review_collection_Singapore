chiranjeet narayan dev,5,"The cage Kallang is situated just next to the national stadium in Kallang. It is a beautiful place for sports enthusiasts, has a lot of indoor facilities for cricket as well as football. The place has a changing area and sitting area outside as well. You can book for two hours or one hour. Weekends is a bit rush but the playing experience was really good. We had a lot of fun and we plan to do it once in a while!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110590788353072024046/reviews
Abdul Jabbar Kachi,5,"For weekends gateways with all your buddies, family bonding, friends from working field and those who loves to show off skills just go to this awesome and sheltered(worth every penny) venue. If you are with bigger families fret not, as you have very big space outside for munching and chatting, while the kids can do thier kicking and playing just in front of you ðŸ˜€ ðŸ˜‰",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111491579706260073591/reviews

William Lu,5,"Went here first time for a team building and play inside the cage. It was a hot day but the big fans inside was quite accomodating to cool down the place.

Be careful on parking at the roadside, saw TP officer came and took photos on some of the cars parked there. There wasn't a parking space at the location exactly.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
Malvin Raj,1,"The service is amazing.

However, the pitch is absolute dogshit. There are holes everywhere. The spots where turf has been damaged were never fixed. The penalty spot in the pitch i played in WAS MADE OUT OF STONES. They assume no responsibility for the safety of the participants.

This place is now a disgrace. They are more focused on spending money to built better counters and seating areas when in fact the money should have gone into TAKING CARE OF THE PITCH

ABSOLUTE HORRIBLE TIME PLAYING ON PATCHY, UNEVEN AND ROCKY GROUND.

baffles me how this is deemed safe. Absolutely disappointed.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114707487918317900079/reviews
