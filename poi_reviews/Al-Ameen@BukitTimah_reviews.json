The place is clean and pleasant. For curry puffs, will recommend the potato rather than the sardines. Waiters were friendly. Overall, a pleasant dining experience here.",

I've been to many Indian restaurants and prata shops because I like Cheese Prata and I can safely conclude Al-Ameen cheese prata @ Bukit Timah is S-Tier. Not B-Tier, not C-Tier but S-Tier (although somedays it would be just A-Tier). I came here many times just for their tasty cheese prata.",
