      "text": "This used to be on level 1 but has since moved to B2 (likely within Jan-Mar 2025). It’s next to Guardian Pharmacy which is by the food court, at the end of Marina Bay Sands that is near the Art Science Museum; Helix bridge. It offers a variety of groceries and cheap bites like sandwiches, onigiri, sushi, cut fruits and such. Probably the cheapest option for a quick bite in this sprawling mall. E.g. the chicken rice onigiri costs $2.50. A cup of mixed fruits is about $6.90. Queue up for either self-pay credit card/cashless payment terminals or if you must use cash, there is just one human cashier.",

Thanks",

As guests of Marina Bay Sands and a long term customer of JD, I will not be returning. Staff were apologetic, but this cleaner is not helping the store's relationship with its customers.",
