F K,2,"This is a very average tailor at best. I have been a customer for 1.5 years and I can confidently say that the high rating given here in google review is not representative of their abilities. Every single time I tailored something ( a suit, 2 shirts, 3 pants) had an issue that needed rectification.

But that's not the worst part. Its the pretending nothing is wrong when they have made mistakes (every single time!) that gets to me.

It's ok to make .mistakes, just admit and make adjustments and move on. But both tailors here cover up the mistake by saying ""it's normal"" or ""it is supposed to look like that"". And they get away with it too because you'd notice that most people giving review here are new to tailored garments. They don't know any better and haven't done their research and so they get intimidated and bulldozed.

I had to speak out and demand, politely of course, that .mistakes are fixed before it is done. After so many tries, I gave up. The mistakes keep happening and the lying (especially one of the brothers) is just disgusting.

Prices are not cheap and not expensive. Technical knowledge is almost zero.

Stay away unless you want a cheap tailored product.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112931980671044363756/reviews

Lloyd Lin,5,"Not sure if those with 1 stars review went to the same shop because my experience here was wonderful.

I was contemplating between another popular tailor in Defu lane but am so glad I decided to go ahead with Brazil tailor.

I would consider the price here to be the same with most other tailors out there but what really set them apart was the quality of service they provided. Mr Thomas Lai was patient and attentive every time I went down. This was a complete contrast to my experience in the other tailor at Defu lane where everything was a mess and I was kept waiting for more than 15 mins sifting through all the samples which I had no idea about.

My suits are due for collection soon but throughout the process of measuring, fitting and altering, the service was impeccable and the handiwork looked great. Can't wait to get my hands on my completed suits.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116957629340531297731/reviews

Kosmikos Immanuel,5,"Price range about $95 - $105 per tailor made shirt. Been wearing tailor made shirt since day one with them.

Very comfortable as it's made to measure. Looks neat n smart cause there's no extra material hanging out some where like off the shelf ones. Also durable n withstand wear n tear.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106333497640441615118/reviews
