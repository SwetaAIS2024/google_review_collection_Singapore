Levin,3,"Fried fish was crispy and wasn't too oily. The flesh was a bit dry, but better dry than soggy for me. Tartar sauce was a bit bland, but plentiful.

Sweet potato fries although crispy, held no hint of sweetness.

The popcorn chicken was crispy and decent, although it was a bit more oily than the fish.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112878374817848127411/reviews
Leow Raymond,1,"Ordered delivery via grab and the crispy pork looks like 0.1cm thick. Most are just batter.

The mee sua and crispy chicken is still good.

Do not order the crispy pork.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111099464261221681975/reviews
D T,5,"I love the mee sua and fried chicken. I think the food get you get close enough to Taiwan. Probably just short of having an actual Taiwanese serving you, and being in the country itself. That said, there's this Filipino guy who's always so friendly and warm,  which is quite the service level of Taiwan.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108923336048763784109/reviews
Jerome Tan,4,"Nice chicken cutlet and Taiwanese good stall. The only one in this mall when u have a craving for fried chicken cutlet.

The set meal seems worth it (with rice, cutlet and braised egg for around $8)",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117996872878240417241/reviews
Daryl Lim,1,"Ordered through grabfood at 11.47am, don't even care & accept the order. It's 12.30pm now, I decided to cancel. Called the hotline too, no one answer. If you cannot handle delivery orders, please off your grabfood apps. Instead of letting customers wait.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118298752471461470540/reviews
