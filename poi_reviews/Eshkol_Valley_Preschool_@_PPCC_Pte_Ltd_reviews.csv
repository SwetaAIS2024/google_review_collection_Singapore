JING SUN,5,"My son graduated from Eshkol Valley Preschool Pasir Panjang campus in 2024. Teachers at Eshkol Valley Preschool are very patient, kind and full of love. They understand every kid is different and will apply different strategies to guide kids along the preschool journey. They are not only making the kids academically strong, but also focusing on character building. My son really enjoys the time with Eshkol Valley and loves his teachers.

Happy C,5,"My son enjoyed a very happy time here. The teachers are all genuinely caring and really go the extra mile to do their best to help my son learn. Beyond purely academic learning, we are confident that the authenticity and good values displayed by the teachers will surely be inculcated in each child. My son really looks forward to going to school everyday and this speaks alot. The demographic is also diverse comprising locals and expats from many countries. We found this to be enriching as it gives early exposure to different cultures and thinking.   Though we are sad to leave to move on to Primary school, we are very sure that our son will leave with the best of memories and will look back with fondness in the years to come. We are very thankful to have found this place and hope to keep in touch.If you are looking for a cozy and more personal experience for your child, this is the place.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100567371835393536320/reviews
