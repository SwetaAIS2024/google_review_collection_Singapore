guo tan,5,"We are so grateful for the wonderful experience at Berry Tree Preschool at Punggol! If I could give them 10 stars, I would and even that might not be enough!

My child recently graduated, and I couldn’t be happier with the school’s approach. The school places great emphasis on academics, while still creating a nurturing and enjoyable environment for the children.

The teachers here are incredibly dedicated and supportive. They never give up on any child, always offering the guidance and help needed. This has made a huge difference in my child’s learning journey and growth. Highly recommended to any parent looking for a meaningful preschool experience!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109223305462903101698/reviews
Jentson Lin,5,"Both my kids graduated from Berry Tree Punggol, and we would like to express our heartfelt appreciation to the staff and teachers for their dedication and care. Their patience, guidance, and unwavering love truly nurtured our children and prepared them well for primary school.

We know our kids can be a handful at times, but the team at Berry Tree always went above and beyond to support them in their learning journey. Thank you for creating such a warm and nurturing environment where our kids could grow and thrive. Highly recommend this preschool to any parent!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104934747298488608300/reviews
Julie Trieu,5,"I have two daughters. The eldest studied at My first skool. The experience was bad. By end of K2, she didn't know how to read a lot of English/ chinese words, no phobics program offered, no Han yu pinyin.. Her simple math was as bad. We had to send her to courses to catch up with friends in primary school. All she knew was how to play n doodle. So, with my second one, I decided to find a better preschool. I came across BerryTree which was near my house and I actually didn't think it was my first choice, before I spoke to Ms Shanthi, the school principle. I was impressed at the course programs they offered so all kids would be able to independently read Chinese and English storybooks by k2. They would also be able to write short essays in chinese and English. And the math program was interesting and practical. We enrolled my second daughter immediately. For four years with berryTree, there was no moment of regret. We are thankful to the teachers who always taking good care of our kids, teaching them disciplines and good values, friendship and provide them good education. We didn't even need to send my girl out for tuition at all. There was a p1 transition program for all k2 kids so they learnt about homeworks, and money counting. My daughter is very confident going to her primary school. Parents out there, if you want a good school with academy focus and save up on tuition, more time to play during weekend, this is the right school for you.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114719728671254607888/reviews
chitrarath bhattacharjee,5,"Getting our son admitted in Berry Tree Preschool has been one of our best decisions. In one year we can visibly see a big difference in his learning, behavioural and social skills. We attribute a lot of that to the very caring and professional teachers who take good care of our son and have a very engaging curriculum. We are very pleased with the progress and convey our regards to the school management.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106662281427632055573/reviews
Magdalene Yue,5,"Our daughter was with Berry Tree from PG to K2. We can tell she truly enjoys school as she often shares with us the things she learnt in school and her interactions with friends and teachers.

Over the years Teacher Shanthi and team have been very supportive. They are prompt in responding to our queries through Class Dojo. During half yearly PTCs they provide specific updates about our child as well as address any concerns we have.

The school’s curriculum and worksheets in the later years set a good foundation for primary school - our daughter is able to read and write thanks to the effort of the teachers. The overall environment is well maintained and conducive for learning.

We are glad to have our daughter in Berry Tree. She has blossomed from a toddler whose needs were well taken care of, to a confident child who communicates well with peers and adults. We will certainly miss the partnership with the school - thank you once again for everything!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114328815626825424989/reviews
