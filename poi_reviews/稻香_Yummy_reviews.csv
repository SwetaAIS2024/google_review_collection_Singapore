A Ace,1,"The China lady at Bendemeer branch who is taking care of frying has a real serious attitude problem! While I was waiting for the food to be ready she was gossiping about someone jumping down again and again with her colleague. And the next moment she was complaining to her Chinese colleague together with another China male customer, claiming that she hates customer who keeps looking at the food she was preparing. I look at the food is because I was wondering if the sauce is enough for the portion, any problem with that?? Please educate your workers to do more work rather than gossiping about others this is such a huge turn off! I realized they are friendly towards male customers and showing a million dollar face to female customers. If she could, she may simply hide herself inside an air-conditioned office. It is time to send them for upgrading course. And lastly I saw the steel fryer has some black rusty substance underneath it. Will boycott this stall!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101607342571033510733/reviews
