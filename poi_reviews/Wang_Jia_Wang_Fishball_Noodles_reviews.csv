Ivan Tan,5,"I give credit where credit is due. Honestly, this is one coffeeshop where mostly residents staying around here will visit and eat as the ever popular 505 Jurong west market & food centre is just a walking distance. I love this Bak Chor Mee and potion is good too. Keeps me full and satisfied with a happy smile. Do order the number 2. Uncle may look fierce or arrogant but he is not. He says thank you too. If you are around here, give this a try. If you look at the operating timing, sells till afternoon so it will be a disappointment if you are expecting to open late evening or night. If i come here. It will usually be in the morning so itâ€™s alright.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105865784747329427413/reviews
Benito Linus,5,Discovered this noodle stall after my grocery shopping at the nearby Sheng Siong. Ordered a fishball noodle dry and I really love it. Noodles was springy and the flavours was not too strong or too spicy. Reasonable pricing too.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114106152376985360330/reviews
