Rich Cogswell,5,"An exceptional experience.
I was lucky to be invited to savour this intimate no menu cocktail magic within a singular location.
Spend a couple of hours in the company of a couple whoâ€™s passion is clean flavouring and unique combinations.
Stand outs? Chrysanthemum Negroni and Sakura Flower Martini - tired of the bar scenes? Beginner or connoisseur? No matter thereâ€™s joy for any visitor.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103943212674947648454/reviews
Desmond Wong,5,"A unique experience. My 1st visit to a house bar and this was very near my place. The place Joseph and Peiyi had qas nicely renovated to host guests. I had 3 cocktails, which are all different and tasted according to my request.  The 1st was a rough coffee and spicy, followed by a negroni and ended with a pi pa gao favoured cocktail. We also tried the beef steak and egg mago with bread. Hopefully, we get to come back again soon even though they have a long waitlist.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114220117023892689160/reviews

Tee Jin Hui,5,Very difficult to get a spot as their slots are always filled. Put yourself on the waitlist and quickly respond once slots are open!! Had an opportunity recently and had a great night hosted by Joseph and Pei Yi. Their drinks were great and we loved almost every cocktail that was made.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111069063327196192456/reviews
J. Kang,5,"Never a dull moment here with Joseph and Peiyi. Ideal ratio doesnâ€™t just apply to the drinks but also the good mix of guests we cross paths with. Oh also, count on Joseph to make you a Ramos Gin Fizz, he keeps it going with an undefeated face ðŸ˜‚",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114762816041768658319/reviews
