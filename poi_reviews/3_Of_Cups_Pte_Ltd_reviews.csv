Angeline Gan,5,"Came with my friends for my belated birthday celebration. We were told that we could only sit outdoor. We dun mind that but couldn't sit on the hard chairs for too long.

Love their cocktails! Tried The Wheel and The Sun. They are soooo good!!! Not forgetting the food on the menu!

Unfortunately we did not have the chance to get tarot cards reading experience as we came on Thursday.

Excellent service, outstanding meal, great cocktail selection. I dun mind coming back again~",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100045871253076200775/reviews
Glenda Tan,4,"We were being server by Amy, excellent service. Amy make super nice cocktails.

Food are yummy love the empress prawn and fishy conction. Among the cocktails I had i love the queen of cups most.

We ordered 12 drinks and had 3 tarot reading by Rae. Although is a short reading but we find the reading pretty accurate. Is the first time 3 of us have tarot reading. Tarot reading is not daily so do check out ahead if you want the reading.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112112594123477956258/reviews
Jd L,4,Came here after reading about a tarot card reading for 3 cocktails. Music is a little overly loud for conversation. Cocktails are interesting. Aircon could be colder considering the warm weather the country is having.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115003699534688199669/reviews
Erica,4,"It was empty when we arrived on a Friday night at 7:30. However within an hour the place buzzing, great music and atmosphere. Fun tarot reading. Some of the food items were not available making the choice a bit limited.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117921764325521157463/reviews
AJ,5,"Cute bar with friendly staff, decent selection of cocktails and pub food like wings/ fries/ pizza. Their main draws are the signature cocktails, purchasing three of which will get you a free tarot reading. Recommend the High Priestess, 3 of cups, ace of cups, and king of wands (last three pictured)

Special shout out to Uma the tarot card reader, for being patient with us and making it really fun ðŸ˜‰",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113590622173773153419/reviews
