Samham Tam,4,"This place does not sell your traditional type of prawn noodles- pork lard, distinct umami of prawn head in the stock and mixed generously with sambal (if you do chilli).

A bowl of noodles comes with deshelled prawns cut in half(it's convenient to eat), lean pork strips(still juicy and does not carry that strong porky flavour), fish cakes, bean sprouts and the sauce mix consists of shallot oil(instead of the usual pork lard) and caramel dark soy(and sambal) that brings the whole dish together. The broth/stock that comes with the noodles is of a lighter flavour profile that comes with a sweetness that emanates from the large onions, white carrots and rock sugar that they use with some acidity from the prawn heads.

I would classify it as a lighter and simple version of prawn noodle that still carries a complex flavour profile and for me, this is a version of prawn noodles i do not feel ""jelat"" despite having eaten it for over 30 years(and tasted versions cooked by the current stall owner, his grand parents, parents to to himself currently). Caveat- I do have a soft spot for family run local food businesses(it's really rare to see Millennials being willing to take over their family's food business).

Whilst i don't think it's at the level of asking people to come all te way from any part of the island to eat type of dish; I would recommend a try for this unique version of prawn noodles that i do no think is sold elsewhere if you're in the area!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102149038595831645948/reviews
Jeffrey C,3,"Havenâ€™t been here for years. Sadly, the standard has dropped quite a lot. The noodles are blend. Even after adding the dark black sauce, the noodles still lack the umami. The soup is also not as tasty as before. It is no wonder they no longer have a queue.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106833163410885808643/reviews
Mantou,2,"Not my cup of tea. Still prefer the regular prawn noodles with that umami taste. Here it's just the black sauce taste, one dimensional.  Ordered the mixed soup as well, all the ingredients inside were very tough and the soup was very sweet, and the sweet here is not the umami sweet it's literally sweet. Overall just a weird meal for me.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118213126945726447138/reviews
Edward Wong,3,Paid $4 for a bowl of prawn noodles with soup. Portion was too small for an adult. Prawn was fresh and crunchy. Soup was average with some flavour. Pork slices were a bit hard. Noodles were springy. Service was friendly and efficient despite I queued for 15 minutes.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110173188680901424865/reviews
c tzehow,4,"This is one of the best prawn noodle I had. The soup is good and the dark sauce noodle and mee hoon is delicious.
Hidden at corner of a kopitiam. Price wise is pricey, $5 with few prawns and 2 pieces of intestine.  Portion not big. However,  Q is long during peak time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102842308844590273724/reviews
