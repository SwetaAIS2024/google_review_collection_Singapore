Basil Ting,1,"The customer service is utterly useless, requested for an annual fee waiver for my credit card. First time experiencing annual wee waivers rejections and the only explanation is “the banks decision is final”. It looks to me like a cheap method of SCB to get in a few extra dollars. Would never use this bank for any of their services again. Been using so many banks in SG and all proceeded to waive annual fees without hesitation and trouble.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110675472795091313880/reviews
