Lincoln Kden Sim,5,"A small and nice place for hong kong noodles and dessert. The restaurant offers a variety of rice and noodles, but its recommended to have the noodles instead.

There's also an option to make your main into a set meal by topping up $4.50 to $5.50.

Standard of the desserts have remain constant throughout the years and it's always enjoyable.

The staff here are friendly and helpful, recommending food items to customers who can't decide",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105766970560454146004/reviews
Panna Metta,4,"The food is ok but the mala is more spicy then mala. The seats are worn out and it is uncomfortable to sit. Have to tell them to cook the noodle longer and softer, otherwise the noodle are too hard and difficult to chew.

Mark Ong,3,"An ok, little messy eatery that serve HK style food.  Diners beware prices in menu exclude GST.  All prices will be shown upon payment.  Set meal here are good offer in terms of cafe price.  Food quality is of benchmark. It's a good place if you want to eat and go. Not really recommend to linger longer as this place is quite messy at its seating area . Given it as a small store , it's forgivable.  Wan ton noodles have the chewy texture to it . Wan ton is large enough. If you crave for an HK food fix, this is ok enough.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117348003086836979353/reviews
Heidy Dalumpines,3,"Ooh they're serving abalone dumpling for a limited time, just had to try it. Turned out it's sticky rice with beef chunks, nuts, chickpeas as filling and wrapped in banana leaf. Not bad though the supposed star of the dish - the abalone - were like a couple of pieces, clearly missing from the action. Had the osmanthus lime with honey pearls to wash it down. All for sgd21.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107944570971635776783/reviews
