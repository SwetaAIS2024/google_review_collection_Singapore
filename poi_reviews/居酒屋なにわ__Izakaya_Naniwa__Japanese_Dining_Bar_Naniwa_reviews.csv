Zuriel Mamba,5,"Whelmed by a pair of hospitable owners, this is the place u wanna experience  Japanese izakaya.

Plenty of choices to occupy my table. The liver sashimi is one of my favourite dishes, moriawase  is another fave. Actually I enjoyed all the dishes we ordered & perfect to match with sake. Rly enjoy the vibes & food here",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100097027827819745483/reviews

Dru Lu,5,"This is a bar that you wish only you‚Äôve found and no one else knows, and it is with great reluctance that I write this review.

The nice boss and boss lady run the small izakaya inhabited by the loyal regulars. A real home style cooking that gives lots of comfort, and I supposed shoes off at home ;)

My favourite is definitely the snails. Must have two every time I go there. Yum‚Ä¶. If you‚Äôre already impressed by what‚Äôs laid out on the table, you‚Äôd be real surprised by what else this little shop has to offer ‚Äúoff the table‚Äù.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115927493800245457440/reviews
Johnson Wong,5,Most authentic Japanese izakaya in Singapore so far. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and socialised with other customers. We will definitely return.

Alvin Choo,5,"Unveiling the mysterious veil of Izakaya Naniwa.. I actually wanted to visit since Aug 2020 but details about them online were scarce. Saw an old review from 2009  that was really negative about the place and hence I hesitated. Finally visited in Jun 2023 and found out how much I have been missing out.

The food here is really cheap and good and way better than most of those central kitchen restaurants in shopping centres. I left feeling like I robbed the shop! The shop is manned by the boss and his wife and he's a one man show doing all the cooking hence they have the plated dishes in case you want something while the food is being prepared.

It's also a really small shop that seats around 12 to 13 and reservations are a must. Reservations are made through WhatsApp (find the number yourselfüòÇ) and they take reservations for the coming week on Sunday. There's no physical menu at the shop but all the available dishes and specialities are conveyed via WhatsApp before your visit.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
