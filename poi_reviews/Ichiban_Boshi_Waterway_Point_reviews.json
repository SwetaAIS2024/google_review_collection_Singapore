The chawanmushi was silky smooth and literally melted in my mouth! The salmon belly was flavorful.\n\nHowever, the rest of the dishes are not so good. The beef teriyaki don was overwhelmingly sweet, which threw off the balance of flavors. Similarly, the sukiyaki beef soup was also too sweet for my taste.\n\nOn the service front, the staff were friendly and welcoming, but the service was a bit slow.\n\nOverall, my experience at this Japanese restaurant was decent, but not spectacular. If you're a fan of chawanmushi or salmon belly, you might want to give this place a try. I might come back to try other dishes.",
