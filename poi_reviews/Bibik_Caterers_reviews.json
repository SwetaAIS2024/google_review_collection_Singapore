      "text": "Recently opened along Guillemard road Bibik catering is a cosy little local cafe, specialising in Singaporean delicacy Kueh cakes and other sweet delights, it‚Äôs a good place to have a snack and a local tea or coffee. You can also get a local style breakfast with kaya toast and eggs as well as western breakfasts including pancakes with scrambled eggs and sausage. There are also good local options of beef rendang or chicken curry which was pretty good. It‚Äôs nothing fancy, but then it‚Äôs not supposed to be. The price is reasonable and the service friendly but still a bit rough around the edges, but atmosphere is casual so don‚Äôt expect too much. If you‚Äôre looking for a light local bite, check it out.",

The taste of cheese is just nice and it blends very well with the milky texture.\n\nIts been awhile since I've tasted such a delicious cheesecake.\n\n2 thumbs up!! üëç",
