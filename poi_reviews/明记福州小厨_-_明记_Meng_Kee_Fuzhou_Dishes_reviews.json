      "text": "For a Tze Char stall, it is generally quite average. The sliced fish with onions is very underwhelming. The salted egg pork is much tastier and very well fried. We also ate some Prawn Paste Chicken, which is probably the tastiest of all the dishes we bought. Serving portion is quite small and hence not the most value for money compared to other Tze Char stores in Singapore. It is slightly more expensive (i.e. 8 prawn paste chicken for $10, but other stalls are selling 10 for $10!)",
