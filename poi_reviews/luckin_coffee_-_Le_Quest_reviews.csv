snk,5,Happy to find Luckin here. Just right in front of the bus stop. Shop space is small but still manage to have some seats. Can take a short coffee break here. It's more quiet and not as crowded as the Westgate B1 one. Service is fast.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111705105142049227184/reviews
Barbara Lina Lei,5,Cosy little space with 4 high bar stools in the seat area. The aroma of coffee is amazing! This outlet is just across the street from our home within walking distance. Great place to just chill for a drink mother daughter style when we don't feel like going anywhere. ðŸ˜œ,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103975884080271758388/reviews

Alvin Li,5,"Was pleasantly surprised when I tried to order from Westgate and they gave me a nearer option.

There's a mini dine in area (a bench table with high seats) looking outside if you want to rest and relax. Otherwise, just grab and go.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101636040394390892825/reviews
