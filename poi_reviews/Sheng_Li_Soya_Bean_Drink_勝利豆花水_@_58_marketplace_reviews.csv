YY,4,"A soya bean shop that has a never ending queue during peak timings.

80 cents per cup / bowl at this day and age seems like a steal, and they are selling cups after cups of it.

The owners are really friendly and are working at a very fast paced to serve the continuous stream of patrons.

Definitely a local favourites from the looks of it üëçüèª",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews

Terence Tan,5,"My all time favourite drink stall. Freshly made soya bean milk and bean curd. Soya bean milk sweetness is just right. Bean curb is silky smooth with perfect sweetness!

This is my first time trying out mixed soya bean and grass jelly. Interesting combination, not too sweet, not bad not bad!

Best of all, the price is so much cheaper than other places. $0.80 for each item.

Pack a hot soya bean milk $0.80 yield 700ml. Good deal!

Enquired from fishball hawker owner about this soya bean outlet. Apparently uncle had a fall recently. Good news is he has fully recovered. Since the hawker will be undergoing renovation in early October, uncle decided to take a break to rest and will be back after the renovation is completed, tentatively end of year, 2023.
Looking forward for it! üòã",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107525131369857002446/reviews

Teri Mak,5,"Me and my family visited Sheng Li Soya Bean Drink stall today, we enjoyed eating their soya beancurd and their drinks were good too !!! Expect a queue (fast-moving). Their packaging was also thumbs up (for example the plastic bag was of good quality and nothing spilled). Overall experience was very pleasant !!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110288242101634602409/reviews
