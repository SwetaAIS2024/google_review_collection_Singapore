It is an affectionate confession to the soul.\n\nThe exquisite tableware and colorful food are as pleasing to the eye as works of art. They not only nourish the body, but also awaken the soul that has been sleeping all night, making every ordinary day shine with this sense of ritual. Hui.\n\nThus, a beautiful day slowly kicked off with this delicate care and romantic expectations.",
