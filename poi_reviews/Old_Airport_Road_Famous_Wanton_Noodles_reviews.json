Visited in Dec 2024 after more than 20 years and disappointed that the sauce isnâ€™t as good as it used to be. The noodles were cooked al dente and there is no alkaline taste. Wontons were decent too. The portion for $5 was filling, but I feel that the sauce wasnâ€™t as robust as it used to be. The crispy shallot paste that used to coat the noodles wasnâ€™t there. Noodles were also drier and lacked punch. And no option to take green chilli",

The bowl here is extra special taste from the rest in this crowded area FF, C's,..even the other more popular stall in same market. Noodles are springly, credit to the special chilli with no lard taste, soup, even $4 wantons taste magical enough for mortals, portions are big. A big Michelin star too, what more can you ask. Luckily queues here subdued too.",

Not your lean paper cardboard variety. Special dumpling at $1 a piece. Tasty pork lard bits tossed in.\n\nOtherwise, just above average",

White version with only wanton dumplings, no chilli no char siew.\n\nIn comparison, Kim Kee's wanton mee does it better for me. I personally prefer Kim Kee's sauce mix and wanton, with the final presentation more fragrant as well. Noodles texture are comparable.\n\nNext time, if Kim Kee is closed, hmm... I'll try other stalls instead ðŸ˜…\nService is fast and digital payment via PayNow only.",

And sambal type chilli or green cut! CharSiew was a bit on the dry side, otherwise itâ€™s worth a visit. Will try to also look them up on their history and how they prepare their ingredients.
