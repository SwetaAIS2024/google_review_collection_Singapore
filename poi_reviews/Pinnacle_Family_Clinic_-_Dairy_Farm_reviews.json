I loved that they have a weighing machine that can take height measurement and they have a machine you can self serve to take blood pressure.\n\nHaha.\nAnyways....\nI loved this place as it is not yet so crowded.  There are a lurkin, coffee bean and Baker and Cook cafe.  Same doctor for now and this is good.  Staff is great and service is prompt.",
