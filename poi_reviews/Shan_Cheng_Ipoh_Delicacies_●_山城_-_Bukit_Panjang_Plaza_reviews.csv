M S,2,"We wanted to try Ipoh Hor Fun and this seems to be the only option around Bukit Panjang. We ordered 3 different styles of Hor Fun and Noodles for a broader perspective of this restaurant. Our collective conclusion is this restaurant is not worth the visit until improvements are made. The Hor Fun Soup tasted bland and diluted. The Hor Fun Dry comes with a separate bowl of soup and that is also diluted. For relative comparison, the noodle dishes here are average food court standard but at a premium price. As for the service, I'd expect a restaurant (this is not a food court) selling at a higher price to offer better customer service. As we walked in and asked for a table, the staff directed us backward to the entrance pointing to a pile of menus and telling us to come back to the counter for our order. No, they're not rude, just want to point out this is not a service-oriented restaurant. They could have continued with the flow to have us seated, brought along the menus, and then explained their ordering process. There were 4 staff total and we were the only table on a Monday at 5pm! No excuse for being too busy for better customer service. Food is ordered in person over the counter, paid on the spot (credit card accepted) and a device is provided that will buzz when our order is ready for pickup. When I asked (not demanding) for tissue, their reply was we don't offer tissues in a tone and expression that made me feel like I was asking a silly question. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Other than a clean dining area, can't think of other positives to recommend this restaurant.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100159686121737501481/reviews

Victor Chua,4,"Overall not bad..
Ordered the dry wanton noodles.
Noodles texture is good, wanton skin is thin and soft with some prawn in the filling as well..quite good.
Char Siew can be improved though.
Pineapple egg tart was quite good too. Coffee is ok.
No service charge, no GST.
Can try if u have craving for noodles if u are around this area.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107140069147357421405/reviews
Koh Sing Tan,5,The food here are great. I usually love to order the ipoh prawn mee soup which has a rich taste. Ipoh dry curry noodles is a good try - highly recommend if you have not tried dried curry. The new menu now also has egg tarts.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118218302551522725979/reviews
marcus choong,3,"Looks promising when I by pass it. Went there 2 weeks ago. Char Siew was charred and dry. The chicken was like old school canteen style, boiled and bland in taste. Just normal taste, no where near ipoh style. The whole ""ipoh"" thing is just a marketing gimmick. Staff friendly though.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103371235358466646821/reviews
