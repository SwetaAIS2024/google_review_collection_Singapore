BeholdHim,5,"We thoroughly enjoyed our meals here. The dum mutton was super tender and delicious. The staff recommended chicken on a hot plate and if you like the wok smell, it will be a palatable dish for you. Fried cauliflower was also a good recommendation but if you don‚Äôt like fried food, do give it a miss. The papadam served was fragrant too. For the chicken, I would recommend you skip the dum chicken and go for the chicken Bryani instead as it also comes with few side vegetables. I find the dum chicken not overwhelming and prefer the bryani version. The place is well ventilated, spacious and cool. Service was friendly especially an elderly service lady who was smily and approachable. Definitely one of my favourite Indian fare restaurants.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107790882829972143902/reviews
Sharmila Melissa,5,"We ordered Satti Sorru (Claypot Rice and Curry) for my mum's Birthday Lunch from Shami Banana Leaf. And I was totally BLOWN AWAY by this Prawn Satti Sorru from their branch in Sembawang!!! LOOK at the number of big prawns in this dish (more prawns were hidden below the rice too)!!!!! VERY VERY GENEROUS. It was also so very VERY TASTY. It was a little too spicy though. I could just about tahan but I wish it didn‚Äôt pack that much of a punch ü§™. I think that's why they included a pack of Raita (yoghurt) to quell the spiciness. Anyway, I'll definitely buy from them again. It was really REALLY GOOD!!! üëçüèº‚ù§Ô∏è",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111104784040701291236/reviews

Zhan Hong,5,"Shami Banana Leaf never fails to impress! Back for the second time, and the food was outstanding once again. The curry fish head was bursting with flavor‚Äîperfectly cooked, rich, and satisfying. Their nasi briyani is equally amazing, with fragrant rice and tender, flavorful meats that leave you craving more.

The quality and consistency of their food are simply top-notch, making it a place I‚Äôll keep coming back to. Highly recommend Shami Banana Leaf for anyone looking for authentic and delicious dishes. Truly one of the best!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107693607034683476639/reviews
Sarah Zo√´,4,"Was introduced to this family business place near Chong Phang as having yummy food. It‚Äôs quiet place and spacious. May need to walk a bit from Chong Phang but easily accessible by bus. Felt the prices were reasonable too.

The butter chicken & palek paneer had generous and well-seasoned. Their naan is crispy and best eaten hot. Would come back to try their other dishes.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113842195210282880100/reviews
