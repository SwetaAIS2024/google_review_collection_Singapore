      "text": "I first went to The Straits Eye Centre for a comprehensive eye checkup. Since I'm approaching mid-life, I thought it was time to do one. üòÅ  The clinic staff was very warm and friendly. Dr Jayant was very thorough in doing the examination and found something that needed attending to. I ended up doing a day procedure there that day. I really appreciated the simple explanation of my condition and that they gave me time and space to consider whether to do the procedure or not, and to work out my insurance coverage. In the whole process, they are genuinely caring and want the best for their patients. I highly recommend this clinic for anyone who needs eye care. Be prepared for the visit to take up to 2 hours though. The pre-consultation checks and tests do take time.",
