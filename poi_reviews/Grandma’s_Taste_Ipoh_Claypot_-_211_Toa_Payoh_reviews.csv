Chan Lovynn,1,"Ordered via Foodpanda, and it was disappointing. The portion sizes were ridiculously small for the price. I paid $5.60 for the few pieces of lettuce in the photo below. I felt like I barely got half of what I expected. Not worth the money at all. The pork trotter vinegar was practically just selling bones and cloves of garlic.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103258815484805000737/reviews
CK,5,Ordered from foodpanda about sgd 27. Moment I opened the plastic bag nice fragrance oozes out. Believe it's the small size fried vegetable tempura with prawns. Slight crispy n v tasty. The sesame oil chicken tasted nice not overpowering. Soup is on the sweet but prawns v fresh. Love the home cook taste.

Mandy lim,4,"Ordered twice from Foodpanda. The food is great and portion is not consistent i guess. But i cant determine, as we only ordered twice. First time, the portion is big easily each dish fits 1-1.5 person. Second order , portion is smaller, fit 1 small eater. Both ordered for Lunch.

We have tried some of their main dishes and side dishes.

Mains :
Pig's Stomach Chicken Soup - Nice, perfect for cold weather. Comes with 1 drumstick and some pig's stomach. Portion wise just nice for 1 pax.

Sesame Oil Chicken - Nice, not too spicy and sesame oil smells so good ! Can try !

Herbal Prawn - Prawn is fresh , soup is good ! Guess it's the same base as lala herbal soup, very refreshing ! But we are very thirsty after having this , not sure if it's the msg or not. But we will order this dish again too!

Vinegar Pig trotters - Portion is big and super yummy! It's not too sour , and pig trotters is fatty & meaty type. Comes with an egg.  Will order this again for sure !

Side :
Chili Crab Bao - Deep Fried Bun with Chili Crab meat fillings , so-so , filling is little but tasty and spicy. Oily as it's deep fried.
Veg Fritters - Woow , this is good. Will be better if we had it on the spot, as we order through delivery, it's alittle soggy. It's mini-sized , with a onion ring to shape it.
Veg - Normal , can eat.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111977413863264695979/reviews
