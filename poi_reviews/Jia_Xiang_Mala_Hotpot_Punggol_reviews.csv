Jeff,1,"Ate there multiple times and found the food to be average. But felt lazy and decided to order their grilled fish.

Guess how they packed the fish. See photo. Gross. It was put directly into a plastic bag without any other cover. Not even a paper towel.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101763540896756605183/reviews
Alfred ho,3,"Order 2 x grilled fish for 4 adults and 2 childs. Loads of ingredients unlike other shops. Comes with x 2 bowl rice. $23.90. 3 types of flavour. Non spicy to mala spicy. Fresh fish and good texture. Solid fuel to keep food warm. No top up for the soup but ample for a meal. Could not even finish the meal.  I would not said that the gravy is great but it's still great value for the price you pay. If you are looking for budget chongqing grilled fish, look no further. This is the place for you!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111847154516022642987/reviews

Ming,4,Ordered on foodpanda pickup. Food ready for pickup within 10mins as shown in app. Generous portion. Mild spicy mala was not spicy. Probably go for spicy onwards next time. Taste was pretty okay.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109226628464118431877/reviews
