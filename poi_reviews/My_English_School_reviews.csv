saz noor,5,"We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Teacher Lynette and all the teachers who have taught my son. My son attends every Saturday, and over time, we've seen a significant improvement in his English skills, which has helped him in his primary school performance. We are truly grateful for all the teacher's patience and commitment.

Not forgetting the front counter team, who have always been friendly, helpful, and efficient.

Overall, this school has provided a nurturing environment for my son's growth and development in English, and I couldn't be more pleased with his progress. Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104363829357840995350/reviews
Lorraine Tan,5,Teacher Lynette is very patient. My son and niece love her lessons. Administrator Nia is also very helpful and knowledgeable when sharing about the curriculums that My English School offers. Its been almost 4 years since my son last joined and he has been progressing well although we did not do much revision with him at home.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109905768537275427329/reviews
you decide,1,"Customer service lady at counter can’t make it. No passion in kids. Always black face. Teacher not patience enough. Dangerous location as toilet is very far & no teacher or not even the customer service will bring kids to go washroom. Escalator & carpark is just next to it too. Kids can run in & out but no teacher or customer service to monitor, gate to secure. Documents never deliver even after promise, got to remind. Call also never answer. Bad experience.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114665039551318977156/reviews
Vera Bunawan,1,"Regret sending my child to MES DTE. Classes not catered to her level, and she was promoted despite being not ready. Worse still, teachers could not slow down the syllabus despite having some kids in the class who were not being able to catch up. My child couldn’t cope and she ended up feeling fearful going to classes and started to dislike English. Don’t even think about reaching out to the management for feedback. They are practically non responsive. Front desk staffs not helpful too. Definitely Not a positive experience.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102873968321821107630/reviews
Asmah Bte Ansor,5,"Used to send my 2 older kids here and now sending my two younger ones. Special thanks to Teacher Shelly for her dedication in teaching both my kids. I have seen a lot of improvement and overtime building more confidence in them. Other teachers who have taught them before like Tcr Amanda, Tcr Calvin, Tcr Lynette.... special thanks to you too. To Nia, the lady who is sitting at the front desk,  tq for always being accommodating especially when it comes to make up classes and looking after them when I'm running late during pick up. Never regret sending them here.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111478178445562865556/reviews
