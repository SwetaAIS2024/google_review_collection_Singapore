Sylvia C.,5,"This is my second time visiting L'éclair Pâtisserie, and I’m still as impressed as I was the first time! The high tea set is absolutely delightful, with a wonderful selection of teas and delicious treats. The eclairs that come with the set are a standout—perfectly balanced and not overly sweet, which is a relief since sometimes desserts can feel overwhelming.

The ambiance is always cozy and inviting, making it the perfect spot for a relaxing afternoon. Every visit has been consistently enjoyable, and I can't wait to return! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a top-notch high tea experience.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112906101719032663836/reviews
Kevin (AussieFoodieAdventures),5,"The eclairs were heavenly. The dark chocolate had a lovely rich chocolate cream topped with three chocolate streusels (choc balls) which gave it a nice crunch. The salter caramel was delightfully sweet and salty, very well balanced flavor. A lovely afternoon tea pitstop. I did notice their pasta lunch menu which looked and smelled delicious so will be back for the next round of reviews.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107203837341723663240/reviews

🍵 The afternoon tea Set – Lexperience Delight 🍰

I ordered the Lexperience afternoon tea Set, and OMG, it was absolutely worth it! 😍

Only $48 for 2 people, and trust me, it’s more than enough! Super filling and beautifully presented, like a piece of art. 🎨💖

✔️ 3 selection of delicate eclairs—so adorable and colorful! 😍

Each bite was a perfect balance of sweetness and creaminess. 🍫🍓

✔️ Flaky, buttery pastries that simply melt in your mouth! 🥐✨

✔️ Freshly baked scones, served with blueberry jam—pure perfection! 🥰🍯

💁‍♂️ Service & Atmosphere 🌿

The staff are super friendly and welcoming! 🥰 However, I felt that the Indian server could have explained the pastries a little better—it would have made the experience even more special. But overall, service was warm and attentive. 🤗

The ambiance is top-notch—quiet, relaxed, and perfect for a cozy date, a catch-up session with friends, or even some peaceful me-time. 💕📖

Colin,5,"Very pretty looking eclairs, good as gifts. But a bit pricey (probably because of the presentation).

Taste wise, have a decent variety of flavours.

They also sell tiramisu and other hot meals if you arent just looking for desserts.

Each eclair is 9 dollars",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112477726864016792635/reviews
