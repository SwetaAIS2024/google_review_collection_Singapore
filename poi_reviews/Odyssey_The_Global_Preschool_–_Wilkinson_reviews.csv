Joey Ong,5,A wonderful preschool whom i entrust my kids to. The school has an open concept where parents can pick up our children directly from their classrooms any time of the day while keeping the campus safe and secure at the same time. This transparency is a major plus in making us feel assured our children are well taken care of and is a key factor in our decision to enrol my daughter. Respect is a core learning in odyssey as children are taught both self-respect and to respect others. The sprawling open space in the campus is a cherry on top the cake.,12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104443727703216869139/reviews
Nicola Coreno,5,"Both my kids Luke and Liam attended Odyssey Wilkinson since the Bambino class. As parent I am extremely happy about the school. Super friendly environment, teachers are friendly and competent. The ration kid-teacher is perfect. The campus is just ideal. But the best feedback I can give is that both my kids love to attend school. They are excited every morning and sad in the evening when I pick them up. I can see daily progress and their Chinese is impressive (according  to my wife … since I don’t understand anything). Kids are challenged with lots of activities to keep their interest high. Their overall knowledge improves every day.  I can definitely suggest the school to any one.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105518013164275258240/reviews
