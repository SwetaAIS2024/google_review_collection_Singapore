Andy Liew,5,One of the better Zi char places that sell JB/Malaysian/Cantonese style food. This salted egg JB style pan fried bee hoon set me back 7 dollars without being too jelak and I am still able to taste the salted egg flavor. I wish the bee hoon could be more flavorful but nevertheless I think it is a creative and not bad eat Zi char dish.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103601839339673088383/reviews
