sho wa,2,"There is one Indian staff who is rude and has no patience to kids. She will show her unhappy face to the kids, not friendly at all. She even told my 5 -year old child that he is not allowed to borrow the books in the shelf of books for 10 years old. Absolute nonsense !",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117743435171475794812/reviews
Explore with K!,5,"The library is not too crowded. The maximum duration you can stay is 2 hours continuous and if you want to stay longer, you need to check-out and check-in again due to Covid-19 safe distance measures which I believe is understandable.
