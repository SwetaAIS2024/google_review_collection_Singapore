euh Hue,5,"Having found a nice vegetarian stall in this block is awesome. Love their Thunder Rice, full of assortment veggies to heal our guts. The soup/basil herbs tea is packed with flavour and aroma of herbs. Not overpowering and a delight to my palate. This stall is my every Sunday favourite when I visit this area. ðŸ’š",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109103138674584124984/reviews

æ¬£ä½©,5,"I really like their watercress soup & PumpkinShitake mushroom rice...Their soup is really less oily, with lots of watercress options, + the fragrant pumpkin and mushroom rice, and you can enjoy a relatively reasonable set price of $6. In addition, the vegetarian meat is also very well marinated, very delicious! I went there for three consecutive days and it was closed. I thought it was closed on the 7th-9th, but it was still closed when I went there today, and the note was gone, so sad... ...ðŸ¥² I really â™¡ their watercress soup & PumpkinShitake mushroom rice...Their soup is really less oily due to vegetarian meat options, & their portions for vegetables like Watercress is generous. Refillable too I was told the other time I visited, with pumpkin rice we can get an affordable price of $6. This stall's really 1 of my affordable comfort meal go-to-spots in Tpy yet I have been there for the last 3 days & didnt see it open:""( Really sad it's closed, hope it can open again some day!!ðŸ¥¹",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108649182116922429991/reviews
