      "text": "The SUTD Fabrication Lab is literally a one stop centre for students to realise their project ideas. Now while this is a one stop fabrication cum machining cum 3D printing space, don't expect professional grade products. It is meant to produce prototypes but if a pro grade product does roll out, it only speaks of the effort the student has shown.\nThere a host of tools and equipment available, from specialised water jet cutters to laser cutters. The 2 storeyed lab is sectioned into metal work, wood work and an open space area for general work.\nSafety is of the utmost importance hence you'll find fab lab staff easily available and willing to assist students so that accidents can be prevented.\nLocated in a central part of the campus, it is accessible 24hrs for students to work on their ideas and projects.\nThis is a university facility and hence, only staff and students have access.\nFor the general public, keep a lookout for SUTD's Open House. During this event, the public can access the Fab Lab and be treated to souvenirs crafted in-house by the Fab Lab staff.",
