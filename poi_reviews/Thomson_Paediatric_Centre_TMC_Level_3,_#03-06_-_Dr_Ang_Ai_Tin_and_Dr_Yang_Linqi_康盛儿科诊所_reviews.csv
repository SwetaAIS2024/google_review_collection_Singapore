Nikki Grace Guo,5,"Our son has been failing sick ever so often after starting preschool and we are thankful to have Dr Ang as our PD. I’ve not met another PD as experienced, passionate and responsible as Dr Ang. We once had to admit our son in the middle of the night and Dr Ang came to our rescue at 5am. It’s reassuring to know that she’s a PD we can count on and we will continue to rely on her expertise for our second child. Not to forget, she has a great team with her at the clinic as well as level 4 ward, who are able to provide the best service to help your child recover.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108967764764415935486/reviews
Africa Hart,4,"I absolutely love Dr Ang and her accompanying nurse, they are so good at what they do. The front desk staff are also very helpful and polite. There used to be some quite rude staff worked there but she thankfully seems to have gone. The bad part is the waiting time, I think after 6 months it could be better to transfer to a different pediatrician if you are short of time.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116859402553897363382/reviews
Auror Yin,5,Dr Ang is one of the very few doctors who allow us to walk in even at the last hour before closure. Other clinics will have a cut - off time and I ever experienced one where the clinic was supposed to be open till 1pm but they cut off at 11am. Of course we should be mindful not to rush in very close to the closing time. Anyway! Just want to really thank Dr Ang for being the steady presence we need especially when our little ones are not well and we feel so anxious. Thank you to Dr Ang and team!,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109563154620994446695/reviews
jewel,5,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

We have been with Dr. Ang Ai Tin since the birth of both our sons, and I can't express how grateful we are for the care and expertise she has provided over the years. After my son turned 1 year old, the wait time often stretches to 2 hours, but it's always worth it because we know we're in the best hands. Dr. Ang's dedication to her patients is unmatched—she always knows exactly what to do, no matter how challenging the situation.

I also want to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the wonderful nurses at Thomson Paediatric Centre, Level 3. Their kindness, patience, and professionalism make every visit a little easier, especially during those anxious moments when our little ones are unwell. They go above and beyond to ensure every child is comfortable and every parent feels supported.

Thank you, Dr. Ang, and all the amazing nurses, for your unwavering commitment to our sons' health and well-being. We feel incredibly fortunate to have you all as our trusted healthcare team!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112896326579986858357/reviews
Chong Yang Chan,5,"I cannot speak highly enough of the exceptional care we received at this pediatrician clinic. From the moment we stepped in, we were greeted warmly by Sister. She has a calming presence and a genuine way of connecting with children that immediately put my little one at ease. Her patience, warmth, and professionalism made us feel truly cared for every step of the way.

Dr. Ang was equally impressive, demonstrating a perfect blend of expertise, compassion, and attentiveness. She took the time to listen to our concerns, thoroughly explained his recommendations, and made sure we felt confident in our child’s treatment plan. Dr. Ang’s reassuring demeanor and deep knowledge made the entire visit stress-free for both us and our child.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101137064833507554028/reviews
