Stable Mr (조's family 세계일주),1,"Very unfriendly and arrogant. This is a family migration with children, and all family members ne by one were asked to submit a migration registration.
They didn't keep paper form, and my young daughter had to start by creating an email account.
Meanwhile, my bus had already left and my trip to Malaysia had begun as a nightmare.
Of the 20 countries I've traveled to, this is the worst border.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115328937929622834787/reviews
bharath mamillapalli,1,Staff is not friendly and unprofessional. Closing the counters on face and shouting on passengers to move to other counters instead of explaining better. Immigration department gives the first impression of country and culture they should be more careful as they are damaging reputation of malaysia.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114513770365900808215/reviews
Tamil Harasu,1,"To Whome Concerns,

I'm queries on few things that I always see  during the Clearence at Imigresen (2nd Link). Most of the time, I realised that more then 3/4 officers handling a single X-Ray machine.They will sit and having chit-chat and even not focus on screen. Do they know what they searching for actually? This custom building is having a very limited space for long queue and why the officers don't have alternative option to clear the bag checking process ?

As a Malaysian I'm worried, how the foreigners will look on this situation ? Do we in the Worst Imigresen System List on Earth ? Our imigresen system should be easy to everybody. Officer's must take initiative to clear the crowd. Same goes to Superior officers those on duty. Please do something when the crowd is big.

Please work together , show the world how superb is Malaysia Imigresen System  is doing. For the moment its not happening.

Only when Menteri give suprise visit the Clearence processes  become 5 star.

Please give your people a better quality and customer service .

Prasun Parashar,1,"Leaving Malaysia was the worst part of the experience. Somebody named Amira who was supposed to help with immigration, wanted our child to go on to a separate counter. Mind you, he is 6 year old.

Absolutely rude and some lacking basic decency is being allowed at a place like this is a disgrace and Malaysia should take some corrective actions on this.

If US immigration is toughest, Malaysia in my experience, has got be rudest. If this isnt the case in general and only with this individual(Amira) then she should be put through some basic trainings.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116772719374632003404/reviews
Viperon,1,"Very bad checkpoint service, moved like 20m in 1 hour, you can see a lot of families taking their children to the toilet already. And there’s somehow a hole in the barricade separating the 2 directions of roads, further worsening the jam because people can u-turn back to the checkpoint.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101924859980413873874/reviews
