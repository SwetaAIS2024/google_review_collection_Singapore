      "text": "Service has gone downhill and no longer a mom-and-pop shop after the proprietor retired, and while still owning the shop, now employs workers. Pretty standard transactional experience. Also seen customer quarrel with the shop assistants until police came. The shop also closes early now, so no selling point to go in times of needs. No good reason to support these type of local shops if the service, price and stock are no better than the larger chains or online retailers.",

      "text": "Wandered there by chance while looking for an electrical shop to buy an extension socket.\n\nAt first glance it seemed like a random mini mart (or mama shop) that sold basic necessities or groceries. But to my amazement, this mart held so much! Prices were good and could even compete to online shopping prices for electrical stuff.\n\nWhat I loved the most about this place?\n\nIt felt so homely. Customers walking in and out were mostly regulars that came in with huge grins and such positive vibes.\n\nUncle Yap caught me staring at the electrical section and offered his help. It ended up with demos on how the lights or electricals looked like! He was approachable and knowledgeable, nuff' said!\n\n:)",

Since she load it already they say I can do anything even tho I’m not the one who load it. It’s the girl! . Please make this right! You might lose good customers.

Printed a sample to see if it's alright before i proceed to print the rest of my items. Apparently, sample is correct. However, with the same settings (did not click on others), the rest of the print out turn to be in the wrong position. The shop owner told me can't pause/stop and i have to pay for the wrong prints. I felt scammed.",
