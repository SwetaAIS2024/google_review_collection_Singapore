Service is very very lousy and I can't believe they still can survive.",

This very rude woman > You are lucky i never get the chance to take down your name because too angry with your rudeness and tone of voice! Who are you to talk to me like that kind of tone! Please Management, go and send your coordinator to CUSTOMER SERVICE COURSE or even more better go and send your coordinator to ANGER MANAGEMENT COURSE! Please have some respect! Nonsense!",

However, I decided to give them a shot and was pleasantly surprised. I called for an hour service and the customer service representative who took my order was helpful and patient when I asked for the pricing. My order was delivered before the 1 hour mark and I was given a call by the dispatch rider when my order was delivered (as requested by me). Will definitely use them again.",

My company have been using them for many years , frankly there is no 100% perfect but to me, they are reliable team. If they canâ€™t make it , they will call to arrange for a better solution. Hopefully courier are given a set of good quality raincoat as our weather are bad at times. Thanks team for the great service!",
