Rizal Nasir,5,"Working with Cornelius has been a real pleasure in terms of communication, transparency and fulfilment. If not for his suggestion, I would not have improved on my initial logo design. Also, the second picture is the sample patch shown to me which he insisted will be improved upon to bring up the quality of the wording.

I will definitely be coming back to Transcope for future restocks and new patch designs!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111447179071551242707/reviews
