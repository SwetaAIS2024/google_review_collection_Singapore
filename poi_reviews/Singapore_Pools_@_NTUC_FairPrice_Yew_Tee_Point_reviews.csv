General Twilight,5,Very long queues were spotted here during weekends. There are many times when the queues extended into the grocery section of the store. It is hard to walk through this queue and it is very crowded. This makes it hard for the shoppers to get their groceries on weekend. It is recommended to write your 4d before going there to save time as the writing place is also very crowded.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114314523990529053400/reviews
