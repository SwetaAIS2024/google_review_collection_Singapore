      "text": "It was my friend‚Äôs second visit as he loves kacang pool. I decided to get tahu goreng. At first glance, the stall‚Äôs menu is quite limited. However, I rather stalls focus on their strength instead of having many dishes but it‚Äôs not nice. Kacang pool was nice and flavourful. Spice used is slightly different but it worked for the dish. Tahu goreng here is also slightly different. Tofu is not fully fried and it‚Äôs still soft and served hot. Peanut sauce balance is just perfect. Not too spicy or sweet. I requested for more taugeh hence it looked ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù. Really enjoyed the light meals ordered around this stall.",

It's the place to go when you think of Kacang pool. Served hot with sunny side up egg, cut green chilli and french bread.
