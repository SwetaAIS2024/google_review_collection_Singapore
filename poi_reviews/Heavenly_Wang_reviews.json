      "text": "I stopped by Heavenly Wang at Mount Faber to grab a quick coffee while waiting for Kitty.  I have a fond memory of their tea – some of the best I've had, back when I was hospitalized.  The tea in the hospital cafe was truly remarkable, with a strong aroma and a richness that reminded me of Ya Kun's coffee.\n\nThis time, I decided to try their coffee instead.  While it wasn't bad, I found it a bit less fragrant than Ya Kun's, which remains my favorite.  I ordered the coffee and Yuan Yang soft bread at $4.90, but the bread was just okay and unfortunately not warm. The set (coffee and Yuan Yang soft bread) cost $6.50.\n\nThe atmosphere was alright, but the enclosed space felt a bit warm.  The service was fast and efficient.\n\nOverall, it was a decent experience.  While I wasn't overly impressed with the coffee and bread, if you're waiting for someone at Mount Faber, Heavenly Wang is still a decent option.  They have ample seating, so it's a good spot for a cup of coffee or tea. Alternatively, you can also check out the food court just beside the establishment.",

      "text": "Heavenly Wang has this habit of having their food not available even in afternoon especially during a promotion.  It happened to me a few years ago before covid during a NDP promotion voucher.  Food no more in afternoon at Punggol safra.  This happened to me again 2 Sep 2024 a this branch for their safra fifty cents promotion.  Arrived at 3 pm but Porridge no more.  The Malay ladies were generally friendly and broke the news to me.  I came again before 9 am on 3 Sep 2024 and managed to order.  With barely any customer at this timing service was fast.  The Porridge was above average.  The youtiao was quite dense and firm.  My low star was a reflection of my unhappiness to waste my transport money, effort and time to come here twice just to use voucher.",

Rice was half cooked.\nTray return cabinet was full of dirty cutlery  and house flies.\nIt's an extremely unpleasant experience dining here.",

      "text": "For our Saturday lunch, we decided to tryout Heavely Wang’s local food ordered via foodpanda since had a welcome voucher to use. We ordered mee rebus, laksa, mee Siam and ayam masak Manis yellow rice. The packaging of each dish was packed well. Taste was really good especially the Laksa (lush gravy) and chicken rice (tender grilled chicken). And presentation of the food was good with each items placed nicely in each pack. For the price paid, this is definitely a reasonable choice versus other similar cafes. However, their tea was rather disappointing. Somehow it had a weird taste which my hubby and I did not enjoy. Overall will definitely try again minus the tea.",
