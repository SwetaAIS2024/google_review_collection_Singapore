ZHU XIAN2,1,"Instead of spending the time to read all reviews and reject those you don’t deem fit, you should review your external suppliers! What kind of response is this? This particular supplier always lists their bedding at great pricing; I’ve tried to order several times - none of it was successful, all refunded. Joke.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104081735037645133862/reviews
Loh Pebbie,1,"What kind of supermarket is this? Even baby wipes can be out of stock! And yes, often chicken soup and pork soup bones are out of stock too... so much for helping citizens

Advertised at website ... frozen ora salmon, very small piece at over 30$.... and look at what was delivered!!!???
A very wet dripping small piece which dropped to the floor.... so NOT FROZEN AND NOT SEALED...
How professional or ethical is this?
And NO response at all to my claim online despite photo unlike when it is 2 or 3$ for rotten vegetables...
So yes, fairprice or cheatprice is most unethical, unprofessional n there to cheat not serve

E Yeo,1,"I am totally upset with how this national flagship store NTUC FairPrice handles my online delivery with missing items on 9 January 2025, made several reports with no avail, the amount of order was deducted from my bank account.

Last night resort to go live chat, with a promise for re-delivery today, but no email confirmation, and I don't have any where to look for the live chat guy.

Went to live chat again just now, got a different guy, promise to work on this and get back to me asap, then he left the chat 7 minutes later.

It is so time consuming having to type the whole incident again and again, having to make myself stay home to wait for the no-show re-delivery when asked to give a date/time slot several time.

Its 2 weeks, and the case remains unsolved, with many frustration of making reports, time wasted and angers built up!

NTUC Fairprice - when are you going to solve my case?",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109259645286869632319/reviews
