J,4,"IMPORTANT NOTE!!! I was informed that they would be closing in May 2025, if you are considering visiting , please call and confirm they are open

Visited joe(which is owner and cook) kitchen on a random weekday night for dinner

Which such great reviews on Google, one would expect a queue during dinner time. Instead there was only 1 other diner when I visited the place. My partner says itâ€™s looks deserted and we should go somewhere else. I persisted

Service was absolutely stunning. Waitress was kind and polite, much more so then 5 star Michelin restaurants

Atmosphere was cosy

Letâ€™s talk about food , Tom yam soup was absolutely stunning. Blend of spicies dancing in your mouth. It was neither overly spicy nor overly sour, it was a perfect blend. 5/5

Red curry chicken looks nice on picture but was rather disappointing. Curry was really sweet 1/5

Kang Kong tasted fresh and crunchy but nothing much to shout. But this is to be expected. I wonâ€™t recommend this dish as it was too over priced for what you are getting. 2/5

For all of above and 2 tea costed $40+",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108768756751918202716/reviews
Victoria Phan,4,Came here on Monday night 9pm for late dinner. Service was very fast but could be because I was the only customer at that time. I was dining alone so didnâ€™t want to order too much. Got the thai fried vermicelli and thai milk tea. Milk tea was not too sweet and vermicelli was not too oily or salty. Chef was also quite generous with adding chicken and egg. Interested to come back and try more dishes,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117655783793863513936/reviews
khanh linh,4,"Weâ€™re back after few years. Overall the foods still as nice as before. Mango salad and steam fish are nicest, sweet and sour enough. The fried tang hoon will be nicer if dry more. I walked pass by the kitchen area while went toilet and noticed the washing place is not hygiene, and the restaurant looks old. Price consider a bit high compared to others (not food courts / hawker)",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106052650711284514899/reviews
Cheyenne Chong,3,"food was decent however there are better options out there. ordered the pineapple rice, honey chicken, garlic pork, prawn cakes,baby kai lan and tom yum soup. the garlic pork and pineapple rice were mediocre only. was given 2 complimentary red ruby for fatherâ€™s day, kind gesture from the staff, thank you! ðŸ˜Š",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103260467298764623465/reviews
CK C,4,Mango salad is probably the best that I have ever tried - thinly sliced with the right texture (between ripe and unripe mangoes) and balanced taste (not too spicy). Tofu soup was not bad. Claypot prawn vermicelli was generous in portion with six large prawns but the taste was rather one-dimensional. Service was OK. The restaurant was quite messy inside so the ambience was almost non existent.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
