Forest BK,4,"🪵Nature Playgarden at Tampines Boulevard Park East is a log-themed children play area.
🧗The log play area is sand filled, so children can play with sand as well.
🧺There are chain swings where older children can enjoy swinging.
🌿Presently, all the the newly planted surrounding trees are still young and cannot provide shade yet.
☀️So, best is to visit during morning or evening hours.
⛱️The Nature Playgarden is located on gentle slope near the Park's south entrance.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
