Kirsten Wong,5,"Yvette is a great vocal teacher. She is very experienced not just in singing but in teaching as well. She is able to use different techniques to help improve my singing - techniques that I have not learnt before from other singing workshops that I've been to.

Yvette has taught me to achieve what I thought I couldn't do! :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111836859404832588139/reviews
Christine Monod,5,"I’ve been taking lessons with Yvette for nearly two years now. She really helped me change the way I was singing, taught me how to open my throat, position my palate and use my core muscles to get more power. Sometimes I am very suprised at the fact I can belt high notes.
Yvette is very profesional and a pleasant teacher, and the fact she performs as a live singer all the time make her advice so relevant and to the point.
I very much recommend her.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111180557976103258400/reviews
Reii Himeko,5,"I have been taking classical voice lessons from Ms Yvette since Year 2013. Ms Yvette is a patient and approachable teacher who is versatile in various singing styles. She is able to tailor class content according to your preferences and goals. (Whether it is for examination, audition, leisure).  Classes are fun and fulfilling. It is an enjoyment to attend her private class. I have improved my singing from beginner to a diploma level. It was a rewarding journey. This includes tonal control, pitch, managing a good sounding vibrato, proper breathing and support, aural, sight-singing skills. I am grateful and contented with the outcome of my singing after years of lessons with her.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115819154599001027068/reviews
James K,5,"Yvette is not only a great singer herself, she is also very passionate about teaching and doing her best to help all her students unlock their singing potential.

Through the progressive vocal exercises and techniques she taught, I have found great improvement in the resonance and tone of my singing. These proper singing techniques have also resulted in eliminating all nasal-ness from my voice which I was previously struggling heavily with.

Don’t hesitate anymore and contact her today if you are looking for a great vocal coach! Thank you Yvette for being patient and understanding throughout my journey with you!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114607678620089258852/reviews
Sharad Ramachandra,5,"As a musical theatre actor, I’ve had a handful of singing coaches over the years (both in the UK and Singapore), and it is no exaggeration to say that the progress I’ve made with Yvette has made the other (while lovely people) coaches seem like amateur.

If you wanted to start singing, for whatever reason, do yourself a favour and give Yvette a shot. You won’t regret it, I definitely didn’t!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111068819515725853890/reviews
