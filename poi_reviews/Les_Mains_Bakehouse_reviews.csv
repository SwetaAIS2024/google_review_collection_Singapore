Hammad,5,"Such a quiet gem in a great neighborhood! My go to spot for amazing breakfast everytime- so many options for breads and portions are just nice, everything was fresh and full of flavor. The coffee was fantastic, and the staff made the whole experience even better with their warm and friendly service.
They don't have a lot of options for drinks and main courses yet.
Parking is hard to find so you'll have to find roadside parking and walk here
Can't wait to come back. Definitely one of my favorite spots in Singapore!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105672960530428867999/reviews
Pinaki Ray,5,"Small little cute place. Every single slice of bread, and pastry is baked with love & affection. Service is just awesome and nice and homely.
Turkish egg & Focaccia bread varieties are my favourite.
Will be back soon.

Li koon,5,Along Jalan Tua Kong. There are some parking lots in front of the shophouse but can be tricky tp find an empty lot. There are indoor seats and a larger outdoor area. The fan is powerful and it does not feel overly hot outside. Waffle is great. There are many ice cream flavours to choose from. The watermelon flavour is good. Good coffee to go along as well.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103194300749984878407/reviews
Adrian Chan,4,"Nice small cafe with outdoor seats if you have pets. Came on a weekend lunch time and it was almost fully packed, but fortunately we could still get a table. Lunch menu is considered rather limited (and item do not come with sides), but they do offer many pastries. Personally, I like the burger with its handmade patty, but the patty seems to break off too easily, but not really a big issue. Coffee was quite decent. Overall, price is slightly on the premium side considering the portion. Wouldn't mind going back to try the pastries or if I am looking for lighter bites with coffee.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109957919811943890317/reviews
Richard Claydon,5,"A limited but beautifully realised menu. The Mediterranean Beef Stew is up there with the best stews Iâ€™ve ever eaten. Simply superb. The Turkish Eggs are equally tasty.

Cold Brew coffee was delicately flavoured and Melon Oolong Tea exactly the right level of sweetness.

Highly recommended.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101160893975220081424/reviews
