Hui Qing Lim,5,"MMI Holland Grove has been an excellent preschool, providing a nurturing and well-structured environment for my children. The administrative staff is meticulous, ensuring that every detail is well taken care of, giving me confidence that my kids are in good hands. The teachers are dedicated and committed, providing regular, honest updates on my children’s progress, sharing both strengths and areas for improvement. I also appreciate their differentiated approach to learning, ensuring that students who need extra support receive the help they need, while those who are ready for more challenges are appropriately stretched.

A heartfelt thank you to the teachers and administrative staff for your dedication, patience, and hard work.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107266594329891678346/reviews
meinn AN,5,We have decided to sign up with MMI Holland Grove after the visit as we were impressed with the presentation by the Principal during the school tour. She understands well how Montessori works and able to convince us how Montessori eventually help our kid as compared to typical thematic preschool. The school has given us a warmth impression and the admin’s quick response enhance the overall sign up experience. Our boy has settled down for more than a month and happy going to school. Most importantly he brings back his sharing almost everyday. Thank you the team in MMI Holland Grove.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116414312383951048165/reviews
Andrew Rajkumar,5,"This school is really outstanding. We are a pretty international family – I am Singaporean, my wife is Brazilian and our 5-year old daughter was born in USA – and we have lived in several different places. Our daughter has gone to different preschools in USA, Brazil and Singapore where she attended preschool most recently at MMI Holland Grove. We found this preschool to be of a very high standard comparable to the best international preschools. Their teaching methods are awesome, truly bringing out the Montessori Method. Their teachers have an excellent manner with the kids, and our daughter really liked them, as well as the preschool overall.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108396908248332222741/reviews

Maggie Xue,5,"Relatively authentic Montessori school, the set up and environment is clean and aesthetically pleasing. Curriculum is rich. Teachers have detailed updates on subjects taught. They have 2 diploma Montessori teachers which is a luxury compared to many other alleged Montessori schools. They really know how to teach with positive guidance. My child comes back happy everyday.
Great park in front for outdoor activities.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108676505236768795437/reviews
