Sunny Tan,4,"We stumbled upon this and decided to visit this cafe as the cafe besides starts only at 2pm.

Probably a better option as the food taste good, so was the Honey Oat Latte. Besides food, one might also catch paws in actions, probably if they happened to be roaming around inside the separate area.

Note that this is the ONLY animal friendly cafe in Beauty World.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102106343379730812515/reviews

Jessica Nathania,5,"Nice chill vibes at this cafe! You can also watch the cute meow meows from a distance.

Iced coffee: Was slightly towards the milky side but still decent!

Iced matcha: Too milky for my liking, can give it a miss.

Iced peach tea: I believe it‚Äôs ice shaken. It has a rather big serving. Quite refreshing but nothing to shout about",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111231486275642514006/reviews
