      "text": "Great BBQ stick, flavorful and chewy lamb skewers. When the grill fish was served, I was very impressed with the presentation. A bigger than normal size and fish meat was firm but soup was a bit too sweet than normal. Maybe it is just a different style and not to my likeing. Will be back for more skewer meat. Service staffs was attentive and offered to change the plate that was full of fish bone.\n$30+",

Paired with shedded chicken and bean sprouts. My friend and I wanted the 2nd portions!\nBut too full!\n\nFrench beans and shredded meat water bamboo shot taste very authentic and delicious.\n\nService crews have a few aunties and they are really nice and friendly. Attentiveness to each table, clearing the table promptly.\n\nDefinitely we will come back again, we don‚Äôt have to travel all the way to Chinatown. Environment is quite cosy, it‚Äôs not as noisy as Chinatown hahaha.",
