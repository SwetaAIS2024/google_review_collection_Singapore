Andrew Soh,1,"Frustratingly Slow Lifts - A Persistent Problem at Ngee Ann City

Ngee Ann City boasts a fantastic selection of shops and dining options, making it a go-to destination in Singapore. However, a major pain point consistently detracts from the experience: the excruciatingly slow lifts serving the main shopping levels, which also unfortunately cater to the fitness club on level 8.

These are the core lifts you rely on to navigate the mall, yet waiting for one feels like a test of patience. The problem is particularly acute during peak hours when securing a spot in a lift becomes a battle. You can easily find yourself waiting several minutes, only to have a packed lift whiz past without stopping. This makes moving between floors incredibly frustrating and time-consuming.

This isn't a new complaint; the sluggishness of these particular lifts has been a known issue for a significant period. For a prominent shopping complex like Ngee Ann City, the inefficiency of its primary lift system is a major letdown. It creates unnecessary stress and inconvenience for shoppers, especially those with young children, seniors, or anyone who prefers not to use the escalators.

While the rest of Ngee Ann City offers a great experience, the lift situation desperately needs attention. Investing in an upgrade or a more efficient management system for these key lifts would significantly enhance visitor satisfaction. Until then, be prepared to factor in considerable waiting time when planning to move between floors.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113212484213226386815/reviews
Tayson Tay,5,"Ngee Ann City is the gem of many Singaporeans and tourists alike! I remember coming to this mall when I was very young, the first time visiting a toy exhibition here around 2008. After that, due to my primary and secondary school studies, I did not visit the mall as often. Back in 2021, I started to visit this mall again, this time with more seriousness.

I am amazed at the facilities it provides, making it almost a mini-city as its name suggests heavily. The mall does not feel like a mall but rather, the interior to a luxurious hotel that provides everything for everyone. Similarly, the stores and exhibitions in Ngee Ann City have developed it into a bustling mall that is popular all year round!

The art and uniqueness of this mall is what brings life to the Orchard section of Orchard Road. It seems there is something for every class of Singaporean and tourist alike.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104411331065902255890/reviews
