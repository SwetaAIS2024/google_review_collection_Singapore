eully eully,1,"Bought a jade bracelet in Dec 2022 at Canberra Plaza only wore it once then kept it in a box. Decided to wear it during cny in 2024 so took out the bracelet but we got a shock because the gold turned black. Went to Khatib shop since their Canberra Plaza shop permanently closed. Their staffs who attended to us were nice and professional except that their boss who is rude and very defensive. It is the gold that you need to quality check but why you complain about your customer after they stepped out from your shop? Shame on you, as a boss your service is even worst than your employees. You should go for training on how to be patient when attending to your customers and handle the situation more professionally.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100000689851686775457/reviews

Heidi Koh,4,"Gold price $110 ($2 lower than market rate of $112).
Was served the moment I walked in!
Would be better if staff can inform customer of the promotions available (i.e. linkpoint redemption).
It’s a pity Fraser gift card cannot be redeemed at this shop.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113665515645700606185/reviews
Jill,1,"Went to get ear piercings and I went back for a refund when I noticed they were at a horrible 45 degree angle to my lobe, instead of perpendicular. Then the manager told me there was no refund which ok fine I can accept, but she made up problems about my already existing ear piercings just to minimise her staff’s mess-up. Tbh anyone with eyes can tell the piercing was screwed up, it is THAT obvious. I felt like she was also purposely not understanding what I was trying to say. And she was laughing at me right to my face while I was patiently explaining the problem to her?? I know the difference between laughing to diffuse the situation and laughing to make fun of someone, and her laugh was the latter. I’m young but that doesn’t mean you can disrespect me like that.

Anyone who’s thinking about getting ear piercings here, please don’t. Go to a store that actually specialises in ear piercings and uses a needle instead of a gun. With the needle it’s so much easier for an actual professional to pierce the ear perpendicularly and accurately. This store uses a gun (they call it a system but imo still a gun) and that’s probably why they screwed up my piercing.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104416192353177962919/reviews
Alfred Ong,1,"Bad experience! High gold price.
Stated $119.00 per gram (999)

I bought gold bar 10g, but priced me $1245.

At same day I went to other gold shop at Yishun area, all 4shops quoted me under $1080, exactly the same brand gold bar.

Overpriced!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103840810548838671109/reviews
