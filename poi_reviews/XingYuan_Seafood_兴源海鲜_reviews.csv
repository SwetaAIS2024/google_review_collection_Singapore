Jonathan Lim,1,"We had an extremely disappointing experience at this stall due to the rude and unprofessional behaviour of both the boss and staff. Despite confirming our payment via PayLah!, the boss still keyed in the wrong order and then had the audacity to demand additional payment.

The service was equally appalling. The female staff member carelessly left our takeaway order on the table without informing us, forcing us to check it ourselves. When we requested red and green chili, she impatiently grabbed only green chili from the fridge, showing clear annoyance.

This wasn’t an isolated incident. During our previous visit, a kitchen staff member from China actually yelled at us just for asking for chili. If certain condiments are unavailable, they should be clearly stated, especially for a Zhi Char stall.

With such an arrogant and dismissive attitude, it’s no surprise that this place is losing customers. They are not the only food stall in Fernvale, so it’s baffling why they think they can get away with such poor service. We will certainly not be returning.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114431803259278779481/reviews

cpv green,5,"Good promotion for curry fish head. Tastes good, fish is fresh. The fish head was small, so they added extra fish meat. The fish head curry tastes even better than some other places.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117814917533501177360/reviews
Calvin Perera,1,"Used to be our most fav tze char 富俐煮炒 unfortunately they changed to this. Thought would give it a try, but regret max.

Watan Hor the Kuey Teow is basically not fresh, it dissolves when get into your mouth (not in a good way). Their sweet sour fish is worse, the fish is hard felt like chicken meat (maybe not fresh) and the rice is sticking together like rice balls.

Not to mention there's also increased in price. First and last for us.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112097618386009383427/reviews
