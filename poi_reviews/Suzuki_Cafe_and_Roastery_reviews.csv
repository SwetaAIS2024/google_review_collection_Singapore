Nuraziz Yosokumoro,5,"Truly hidden gems. Pretty little Cafe in between industrial building. We tried signature cold brew V60 Uganda it was good, can feel the difference to normal coffee. The latte also very nice, the milk doesnot dominate the coffee taste, balanced well. Atmospheres and decorations are truly outstanding. Parking is free just in front of cafe.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104092609730015504266/reviews
Andre Karl Misso,4,"This was a gem of a find! Tucked in an industrial area. I’d never expect such a setup. Accessible by bus. Loads of parking space.

Worth the trip!
The zen atmosphere is appealing. It would be less quieter during peak hours. Monitor this information on Google Maps. I’d recommend coming in between peak periods to enjoy the serenity and calm.

The decor gives a soothing ambience. The service crew are friendly and interactive so ask them about the pastries and desserts.

The coffee
It is well balanced. The roast is not acidic. Robust and nutty.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104188194322810086220/reviews
Lorelai D,5,"Decided that today is going to be a drive that will lead to good coffee & what’s in store for me ended up with great coffee and a chill afternoon instead.

Heard about this place at chin bee place with their own roastery, the moment I got out of the car I knew I am at the right place, there are a lot of free parking outside and it was such a nice quiet place.

The theme is Japanese coffee house for sure, every decoration exudes the Japanese vibes.

I opted for Yugen white since it was in the afternoon and spotted a few people that opted for iced matcha as well.

Given how far this place is, was surprised to see many patrons visiting this place, great coffee bring people to places regardless the distance!

The baked look ok to me but the coffee ranges were great, managed to bought a few with me to give to my friends and families.

Such a nice place to chill and do your stuff, highly recommend anyone who want to just spend a nice afternoon with great coffee & a nice drive.

The service staff was also knowledgeable and helpful, got to know more about the coffee too. They also help you to grind the beans so that was helpful. Was told Chowa which is the dark roast and yugen are for espresso while the rest is for filtered coffee so ask the staff if you are unsure what to get in your next visit.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110563036404967613068/reviews
Zoe barber,4,"Tried their sugar-free brownie (topped with my own strawberries), it’s good.
I love their black signature coffee, there’s fruity notes.
It would be a lovely place to do leisure reading. Just that today was kind of a bumper as 2 teams came in to discuss about work after me, which masked the soft music as their voices filled the place.
Service is definitely 5  stars! Friendly with a smile! Ordered take-aways and they are so considerate that they gave a fork and some napkins. And the paper bag is stylish unlike Starbucks. It looks very good for gifting.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104912962264780565735/reviews
Leon Kwang,3,"Had this place pinned for a long time and finally found the opportunity to come here with the kiddo.

The location is a tad secluded, far from the hustle and bustle of life in Singapore. And the first impression into the cafe was the calm/ peaceful Japanese zen decor.

They are probably famed for their drip coffee, which we both decided not to go for, potentially to our regret. As it turned out, the latte and mocha were rather forgetable.. didn't quite leave an impression.

Lastly, the space is not a big one, and in case it gets crowded (if ever), it'll lose the aesthetic/ peaceful appeal. So, I suggest folks to get here during odd timings to enjoy the ambience more.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116326892362989736040/reviews
