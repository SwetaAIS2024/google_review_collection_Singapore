Melissa Lee,1,Almost burnt down the house. My husband was charging his backbeat fit 2100 when he smelt something burning. The headphone and charger was burning. It was a fire hazard because we usually charge our devices next to our bed. We called the support helpline that promised someone would call back but after a few days no one did. It was only after days of calling did they offer us a replacement headset (less than a year) but for that we had to go all the way to Ubi. Something that is no fault of ours.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113432315031630651875/reviews
