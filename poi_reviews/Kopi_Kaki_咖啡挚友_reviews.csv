Cheow Mong Chan,4,"3.5 stars review.
This is a market that we frequent, but 1st time ordered from this stall. Tea/coffee was ok. Toast not too bad also, just the right amount of kaya and butter. Eggs is via hot water. Need to estimate the time (auntie mentioned 7 mins, but think its closer to 8 mins).

Overall good food at good value.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116936834742186304043/reviews
Syndie Yeo,1,Their toast really not nice. They used cheap ‚Äòbutter‚Äô. ‚ÄòButter but tasteless butter. It taste like vegetable oil. U should not even order toast from the stall.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113172044741091687550/reviews
WL T,5,"Used to drive to Westgate to get my fix of teh and eggs at Toast Box or Yakun. But no more after discovering this little gem at a corner of Taman Jurong market.
Teh is creamy and just sweet enough. Not too sweet or bland like what you get in many places.
Eggs come in hot water, allowing you to choose how long you want them to he cooked. My usual is 8 minutes. Other places may be less messy, but leaves you little choice in how runny you want your eggs to be.
I normally eat peanut toast. Toasty and fragrant, but not super thick like Toastbox. Not complaining, as eggs and teh are deal breakers for me.
Best of all, it's only $2.60. I eat so often the auntie recognizes me.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112165343522804253556/reviews
