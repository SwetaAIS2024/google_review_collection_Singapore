Cheryl Cheong,5,"Resilience Clinic is a great place to go to as they have very experienced counsellors. My counsellor Yiling is an extremely experienced and caring counsellor. Unfortunately, she has left but I was handed over to a new counsellor who is just as caring and experienced. Front desk staff is very friendly and efficient.
