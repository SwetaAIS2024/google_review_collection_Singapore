khanh linh,4,"Tried the Dry tom yum koka noodles today, surprisingly the taste is nice, the soup is nice too, but I wish it comes w tomyum soup instead. The pork balls taste a bit strong for me.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106052650711284514899/reviews
GaveUp,1,"Food stalls here are well patronised, ling Qs at few popular stalls.
Unfortunately, lacking seats/tables...
Coffee & drinks here are expensive!

Irene Tan M X,4,"Among all the coffeeshop within Hougang Ave 8, HIGHLY RECOMMEND this coffeeshop the most. Have loads of good, not overly priced food here. Place has airy outdoor seating and divided smoking section.

‚≠êÔ∏è Recommended Stalls: Mixed Rice Cai Png, Vegetarian, Ban Mian, BCM (yummy but can be slightly pricier than other stalls)
‚≠êÔ∏è Kway Chap the most popular, long queue during lunch hours!

Vegetarian stall doesn‚Äôt only sell the standard beehoon, they have also different cooked meals that you can order and equally delicious. No complains with their beehoon, curry veg and different variety of other dishes to choose from.

Ban Mian auntie doesn‚Äôt rush into cooking your bowl of Ban Mian. Inexpensive yet many ‚Äúliao‚Äù in a bowl.

Kway Chap longest queue, but really yummylicious Âç§Ê±Å without the smelly pork smell.

Mixed Rice stall is honestly priced and won‚Äôt overcharged your chosen dishes.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107234303898599875744/reviews
Jonavan Lee,4,"Just re-opened after renovation. Sparkling bright lights & smoke (at the üö¨ area) filled the place. We tried the ÁªôÈù¢Â≠ê, ÂÖ®ÂøÉ ban mian & western food. The dry tom yam ÊùøÈù¢ had the most interesting flavour. Tom yam taste is there & the noodle texture was good. Only thing is the portion doesn't commensurate with the price: $4.50. The bak chor mee was more generous with their portions & it was good - the soup was noteworthy. Western food was the worst - expensive ($8-$20) and portions were meh & cooking was meh. We got the fish + spaghetti & the spaghetti was served cold & spicy. Cui. I didn't even bother taking pic of the western.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102582766424036554780/reviews
