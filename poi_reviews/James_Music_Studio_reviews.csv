ShuYin Chan,5,"Mr Jamesâ€™s passion for music is so powerful that he inspires us every lesson to reflect on our own playing. His ability to break down concepts into understandable pieces is unparalleled.
His classes are also engaging, interactive, and always challenging. Be prepared to be drilled on your weaker topics. Did see quite tremendous improvements since starting lessons with him 2 years ago!

Wan Yi,5,"James Music Studio has a very conducive learning environment!

I've been studying violin with teacher James for a year and I couldn't be happier with the experience. He is not just a talented musician but also an incredible teacher who is patient, supportive, and incredibly knowledgeable. He has a knack for breaking down complex techniques into manageable steps, which has greatly accelerated my progress. The lessons are always engaging, and teacher James provides constructive feedback that has helped me improve tremendously. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced player, I highly recommend teacher James for anyone looking to enhance their violin skills.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108700240902605158800/reviews
