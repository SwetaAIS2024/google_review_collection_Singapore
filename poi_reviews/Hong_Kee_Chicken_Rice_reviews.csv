Pinky Rach,5,Came here after seeing good reviews on chicken rice. The chicken rice is well cooked and chicken is tender and nice. Love how the taste and texture felt on every bite. No crowd at all on late afternoon week days but left thigh or wings meat. So I chose thigh meat. Super nice. Will be back again for late lunch. üòÉüëå,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113236919580553197259/reviews
CHIN ANG,5,"A special place, must be the only stall in Singapore that serve chicken rice with fresh zi-char veggies. Family team including Ah ma does the stirfry (!) All items are literally hours old, freshest daily ever. Besides roast, braised, duck & chicken rice, nice veggies, fish & sunny side available for balanced meal. Old school taste at amazing prices hence the long queues. If done in, the big bowl of chicken soup is deliciously rare nowadays. Brilliant family stall at neighborhood pa sat that serve healthy great tasting fare",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106579944402663883280/reviews
Veronica Phua,5,"For a hawker stall, the Tom Yum Soup is damn legit.
Located in Jalan Batu Food Centre, the couple-run ‚ÄúHong Kee Chicken Rice‚Äù is popular for their double-whammy of ‚Äúchap chye png‚Äù and meats that include roast chicken, ‚Äúsio bak‚Äù, ‚Äúchar siew‚Äù and ‚Äúlu rou‚Äù. There is never no queue when we visit.
Not long ago, they started offering a couple of soups as well but only after the lunch peak period as they cook each bowl to order.
The wife is originally from Myanmar and when she first arrived in Singapore, had worked at a Thai restaurant. Being of the Dai tribe, her palate leans towards stronger flavours, so her #TomYum is very fragrant and unapologetically sour and spicy - which suits me to a T.
For sure, the highlight is the soup but the serving size and amount of fish, prawns and crab sticks are also good for the economically-priced portion.
Do remember you‚Äôll need to visit the stall after 2pm if you are keen to try this.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102848705251054755725/reviews
Loki,5,"Surprised to see there aren‚Äôt more reviews of this stall. The food isn‚Äôt mindblowingly exceptional but rather very homely, there‚Äôs just something different about having chicken/duck/roast pork with stir fried veggies a la caipng style. Also very affordable (as with the rest of the food in Jalan Batu food centre)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101937176024039442948/reviews
