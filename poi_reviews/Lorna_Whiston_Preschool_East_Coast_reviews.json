      "text": "My son absolutely loves going to school here! The most important thing we looked for in a preschool was a warm, loving environment—and this school truly delivers. The teachers genuinely care for the children, and there’s great communication and accountability between parents and staff.\n\nAll enrichment classes are included in the fees, so every child gets to join in without feeling left out. I also appreciate the many fun activities planned throughout the year, with opportunities for parents to participate too!\n\nKnowing my son is so well cared for gives me peace of mind every day. Highly recommend this preschool to any parent looking for a nurturing and engaging space for their child.",

      "text": "My child has been with the school since 2022. I’m very happy with the school, the teacher turnover has been very low and a lot of the teachers from 2022 are still there, the principal and her staff are highly communicative and easy to reach, and most importantly my child enjoys going to school. The masterclasses are interesting and engaging, with some highly accomplished teachers, and the core teachers are caring and supportive. There is also a warm community of parents who often get involved in the school’s parent-child activities. I highly recommend the Lorna Whiston East Coast preschool.",

Very prompt communication via app & WhatsApp. The school always put in a lot of effort in organising activities that parents can participate in together.\nMy child loves going to school everyday, there’s a good balance of indoor and outdoor activities for the kids to ensure holistic learning.  Definitely one of the best pre-schools in my opinion, highly recommended!",
