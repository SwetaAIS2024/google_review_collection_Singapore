      "text": "I was in the area on a weekday for lunch and the nostalgic pig trotter beehoon caught my eye.  I haven't had it in ages, so I had to try it!  As the stall was empty, I tried my luck at requesting a custom order of a sunny-side-up egg to top the beehoon, just like how I would have it at home. The friendly stall owner gladly obliged.\n\nMy order took about 10 minutes, as it's freshly prepared, but it was totally worth the wait. I got a moist plate of beehoon, with each strand soaked in the flavours of the pig trotter sauce. There were generous chunks of pork too, both the fatty and lean parts. Plus, there were these yummy bits of crispy lard that made it extra fragrant. And the runny egg yolk simply elevated the dish.\n\nThe total cost was just $7, and I paid with CDC Vouchers.\n\nThe only minor flaw was that the sambal chili was too salty for my taste and lacked a spicy kick. I will probably bring my own belacan next time when I come back. Haha.",

Their pork leg bee hoon is served moist and absorbs the flavour from the canned pork trotter with a fair amount of meat, vegetables, bean sprouts and a lime to squeeze over it! Yums. üòã",

      "text": "My favorite stall at Adam Road Food Centre that I go back regularly. Lady boss's dishes reminds me of my childhood and recipes that are still cooked the same way.\n\nMy favorites would be the char kway teow and pork trotters bee hoon. This is the only store I know that sells pork trotters beehoon. It's richly favoured with pork fats goodness. Have this together with a glass of teh-O-kosong-peng.\n\nFor all the times I'm there, I see her stir frying every order one by one. I'm guessing it's to ensure consistency. So be prepared to wait a little but it's worth it.",

The bee hoon was cooked well with infused with flavours and the pig leg was soft and tender. Chilli was overly salty for my taste and overall the dish is good but not great.",
