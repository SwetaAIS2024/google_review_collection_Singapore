The prawns were half sliced, with a few slices of fish cakes and lean meat, not particularly remarkable though. The prawn soup was light and slightly bland, not as flavorful as others. Overall, the prawn noodle was not bad, if you like the soggy noodles type. However, I wouldn't make a special trip down just for this.",
