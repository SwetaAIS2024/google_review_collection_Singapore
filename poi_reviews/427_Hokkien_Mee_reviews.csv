Tan Mark,5,"Happy Valentine’s ❤️ Day ! : Fried Hokkien Mee - New Gem 💎! ❤️

Alighted pax at Kembangan vicinity and make a U turn to Changi Road heading to city direction and uncovered a real gem 💎of Fried Hokkien Mee …

Ordered a $6.00 version and found something unique … got ikan bilis inside sprinkled all over the “shop” on the plate and it’s lite wet and created the euphoria of umami in its Noodles of yellow mee & Bee Hoon …

Seemingly, a pair of late 30s “couple” from Vietnam 🇻🇳 manning the stall, the guy, ah Wen is the Chef 👨‍🍳 and his ability to wok frying 4 distinct dishes : Oysters 🦪 Eggs 🥚 + Fried Carrot Cake + Penang Kway Teow + Fried Hokkien Mee … simply amazing ! 😮 🤩 👍 ⭐️

To helm these dishes and created goodness in them is never easy, but time shall tell … afterall, it’s my 1st time and 1st Fried Hokkien Mee from the stall …

Started since late 2024 … new kid on the block; had been working in Are U Hungry 😋?re than 10years now …

Interestingly, my plate of Fried Hokkien Mee looks decent w/ 3 mid sized de-shelled prawns 🍤 🍤 🍤, squids 🦑 slices, pork belly slices and pork lards + it’s balachan spicy 🌶️ chillies which caused me to sweat it out …

Highly recommended to give it a try and see/ eat it on the spot to determine your own preference and likeness ! 🙏🏻 😀

Are U Hungry 😋?

Cheers 🥂

Case Woo,4,"This is not the usual white or black carrot cake, but a little more special with added ingredients. We were surprised to find bean sprouts and sweet onions. Nicely fried and tasty. The oyster omelette is not bad too. We appreciate that all are not too oily. Shiok. All good except they didn’t include any chili sauce for the omelette. Will try the Hokkien mee another time.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104415171534053217226/reviews
Jervin Seow,5,"Reminiscent of the previous store, love the pork lard and the ikan bills. Chilli changed to the spicy variety instead of sweet but still as good to me. Probably one of the best in the vicinity.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114971680809461828755/reviews

Dickie,5,I like this place. Solid hokkien mee and char kway teow and the auntie is quite nice. Price is what you'd expect for this kind of food and never a long wait.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101933871268763325560/reviews
