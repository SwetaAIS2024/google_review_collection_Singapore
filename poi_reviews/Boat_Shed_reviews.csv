Forest BK,5,"ðŸš¤In a highly urbanised Singapore, many who fished for a living had since abandon their trade for other occupations.
ðŸš¤But, for some reasons, there are still folks who continue to fish for a living.
ðŸš¤The only one remaining Boat Shed at East Coast Park is where the returning fishermen moor their boats at.
ðŸš¤The Boat Shed used to be a open access area.
But for security reasons, it had since been fenced off and entry/exit subjected to security checks.
ðŸš¤All the fishermen are now seniors. Wonder if they are gone, will this part of history be gone as well?
ðŸš¤Fun note: Another similiar Boat Shed is at West Coast Park Boat Pier.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
