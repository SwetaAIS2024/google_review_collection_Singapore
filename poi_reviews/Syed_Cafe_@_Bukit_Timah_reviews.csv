Mohamed Haniffa,3,"1st time here after they opened just 11 days ago. Seems my review is 1st alsoüòá.Staffs are very friendly. It's like talking to friends
It's the 1st restaurant from the MRT exit side. This used to be a Chinese restaurant. Lao Jiang Superior Soup. Place is big. Able to cater for slightly more than 60pax. The menu book is big. 4 of it can cover one table.üòú.
Ordered the chicken tikka biriyani and Mutton Roti John. The chicken tikka biriyani was very nice. The papadam was ""soft"" but had abit spice to it. The chicken pieces were tasty. Roti John was soft. A decent amount of chilli sauce and mayonnaise on top. But it did seemed like small for the price. Tea was ok. Abit on the lighter side. Wanted to try other dishes but was full. Maybe will go down again.üòÖ",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106001901776455159598/reviews

James -,1,The prata standard as a restaurant are far worst than a coffee shop . Not crispy and curry taste so so . Personally my view I don‚Äôt find it worthy if you are looking for a nice crispy prata .,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105716624877285902267/reviews
