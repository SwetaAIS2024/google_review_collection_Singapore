Gloria,5,"Food is scrumptious and fine details are thought out; for instance the well balance tangy taste in the prawn pad Thai, the al dente baked salmon with its crispy skin, the grilled pineapple (giving it its Citrus name).

Great ambience and service (especially Shawn and Belle) are so forthcoming, it makes for a comfortable dining experience for us. Indoor or alfresco seating are well ventilated for your comfort.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101179930863904711709/reviews
Berlinda Goh,5,"Delicious food! Great service from Shawn and Belle, attentive and friendly. The setting is beautiful, wanna take the alfresco seating next time.

Take note the Thai Scallop Linguine is very very spicy (by default) but it is very addictive kind of heat.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100207240187708698568/reviews

Daphne Phua,5,"Stumbled upon this newly opened hidden gem — love the chill vibes and Instagram-worthy corners! Service was warm and attentive, thanks to Belle. Would be perfect with a wider selection of pastries for tea break. Still, definitely coming back!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117890249270897142002/reviews
T L,4,"Salmon salad was good. At $11.9, there were many salmon chunks. Nice place and had potential to do well, but sadly our experience was not great. Perhaps we ordered the wrong things.

Many items were sold out when we were there at 8pm. Chicken was sold out, salmon was sold out, cod was not available… so we got the steak - please don’t get this… it was tough and dry & we spat half of it out.

Red ruby could be colder and coconut cream was a bit too salty. Vanilla latte was way too sweet - more syrup than coffee taste. Lemongrass drink was less sweet, but still sweet.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105491523268870269764/reviews
