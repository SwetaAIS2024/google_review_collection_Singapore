My girl enjoys her student care time. She adjusted to the student care quickly as well, thanks to the teachers there. Her chinese has improved ever since she attended the centre. I'm happy with that as I told the teachers that I would like her to improve in Chinese.\nMy girl loves the lunch served here, which is such a big bonus point for us as she's a picky eater.",
