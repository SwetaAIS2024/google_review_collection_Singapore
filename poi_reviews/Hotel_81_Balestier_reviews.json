The staff were attentive to my needs especially when I needed help with my room’s lock, and when they let me check in an hour or two early. There are bus stops right in front of the hotel, and across the street from it.",

Very bad cleanliness. Small room. Damp smell. For the price that they charge there are much better options in this area. Don’t waste your money. This hotel needs and update asap. Value hotel better option after I changed to stay there.",
