The chicken was tender, tho the portion wasn’t very generous\n• Thosai with Egg\nCame with a few curry sauces. Spice level was alright. Tasted pretty normal overall\n• Egg Benedict Prata\nNot the best I’ve had, but still decent quality. The ham hidden inside the prata was a pleasant surprise\n• Iced Milo Tarik\nJust the way I like it",

      "text": "I cannot stop waxing lyrical or salivate over what I consider to be the \"OG\" crispy prata. My kids love it even though they can't describe properly which prata place it is (Jalan kayu, springleaf etc....)\n\nWell, this is THE ONE. The one \"papa brought them to\". This is the best of the best. Casuarina Curry. CC.\n\nThey even had a prata cook out session when I was there, (I'm guessing some corporate team building event? What a way. Instead of flopping alone, they flip pratas together. What a change in perspective. They should have WSQ for this) As I could see multiple individuals flipping (not flopping) pratas on the table tops, I was concerned that our order would be delayed. Miraculously, our pratas actually came faster than expected. How Casuarina Curry does it, I can only speculate with wonder, amazement, and gratitude.\n\n(personal favourite = garlic prata)",

Masala chicken was good but Prata was\njust normal, could have been more crispy to our liking.. the complimentary curry tasted pretty good as compared to others. The tek Halia was well balanced with fragrant tea and good dosage of ginger. We love it!",

I've tried springleaf and a few other al almeen/ Al Azhar kind of restaurants and I would say casuarina might be my least favourite.\n\nThe prata is crispy yes but maybe slightly too crispy. Overall I think the taste lacks slightly as compared to the other places but regardless it will be suitable for those who prefer crispier prata.",
