Tommy Gui,5,"If you‚Äôre a fan of nostalgic gems, this caf√© is a must-visit.
Stepping inside feels like hopping into a time machine back to the 70s‚Äîcomplete with vintage toys, classic signage, and a super cozy vibe.

The food? Delicious. I had the pasta and it was full of flavour. The staff? Friendly, attentive, and made us feel right at home.

A hidden spot with both soul and taste. Will definitely be back!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109843357204780800998/reviews
LULU EVOX,5,My order was that Beef slice Carbonara. It‚Äôs very creamy but lack of cheese taste. But for this prices I can‚Äôt ask for much. üòú The slice beef was tender tho. Nicez. Beef stew was tender and the roost chicken nicely roost. Chicken meat not as tough and dry as I through.. overall was good place for family gathering meal together. üëçüèªüëçüèª,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107012020161541736403/reviews

Rusha Chakraborty,5,"This cafe is full of old toys and mint condition comics. Food is tasty and affordable. Located inside SAFRA this is a great place for lunch/dinner if you like Singapore style western food. We had mushroom soup, chicken chop, spaghetti, yuzu honey juice and red velvet cake and every item was well prepared.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112355042371165546485/reviews
Simon Yap,5,"Nostalgic theme caf√© usually don't focus much on food but I was not disappointed.

Had Salmon with lemon butter sauce and a root beer float. For the price and vibes, it deserves 5 stars.

The only inconvenience is a little far from the nearest subway. Suggest bus or cab.

Nicely located next to a walking trail up Mount Faber. After a heavy meal, you can burn it off üòâ.

Kudos for the nostalgia stomach-filling experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109728633595537867261/reviews
