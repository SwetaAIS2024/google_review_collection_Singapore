Harshani Fdo,5,"Located in the heart of Chinatown, the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum is a must-visit destination in Singapore. This stunning Tang-styled temple, built in 2007, houses what is believed to be the left canine tooth of Buddha, displayed in a magnificent gold stupa on the fifth floor. The temple offers a blend of traditional architecture and modern accessibility, making it barrier-free and wheelchair-accessible.
The temple is a trove of Buddhist wisdom, offering a serene atmosphere amidst the bustling city. It’s free to visit, making it accessible to all. Whether you’re a Buddhist or simply seeking tranquility, this temple is a must-visit in Singapore.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108643630323828874217/reviews
Rameya Shanmugavelayutham,4,Beautiful temple with a powerful presence. It is unfortunately filled with more tourists and patrons. I valued being able to visit as a tourist but wished worshipers could enjoy the spiritual space with more serenity. The nearby Hindu temple for example has blocked off space for Hindu devotees. If you are a tourist please respect those engaged in their spiritual practices.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106076369470796486232/reviews
Asheesh Gupta,5,"This temple is a must visit.
Its really well maintained, calm and spiritual experience.
The staff and priests are helping.
The idols have intricate details even the smallest ones.
They have life sized wax statues of previous monks. Again really well made.

Please carry an umbrella and cold drinking water, it gets hot during daytime.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103289634858636555331/reviews
Shahrukh,4,"Recently visited the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple in Singapore and really enjoyed the experience. The temple is beautifully designed and peaceful. I was especially fascinated by some of the old sculptures of Buddha, which were rich in detail and history. It’s definitely a place worth visiting if you’re interested in culture and spirituality.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116894673079059605918/reviews
Kamilla,4,"It looks fenomenal from the outside, especially at night, because of all the bright lights. Interior is gold galore, a bit too much for my taste, but it certainly makes an impression. Side note, visitors shouldn't take pictures inside the main hall.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105750861063082404316/reviews
