Marilyn Tan,1,Paid $600+ to go to the Tioman trip last year. They said I failed my mask clearing and didn't bring the trip forward to this year. I told them I wanted to go through another lesson to pass this year. No response and no refund at all. Bad customer service.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116344273116878600421/reviews
