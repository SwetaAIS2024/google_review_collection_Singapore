Chris Tan,5,"Went to Dr Chan twice and during our consultations, I find him to be professional, a nice person and one who genuinely cares for others.

He listens to patients, then explains things simply sometimes with the use of visuals and even have print outs for you should you need to refer to it after you left the clinic. That I find it useful and perhaps even helpful for elderly patients who might struggle to remember things said.

You can utilise your CHAS benefits at this clinic. Reception staff was responsive and communicative.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103463791737805347871/reviews
Queenie,5,"The clinic is clean and orderly. Dr Chan and his staff (with him for many years) were courteous and professional. Dr Chan is as always very knowledgeable, professional and cautious in treating patients. His explanation was thorough and sometimes took the efforts to show you the photos or research on certain conditions. His staff was also very loyal and friendly too. Good work!
