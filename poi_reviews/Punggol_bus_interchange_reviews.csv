Ivaous Gaming,1,"2nd review, on top of the bus, being early by 1 to 2 minutes, causing confusion whether you missed it or not. The bus may not even come at all. On their screen shows, bus 85 was arriving in 6 minutes. Me and a few others stood there waiting like a bunch of idiots, 6 minutes later, it says arriving and later switches to arriving in 8 minutes. As per usual, their reply to my feedback is that we will look into this matter and proceeds to do nothing.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108887418777626453607/reviews
Lee,1,My son was boarding Bus No. 85 at Sengkang West Way towards Punggol Bus Interchange on 20/10/2024 at 5.30pm. The bus driver closed the front door while my son was still going up the bus. The bus door hit my sonâ€™s cello which he was carrying on his back and the impact of the door closing cracked the cello. Anyone knows where can I file a complaint over this matter?,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106615570699125960470/reviews
