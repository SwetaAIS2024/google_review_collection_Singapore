Whenever I take a taxi/grab, always encounter problem even though I am a resident here. Tell the security guards so many times and yet they don’t seem to understand English. They are also always not at the guard house and have to find other means like calling the office to open the gantry.",

There was a Children’s Day party a few days ago and there is a Halloween party coming soon and there is plenty of children to play with and it’s a perfect place to see beautiful sunsets and there is a tennis court full field 3 pools playground and the condor is very big great for jogging and walking.And the summit is very close to bus stops and an mrt station for people who needs it urgently. There is also a lot carparks around the condor with electric charging points and rent is quite an affordable price.The summit is also near East Coast and it’s connected to the pavement. It is definitely my recommendation for a good place to live and to have fun with new friends!",
