kiran karunakaran,1,"The place is a great location and vibe. But that’s about it.
The second Gin and tonic I ordered basically had no gin in it. When I brought it up they refused and when I informed them that they should d poured it in front of me, the just didn’t even respond.
I would not recommend this place",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115702863955825920367/reviews

Gary Tan,5,"Check out their Happy Hour as the drinks is kind of bargain.
Great selection of drinks to choose from however I strongly recommend their customise Gin where you can choose Fever Tree mixer and wide range of ganish “if you like Gin”
As for food please look for Ms FeiFei as there are a lot of hidden food which not be found in their menu.
With out total surprised their homemade fishball, oyster omelette (a little expensive ) but it’s one of the best you can find in Singapore, Beef Steak cook to perfection ( easily win those 5 stars beef house ),
Garlic prawn and sooooo much more.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100018668445727553186/reviews

Anand Pande,4,"A cool place to hangout and where one can have a decent conversation with friends . The music was just right, the volume perfect and the interiors welcoming .

Fei, the manager and Sri who looked after us were very hospitable.

The 3 to 6 pm gin , sangria pricing are great value for money

the pizza was outstanding. liked the thin crispy base and sprinkling pieces of tomatoes on the Margherita pizza added to the taste .

A few suggestions: the whisky menu is very basic . Needs to be improved.

The pricing if one wants to use the cigar room at a minimum 150 dollars per pax is hard to understand. Maybe have a cover charge of 30 dollars for smoking one’s cigars

Overall , We had an enjoyable evening over whiskies , gin and pizzas.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103660647979898389800/reviews
