johnnykuochung,4,"In the quiet corners of Cove at Punggol, where the gentle breeze carries whispers of the waterfront, a small but extraordinary eatery nestled itself among the bustling eateries of Singapore. It was known as Hennessy Duck, a hidden gem that had grown legendary for its unique spin on the classic roast duck.

The Signature Herbal Roast Duck became the star of the menu. As diners sliced through the crispy skin, an aromatic cloud of herbs filled the air. The meat was tender and juicy, its flavor a perfect balance of savory richness and subtle herbal notes.

The Herbal Roast Duck quickly gained a reputation not only for its extraordinary flavor but also for its ability to uplift the spirits of those who tried it. Whether you were nursing a bad day, a bout of homesickness, or even a broken heart, the first bite seemed to wrap you in a warm embrace.

Hennessy Duck became more than a shop it was a place of solace, where people sought comfort, joy, and perhaps even a bit of healing.

Roy Chiang,4,"Not sure what‚Äôs about the negative reviews but I may agree that the price is a little on the higher side, but comparing to neighbourhood duck rice, this really stands out. Worth the try!

Caramelised Char Siew is really unique, some may like, some won‚Äôt. I love it.

Duck rice have the Dang Gui herbal flavour and it‚Äôs good!

I am changing my review to 4 stars as of April 2024 because they no longer serve the leafy green vegetables which I love, and replaced it with subpar super thinly sliced carrot + cucumber achar",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114931956985478572818/reviews
Low Bao Heng,3,"Hmm it deserved higher than 3 stars but no more than 4 stars.. the food is okay. Ordered their DUCK, CHICKEN N ROASTED PORK during CNY eve for praying and it‚Äôs kinda not bad.

Just now takeaway the Dang GUI Duck Noodle and it‚Äôs not bad still but kinda pricey as it‚Äôs $7.10 for that‚Ä¶ price like higher than the others.. and the uncle indeed no smile like many others had reviewed. He doesn‚Äôt seem friendly, can result in a turnoff to customers‚Ä¶",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108033403024309465290/reviews
S.Y,4,"Dang Gui Roasted Duck $6

The herb taste was not as strong as how I would have liked it, a decent plate of duck rice, but the sauce that was poured onto the rice was not very tasty but the chili was good üòã",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103878295994654326123/reviews
