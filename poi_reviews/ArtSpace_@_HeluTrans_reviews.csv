tomyumdumpling,5,"Visited the ArtSpace during afternoon. There was not really a crowd so it was a good experience to appreciate the art pieces available. The place was minimalistic and neat, and the art pieces was well placed. There are art pieces here on display but also for sale.

Khun C,5,Great space for art exhibition. Accessible by public transport but you'll have to walk 700 meters from closest bus stop. Space is excellent and roomy.
