You can do it outside of the shop the order and there‚Äôs a QR -code to scan to download different app in case you want to order, and then lady is very kind and quick and makes delicious food in 15-20 minutes and she is extremely helpful and understanding, trust me it worth the waiting!   I have ordered Chicken Cheese Tortillas (see in picture) it was very delicious!\nAlso bare in mind that this store is collection only or home delivery , not dining in.",
