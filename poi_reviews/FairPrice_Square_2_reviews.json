      "text": "This is probably one of the oddest NTUC Fairprice outlets that I've been to, but it works for what you need. They function like most other NTUCs I've been to.\n\nThat said, they are hidden in Square 2, on the 4th floor (when most supermarkets are located on the ground floor or basement). There's also a Don Don Donki in the same building, and a Cold Storage not too far away. So why would anyone make the effort to go all the way up to the 4th floor, of an already confusing building, to get their groceries?",

Then she left whatever she was doing to pick fish up and ‘attend’ to fish. Note: this is not early morning peak hours nor ‘rows of fish’ waiting to be deboned. Neither was she deboning other fish.\nI stood there to watch her debone. It was mere few minutes job. Didn’t know I needed to stand there to watch the deboning before she could get to work.\nHopefully her supervisor to verify above event by watching the cctv.",
