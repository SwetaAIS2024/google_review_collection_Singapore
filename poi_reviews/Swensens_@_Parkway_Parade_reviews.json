The gold bar dessert was such a novelty, and it was fun cracking into it.\n\nIt was delicious, and worth the extra premium as we were creating memories.\n\nThe staff there were wonderful as usual and food arrived quickly despite how busy they were.\n\nThank you, Swensens Team!!!",

I really loved the crunchiness of the outer layer, it was such a good topping to the ice cream. I also appreciate how realistic it looks! My dad tried the brownie but he thinks it's way too sweet, especially with the marshmallow drizzle. Service was too slow.",
