      "text": "Ota Fine Arts Singapore, located in the serene and historical Gillman Barracks, is a must-visit for contemporary art lovers. With a strong legacy dating back to its Tokyo origins in 1994, the gallery is renowned for championing Japanese contemporary art, including the works of the iconic Yayoi Kusama. I had the pleasure of visiting their current show, Every Day I Pray for Love by Kusama, which was captivating. The gallery was peaceful, with very few visitors, allowing for an intimate and reflective experience. Ota Fine Arts stands out as one of the best galleries in Singapore, especially for those who appreciate the growing influence of East and Southeast Asian artists in the modern art world. Highly recommended!",

      "text": "My favorite gallery at Gillman Barracks.\n\nGallery itself is well-designed, with a big window that reflects the nature scenes outside.\n\nAmongst all the galleries, they often have very interesting exhibitions. I only visited Gillman Barracks twice so far, but both times Oat Fine Arts exhibited my favorite artworks.\n\nRecently went to see the exhibition from Yayoi Kusama, went twice as weekend the queue is too long so decided to come back during weekdays evening which is so much better, we get to avoid the crowd and enjoy the exhibition in more peace.\n\nLook forward to seeing more interesting exhibitions at Oat Fine Arts.",
