sporeKAfan,1,"Bad Shopee collection point! Stated opening hours is from 1.30pm to 9pm but when I reach at 8.45pm, store is already long closed! Wasted my time to walk all the way there. I noticed the store mostly closed at night already whenever I pass by to take lrt. If owner is so lazy to stay till closing time, you should inform Shopee to change your opening hours!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116720676922818948705/reviews
