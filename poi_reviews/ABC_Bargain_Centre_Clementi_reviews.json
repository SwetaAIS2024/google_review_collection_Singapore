THE REVIEWS ON THIS SHOP ARE TRUE, he overdoes the tapping when she knows you bought a lot. PLS. MAKE AN ACTION FOR THIS.",

There’s another more mature Chinese lady who’s patient and nice though.\n\n- the store is the messiest ABC shops I’ve been to. Ladder blocks the already crammed walkway. You might have difficulties reaching for some items too as they are blocked by stock boxes\n\nAlways check your receipt before leaving. Bring your own bag. Be intentional about what you’d like to get here.",
