George South,5,"We visited a number of pre-schools before deciding onÂ Lavender Meadows, after seeing how engaged and friendly the children seemed here. We couldn't be happier with our choice. Our daughter is thriving and the staff are caring, driven and dedicated. Despite the pandemic they have managed to create a stimulating, creative, safe environment with engaging activities and events. The teachers are clearly committed and I appreciate how they engage with the diverse group of children as individuals. When our daughter first arrived (at 23 months) she had some separation anxiety but was given lots of encouragement and support by teachers, and before long she was excited to go in. Lavender Meadows Playgroup has helped her become more confident and sociable, as well as teaching her functional and creative skills. We're glad we found it.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101100491817876024051/reviews
