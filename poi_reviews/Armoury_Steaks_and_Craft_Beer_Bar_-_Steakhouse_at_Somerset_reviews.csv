Jia Pin Lee,3,"Located on a top floor (level 11) on the building. Great view if you sit near outside. A mix of cute, retro, and pub-like atmosphere. Staff were polite and attentive.

Ordered the steak with their in-house sauce. The steak was OK. It was cooked unevenly. Ordered for medium, bottom half was quite rare, and top half was fully cooked. Steak was a bit gamey. The sauce, satay, and mashed potatoes were delicious.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107847450021351030886/reviews
Orange,4,"The food is served quickly, but the Wagyu burger from the steakhouse is quite oily, and the patty is on the dry side. The fries are decent—best enjoyed while hot—but not the best I’ve had.

The place was quiet on a Wednesday evening at 7 PM, with less than 30% occupancy. Water was served promptly after being seated, and the staff was friendly. They even offered 2 free drink in exchange for a Google review.

I tried the Radler beer (300ml, $6), which was sweet and refreshing, and the Yakult soju (250ml), also sweet—perfect for first-time drinkers. They also have happy hour deals on alcohol from 11:30 AM to 8 PM, with prices ranging from $5 to $7.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
Rayston Leong,5,"Very filling. We over ordered. But for the average diner, seriously, how much meat can we put in us too? Managed 3 steaks, some fish, some mac and cheese and some fried chicken and I was stuffed. Didn't even have to worry about the time limit as I was full way before that.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107523660376241751767/reviews
Jacqueline Erika King,5,"I had their buffet with my family earlier today, and it was a wonderful experience! The atmosphere is perfect for gatherings with family and friends. The place was clean, there was ample space between tables, and the music didn’t overwhelm conversations. The food quality was great for the price. Best of all was the service provided by the servers. They were all very attentive to our needs and super friendly, especially Danica! She made sure we were well taken care of and even made small conversations with us! Would definitely come by again :)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109597176328572899653/reviews
KE,5,"Celebrated my birthday at Armoury. Staff, especially Danica, were ready to attend to us. One of them recommended the Monk beer which we tried. Danica surprised ne with a complimentary lava cake and it was such a pleasant experience dining at Armoury. Will definitely come again!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116989558809020667028/reviews
