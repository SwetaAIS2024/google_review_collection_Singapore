HealthcAIre Kim,4,"Starbucks Parkland Greens, East Coast: We have cycled past this gazillion times but today we headed in the cool AC confines for a duck-out from the blistering sun. I am not a Starbucks fan as I dislike outlets but this afforded a lovely view of the blue sea and the green (hence Parkland Greens). Sit out for the sea breeze or head in for the AC blast. We chose the latter. It‚Äôs lovely to do their latest high-priced matcha mocha drink (weird blend) and strawberry blossom cheese cake. This might be one of my rare Starbucks outlet like. #eatstylishtravelstylish",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101154220359165719571/reviews
C.H ‚ÄúRetxed‚Äù Ee,1,"So we ordered our strawberry acai lemonade, both staffs were NOT working on our drink after I waited for 15mins, while I am typing this review, our drink is still not done yet.

You can see from the photos, they are doing  their own things.

Ps: only when we approach her, she started doing our drinks. Oh my

Starbucks, please explain this behaviour",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104027383115701518986/reviews
Wee Nee Poh,3,"Order took double the estimated time.

Good location and scenery but place can be cleaner.

Shortage of staff, service not very welcoming",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107224823246501298077/reviews
Joshua Foo,5,"Caramel Macchiato less ice. Was told cannot have less ice but I insisted and was told the usual watery reply. Was kindly reminded about 50% discount.

Acai blueberry is yummy and supposedly a healthy replacement for cheesecake? ü§£",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110000868341222767135/reviews
DR DAVY GOH,5,"Located in East Coast Park, a good resting point for cyclists or joggers.
Standard Starbucks menu.
Ample seatings space for the indoor and outdoor area. Quite spacious. Can easily accommodate different group of people.
There was only one staff in the morning, when I was there. She was friendly and patient.
Overall a nice environment to chill out- you can enjoy the sea view while you are there!

One of my favourite outlet.
Strongly recommended!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100178836333366849641/reviews
