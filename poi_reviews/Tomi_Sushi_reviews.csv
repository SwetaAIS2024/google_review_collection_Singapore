Ray Tan,5,"Saw they have a tuna promo going on. Haven‚Äôt had Tomi sushi in years thought i return to try. Tuna still as fresh as ever. Not omakase fresh but for the price i think it‚Äôs v reasonable. Ordered a maguro zanmai ($32.50). Consists of 2 maguro, 2 chutoro and 2 otoro sushi. Also comes with mini tuna rolls. Chutoro is my fav cut of the tuna but the otoro and maguro were v gd as well! Also had the nakaochi gunkan($7) which is some minced tuna sushi. Taste alright. And more chutoro sashimi ($24)and salmon sashimi($24). The salmon is abit subpar. It‚Äôs a lot of sporeans‚Äô fav fish but the japs tend to avoid it dunno y. Also ordered the maguro cheese katsu($15). Was skeptical about this but tasted surprisingly gd! Batter nicely fried but meat is still moist and tender! There‚Äôs $30 corkage charge for wines and sake and $60 for hard liquor. Ate like a baller and dmg per pax ~$80. But i feel $50/pax is doable. Def must give their tuna a try!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118226053308108066808/reviews
Coldnight Very,1,"Fish slices were cut inconsistently, some slices with cut off edges, some half the size of others, and some that looked like leftovers. Feedback to server and a lady (older) said the fish slices were weighed before serving so I‚Äôm not shortchanged. I asked does that mean the fish were cut into circles and triangles I have to accept them as long as they are weighed as well? Was a knife from play dough set being used to cut those? What‚Äôs the worst part was how the server lament loudly to the chef regarding my feedback that the whole restaurant could hear her. Chef doesn‚Äôt take pride in slicing fish, server does not take pride in customer service. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs left at tomi sushi. You r better off spending less but better food and service at Sushi Tei",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111346941409415656707/reviews
Owen Chan,5,"tried their new 80 dollar set for the price i was given really thick cuts of sashimi that tasted really fresh as well. can give it a try if you are a big fan of crab and tuna, really worth it in my opinion!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114242167257033998242/reviews
Melissa Leong,5,"We liked everything about this hidden and charming Japanese restaurant. We were sat by the counter which gave us quite a feel of dining in Japan itself, and the many Japanese patrons dining there provided street cred - it meant that the food should be quite good and authentic. The sushi was very fresh and my husband enjoyed his dinner set. Staff were friendly and served food promptly. We weren‚Äôt charged for tea nor wet towels which we thought was fantastic. Will definitely visit again when the Japanese food craving hits.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113345730471940578660/reviews
