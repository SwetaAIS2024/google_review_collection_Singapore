Nestled along an alleyway on Tembeling Road is Kopikhoo—a literal hole-in-the-wall takeaway coffee kiosk operated by 73-year-old. Age didn’t stop this 73 Y/O S’porean from starting a coffee kiosk from her kitchen window.\nI am impressed with her healthy coffee and not so sweet.",

We even took pictured together! What’s more fascinating is that since it’s my first time, she asked me to write on her notebook, like a diary. Amazed indeed! Should I be coming back? Oh yes, with friends of course. Worth visiting! Second customer btw coz I want to avoid the crowd and I got oat capp. :)",

She even offered me a pineapple tart with the Americano I ordered. It was strong and well bodied flavour. You could sit at the chairs along the lane to have your drink. The experience was unusual and interesting.",
