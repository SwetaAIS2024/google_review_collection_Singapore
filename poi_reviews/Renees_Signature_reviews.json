Huge part of it was so tough and overcooked that I had to shred it to eat it yet spit out quite a bit, while there was one part that was so rare as you can see in the photo. There was also a large chunk of fat.",

Not oily and they were crispy even after awhile.\n\nThe chocken chop was so good my 7 years old son finished it all.\nDidn't manage to take the picture before they eat so here's the finished look.\n\nI would come back again for this üòÄ",

      "text": "I usually enjoy dining at Renee‚Äôs for their western food, but unfortunately, today‚Äôs experience fell short. I ordered the carbonara and was quite disappointed, it was extremely salty, and the sauce had visibly curdled, likely due to being cooked at too high a temperature. The overall dish felt rushed and lacking in care.\n\nWhen I provided my feedback to the lady at the counter, I was told that the pasta wasn‚Äôt salty and that previous customers hadn‚Äôt mentioned anything. While I appreciate that taste is subjective, I felt dismissed and somewhat invalidated when I was told that I just couldn‚Äôt take salty food, rather than acknowledging that something may have gone wrong in the preparation.\n\nTo be fair, they did replace my pasta with an aglio olio, which I appreciated. However, as I collected the food, she reiterated that she felt that I couldn‚Äôt take salty food. The way the feedback was handled left a sour note. I hope the team can take customer input more openly in the future, as I‚Äôve had better meals and experiences here before.",

The veg is watery and only plain lettuce (the picture show a whole different presentation of salad). The steak was so thinly cut it didn't matter how you want your steak to be done because it's overcooked and hard (i asked for medium).",
