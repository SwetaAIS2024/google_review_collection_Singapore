Pavithri Vithanage,3,"I was at Carlton City for a week in March 2025. The only reason I rated the hotel a 3 is because the staff at Plates (main buffet restaurant) were unfriendly and borderline rude. Not the best start to the day. Staff makes a big difference to the “feel” of a place, so a bit of improvement needed there. Food was average.

Having said that, the housekeeping staff were excellent. Room was spotlessly clean. It had everything I needed. I got complementary laundry which was very helpful during the long stay. Concierge was helpful. Luggage storage was helpful. Location is close to the MRT. Walkable to Chinatown and basically everywhere else, if wearing comfy shoes ☺️",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104753975821581480308/reviews
Stefan Ladwig,5,"I was here for two nights and totally enjoyed myself. The Carlton City sits in a very nice area with lots of shops, parks and other things to see. The hotel itself is very well kept, we had a rather twin bedroom with a great view on the neighbor skyscrapers (I recommend to choose a room on a higher floor). The hotel offers a nice swimming pool on an upper floor. I found the water to be quite chilly, but some may perceive this as nice an refreshing. I did not have a chance to check the restaurant but the rooftop bar (called cooling tower) is small but offers a great view and a good selection of drinks. I had a great time and can highly recommend the Carlton City hotel.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110603128227701098575/reviews
George A,5,"We did a lot of research on where to stay in Singapore and the Carlton City area as the one we thought would give us the best value.    It did not disappoint.
Hotel facilities and rooms are clean and look fairly new. Breakfast buffet way very good.  Location was also very good.  Walking distance from Chinatown, shopping and eating places (10-15 walk to Lau Pa Sat).  I would definitely go back again",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117409071442585344200/reviews
Ramon Merola,5,Amazing hotel if you are using it as a base or landing pad to just sleep. Great rooms including interconnecting for families and a reasonable buffet. Close grab ride to most attractions and plenty of food in walking distance,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111540360155945423574/reviews
Mark Phillips,3,"Lovely hotel, concierge very helpful. The only reason I give 3 stars is due to my recent visit. As we were checking in the lady who signed us in to our room, whether she meant it or not, stared at us as if wondering why we were there in an almost judging manner. Perhaps it is because we were wearing shorts and a tshirt and seemed a little sweaty from all our travelling and not in business suits like most clients in the lobby at that time. Unsure, however the whole interaction made us both feel the same way. Room was fantastic, great view of the city.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103760071858664272875/reviews
