Mindy Mindy,3,"Big fail for Daniel Lim and Joline co in charge for PMBA Experience Day. They are obviously way below standard for NTU, but not sure why or how they are being employed.
I was there and the person doing the sign in process was unable to get my name right. But  Joline jumped into conclusion mid way that my name was not captured. Glad the student continued trying and he finally got my name after I repeated it for at least 3 or 4 times.
As we were completing the sign in process, Joline just took all the bottled water available, holding them dear to her. None was passed to me, I thought maybe there are some bottles inside, so I entered the room, found my own seat and realised no bottles were available. I had to exit the room to ask for water. The customer experience by then was already super bad, and as an alumni of NTU, I know for sure that this is not the kind of service quality my uni usually offers.
I returned to my seat and after a while, Joline came to ask if I would like to sit elsewhere. Was really frustrated at their high lack in sense of customer service, from sign-in issue to water issue and now sitting issue. If they would like me to sit specifically somewhere, shouldn't they usher me in right from the start, instead of troubling me to carry my things and shift elsewhere? Joline explained that the bottles were meant to be placed at one table in the room. (So when I was just beside her, bottles meant to be at table would  still go to table, instead of kindly just pass one to me, is she even a thinking worker?)
As I was feedbacking to Joline about the lack in quality of work, Daniel Lim came over and interrupted to question on the water issue, speaking in a bearly can hear voice. I clarified with him that it is not just the water issue, but also the sign-in issue, but before I can complete my sharing, Daniel rudely cut me off and signalled to me if I would like to leave. Omg, a non-people person with poor communication and interpersonal skills taking on the role of outreach and admissions of a prestigious MBA which is $80,000. He only turned to a nicer personality when I told him that after all the MBA events I attended, this is the worse and I even attended NTU EMBA event at Fullerton Hotel. Daniel explained that the lack in prompt service by the person attending to sign-in, is because that person is a student, and that with no pay, student may not do a good job. I questioned him is it because of budget (Doesn't look good on NTU, isn't it?).
As a NTU alumni, I clearly understand what is the standard offered by my uni or its alumni. If  they are not aware of NTU culture or aren't up to standard, kindly do not disgrace NTU, misleading others to think that NTU offers such low level service to its students. They need to know that it is very competitive out there. For talent like me, I do get invites to various progammes, including even PhD. So how are these people who don't behave like talents, able to comprehend us and behave accordingly to attract? What is the purpose behind Experience Day? To attract or turn off? At the end, seems like those who are keen, are those who are keen even before the event, so how are Daniel and Joline adding value? They are in a sort of sales work for a prestigious tertiary institution, but lacking in important knowledge of branding etc.

Eventually their Head of Admissions also stated that his department is receptive to feedback, and their Head of Admissions is really way much more impressive by mannerism and mindset than Daniel or Joline, he is such a saver to the event.

I think the Prof invited to do sharing also mentioned that Joline was expecting him to give a lecture, when nowadays is with students' engagement, instead of just Prof one way talking. How on earth are such outdated staff in employment? Nowadays with so many people looking for work, am sure there are ready people who are better fit to the organisation than them. They should be reviewing their hiring process.

Good job to those who organised the event for EMBA at Fullerton Hotel, I am impressed.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104732936966875648635/reviews
