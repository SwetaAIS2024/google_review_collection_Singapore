It has been n was one of the memorable mosques we had been to. They made changes to the place to accommodate many other mosque go-ers.\n\nAs a foundation, there isn't much changes as it retained the overall look as how it looked like.\n\nThe view may scare some as the trees growing around the area are rather thick. So it could be imposing but well it could be some, not for all la eh.\n\nNonetheless, we find peace at this mosque, so do drop by for a short prayer.\n\nCheers!",

The compound is expansive and the prayer hall is large, airy & comfortable for you to perform your prayers. The sound system is also very loud so the imam is very clear. If I stayed nearer, Iâ€™d frequent here much more!\n\nFor drivers, you either can park at Blk 253 (Hougang Ave 10) or along the private residential properties along Tampines Rd.",
