Samuel Gan,5,"Awesome, I ordered the #15. Beef stomach with noodles, get the dry one! And ask for one more small bowl of clear soup.

Sauce was infused with abit of peppercorn for extra kick. Beef tripe was soft and tender, noodles was evenly cooked and easily coated with the sauce.

Large amount of veggie was also appreciated.

Will come again.

kyal sin,1,"I ordered the chicken feet dish from this shop, and I was extremely disappointed. The dish that was served looked nothing like the display advertised. The chicken feet were not fresh and poorly cleaned, making the whole experience even more underwhelming. This felt like a complete mismatch between expectations and reality. I hope they improve both the quality and consistency of their dishes.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117370309236860571145/reviews
Simone Lim-Foster,4,"Travelled a distance to find this gem in the Tampines heartland. Run by a mainland Chinese couple, we ordered both the fried dumplings and the chill oil dumplings were both tasty and such value for money $5/ 10 PCs. Tried the mince meat noodles ( Jjajangmyeon) and pickled cucumber and our bill came up to only $18! Very delicious and ambience in this new coffee shop is very clean and pleasant.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112269361765110839596/reviews
Jacob TAN,3,"Xiao Long Bao here is too dry and not much juice when you bite into the bao. Taste wise is OK. The beef noodle is flavourful but it is quite spicy. The noodle is firm and tasty. I like the beef which is tender and yummy. However, I would prefer if the beef were of bigger chunks.
Service is quick and orderly.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
