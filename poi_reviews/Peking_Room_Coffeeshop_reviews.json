Pork is tender, the intestines are cleaned very well with no ordor. It is very reminiscent of Malaccan style kopi tiam style noodles. Worth going specially for it. Only down side is that it's small with limited seating.",

Read so many reviews about their noodles and true enough; this stall sells pork noodles from $2.50 and the taste close to KL ones!  Ample parking here and expect to queue if you are there in the morning.  Limited seats in this small coffeeshop though and one could also find Roti Prata and supposedly another Stall selling Fried Carrot Cakes; but it was closed today!",
