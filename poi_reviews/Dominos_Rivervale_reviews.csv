Marcus Nah,1,"Was trying to order from their app in the store for some promotional items. Something might be simple for them they just ignored! Well happened to be free since there.. managed to place the order..
Don't have to wait long, around 10+ mins.. and it's started to rain heavily..  What a experience with the staff inside... Can see them talking.. walking around but can't ask help with on app order..

Services getting very lousy..

Food, taste acceptable but ingredients seem to be cutting down until I don't see much except for the cheese..

18/12/24 Update;
Trying to feedback to Dominos pizza, and the verdict is ""waste of time"".. ask me to check on their reply yesterday.. Where?
First time I delete an account because of the time wasted to feedback to a company. Hoping that they can improve but.... I don't think I would patronise them again..

See the review, number don't lies!

Used to be my favourite pizza place in the past.. but now.. totally disappointed.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108851483842225070997/reviews
Jolene K,1,"Ordered my pizza from their website at 5.11pm and my pizza still hasn't been delivered at 8pm. called in the outlet hotline 20 times and only gone through once without anyone picking up the phone. Other 19 times line was busy.

Live tracker shows ""rate your order"" but my pizza is not even here? Called in again and the line is still occupied. Horrible experience and service.

Update: pizza arrived at 8.15pm and the pizza is already cold. Instructions to remove onions from pizza is not even followed.

Will not order again.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107167857522834797188/reviews
Chanel Lim,1,Did a pre order through app and was gonna do a self pick up at 7:30pm. Upon reaching the store at 7:30pm. The staff said it will take 1 hour to 1 hour 30mins more. Order at your own risk. No point opting for self collection as the self collect is as bad as its delivery. Just look at the Amt of ppl waiting for their pre-ordered self pick up.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101387673680591731122/reviews
Benjamin Eng,1,"2 XL pizzas took around 1.5 hours to show up after placing order at 9PM-ish. Their pizza tracking thing was never updated (even after delivery) and the delivery person did not ring the doorbell and just left the order at my gate. Found 2 cold pizzas with thick chewy crusts and not much/uneven toppings.

Update: Sent a message to Domino's 2 days ago via their Feedback site. Yet to hear back from them.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114453899372251077646/reviews
