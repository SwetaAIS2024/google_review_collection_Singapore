      "text": "This is a Nanyang-style breakfast shop, similar in style to Toast Box and Ya Kun Kaya Toast, but more customer-friendly than the Killiney Kopitiam listed on the \"must-try\" list.\n\nThey offer affordable set meal options, and the staff thoughtfully charge customers based on the set meal price instead of sneakily charging à la carte prices for first-time visitors like some opportunistic merchants do.\n\nTourists can try the kaya butter toast, a signature local flavor—though be aware that this combination is quite sweet. The soft-boiled eggs can be seasoned with soy sauce or white pepper, depending on personal preference.\n\nHowever, there are no condiment bottles on the tables outside, so customers must serve themselves entirely. Orders are placed at the front counter, and food is picked up at the self-service collection area in the back, where there is also a relatively spacious dining area. Since all food collection is self-service, first-time visitors may need some time to get used to the process.\n\nThe young female staff here are generally polite and helpful, especially to first-time visitors—much better than the rude, ill-mannered, and uncultured elderly staff at the Tai Cheong Bakery next door. The overall pricing is affordable, making it a good choice for solo dining. First-time visitors can start with the classic toast + soft-boiled eggs + hot/cold drink combo to get a taste of Nanyang-style breakfast.",
