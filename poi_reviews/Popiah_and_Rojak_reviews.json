      "text": "Oh no!   If you want a masterclass on the wrong way to make a popiah, come to this stall!\n\nI won't quibble about the slightly higher price ($2.70 each) as this is at Harbourfront, where the rent is probably higher.\n\nVisually, the popiah didn't look good.  You can see from the photos that the skin tore in a few places.  The popiah is very wet.  When I picked up a piece, gravy is still dripping from that piece.\n\nThe popiah skin doesn't taste as good as the one from Ann Chin.\n\nThe popiah here is way too sweet for me.  Moreover, the pieces weren't cut all the way through.  Pieces are still attached to each other through the uncut skin at the bottom, requiring a bit of effort to pull them apart.\n\nLastly, their popiah is larger in size, but they made 3 cuts yielding 4 pieces per popiah.  Each piece is quite big.  I have a big mouth, but still needed to open it very wide just to pop each piece into my mouth.  Very clearly, the popiah maker should have made 4 cuts (yielding 5 pieces) instead of 3 cuts.  They saved some effort by making one cut less, but this results in customers having to open their mouths wider.  They should have had the customers' comfort and convenience in mind.",
