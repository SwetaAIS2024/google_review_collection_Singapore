The Genesis Family,5,"Bird Bakery is a delightful spot to grab a bite before or after exploring Bird Paradise. They offer a range of fresh breads and savory options, along with fruity beverages. The atmosphere is bright and cheerful, thanks to the large windows that fill the space with natural light. The pastries and cakes are delicious, especially the Signature Swan Cream Puff and Mini Nest Chocolate Savarin. While slightly expensive, it's a worthwhile treat within the park. Service can be slow when crowded. Good coffee and ice cream",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114071894759795666732/reviews
Darren,4,"Pretty pricey but I guess that's to be expected. Had the Spinach and Cherry Tomato Quiche which came with a side of salad in thousand island dressing. Quiche was alright, nothing fantastic and it was pretty small. The ambience of the shop was comfortable and cooling though, great to rest the legs after a day at the park.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116771157599704611382/reviews

Kai Ming Hew,4,"The cappuccino looks very ""automated"" at its price. The cafe does have seemingly expensive espresso machine though.
The plating of swan puff is impressive and I don't mind paying more to feed the real swans.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112071062111471106051/reviews
