Ponshankar Magesh,5,"One of the definite places to see beautiful sunrises in Singapore don't miss the Rooster ringing early morning bells.
We did camping during May, it was very humid even at 4:00pm

Other than that the washroom was very clean and tidy throughout the stay",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100596744045787270389/reviews

Rizal Nasir,5,"Knowing that weekends would be packed with people, I chose to ride my bike and pitch my tent on one of the weekdays. Fairly peaceful and you get to enjoy the soft sound of crashing waves during high tide and do some bird watching. The BBQ pits were also vacant most of the time so I got my peace and quiet. Lovely place to catch the sunset and sunrise.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111447179071551242707/reviews
