      "text": "Latest update: stall attendent refused my cdc vouchers in sheng xin fish hotpot zichar stall. Saying they don't accept cdc. I have done it before a few months back. Is a disappointment. I suggest not to come back for big meals.\n\nHot beverage like kopi o which I ordered 2nd time these months.. The kopi o served was a lesser than usual. Since it happened twice from the same coffee lady. This no coincidence. Decided not to confront them. I rather avoid this coffee lady instead.\n\nFoods is alright. 名轩 roasted meats is nice but standards not the same for everyday. 成吉 Hainan chicken rice maintained it's standards for tender chickens and same fragrant rice. Nice or not is subjective. Is enough for my palate.\nSisaket thai food serves legit Thai food. Recognized by my thai friend and favoursome. Portion might be a little small in my opinion like fried kailan. But compare to zi char fried vegetables? Sisaket serves good portio.n for $5.\nDim sum forget it. Duck rice stall standards dropped since the day it opens a few months ago. Duck meat was tough on certain days. Zi char tall was featured by some youtuber for their Assam fish head $9.90 after spending certain amount. The food was just average. Mixed vege rice is average. I had toilet runs occasionally after their meals.\nAtmosphere indeed choking due to mala stall cooks if you sit indoor. Sit outdoor full of smokers. Avoid meal hours should be fine.",

A meal for two as shown in the picture would set you back at $17. Beware the spice level is rather substantial, only thing missing is a glass of Thai ice tea.",
