My steak was also on the money in terms of doneness. Fave of the night was dessert though - the tiramisu had enough of a bitter coffee hit to make it memorable. They gave an additional dessert too since it was my birthday :)\n\nService was excellent as well!",

They will also go out of their way to make changes to the dish/menu for you. In general if you're looking for great Italian food done with passion and flavour - this is the place.",

We got the seasonal menu and one extra dish to try and they were SOOO GOOD, especially the angel hair pasta with the caviar, the poached egg dish, and their pastas. They even gave me a dessert as a birthday treat! ðŸ’¯ service too. Also saw they won a lot of awards for their wine selections, not a big fan of Prosecco but theirs was so good and no hangover! Highly recommend for a date, birthday, or a cozy holiday meal!",
