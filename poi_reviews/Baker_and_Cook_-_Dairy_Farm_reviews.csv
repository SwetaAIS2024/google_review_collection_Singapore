Ming Hui,5,"A nice chill location at dairy farm. It's quiet on a Saturday afternoon. Ordered coffee and freshly made pizza. The coffee is all large sized... Makes you feel that you're getting a good bang for your price. The freshly made pizza, made to order in their nice big oven. Wow the pizza is really amazing. Really nice.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108198322351045531056/reviews
Abraham Lee,4,"Food was decent but we really liked the coffee. The brand is always located in nice neighborhoods so we werenâ€™t surprised to see it spring up in this estate.. the plush greenery around adds to a nice atmosphere. Came on a weekend morning but place got progressively crowded towards lunch. Both indoor and alfresco options and the staff were helpful in getting us seated. They have a really nice array of breads and cakes, and a good Xmas vibe all around.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews

Would really come back! One of the better Baker & Cook outlets that we have been too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112310545730950862073/reviews
Joan Chin,5,"loved the mushroom pasta and pizza #11!

the marinated tomatoes on the pizza really elevated the dish, and they were very generous with the toppings on the pasta.

thank you to the team for a super yummy brunch and happy new year! ðŸŒŸ",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106948946991457100918/reviews
C,5,"Great place for chill & yummy breakfast after nature walk. Serving good coffee and warm breakfast. Nice!

Finally open! Went to pick up some breads, always love their artisan sliced bread. And decided to stay back for pizza & drink. Sourdough pizza (by plank) is highly recommended, perfectly paired by  wine by glass (at reasonable price).
Very nice and friendly staff/crew, enjoy my time there and will be back again! Keep up the great work team!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110704375820971665962/reviews
