Flo Yeow,2,"Never really a big fan of large crowded MRT stations. Personally was quite lost the moment I exited the station, as there were 3 to 4 large exits with long walks, presumably leading me to different parts of Serangoon, Balestier, and Boon Keng, upon exit. Without proper signages and directions, it's just very difficult to find anything if you're here the first couple of times. Exited one of them accidentally, and had to go back down to find the right exits.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews

Aom Sankaewtong,4,"A north-east line station locates in the middle of a residential area. Hidden gem for local food and artitechture. Just few steps from the station, you can easily find a fresh market where local food and fresh ingredients are sold. Two stations away from little india and downtown area.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108492968966899867200/reviews
