Karen Koh,5,Shout out to Dr Michelle! I finally found an amazing female doctor in Tampines. She‚Äôs the only doctor that opens the door and welcome you in. Very gentle and listens to my worries well. She explains to me my symptoms and concerns and guides me in taking the medicine well. Prices are reasonable. She makes me feel comfy and I think the next time I‚Äôm sick I‚Äôll come back to her again.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104450280536326033387/reviews
Titan Pua,3,"The physician was amiable and cordial. The prescribed medication proved to be efficacious in facilitating my swift recovery. The ambiance of the clinic was pleasant.

However, I am compelled to assign a three-star rating due to the following reasons:

1. Inefficient queue management and unprofessional conduct exhibited by the nurse.

Upon my arrival at the clinic, I was informed that I would have to wait approximately one and a half hours for my consultation. Subsequently, I received a phone call an hour later, wherein the nurse instructed me to return to the clinic as my turn would be approaching shortly. Despite this, I was obliged to wait an additional fifty minutes before I was finally seen by the physician. When I inquired about the reason for this delay, the nurse was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation.

2. Exorbitant consultation fee.

The consultation fees charged by the clinic are significantly higher compared to the prevailing rates at other polyclinics.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105126799522947612860/reviews

None of your business,5,"(Female GP Doctor Michelle)

So many clinics i have visited and this is the only clinic whereby a doctor will open the door and call the patient in personally.

(under the company panel doctor)
As i know,most company panel doctors are very ""stingy"" and ""strict"" when you visit them.
This clinic is exceptional, the doctor (doctor Michelle) is very polite and caring about your health and listens to patient problems.

One of the very few clinics whereby the doctor is very patient and medication is given accordingly unlike some panel clinics whereby the doctor will only know to prescribe ""cheap"" medications  example like only ""paracetamol"" is available in the clinic if you complain about pain.

‚≠ê Doctor Michelle is an absolutely excellent doctor who deserves my praise.

Conclusion:
I should not have praised doctor Michelle as I'm sure this clinic will soon be crowded after people seeing my review üòÖ",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110952495501575881050/reviews
