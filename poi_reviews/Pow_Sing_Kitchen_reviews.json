Today I visit with my family and kids.\nThey have renovated and become smaller, but still comfortable. The only problem is, the chicken becomes..... Very bloody looking. Abit scary. The rest, still yummy as usual.",

      "text": "Many customers who have been coming here for decades. I remember when he had one stall at the corner and a restaurant at the other end each selling one type of chicken. The pow sing chicken taste to me is special. So I’m a bit saddened at what happened. Basically there was a sharp plastic in the sambal kang Kong and my friend had bitten into it. We wanted to nudge the service staff to take more care but it was bizarre. She didn’t even blink twice to enquire and straight up offered to refund or fry a new dish. We were blur. We didn’t need a new dish but wanted to tell them to be careful but once we said we didn’t need a new dish, she whisked away the vegetables and disappeared! And the remaining dish we ordered never appeared also!! So my once a year visit was disappointing. I really hope the business continues but I guess it’s hard to keep up good standards",

      "text": "A specialty chicken rice restaurant that also serves other local dishes such as curry fish head. Good for family meals. We ordered the roasted chicken rice, steamed chicken rice and also the stir fried garlic Kai lan vegetable for our side. The rice was really fragrant and delicious, but I feel that the chicken tasted pretty average though it was very tender. We preferred the roasted chicken over the steamed one as the roasted skin added more flavour to the chicken. The stir fried vegetable was pretty good too. The chilli is amazing as it really amplified the taste of the meat. Would return again to try the other dishes.",

Assam fish curry was surprisingly tasteful (lightly sour) with generous serving. Chap Chye fell out of expectations, it wasnt as good and the cabbage were quite hard. Nyonya tofu was ok but lack the nyonya taste.",
