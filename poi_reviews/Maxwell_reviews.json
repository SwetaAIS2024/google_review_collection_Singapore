So these people who live nearby can get to Marina Bay easily with the help of the new opening of phrase 3!\n\nAlso quite a nice design of MRT station which one platform is on the top while other at the bottom so its similar types like other stations like Promenade, Stevens, City Hall, Raffles Place and other stations that have the same design as these! Quite useful for this because if I of the platform the train has broken down but the other wasn‚Äôt so the platform for one side won‚Äôt be so crowded!!‚ò∫Ô∏èüíï",
