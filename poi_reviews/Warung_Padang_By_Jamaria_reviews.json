Beehoon and noodle not bad.. The food overall was a bit cold though.. for the price.. I don't think is worth it to eat at this stall. The portion not say it's a lot..\n\nMaybe should try Mee soto or lontong for hot food.",

Or u purposely dont want to waste the rice thats y u still serve to customer.U must understand this we r paid customer we r not gettin the food for free.So we deserve fresh quality of food.Thats not all even the chicken i choose u gave me so stingy.3 pieces of chicken that has been cut like a piece of nugget.2 pieces meat with bone on it and the other piece u gave me is a chicken that has no meat on it.more to bone.ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Pls avoid being stingy when ur sellin food.Cause u want customer to come back not run away.If u keep being like this no customer will want to come back to ur stall.And u r lookin at it.This will be the last time im goin to ur stall.",
