Yan Yan,1,"I would like to lodge a serious complaint regarding the service at Mr Bean, Suntec City.
There is an older lady staff member who consistently displays a very poor attitude towards customers. Every time I visit, she ignores customers and tells them to wait, claiming she is ""busy,"" without even basic courtesy or acknowledgment.
During my most recent visit — which will definitely be my last — she completely ignored me even though I was standing right in front of the counter. After waiting for about a minute without any response, I had to leave and buy from another store as I was rushing to work.
This experience was extremely disappointing and unacceptable, especially coming from a well-known brand like Mr Bean.
I sincerely hope that the management will look into this matter seriously and take appropriate action to improve service standards at this outlet.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106169571714267185578/reviews
Mentaiko Lover,1,"Suspicious shop, saw the reviews and was hesitant but really wanted a hot bean curd drink. Taste was ok, but while I was sipping a long piece of substance came out. Bean curd drink was not strained, was intimidating. Service was non existent, staff did not acknowledge customer and nothing was said.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110232272612456245877/reviews
Wayne Khin,2,"Used to like the food there. However the rusty wok smell on those pancakes bother me.  Gave it a chance once yesterday (25th June 2024).  Same rusty wok smell on pancake sadly. This happens in quite a few of their brunches, I notice.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105458385746426085175/reviews
Brina Nash,1,Worst Mr Bean ever! All the 1 star reviews and complaints here are fully justified! I’ve been a supporter of this brand but this outlet makes me never ever want to eat this again. They sold out of chocolate pancake and then lied to me and gave me a red bean one saying it’s the “last one left”. Unethical way of doing business!! I’ve reached out to ask for a refund but no response either. I was really looking forward to a chocolate pancake and I am really disappointed by this experience.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103459064161911184048/reviews
B Tan,1,"Old aunty is extremely rude. Scold me for using voucher... Once I'm done with AIA, I will also be done with Mr Bean, at least Suntec's. I'm guessing most people only patronise because it's the only Mr Bean around the area. Time to set up a soya milk store right beside to put her out of business.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100754200675283969026/reviews
