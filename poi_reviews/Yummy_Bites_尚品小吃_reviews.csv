MNG,5,"Tucked in a corner with a simple set up.

An order of steamed dumpling consisted of 12 pieces.

Each dumpling was plump with finely minced pork with fragrant chive. They were tasty.

Condiments of minced garlic, Chinese chili oil, cut chili and soy sauce or vinegar options.

The elderly uncle was amicable and the shop enjoy quite a loyal following.

They also offer various frozen dumplings for takeaway.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews
Mr A,4,"It's OK. Fried rice normal - not sure what the earlier comments talking about.
Dumpling pic I ate halfway already, it comes in 12 pcs.

Honestly mid. But the ambience is kind of unique (not necessarily good, just different) for a restaurant, so it's worth a try.

I genuinely think one could cook better food by themselves, but I guess if you're hungry, there's no really any option in walking vicinity.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113269740994000904590/reviews

Leon T,4,"I always pop into this stall to have a quick bite for supper before heading home. There are a lot of dishes on offer but I like to order the dumplings to eat.

They are all bite sized and a good ratio of meat and vegetables in each of them. The cook will pour a bit of sesame oil on it so they don’t clump together quickly. For $6, I think it’s a steal.

I also ordered their signature fried rice on a separate occasion. Pretty good I would say and it has cucumber bits in it, so quite unique!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112055732544846425678/reviews
