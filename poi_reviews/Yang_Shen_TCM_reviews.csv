Joan Phua,5,"I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dr Low for her great medical advice and treatment. Under her care and guidance, I have taken following medicines.

1.	Retreat Life Herbal Tea
2.	Herbal Cleanse Capsules
3.	Herbal Life Balance Capsules
4.	Anti-bacterial and Anti-inflammatory powder
5.	Yangjin Busui Powder
6.	Throat powder

The above medicines are very effective as they helped to build my immunity and nurse my body system. Some of the areas that have greatly improved include kidney, lower back pain, heavy foot, knee cap, slim down without compromising on diet.

It takes a while to see the result but for Anti-bacterial and Anti-inflammatory powder, Yangjin Busui Powder and Throat powder, you will see the result after a few intakes. Especially for Anti-bacterial and Anti-inflammatory, Yangjin Busui and Throat powder, they are excellent form of supplements and build body immunity in this current Covid-19 situation. When I returned home and felt something strange in my body, I will make a cup of Anti-bacterial and Anti-inflammatory powder. After that, you will feel that you are back to normal. I strongly believed that this medicine has helped to boost up my immunity which is important in this current pandemic.

At times, when I have itchy throat or felt discomfort, I will take the Throat powder which relieves me after a while. You will be able to see the result after 1 or 2 intakes.

The Yangjin Busui Powder has solved my long term lower back pain problem. I also heard from Dr Low that this powder could also cure eczema. So I have started to let my son drink this powder and he feedback that he felt better.

Lastly, the best part of these medicines is that you could mix all powder together without worrying that certain types might clash. The medicines are able to complement each other. Therefore, it is very convenient for me to take all these together at one go.

Thank you Dr Low for concocting all these great medicines.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102238892206052329589/reviews
