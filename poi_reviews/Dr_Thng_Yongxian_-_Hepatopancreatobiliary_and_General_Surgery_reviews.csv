Cl,5,"I found Dr Thng Yongxian on Google and hope this review will help others like how it did for me.

I cannot express enough how grateful my family and I are for Dr. Thng.

My mom was admitted to SGH A&E and was given a 2-3 days lead time on the availability of a bed. It was a long, long wait at the hospital not knowing what our next steps were. Frantic, I googled searched and called the number on the website. I was so surprised that Dr Thng picked up! He listened and gave me advise, and helped me book a bed at Gleneagles for my mother to transfer right away.

After the scans, Dr Thng advised us the following steps for a Gallbladder removal and an ERCP. Dr Thng showed nothing but the highest level of care, compassion, and professionalism.

Not only did Dr Thng take the time to explain every detail of the surgery and answer all our questions, but his warmth and understanding truly put our minds at ease during what was a stressful time. My mother felt so comfortable and cared for, and that made all the difference.

The surgery itself went smoothly, and my mother has been recovering very well, thanks to Dr Thng’s expertise and thorough follow-up. It's clear that he genuinely cares about their patients' well-being, not just as medical cases but as people.

We are so grateful for everything Dr Thng has done for my mother. If you're looking for a doctor who goes above and beyond, I highly recommend Dr Thng Yong Xian. He is truly exceptional.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100516557666866002093/reviews

Hui Ling Ng,5,"After a recent health screening scare, Dr Thng was able to see me on short notice. He advocated and made time for me to get the necessary scans just 2 days later. He took time to listen to my concerns and symptoms. He was patient and knowledgeable in explaining the scans and insurance matters. I'm very grateful to have had him as my Dr, and will definitely recommend him to friends and family. Thank you for everything!

Shout-out to the team at Nexus Surgical too, a very friendly and patient-centric crew. Thank you and very glad to have met you!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117014143028413536974/reviews
