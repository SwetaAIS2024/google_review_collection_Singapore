Pipat Pongsrirat,5,"First time at Rabbit’s Hole with my friends was gagged — in the best way! I usually don’t vibe with clubs in Singapore (Thailand’s scene is hard to beat, you know?), but this place? A full-on serve. The music was on point, the energy was electric, and the crowd was giving!

Special love to Gerald at the outdoor bar — such a sweetheart, super fun to talk to, and his playlist? Baby, we were soulmates. Total slay.

Only one thing — I didn’t know I couldn’t re-enter after going downstairs for toilet since I didn’t get stamped. Would’ve appreciated a heads-up as a first-timer, but no hard feelings.

Overall? ATE. Will definitely bring my Thai peeps here next round!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107162494907443279824/reviews
