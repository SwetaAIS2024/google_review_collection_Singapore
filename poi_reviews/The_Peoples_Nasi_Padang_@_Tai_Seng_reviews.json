      "text": "Chance upon this nasi Padang stall in the Tai Seng industrial area while running some errands in the area. This stall not only sells nasi Padang but also yakiniku Japaneses bbq.  I was there around 11.45am,just before the lunch crowd. There was no queue, and I was able to order immediately. Huge variety in terms of dish selections.\n\nOrder 2 different veg and a fried chicken, the meal cost me SGD$5.50. Fried chicken was not well seasoned, it was super crispy and wasn't oily at all. The eggplant and vegetable dishes were decent, pretty similar to what you get from other stalls.\n\nOverall, the nasi Padang is definitely above average and, most importantly, reasonable pricing. I would likely recommend and return myself again.",

Nasi Padang stall closes at 3pm.\n\nEvening serves BBQ beef, which I didn‚Äôt try.",

Accept paynow here.\n\nIt was a long queue when I ordered. I think always long queue on lunch hour though.\n\nThere was a customer complained that the fried chicken was not up to expectations (it wasn't the taste but the portion it seemed) when I was about to pay, they offered a refund or a replacement on the chicken. Good service üëç",
