HC Yu,5,"Dr. Judy’s expertise in TCM provided remarkable relief for my chronic migraines. Her acupuncture treatment targeted key tension points in my head. Post-session, I felt an immediate lightness in my temples and a surprising clarity—my eyes felt less strained which helped diminish my fatigue I've been carrying for days. Highly recommended her.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114525969418806451174/reviews
Sabrina Ng,5,"Came here upon friend's recommendation to treat/manage my sudden eczema flare-up.
Had tried applying steroid creams and those worked fast, but I didn't wanna apply those long-term, so gave TCM a try without knowing what to expect.
Glad to say that my eczema is under control now after a few months of treatment here. Dr Gabriel is friendly and knowledgeable, and his diagnosis is quick and accurate.
It was a good experience from the moment I entered the clinic, which has a calm and cosy atmosphere. The staff are very pleasant too.
Although TCM isn't cheap, I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a long-term solution to their health issues.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112095562145865275866/reviews

Senior Pretty Girl Jenny,5,"I had suffered from pain for quite a long time.  My friend had recommended me to consult Dr. Judy.  When I walked into the clinic, the environment was comfortable.  Dr. Judy was very kind and professional at curing my symptoms.  After getting acupuncture and taking medicine, I was getting better and then recover.  She told me that she can do facial acupuncture.
