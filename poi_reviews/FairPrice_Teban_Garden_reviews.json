They expanded their merchandises - by  dumping them outside along the walkway outside!\n\nBusiness may be better but the poor cashiers are still two per shift. Really? Maybe a few more cashier points or one on the outside?\n\nSigh. No wonder tge staff always looked so hassled and haggard. In fact, they hardly had time to even do upselling or suggested offsetting my Fairprice points. Other reviews may say otherwise but no one ever mentioned the rewards.",

      "text": "Review September 2023\nNTUC Smart Choice bread üçû is an essential daily item for the only outlet around the area which caters to the nearby dormitories of foreign workers on the off days . These üçû bread gets all sold out & unavailable for the local residents. Despite informing Fairprice the situation still offern persist .\nThis outlet is small yet it's space is used with non fast selling items laid everywhere.\n\nReview: 1st June 2023\nAll its employees are polite and helpful.\nI've been visiting other supermarkets too but never seen any compared to Mdm  Poh Siew Lan who will go through all the proper processes when as a cashier by reminding ü§î of your discount cards üòâ & special offers . Obviously thanking every customer üôÑ too. Its Amazing üëè üòç üôå ‚ù§\n\nReview  7 June 2022 :\nFrozen fillet fish stacked up with tagged stating SPECIAL @$4.95 YET charged at $7.45 .\nWill wait for their excuses as usual.  As though its customers are always at fault.\n\nReview June 2022\nCat security deployed for RATS üêÄ\n\nReview  May 2022\nInvitation for Rats üêÄ üêÄ üêÄ üêÄ üêÄ\nThrough it's open wide back door\n\nReview April 2022\nRenovation begins on the 15th April. Hopefully with much improvement .\nSimple wrapped Food items to be stored inside away from Rodents.  Freezers to be on the out side . Price tags to be bigger and clearer for the aged seniors.\n. A  Payment counter  may be set outside too  to avoid crowding inside .",
