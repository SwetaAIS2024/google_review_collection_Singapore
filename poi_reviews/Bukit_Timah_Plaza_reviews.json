Sometimes both lifts break down at the same time !  That becomes very inconvenient for the shoppers with heavy trolleys (and with young children in tow) & wheelchair users.",

Overall, good shop mix, more to eat, more hipster cafes and food joints.\n\nPop by and have a go yourself.",

Anyway in most shops I encountered staff with stuck-up attitude, so no point supporting them. The lifts are very slow and always break down. No fast food outlets other than subway. Poor connectivity to other amenities in the area if you walk. Parking is expensive with only 1$ rebate if you shop >50$ in fairprice. The only good thing is the big and comprehensive fairprice finest, but I would rather go to the one in Bukit Panjang Plaza or Hillion mall.",
