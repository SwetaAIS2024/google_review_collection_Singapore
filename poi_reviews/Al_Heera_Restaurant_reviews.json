The customer service was so so, some orders were forgotten, and the food serving was too long. I was in rush as well and didnt enjoy the meal. Both visit were on a weekend morning. I tried again this weekend and the experience was totally opposite. Good service, food was served relatively quick. Taste good. Price might be higher than usual coffeeshops. Family of 4 (2+2). Pratas and drinks cost SGD 17. Parking might be challenging on peak hours. The prata standard deserves 4 stars.",

Don’t expect 5star service, expect our local Indian Muslim restaurant service. My second visit. Would definitely bring my family back again. The only issue would be accessibility. Not much parking. Food wise 5 star.",
