Jason Soh,3,"Ordered the char siew / roasted pork rice and noodle. Both are pretty average, nothing outstanding but not bad also.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113133934501923551074/reviews
Seah Jia Hui,4,"Very happy to be here. 5 star for the claypot rice stall. Affordable, $12 portion for 3 peeps to share and 2 soup. Total only $21. Come early before 730pm as their herbal chicken and other soup run out before that. However, didn‚Äôt try the other stalls so can‚Äôt give it 5 stars. But was happy to stumble to this coffee shop as all the stores are closed in the hawker Center nearby.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109933240025657790273/reviews

They have a lot original Vietnam food that I can‚Äôt find in shopping mall one , The soup is very yummy !!! I most most most recommend is the dry noodle üçú make me can‚Äôt forgotten until now ! The green bean dessert must eat and must mix with the coconut ü•• sauce !",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109913173799227153063/reviews
Ong Kai Xuan,1,"Would have given 5 stars because the tze char stall is fantastic‚Äîfriendly staff and great food.

However, the drinks stall completely ruined the experience. On 27 Feb around 1pm, there were two staff: one making the coffee and another at the counter. The lady making the coffee was friendly, but the counter staff was extremely impatient, despite there being no queue.

When I ordered a Milo Dinosaur (which wasn‚Äôt available), she showed clear annoyance. When I asked for a canned green tea, she shouted at me and my students to take it from the fridge. She even shouted at the coffee lady while confirming if my coffee was hot or cold.

Unacceptable service given that the coffee shop is called Happy Hawker. I would have been happier if I have gotten my drinks from ITE instead.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108993180535936054631/reviews
Sanju,5,"The Vietnamese stall and roasted delights stall in this Hawker center are just brilliant.

The best Vietnamese food I've had in Singapore at a very affordable  price..(6$ for most sets)

Even the presentation of the food is many levels above what you expect from a hawker stall and won't look out of place in a star restaurant.

Its literally a hidden gem!

Roasted delights shop is pretty good too",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107891854584602179793/reviews
