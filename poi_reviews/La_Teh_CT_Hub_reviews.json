The meals tasted good coz the ingredients were fresh and the meals were freshly made. We enjoyed the meals. Will return another time for lunch again.\n\n2nd Visit: I was there with my sisters on Thursday, 11 January 2024.  All of us had Grilled Salmon Salad. We all love ðŸ’• the lunch. It was so yummy.\n\n3rd Visit: I was there with my ex university classmate. We had Grilled Salmon Salad. It was just so lovely. The greens were so fresh and the salmon was grilled well. We both love ðŸ’• it.",

      "text": "This cafe nested at City Hub, 2 minutes walk from Bendemeer MRT station, serves delicious breakfast. Today tried their Garlic Toasts served with Beacons and Sunny Side Up Eggs, beverage is Ice Lemon Tea\n\nAll I can says that when I had a bite of the toasted garlic breads, itâ€™s crispy and the garlic butter tasted perfect! Goes very with the beacon too! Last but not least the ice lemon tea is refreshing!\n\nOverall the whole experience was great! As well the service I give a thumbs up to a staff member by the name of Ker Bee Lay and the kitchen crew that had passionately prepared such delicious food for me today! Thank You!\n\nSimple and yet satisfying! Strongly recommended.",
