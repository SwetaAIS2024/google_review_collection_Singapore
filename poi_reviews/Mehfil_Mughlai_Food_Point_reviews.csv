Benedict Chua,5,"Filling up on my food expenditions over the past few years, stumbled upon this gem after going to Mountbatten for a carousell deal. This was an amazing place ran by a rather handsome dark skinned guy with alluring eyes. He prepared my briyani immediately, nothing was cold, everything was warm and cooked to perfection. The rice was fluffy, the chicken was tender, the curry had great viscosity, very flavourful and fitting for the aromatic briyani rice.

The downside is this stall is located at the back of the hawker centre. Though there are nets to protect consumers from the birds and weather, some birds flock around the tables, which made me quite afraid they would poop or eat my plate if I was not attentive.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111915063884081471920/reviews
Taimur Ali,4,"The Beef Nihari was fabulous.  Chicken Sheekh Kabab was quite decent. They had ran out of the Shami Kabab unfortunately,  had to leave the place without trying it out.

The indian guy at the store was very helpful and friendly going out of his way to make us feel welcomed at the restaurant.

All in all, loved my dining experience!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110819614175608226262/reviews
