Hwee Hoong Teo,1,"Went to buy onion. Witnessed the shop keeper sold a frail old uncle a can of 425g Ayam brand sardine fish for $5.90. He still explained to me the can isade is made Sg so more expensive than NTUC. Then I saw the can was a bit dented and asked him to change for old uncle. He simply put the dented in a blue plastic bag.Then I left. When I turnedI saw the old uncle holding the blue plastic bag. Later I checked online the Ayam brand Sg. It is stated on the can: Made in Malaysia.
