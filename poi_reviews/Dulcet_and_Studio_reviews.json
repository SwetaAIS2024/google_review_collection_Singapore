The colour is a bit too intense and artificial but the flavour was really well balanced and not too sweet.\n\nThe rolls are made fresh on the day according to the staff and must be consumed within 3 days of purchase (but it‚Äôs really +2 days from date of purchase).",

      "text": "This is hands down my favourite cake shop in Singapore. Love that the bakery has Japanese inspired fare, and used to host baking lessons by Japanese instructors in the past, which were really well conducted. The Pandan Swiss roll is to die for - it‚Äôs so soft and moist with a strong pandan flavour (better than a certain other famous brand). The coconut cream, desiccated coconut flakes and gula malaka jelly added a nice touch. Loved the matcha series - matcha cream puff and strawberry shortcake; latter is the best in Sg. Has a very distinct and robust matcha flavour. I also like the tea/coffee jellies and scoop cake.\n\nAs a long time customer for the past ten years, I feel it is a shame that the outlet in Clarke quay closed down and the prices have increased with inflation over the years. Some cakes have also reduced in size. Nonetheless, I‚Äôll continue to repurchase as I feel the desserts have maintained its quality taste wise.\n\nHave to add that the service at the Taka location is very good too, aunty is ichiban at promoting the items and offered me free ice packs to keep the desserts cold for my journey home. Will continue to support.",
