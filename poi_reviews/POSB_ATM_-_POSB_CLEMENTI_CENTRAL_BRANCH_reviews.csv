Siti Raudah,1,"Very disappointed, Slow service, long waiting time, very rude frontline customer service at the entrance, the video teller machine queue was super long waiting and I saw no staff assisting at the VTM. the officer at the entrance kept telling people to join the queue at the VTM BUT she didn't realise is there any more space to queue there? Is this a Bank or wet market?",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101884139621558656033/reviews
