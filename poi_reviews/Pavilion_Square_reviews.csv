Ice Water,5,"-Promising mall with potentials

New mall features a modern design and a good mix of stores. While some areas are still under development and a few stores are not yet open, the mall shows great potential. It‚Äôs clean, with friendly staff, and worth a visit as it continues to grow in this prime location. The Mall is situated at a strategic location.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110062233494452531515/reviews
Paul Zhong,5,"Plus point üëâ It is one of the few malls that has air-conditioning.

Tried the food and drinks at moon cafe. Surprisingly, it tasted quite good! üëç
The price is acceptable for a town area like this.

The mall is not crowded and it has several shops that are operating on ground level.

Did a self-exploration tour around the shopping mall and come up with this conclusion:

A strata mall that is slowly building up. It has great potential for small/medium businesses and start-up!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116561430138684232772/reviews

Adrian Ng,1,"A truly secured condo!

In addition to the non working keypad at main gate intended as a decoy (as advised by the security guard), highly trained ninja security guards well versed in the art of disappearance, are deployed. Quick witted, they are suspicious to verbal requests for help as well as car honks and never respond no matter the number of attempts.

Yet, it's human to err and should they be accidentally caught by delivery personnel or guests, they will demand the visitors contact residents to personally come down to open the gate, being steadfast to their dedication towards impeccable security.

Special mention goes to the Indian gentleman with irritable and menacing eyes, who appears to be running the circus as he swaggers around aggressively whenever he chooses to appear. Demonstrating the perfect art of finger pointing, he states that the policy is property management office's decision and he not allowed to grant entry for non residents including opening the gate for visitors and deliveries... which begs the question on the need for security personnel.

In dedication to the truth, attempts to clarify on the matter with the property management office have been in vain for weeks, perhaps with the office having trouble reaching out to their own resources.

Will update when i hear back, or if at all. And for those looking for free money, do feel free to contact the property management office for the security guard post. After all, you don't have to register guests nor let them in.. in fact, you don't even have to be seen nor heard.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115674941310739296551/reviews
