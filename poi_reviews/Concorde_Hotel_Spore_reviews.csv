Flo Yeow,3,"Standard bus stop, nothing much to boast. Drops you right in front of Concorde Hotel, but there's no real shelter that brings you backwards towards Somerset, or forward towards Istana. If I were you I'd likely change buses at Plaza Singapura, Dhoby Ghaut anyways; unless necessary.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Safique Ahmed,4,"We stayed at this wonderful hotel from 12 oct to 20 oct 2016. Magnificent hotel beautiful lobby, excellent service. The location was great. Breakfast was awesome (except for one day when some stale food from the previous day was served). Some more Indian items would be better. Rooms were spacious enough by Singapore standards. Excellent add-on was the complimentary handy phone with unlimited free local and international calls. Check in was quick and smooth. Pool was very good. Lounge was great and the Piano and Pianist in the evening was awesome. Location of the hotel is very central with many nearby eateries and shopping malls. The staff of the hotel were very courteous and helpful. Staying at this hotel made the Singapore trip really memorable.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111196830538975808346/reviews
