Ordered the chicken cutlet set, and actually she has other side dishes like teriyaki chicken and also ebi tempura! I love the belacan chilli, it has a spicy kick! The portioning was good too, lots of ikan bilis and kacang, and rice was fragrant as well. Very good, will be back again!",

Nasi Lemak rice portion is fragrant and healthily kept small. The chillies are not sweet like the typical Nasi Lemak but it's spicy enough to compliment the fried chicken wing. Overall, it's delicious food prepared without haste and one can fully appreciate the desires of the owner to serve healthy, yummy and yet affordable food.",

The rice was also delicious but too small in portion even for a small eater, not enough to go with the sambal and ikan bilis. Unfortunately, the otah was quite stale. Satay is available at night.",
