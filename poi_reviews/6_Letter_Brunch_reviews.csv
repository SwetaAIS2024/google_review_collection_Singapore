Sigit Sugiarto,5,"Popped by 6 Letter Brunch randomly for dinner with my 2-year-old and was pleasantly surprised. Didnâ€™t expect much, but the waffle was actually really good and the food overall was impressive. Nice bonusâ€”free kids meal on weekdays when you order a main and any drink. Definitely worth a visit!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117719032032435612093/reviews
S C,3,"Coffee was decent
The bread dish - sourdough could have been toasted for longer. The cheese coupled with the tomato sauce made it very mushy after awhile :(

Rosti was bland and very oily ðŸ˜© roast chicken was cooked well

Also the seats gave me abit of rash - I think it hasnâ€™t been cleaned in awhile.

Atmosphere is cozy but would only return for drinks and not the food.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106633096360984597573/reviews
Chris T,3,Went there all the way from the north-east since reviews are good. Food is not that fantastic for the travel. Price is steep for the portion of food. Much better rosti elsewhere and more generous portion with sour cream.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101649473283894655097/reviews
