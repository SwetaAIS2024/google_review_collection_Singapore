A staff member who specializes in tea pours tea for customers using a long-tipped teapot (?I don't think so?). It seems like you can get a second helping as well. I'd like to say that it's an outstanding technique and doesn't spill a single drop, but you have to be careful as hot water sometimes splashes out (lol).\nBecause the prices are high... Maybe there are cheaper and better options in Chinatown?",
