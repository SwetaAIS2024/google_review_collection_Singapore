Meg van Gennip,1,"Had an awful experience with the cashier. We were given $15 vouchers from Malaysian Airlines due to a flight delay, but the cashier claimed they were only worth $5 (she kept the voucher with her). I didn’t question it at first, but when another voucher was scanned later, it correctly showed $15.
To make matters worse, I tried to purchase something for $4.75 and was told I couldn’t use the voucher unless the total was at least $5—which was also incorrect. Very disappointing service.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106833408802378741689/reviews
