Flo G,5,"Chanced upon this facility attending a hpb 365 class.

The studio is spacious, clean and well ventilated.

Surprised to find a super pleasant club, very nicely equipped with nice outdoor pool, 2 level gym facilities, 2-3 restaurants in the same facility.

The overall environment is very zen with lots of outdoor spaces and water features.

Staff are helpful from security personnel to gym recept.

Location is less than 8 min walk from Boon Lay MRT station.

Definitely love to be back and explore.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113094459489500763998/reviews
Chandu Shekar,1,This is the 2nd time my company organized a party here & everytime the Indian food tastes really bad. If you guys dono how to cook Indian food better hire a good Indian chef or order the food from an authentic Indian resturant from Little India. Please dont insult the Indian cuisines.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107577259433478123219/reviews
rudy ridwen,5,"A good-size children pool, but can be very crowded at times. Because of the SAFRA buildings nearby, the pool will have a shade from both the morning and evening sun. So if youâ€™re worried about the scorching sun, then this pool is perfect for 8am or 5pm swims. Another good thing is the lifeguards have a good view of the whole pool and they are very attentive and alert. Kudos to them!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115639235466606138532/reviews
Chian Song Lim,4,"It is a 5 to 8 min walk from Jurong Point MRT. It seems more oriented for family with kids compared to most of the SAFRA. It has a Springleaf prata, Jack Place and an indian restaurant for food. Remember to show your members for a 10% as sometimes they won't ask.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117597573277381456027/reviews
