It's a popular resting spot for mountain bikers since it lays along the Bukit Timah Mountain Bike Trail. There's no shade, so it's best to visit early morning or in the evening if you plan to spent some time there.",

And when she was 4 metres above the ground, the rope SNAPPED and she landed on the back.\n\nShe's currently in the ICU and is currently only able to blink her eyes, and might be permanently disabled for life.\n\nI'm absolutely appalled at the lack of safety measures here, this is not something you'd expect from Singapore. You would think a rock climbing facility would have better sense than this.",
