William Petty,1,"Just called to ask about purchasing wood for a project I am working on. I asked if the company sells Pine Timber Products as well as the Sizes. I also asked if they knew anyone who would be able to help me. The response was an immediate and abrupt 'Cannot' followed by being hung up on. I was astonished by how rude this was and the lack of care.

I would highly un-recommend this company.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110108067677287640701/reviews
