Ojisan “Hiroshi”,5,"I feel very sorry for myself for not noticing and trying out this stall for the past 1 year.

Their BKT is elite! At $6.50 per bowl comes with 2 thick and juicy pork loin.

Great tasting soup that’s refillable.
I also love the fact that they minced up their garlic.

I personally felt that their quality rivals SongFa but at a much more affordable pricing.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112623517876975514039/reviews
Josephine Oh,5,The best value for money Bak Kut Teh and Braised Pig Trotters! The Bak Kut Teh has a very traditional peppery fragrance and the braised pig trotters melt in your mouth with a homemade taste and don’t feel jelak! Very affordable pricing and  portion also — a must try when you’re at this hawker! Will definitely be back for more!,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108015965176671219696/reviews
Ron Ng,3,"Came by for lunch on a weekend. Found this rather interesting new stall . Ordered the mixed parts collagen soup, Kong Pao pig trotters, preserved veg along with rice.
The white collagen soup based is the same soup based on all their other dishes like the kway chap. The soup itself is similar to other collagen soup from steam boat stall but on the lighter side and peppery. The other ingredients found in the soup  belly shabu, stomach and small intestine were prepared well.
Their Kong Pao pig trotters is also a different take from the usual. The gravy is less thick, you find the dried chilli and it has some Sichuan peppers. What I like is in my bowl, they gave meaty pieces along with the bony trotters part.
The preserved veg tasted less salty than others and you get a nice garlicky aroma with it.
Will definitely come back couple of months later and check if they can make the collagen soup slightly more robust.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102898821791109530498/reviews
Asia Apparel,5,"10 years no dine in AMK. Underrated store this is. A hidden gem. This is a special white kway chap pork bone collagen soup peppery pork stomach and light taste of the sweet salty carnation milk. Meat fresh, kway smooth. $5.00 + $2.00 for the kway chap soup add pork tummy for the best of both world experience. Like the taste, not too heavy, just right for an old man like me.
Somemore open from 10am to 8pm. Hangover can come eat. Sunday close.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112168507594751691491/reviews
Jodeci Fine,5,"We all love traditional black version kway chap, the herbal within it is so aromatic.

Then we found this stall, they have BKT, Pork Trotters and the only stall in SG (I guess) that sell one of a kind *White Kway Chap*. White version of kway chap sounds so interesting. Order 1 bowl at $5.50 for sharing. They serve quite big portion with alot of kway.

They use bkt broth with nice herbal and peppery taste that's neither too strong nor too light. Kway(ccf style) is very thin and smooth but firm bite. Comes with intestine, stomach, lean meat and 五花肉. Their  咸菜 is also well-cooked which is non salty at all and very 开胃. Overall, excellent broth excellent taste. Finished till the last drop and will be back again.
