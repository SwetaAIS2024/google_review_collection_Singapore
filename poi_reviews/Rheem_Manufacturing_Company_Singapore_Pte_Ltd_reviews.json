The second one had broken shower head (plastic) twice, but Apple was a great help in resolving! Only issue is Rheem should make sure their hardware is more durable! But customer support is really the BEST!",

      "text": "I bought and installed this Rheem Instant water heater RTLE-33M as recommended by my colleague. It was a trusted brand with long history. The two instant water heaters was installed at my two bathrooms during home improvement exercise by HDB.\nInitially had some water pressure issues so called up the Customer service hotline. A CS agent by the name of Applelyn attended to my call. She was courteous, patience and very helpful. She addressed all the concerns I had and referred me to their technical advisor who kindly advice me to adjust the regular knob at the inlet pipe which solve the water pressure issue. The asistance didnâ€™t stop there, a few weeks later their technical personnel called at my residence to check on my water heater to ensure I am satisfied with my purchase. I am truly impressed by their professionalism and customer service, it is truly second to none.",
