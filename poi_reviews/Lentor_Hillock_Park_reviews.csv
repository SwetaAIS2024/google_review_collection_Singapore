Beary Beary,3,"Once a beautiful forest

It was a beautiful forest teeming with life. There was even a with a tiny stream flowing thru it. Of course it was very difficult to trek through that. The forest was razed to yield a huge field about the size of 30-40 football fields with walkways. Thankfully they left the top of the hill untouched - the last remnant of the forest. Now with construction going on, the place is slowly degrading with the quiet serene giving way to mechanical noises.

I wonder if Singapore didn't have any other land available for development like large unused government owned bungalows.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101788329090998743221/reviews

Shaunlepaks,3,"Like many say, the park was wide, clean, and scenic with an endless view of natural greenery and the sky. I certainly enjoyed walking as it certainly felt like trekking in a beautiful European field.

But it’s no longer nice ever since the construction of Lentor Hills and Lentor Modern condos started.

The construction companies, building them, cleared most of the “park” and leave the far outer parts of it, which isn’t the best.

Lots of super wet and bumpy areas that make walking difficult, unless you don’t mind getting your shoes soaked.

But the worst part is the construction workers littering everywhere because throwing trash into bins is too difficult.

As a result, the whole place sadly looks like a dumping ground now, “decorated” with discarded food packets, cans, and plastic bags.

It’s certainly sad seeing this happen.

But then again, this park isn’t meant to last as even it’s actually just a cleared space to build the condos.

Can’t imagine how much messier the place will be once they’re finished and house hundreds of many new residents.

It’ll certainly look nothing as beautiful as it initially did.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115065095722603350376/reviews
