Maud Roubeaud,5,"Amanda is an amazing coach—supportive, attentive to your needs and goals, and full of contagious positive energy. I can’t recommend her enough! I also had a consultation with Dr. Tyler at the clinic and really appreciated his attention to detail and the time he took to explain everything thoroughly. A wonderful, human-sized health and wellness center!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110588872698172109149/reviews
Carolyn Lum,5,"I’ve been working with Coach Amanda since November 2023, and it’s been a game-changer. Alongside Dr. Tyler for bloodwork, the clinic offers a true one-stop solution for optimal health—everything is guided by data, so you know exactly where you’re at and how to improve.

Coach A is such a vibe—your biggest cheerleader and “rah rah” person, but also someone who keeps you grounded and real. Her approach is incredibly wholesome. It’s not just about building muscle or losing fat—she emphasizes mobility, personalized nutrition, and mental wellness too. She’s a total superstar and all-rounder.

I’ve also been on her program, The Method, and it’s like having a coach in your pocket. Life changes, things get busy, but The Method is my anchor—something I always come back to when the world gets a little overwhelming.

What I love most is that Amanda is never shy to share. She’s overflowing with knowledge, always ready with resources, and truly committed to uplifting women. She leads with heart and purpose—and it’s genuinely inspiring.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115783194991552994736/reviews

Laura S,5,I saw Coach Amanda and Dr Tyler as I am postpartum and looking to get back to being me. I wanted to know where I stand with lacking any nutrients and how my overall health is. It was such a great session and I’m looking forward to the process of getting back to me! They really did a full 360 it was excellent.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116979594761787273241/reviews
Megan Markgraf,5,I have been working with Amanda for over a year. She provides my workouts and keeps me accountable on my meal tracking. She's so knowledgeable and helpful in more ways than nutrition and workouts. She doubles as your cheerleader too. I love not having to think about my workout and being told what to do. Highly recommend her services!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106897467787378847305/reviews
