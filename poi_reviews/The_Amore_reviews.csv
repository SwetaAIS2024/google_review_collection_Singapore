antihunter,3,"[I am writing as a resident of Punggol estate, who stayed here for 11+ over years and my honest opinion in my review when visiting the condos, so that individual can assess the pros and cons before any commitment.]

Each EC or condo has its pros and cons. But for The Amore EC in Punggol, although its a small project, its definitely better than some other EC/private condo projects in Punggol. E.g. Grand Entrance and drop-off point, Entry to guard house can buffer to up 3-4 visitor cars in queue which a number of condos cannot.

Basement carpark with air-condition at B1 lift lobby.

Overall the estate, common areas and common facilities are well maintained. Maintenance fee is $308+ for 6 strata and $360+- for 7 strata unit.

BBQ is at level 16 Sky garden of each block so that the smoke don't affects other residents. It has a handicap friendly toilet at level 16 as well.

The Amore EC is also right beside Horizon Primary school which is 1 of the best primary school in Punggol, where parents need to ballot+volunteer-work in order to get their kids in.

Floor Plan wise, its quite squarish and easy to fit most of the furnitures.

Walking distance 4min+ to nearby kopitiam and Giant along Punggol Central (no need to cross the road). To Oasis LRT or Oasis Terrace is around 7mins+ walk.

The Amore EC is near to the upcoming Cross-island Riviera MRT in Year 2031-2033 (already announced by LTA) along Punggol Central Road beside the Fire Station, which is 150meters away.

The disadvantage point is there is no shower facilities for visitors who swim at the pool, and will need to go to owner's unit to shower. The connecting staircase from basement carpark to Function Room has no shelter if it rains. The drop-off point for guest or resident has no shelter if it rains. The Function Room is quite big but has no water basin to do washing which is commonly found in other condos, end up have to wash in the common toilet beside function room (15 steps away).

There are also feedbacks that the sinked fund for this EC is very LOW, to the point that the Mgmt Committees is going to impose Special Levies on their residents from Year 6 and Year 9, payment in 2 tranches amounting to few thousands dollars for each tranche. If you are a potential buyer of this resale EC, you have to be prepared to fork out additional money for sinked fund (estimated >$8,000 for 2 tranches) after buying a unit here. This is in view that The Amore EC is a smaller condo with lesser residential units, resulting in higher maintenance fees and sinking funds. The seller or seller agent is unlikely to be truthful about this since it is to their disadvantage. Just take note of this.

For units with no west sun, there are limited units that are internal facings; stack 10,11,15 and 16.

Stack 17,20,23 and 24 have no west sun but directly face the horizon primary school.

Stack 02,08, 18,19, 21 and 22 are internal pool facing but will face direct west sun.

Thus far, this is the only EC in punggol that comes with an open area yard with a retractable cloth hanger, similar to those of HDB.

Overall, the pros still outweighs the cons, give a 3.5 stars.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107409081859681251262/reviews
SeraFina Faith,3,"Extremely small living & dining area although it's a 3-bedder unit. From the main door leading to the living room is a very narrow walkway. The kid's bedroom is probably just twice the size of a HDB utility bomb shelter. Typical space constraint for ECs. Also, the facade of these ECs are basically the same: similar colour and structure; dark gray everywhere.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107732054545832504634/reviews

Hanna Psalms (Hanna),5,A great place to live for beginning a family. With the pool and sky gym. Everything you need is there.  Security is alert and good. But problem with booking with bbq.
