Alex H,4,"Came upon this stall selling many varieties of stewed soup & steamed rice. It only opens between 1230pm-130pm which usually abit late for my lunch hour.
Queue started to form after it opens. The food is great and value for money. The price ranges for the soup & steamed rice from $3.5-$5.5 excluding rice. They do sell steamed fish in various flavors. If you are near here, should give it a try.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109162830319538035020/reviews

The 老黄瓜汤 is damn power but little meat (肉骨) expected huge chunk of meat with little 老黄瓜 $3.5 for the soup not cheap these days.
