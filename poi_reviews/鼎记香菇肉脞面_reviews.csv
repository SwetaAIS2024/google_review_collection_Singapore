JieMuSi Chen,2,"Ate there a few times, no doubt their noodles are good but not at this hougang outlet. Got quite a few not so good experiences at this outlet. Firstly, the cooks are quite rude, can argue with customer, the ingredients they give I feel like not worth the price and quite different in portion from other outlets that I've eaten. Secondly, the hygiene issue was also worrying, I saw a bunch of files circling the food at the display shelf in front of me but the staff didn't do anything. The staff just added the ingredients that the files was feeding on into the soup in front of me. Handling food and cash with bare hands at the same time is also a no no to me. I'm not a demanding customer but just can't stand the hygiene habit of the staffs.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106155891948368193507/reviews
