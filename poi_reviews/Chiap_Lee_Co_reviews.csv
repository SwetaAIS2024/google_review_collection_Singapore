Murdani,5,"First time getting an arai helmet here. Shop was empty, only me and the sales lady who assisted me. She lets me try the size as she checked for the stock of the helmet of my choice. Lots of choices mind you. Sales lady also showed me the features of the helmet and taught me how to wear the full face helmet the right way. Will be back to shop for more.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113870671075667276084/reviews
Umar S.,1,"Has and will always be a shop you go to, only if you know exactly what you want, and you absolutely can’t get an Arai anywhere else.

The bespectacled guy in there is like a fly on the wall. Don’t hesitate to tell him how you feel about his behaviour! I did. He no longer fronts the shop nowadays; he’s at the back or in the office changing visors and/or getting the helmet inventory. The current guy who engages with customers is a nicer guy.

Having said that the prices are ok and the range is pretty decent. But an individual order will take “2-3 months”.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109274101845616976539/reviews
Siti Farihah,1,"The seller with glasses was rude and judgmental, which made the whole experience frustrating. Instead of being helpful, they were dismissive and unprofessional. Definitely not the way to treat customers. Bad service. Will never return or buy any from them.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108624860885566132943/reviews
Kirostory,3,"Decent service, I did not get the negative end of service like other reviews did.

Uncle in glasses were average in helping me, decent interaction.

Somehow I’m just a little taken away, is it me or weird that Arai helmet padding doesn’t come with its individual packaging ? More over from an official distributor.

Dude just hand me a set of internal padding, “they come like that”

I think Arai takes pride in its product and pretty sure they don’t come without packaging.
Well, it’s either from a separate helmet or something else I’m guessing.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104641923179014895189/reviews
Ramin Roshan,5,"Gave a call at 1850 hrs & told him that I was on my way to purchase an arai helmet. Guess what, he waited for me to arrive before closing his store. Was very happy with my purchase of VZ Ram and ended up buying 2 helmets. He is passionate about arai products & explained clearly about the ventilation system. Highly recommended I would rate
Chiap Lee 10/10. The best authorised dealers for Arai helmets in town.

Thank you sir.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106572851166780505493/reviews
