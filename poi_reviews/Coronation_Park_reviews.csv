Trixie Liao,4,"Loving the new upgrades to the park! The kids affectionately calls it their pirate ship! Although the grass patch was taken up to build the playground, I'm sure the kids don't mind. Kids did complain that there were only 2 swings and none for babies. There are also no seats around the park for the caregivers/ parents.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113764379010622368189/reviews

Tyng Yong Chew,4,"Used to be where my kindergarten was. It's really a kid and elderly playground. There is no fitness corner for pull up or dips.
But I guess the kids like the upgrade.
Every Thurs evening around 7pm, there is zumba session too.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113520191882149416166/reviews
