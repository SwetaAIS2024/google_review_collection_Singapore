Srikanth Sanderesegeret,5,"I visited the florist section today at around 7 PM to purchase roses for my wife‚Äôs birthday and was assisted by Nichi. I was looking for a bouquet with 5 rose stalks and baby‚Äôs breath, but unfortunately, only 3 stalks were readily available. Nichi went above and beyond by personally selecting and matching additional stalks to complete the bouquet beautifully.

Her dedication, attention to detail, and outstanding customer service truly impressed me. Thanks to her efforts, I left the store with a lovely bouquet and a happy heart. Nichi is truly an asset to your outlet, and I sincerely appreciate her kindness and commitment.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101473617797553223475/reviews

Lim Tiong,1,"What NTUC said, the seafoods price stayed put.
On 25/1/25(Sat) 9.45am went to Jurong Point FairPrice to buy Red Grouper.
Asked few staffs and they replied, fishes not yet come with various of reasons, have to wait. Okay, waited till 11.25am, finally it arrived. So surprised that they have ONLY 2 BIG SIZES RED GROUPER and that all.
One of the senior any how point the small tuna (bonitoes) to me saying that are grouper fish. OMG what kind of service? Very disappointed.
Is this a kind of promotion, no fish on sale yet say no increase of prices. üëéüò£‚òπÔ∏è",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114242341984908034434/reviews
