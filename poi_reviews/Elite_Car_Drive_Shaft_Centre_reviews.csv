Chan Seek Kian,5,"From the reviews, I took a chance and send my car to Elite Centre. I know from other workshops the problem with my car's drive shaft. Jason was spot on with the issue when he drive tested my car and explained the work needed. It was rectified in same day and the charges is extremely reasonable. Very professional, honest and efficient. Highly recommended.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102307093033689663601/reviews
Chin Hung Tan,5,"I had an ongoing issue with my car‚Äôs steering rack, which had been replaced twice within six months by another workshop. Unfortunately, neither repair lasted more than three months. Thankfully, a friend recommended Jason and his team, and I‚Äôm glad I took their advice.

Not only did they offer a repair option that cost a fraction of what I had been paying for used parts (about 1/5 of the price), but they also completed the job in just about a day and a half. I dropped my car off late on a Friday afternoon, and by the Tuesday's noon, the issue was fully resolved.

What really impressed me was their honesty and transparency. Unlike many other workshops that rely on paid marketing or ask customers to boost their ratings, this shop‚Äôs Google reviews are genuinely earned. Jason and his crew live up to their reputation of providing excellent service. Highly recommended!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109903469181317373636/reviews
Amirul Harith,5,Was recommended by a friend as I was having issues with my drive shaft cover. Contacted Jason and he was very prompt to respond. He even did a test drive before and after changing the drive shaft cover to ensure that all was good. The service was also reasonably priced.

Chung Leong Chin,5,"Visited Elite for some click-clock sound from steering column which bothering me for long time. Had checked with few other workshop but none is confident to resolve it. Some even propose to replace steering rack. Went to Elite, attended by the boss Jason, proposed to leave car for 3 days to troubleshoot and repair, even estimate the cost. In the end, the problem identified and solved within same day at a very reasonable price. Jason listened carefully when I describe the problem, tested and heard the noise but some other can't. He is experience and very detail.

Nicholas Lim,5,"Came here on a Saturday for some preventive maintenance on my original 12 y.o. driveshafts. Reasonable pricing for boot replacement and regreasing. Work is done fast and workmanship is good. Came back a few days later to check on a small suspected issue and the boss helped me look at it thoroughly, and was very patient throughout. The people here are honest and reassuring, with a positive attitude towards the customer. Will use their services again.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100996504202835437270/reviews
