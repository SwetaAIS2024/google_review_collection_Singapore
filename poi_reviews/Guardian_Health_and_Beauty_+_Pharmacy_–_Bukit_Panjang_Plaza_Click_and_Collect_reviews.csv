cindy ang,1,"Counter lady staff is so rude to me, buy an eyeliner but no ink ask for refund or exchange immediately, push to china staff. I spend 30 mins asking for refund, so disappointed. Hope management can do something about it. Time 8.20pm date: 6 march 2025",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114478283568596725717/reviews

Devion Pang,5,Had a pleasant experience at this outlet when I was purchasing supplements for my mother-in-law. A staff approached me and recommended another supplements which was better. The staff was knowledgeable in terms of providing the necessary information I need as well. Definitely recommend this outlet!,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115017680678984205993/reviews
Daniel Loo,1,"Staff are rude, allow queue cutting.

I was queuing to pay for an item at the cashier. A woman dress in a black blouse and black trousers claiming to be a guardian staff barged in front of me and rushed to the casher as the position opened up. Later I realised she was helping to pay for another lady in a mobility device. It would have been better if she had explained it or asked to go first because she was helping someone instead of shouting that she is a guardian staff and rushing to pay before I can react.

Bad experience, will not shop at guardian again. Will go shop at Unity or elsewhere instead.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113487761129414950057/reviews
