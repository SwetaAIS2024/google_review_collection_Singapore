      "text": "There’s something incredibly comforting about a well-made bowl of pork soup noodles, and this one did not disappoint. The broth was rich and deeply flavorful, with a perfect balance of umami and sweetness. It had that slow-cooked depth that comes from hours of many ingredients, making every sip satisfying.\n\nThe noodles were cooked just right—firm yet springy, soaking up the broth without turning mushy. As for the pork lard, it was very crunchy, with just the right amount of fat to keep things indulgent but not overwhelming.\n\nOverall it was a heartwarming dish that delivered on both taste and texture. Whether you’re craving comfort food or just looking for a solid noodle dish, this is definitely worth trying.",

      "text": "Ordered a bowl of Mee Pok with Prawn for $7, which I initially thought was pricey. First impression: the portion of Mee Pok seemed small, but I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the prawn. The Mee Pok was slightly hard at first, but after a few bites and stirring, it reached the right texture and paired well with the sauce. The bowl of soup was packed with ingredients, justifying the price. The prawn was fresh and even better than what I had at a famous prawn noodle stall the week before. Overall, it was an enjoyable breakfast.",
