      "text": "A Big Thank you to Scott, Joan and their team for being our indispensable interface with the outside world while we were confined to the dock under\n“Not To Land” orders for 7 months in Singapore during the Covid-19 lockdown. They navigated the ever-changing restrictions and regulations for crew changes, organised supplies, shipments and contractors, our visit to the shipyard, bunkering and negotiated the all important occasional Day Passes for the crew. Always a pleasure to work with, I have no hesitation in recommending them to my fellow captains.",
