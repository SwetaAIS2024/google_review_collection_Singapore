      "text": "We had not been to Yoshinoya for more than a year and were surprised to find that the entire menu had changed, including the removal of the soda fountain.\n\nYou now have to order your food via kiosks, and bottled drinks are sold instead.\n\nFood-wise, I still prefer the previous offerings as the new ones don’t taste the same anymore. The meat was rather dry, and I disliked the fact that the rice was too plain for me. There was hardly any sauce with the beef. Additionally, I was appalled by the way the chicken was cooked—with batter? That’s not how the Japanese cook karaage, right? Rectangular blocks of chicken?\n\nI’m sorry. I’m not sure I will visit again unless they refresh the menu/dishes once more. It’s telling when you notice that Song Fa BKT next door is packed with a queue forming outside, while Yoshinoya has very few diners.\n\nI just wish Yoshinoya Singapore could be as good as Yoshinoya Japan.",
