Joey,3,"Love the atmosphere and environment of the store. Clean and well organised, everything was neat and tidy.

They don’t charge GST or service charge, so you’ll just have to order and pay from their QR code on the table, collect your meal in front and return your tray after you’re done.

They offer self service water, and there’s an array of condiments for you to use at your table.
I would say it’s good for customers looking for a fuss-free meal, especially solo diner friendly.

Ordered the regular broth Hokkaido ramen ($12.90). It came with bamboo shoots, black fungus, seaweed, half an egg and 2 slides of char siu.
Decent bowl of ramen, but nothing outstanding. Enjoyed the addition of bamboo shoots and the char siu was so tender.

Soup was slightly too salty for me unfortunately.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111353835220742920249/reviews
Yen Trinh,5,Rare and wonderful find in Bukit Timah Plaza. The heavy broth is a bit too salty for me (they did warn you in advance on the saltines) so I usually go for the Black Garlic Oil Ramen. Absolutely tasty! Staff is friendly and the place is cozy and clean. I'll definitely be back again!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106124579273314676288/reviews
