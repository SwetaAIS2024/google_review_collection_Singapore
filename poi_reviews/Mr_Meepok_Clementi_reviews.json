The fish cake and meatballs were tender and nicely marinated, and I enjoyed the sliced mushrooms too which had a strong vinegary taste. Good value at 5.50 I feel. Definitely worth recommending.",

The onsen egg is a great addition as once stirred in, gave the noodles a creamy texture. The aburi pork slices while thin is packed full of flavour too. For $6.50, this is a must try.",

      "text": "Came on a Tuesday morning, lots of seats available in the coffeeshop. Queue was also fast and service was great; they sent the food to my table.\n\nOrdered the signature minced meat noodle with Meepok (plus chilli and vinegar). Texture of the noodles were great, ingredients were generous. I love the lard’s flavour in it too. Albeit the ingredients being really good, I somehow feel that something is lacking from this bowl (not sure if it’s because the flavour is towards the sweeter side rather than savoury).\n\nNonetheless, still enjoyed this bowl of meepok!",
