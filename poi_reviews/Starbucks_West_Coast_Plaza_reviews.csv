Will,4,"Food is standard but hopefully staff doesn't keep cakes when it's only 9pm. Cakes and pastries are often out of stock too.

Prefer the old Starbucks layout. The new layout has v feel aircon seating inside.

Mechandise wise, quite well stocked.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118119525043286062929/reviews

Danny Kwok,5,"Great place near my residence in a homely mall. Can be really crowded during peak hours. Services are good and I started to use the apps to place dine in orders at my convenience. You can also study till 10pm at off peak hours as well. If you are driving, there are a lot of parking lots which is kid friendly.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100941619232436573829/reviews
Cheang Hock Chaun,1,"Dear Customer Service Manager,

I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with my recent experience at your West Coast Starbucks location. On February 26, 2025, I visited your store to collect an order for delivery, which had been placed via the Grab app.

Upon arrival, I requested the order from the cashier, Fahana, who informed me that the order had not arrived. After further inquiry, she mentioned that the machine had not printed out the order. Based on my previous experiences, I suggested that the issue might be due to a machine shutdown, which may have prevented the order from being processed.

I then asked Fahana to manually prepare the order based on the details shown on my phone, which indicated a simple order that did not require any customizations. I handed my phone to her to ensure accuracy and requested that the order be prepared as quickly as possible, as I was in a hurry to complete my delivery.

However, Fahana seemed to misinterpret my tone and became agitated, stating that I could choose not to take the order if I did not want it. She then told me to wait in a very rude manner. This response was unexpected and unprofessional, leaving me disappointed with the level of service provided. Indeed, I was angry and upset.

To my shock, I then heard Fahana utter a Malay slang, ""manpos,"" which translates to a highly offensive phrase in English. When I confronted her about it, she remained silent and threatened to ban me from the store on the Grab platform. Despite my frustration, I calmly requested that she treat the rider nicely and say thank you.

Sincerely,",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109766610590300453042/reviews
