Esmond Chun,4,"Walk pass and decided to buy the red bean bun for a try.
The bread is soft and came with a pack of 4 small bun.
Opening it and tasted the red bean is smooth and soft (not too dry or wet).  If they could put a litter more of the red bean will be fantastic and super!
Overall, could try their others products.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113754482951461644092/reviews
Dawn H,1,"This neighborhood old-school bakery has been around since my school days (2000s), but it’s no longer like before.

Bought a birthday cake from them on 21 May 2022 to celebrate my mom’s birthday. Paid $30 and was told it’s a discount from $33. Cake is large (30cm) but felt very light in the box. At that moment I felt I overpaid for it but let it go cos the design is cute.

Upon cutting the cake it has a crumbly texture and did not look smooth. It is dry and the taste is disappointing.

While eating, we found 2 large pieces of eggshell buried within it, it was horrendous.

We ate the leftover cake today and found a third piece of eggshell. Just look at its size.

This will be the last time I buy from this bakery.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110255087286474095050/reviews

charlene ho,1,"My recent visit to the bakery store was marred by an unfortunate encounter with the staff member in charge of baking waffles. Despite my anticipation for a pleasant experience, I was met with rudeness and indifference. The lady responsible for baking waffles displayed unprofessional behavior. I hope management addresses this issue promptly to maintain the bakery's reputation for quality service.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116920326416733230837/reviews
