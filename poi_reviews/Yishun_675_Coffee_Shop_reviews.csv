Christopher Lai,2,"Expensive and deceitful bak chor mee stall. They advertise their noodles as being filled to the brim, yet the actual portion is pathetically tiny. Worse still, the stall owner blasts music so loudly that he can’t hear customers. Please avoid visiting this place.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103911031610319332396/reviews
adam teoh,1,"Today having breakfast at this coffee shop my wife bought the half boil at the drink stall.After putting 12min in the hot water with cover the egg white still waterly obviouly the egg is no fresh, saw the table beside also the same. Return the egg to counter they say will change but who dare to eat the egg. So we refuse to take the egg but they dont even give back the money just act nothing.

Coldmeh,2,"Mixed reviews for different stalls which I had tried before. Read more about it below.

Fishball noodle stall - 1/5

Frequently visit this stall until something happen. Not too sure about other timing but often seen operated by 2 ladies in the morning. Food is nice and maintain its standard. Short hair lady usually is the one cooking and often very accurate n quick when taking orders. However, beware of another lady in the stall, who is usually helping to take orders and payment. Price can varies from day to day for the same item ordered for takeaway and does not tally with the price indicated.

The new guy at the noodle stall doesn’t feel like working at all.

Thai food - 4.5/5

Newly open not long ago. Ran by Thai ladies. The flavour were authentic and staff were friendly. Just have to wait abit during meal time.

Zhi char - 4/5

Never go wrong with this stall, tried over 10-15 dishes, none of the dish is bad. Standard comfort Zhi char.

Briyani stall - 3.5/5

Only tried once, their Prata was ok. Reason for not trying other dishes is that the stall lack of a visible menu to show customer what is available and the pricing.

Roast Duck Rice - 4.5/5

Ran by a kind lady boss. Extra rice and takeaway at no charges. Food is up to standard. Recommend roasted dang gui duck.

Handmade Noodle - 4/5

Affordable price and food taste great with a home feeling ran by a grumpy lady boss.
Comfort food when you are unsure what to eat.

Economic Rice - 1.5/5

Variety of food remain pretty much the same everyday. Ran by 2 uncles and 1 aunty. Seems like each individual have their own pricing chart. Price varies for same items ordered, ranging from $0.5-$1.8. Standard varies across different dish but mostly still is edible, if you don’t mind the behind the scene.

Nasi lemak/Economic Beehoon - 3/5
Average standard, pricey food.

Seen cockroaches crawling around in the mala stall I am ordering food next door.

Edward,1,"The Tze Char Stall at this Coffee Shop serving portion is ridiculously small. For $8 eggs, it’s as thin as paper and the noodle served was barely enough for kids.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117686303776793128256/reviews
