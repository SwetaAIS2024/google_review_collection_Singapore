It was raining but they managed to got us a place outside beneath the big umbrella. Later on we got a quick change to the pondok when it was empty ! Thank you for the vibrant & welcoming gesture with great service. Always my favourite stall every time !",

The devoted staff goes above and beyond to entice customers with their warm and welcoming approach, even seeking feedback on their satay. The chicken satay offers a delightful, well-balanced flavor without overwhelming spiciness. Furthermore, their goreng dishes provide an equally satisfying culinary experience.",
