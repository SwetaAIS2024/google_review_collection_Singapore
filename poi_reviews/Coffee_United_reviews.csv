Anthony Tan,5,"Good spread of various kinds of foods offered at decent prices. My personal favourite is the chicken rice stall at the corner, the guy running this stall is really friendly and generous with portions. The chicken rice tastes good and is pretty cheap starting at only $4 for white chicken breast & rice.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118056354320214079501/reviews
