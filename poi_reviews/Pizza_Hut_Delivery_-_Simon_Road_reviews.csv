R C,4,"Ordered via grab for pick up. Order was ready right on time. Cinnamon bread stick was really sweet, the butter overpowered the garlic taste in the garlic bread. Other than that, classic Pizza Hut taste and quality, nothing to shout about nor complain on my end.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117091411861389140916/reviews
Irene Tan M X,5,"Pizza Hut @ Kovan (Simon Road) area is an ideal location for people staying within the vicinity, to get their pizza fix! 😋🍕

🛵Delivery: On time, and pizzas delivered are served hot and yummy!

🚶🏻‍♂️Pickup: Can be a hassle, as it’s just a tight single lane outside the outlet with heavy traffic flow, but there are  areas for cars to stop and do collection!

Pizza fix craving easily satisfied! 😋👍🏻

Used to had another pizza chain “competitor, DMO” just slightly down the slope, along the main road, and I sometimes do alternate between both. But saw that they are permanently closed! 😭

🙏🏻 Pizza Hut please don’t closed down too!! We need our pizza in this area!!!! ❤️🍕",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107234303898599875744/reviews
Xin Hao,4,Weekday offers are pretty reasonable in terms of pricing. Very convenient as well for delivery or walk-in orders. Waiting time can extend up to >30mins during peak hours and probably also lack of manpower. Quality of pizza and wings have declined slightly over the years. Size of pizza has also shrunk.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101038177603319548234/reviews
nat reviews,5,"This pizza hut branch has been my go-to for takeaways for the last 2 years. While I see other negative reviews, I have never experienced any issue with my order - either via GrabFood or directly via their website (touch wood hahaha).

I’ve recently tried their crispy thin crust and it tastes kinda like prata (per photo). Perhaps not for me, but I can imagine it catering to a different crowd.

Will be back when the cheesy crust craving hits again (:",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105973186058375958042/reviews
Wei Yang Ang,1,"Delivery is usually late. However, this time they are late by 1 hour 15 mins and counting.  Hotline told me the store will call me back regarding my order, but no callback at all.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102186622978711862296/reviews
