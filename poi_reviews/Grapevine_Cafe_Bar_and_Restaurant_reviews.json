      "text": "Brought my family (8 pax altogether) here for a Sunday dinner. The food was pretty good, from the fish & chips and rib eye steak to the finger foods like the chicken skin and truffle fries. And the Connors Stout I washed them down with was a treat!\n\nToo bad they do not have desserts (plenty of sweet teeth in my family!) but the icing on the cake was the warm and attentive service by Michelle, our wait staff. Truly Service with a Smile!\n\nDefinitely want to go back!",

Personal favourite is the chicken skin, light yet sinfully savoury.\nAtmosphere is great on football nights when they screen live EPL games.\nStaff is friendly and approachable too.",

The waitress was attentive and the happy hour meant a small discount on beers.\n\nFood was a mixed bag with the truffle fries and meat lovers pizza excellent, the crispy chicken skin okay, and the nachos a sad joke (unsalted corn chips with a horrible commercial â€˜cheeseâ€™ sauce).",
