My wife is a regular at this Happy Hawkers coffeeshop as she is an early childhood educator at the nearby Agape Little Uni.\n\nObjectively speaking, the set meal was worth it. Please see the attached photo. The noodles, wantons, soup, etc, were very delicious and fulfilling.\n\nFurthermore, the two female stall assistants manning the stall were very hardworking and professional in doing their jobs.\n\nTherefore, I highly recommend Tai Wah Pork Noodles for all ba cho mee lovers and those looking for a healthy, wholesome and nutritionally balanced meal.",

When it came to my order she made a mistake, instead of being apologetic, she directed her frustration towards the customer, blaming for the wrong order. And cut off people mid sentence",

China lady cooking the noodle was very unhappy with the auntie who is tending orders and cashiers. But the noodle was nice with chilli and vinegar taste. Each bowl was $5 and you can ordered their big speciality bowl at $9. There are pork livers, dumpling and meatballs. So is worth the price. We also ordered the fried sole fish for $4. I also asked for pork lard to go with the noodle. Noodle kuay tiao was QQ. And will revisit again to eat since nearby our house. ðŸ˜€",
