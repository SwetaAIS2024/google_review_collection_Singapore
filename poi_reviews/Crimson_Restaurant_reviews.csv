Austin Ang,5,"Wah, totally didn’t expect the food here to be so solid, especially for a tourist spot! The view while dining is superb, facing the man-made waterfall, surrounded by colorful parrots just doing their thing.  Food wise; King prawn laksa confirms must-order. The rich coconut and prawn taste really hit the spot, super fragrant and comforting. The shared plates also don’t disappoint: truffle fries got that nice earthy flavor, and the prawn & fish combo is tasty without feeling greasy. Even the spring chicken is tender and well-marinated, really shiok! Saw some older reviews saying the staff weren’t great, but honestly? I had a totally different experience. Service was super fast, staff were attentive, and really delivered their best. Definitely worth checking out—good food, great vibes, plus solid service!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103206100473511753199/reviews

The dessert was equally impressive, rounding off the meal on a delightful note. The ambience was superb, offering a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere. Highly recommended for anyone looking for great food in a beautiful setting!

Daniel L,5,"The manager Kumar was very accommodating to our child's needs. He also helped take photos and made our dining very comfortable. He did also recommend the zoo membership and explained the dining benefits, which we will be signing up for. Overall it was a nice dining experience with a good view, great for stopovers when the weather gets hot too. We had mains and ordered many alcoholic beverages to cool off.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105551057878710401170/reviews
