Anne Jenkins,1,"Basic subjects are not well-taught, and there is a clear lack of academic rigor. The school also fails to provide proper learning resources, making it difficult for students to progress. For the fees they charge, I expected much better. If you are looking for a school that genuinely prioritizes your child’s education, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114750565043002941550/reviews
