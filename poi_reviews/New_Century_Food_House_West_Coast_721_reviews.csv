Alex K,1,The western food next to the Sze Cha is terrible. Order a pork rib and I get one big pieces of bone with inedible texture. I don’t stay there and too far to go back to complaint. Please do not patronise this western food stall. The only western food stall there. Huge disappointment.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107156879209229886337/reviews
