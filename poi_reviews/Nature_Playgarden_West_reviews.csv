Forest BK,5,"🏠The Nature Playgarden West is located near block 633B HDB.
🐲At the Nature Playgarden West is an iconic dragon-head Slide.
🛝Children at play, can choose to climb up the wooden log set into the slope or by going up the climbing wall with colourful handholds, to enjoy the ride down either on the dragon head slide or the green slide.
🧸Stool-like platforms raising from the protective rubberised surface act as Stepping Stones for children to have fun.
🧸🪅Close by is a Sandplay area with a Swing structure that includes a parent-child tandem swing.
🪜🪣There is also a small Rock Climbing Wall and other interactive structures, like the manual escalator where children can hone their sensory-motor skills while at play.
🤹🤼The Nature Playgarden is very inviting and children would surely have a wonderful time here.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
