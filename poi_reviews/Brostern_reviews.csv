June MS,5,"I hired them as caterer for my Hari Raya open house and their menu were a hit with my guests, both young and old. My guests love the variety of sauces and even dabao the only remaining nacho cheese and  black pepper home. ðŸ˜‚
The mac and cheese were a hit amongst the youngsters and were wiped out within two hours!
My first time catering western cuisine and definitely wont be my last.
Highly recommended for those who want something refreshingly new and away from the rendang n ketupat spread for Hari Raya.
Friendly staff and very responsive during enquiry.
Overall 5/5 stars.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103087484164756255097/reviews
Juanitta Palan,5,Great portions especially considering the price. Food hits the spot like old school neighbourhood western food - warms the heart and FILLS the belly. Would definitely come back even though itâ€™s out of the way for me.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107003170063521087450/reviews
Catpura,5,We came here after their closing hours (in which we did not know) yet the owner is kind enough to feed us their food. He gave us chicken chop with rice. He offered what is left from their kitchen. It was such a nice gesture of him. Please come down to support this business. Food is good too especially their salted egg aglio olio. RECOMMENDED.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116561415671907910712/reviews
Dia Sabrina,3,"We ordered the Volcano Burger & the Jumbo Burger which was about $6.50 and $7.50 respectively. It was quite disappointing because we have been meaning to try it for awhile but it wasn't as tasty as it could have been. The nacho cheese on the volcano burger was cold, the buns was cold. The beef patty itself was delicious but still.. pretty standard. I wish they added more onions, lettuce & heat the buns with butter or SOMETHING just dont serve them cold? I love the hawker center itself but Brostern, this is a stern warning to please do something about your burger aside from your patty. I want to support local businesses!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116641919843329833209/reviews
