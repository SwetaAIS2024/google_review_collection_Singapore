      "text": "I just ate here on 5 Jan 2025, Sunday 9pm, young Malay chap was working/cooking solo. The food was fresh and delicious, very generous portions.\n\nI ordered Fish and Chips, the fries were hot and crispy, the fish was huge (bigger than my open palm, and there was 2pcs), tasty and well seasoned and the bun was fluffy and airy. The Coleslaw was just normal, yummy, but nothing special. Paid $8.90 only.\n\nNot sure why there are many low reviews of the place. Maybe due to consistency of different staff working?\n\nService - Itâ€™s a coffee shop. You order, pay, and collect your food. Nothing much to it, the staff was pleasant enough.\n\nAtmosphere - Again, itâ€™s a regular coffee shop, nothing special.",

Got the steak and it was so hard and dry as if i was cutting a dried up clay block with a plastic spatula, when ordering the guy working did not even ask for how done i want my steak to be. Super inflexible, could only change coleslaw to mash potato and nothing else. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST OR ELSE YOU WILL REGRET!!!",
