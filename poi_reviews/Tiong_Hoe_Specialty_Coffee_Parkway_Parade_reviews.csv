f a,4,"Had intense latte. House brew gachalla.
Service was friendly and prompt.
Coffee was served in a ceramic cup instead of paper cup.
Smooth and delicious.
But not strong though.
I found their onyx blend is much more delicious than gachalla when I first tried them at their singpost centre outlet.

Bought mille crepe from japanese/sushi stall in the fairprice. Perfect combo.

Area is a bit noisy due to Pok√©mon gaole machine behind the coffee stand.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108197474271189843317/reviews
Sean Yeo,5,Great coffee and service! Had the intense white with nice balance. The regular white is lukewarm. The service staff accidentally spilled a bit of coffee and replaced one immediately. Good service recovery!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111550084502970416549/reviews
Princess Mania,4,"Came with a friend and ordered 2 flat whites, one with  a pastry set and one without. Nice latte art I must say and the female server was super steady when she served us. I didn't quiz the staff on the charges cos the amount seemed about there $8+ for a drink + pastry and $5.70 (correct) for another drink. But I don't recall ordering extra oatmilk  though. My fault I didn't scrutinise the breakdown of the bill properly cos I was eager to rest my legs. The coconut pastry was abit on the hard and dry side.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107320587807657797918/reviews
Lo'vyn Lai,4,"üëç Service:
The young man serving us was super helpful and professional. He overheard me asking my husband direction to the toilet and gave me a very clear direction. While we were going to the toilet, he and a female staff agree to watch our coffee for us. Before leaving, my husband asked for water using his emptied coffee cup. The young man threw away the ice stained with coffee and gave my husband new ice with water. Excellent initiative, I'd say.

üòë Coffee:
The coffee is very aromatic and taste great. However, the cup size is smaller than my palm, making it expensive and unsatisfying. With the ice taking up more than half the cup, the cold version can be finished in one gulp.

üòë Cost:
Flat white - $5.40
Change milk to oat milk - $1.10
Cold - $0.55

For clarification, it was not ""Additional milk"" or ""Additional ice"" as stated on the receipt. It was a change of milk and cold instead of hot.

üëç Environment:
Located right at the entrance of NTUC, you would expect it to be a bustling place, but the seating area is tucked away in a corner, so it is very quiet and peaceful. The seating area is also very spacious, clean, and comfortable.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117202665405496417577/reviews
JK Ong,4,"Walked into NTUC FairPrice in Parkway Parade, discovered a small little cafe nested within. There are previously little seatings available, but one can take away to drink within Fairprice‚Äôs food area. The coffee prices are a tad high considering it‚Äôs location and ambiance (or lack of). However the coffee tasted good, and is a decent place for a quick stop to curb your caffeine addiction ‚òïÔ∏è",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111019396032378373784/reviews
