      "text": "Making a sick, tired, and hungry child wait unnecessarily (over an hour) while prioritizing non-urgent cases is completely unacceptable in my opinion. As a healthcare professional myself, I find this lack of basic patient care and prioritization deeply concerning. I would never allow such poor triage decisions in my own workplace.\n\nI brought my daughter to I kidz clinic early in the morning as she woke up with a high fever and body aches. It was the only clinic that looked relatively empty. Given the weekend and the ongoing influenza outbreak, I wanted to get her seen to and treated fast. We arrived just before 9:00 AM (and didn't leave until just after 11.00am.)\n\nWe were told there would be a wait, which I understood. However, after an hour of waiting, during which there were moments of an empty waiting room, I was informed that they still needed to see five more patients before us—all for routine check-ups. There was no triaging process, no urgency, and absolutely no empathy from the staff.\n\nIf you’re looking for a clinic that understands urgency and shows compassion, this is not the place.",

      "text": "Terrible experience so far after couple visits.\nThis clinic seems to only want quick vaccinations patients.\nLast visit, I called ahead of time so to avoid miserable wait time, we arrived early as they told us to but yet we waited for 1 hour with a high fever 18mos old as they prioritised a couple of vaccinations/healthcheck cases of much older kids. When it’s our turn, it was a 5 mins doctor check up and just asked us to go home and use our existing medicine, and just rushed us out.\nWe came here before for the baby’s vaccination too, I had 2 other older children with a different doctor outside of Singapore, and they had proper growth check, while this clinic only get you jabbed and get you out. I don’t think I will come back to this doctor when my child gets sick next time. There are in fact better and more caring paediatrician in the same building.",
