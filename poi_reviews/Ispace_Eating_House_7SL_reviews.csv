T Sha,5,"2nd time here for the Western food from Kaki Corner. Its so affordable with big portion. I had Blackpepper Chicken Chop with rice and tasted so good, there was fries and coleslaw too.
The coffeeshop is clean and brightly lit, but can be a little inaccessible if you dont have a vehicle. Nearest mrt will be pioneer mrt.
Its open on weekends too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111402321974803153720/reviews
