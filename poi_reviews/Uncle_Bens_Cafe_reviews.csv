Ron,3,"The food is too oily, the rice has little flavour and the chilli used can sometimes give people diarrhea. The snacks are overpriced.

However,the chicken cutlet is nonetheless delicious and the fragrance of the oil they use makes you feel nostalgic.I wouldn't be surprised that I'll miss Uncle Ben and the food he makes 10 years down the road.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110687649047102834437/reviews
Kaine Jun,2,"Uncle Ben‚Äôs Chicken Cutlet ‚Äì A Lesson in Patience and Oil Absorption

I wanted to love Uncle Ben‚Äôs chicken cutlet rice, but what I got felt like a deep-fried oil sponge. The batter was chewy, not crispy, and the rice was soft enough to be a pudding. The sauce? Just sweet soy sauce with trust issues.

Service? Uncle Ben moves at a pace that suggests he‚Äôs solving life‚Äôs deepest mysteries between taking orders. I saw a guy order, buy a drink, chat, and still come back to wait.

The stall has rustic charm (a.k.a. needs a wipe-down). Uncle Ben is a legend, but my stomach might sit this one out.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117798316000164897790/reviews
