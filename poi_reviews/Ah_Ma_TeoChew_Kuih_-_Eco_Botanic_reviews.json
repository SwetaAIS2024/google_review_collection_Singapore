      "text": "My family has been patronising Ah Ma since 4 years ago. The Char Kway tiao is excellent. I enjoy the teochew porridge with the side dishes -my comfort food. Service is fantastic too.\n\nI like to commend your staff at the pop-up stall in Aeon Bukit Indah. I bought 8 dumplings on 20 Mar Thu at around 2.30pm but had forgotten to take it. Your staff (looks like a teenage/young adult with long hair) searched for us at the mall and she found us when we were leaving the mall. She was panting when she caught up with us so she must have searched high and low for us. We are very thankful to her for going the extra mile. Pls convey our heartfelt thanks to her!",
