Jack T,2,"Food is OK but price is extremely expensive.
We ordered portion for two. Mostly made up of veg, mushrooms and noodles, only few slices of beef and no seafood. The price came up to $24!
It is the same food and portions we usually picked for our regular mala, and it usually cost $12 to 14.
The price is ridiculous and will never eat from this shop ever.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112103700921440525861/reviews
Ong Weisheng,1,"I ordered this via an app and I have to say, paying $13+ for such a small serving of Mala Xiang Guo is really not worth it.
The amount of ingredients can fit into a styrofoam box used with plenty of room to spare.
Needless to say paying about $2 per ingredient is not worth it since the serving is so dismal.
Definitely over priced. Avoid at all cost.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113779730241487331092/reviews
