Grace Chua,1,"This stall only accept cash. Their dishes are not fresh, selling overnight left over. You can even smell the “sourness”. Not recommended.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100391093761426880100/reviews
Jun Kai Toh,3,"Good price, variety, and portion.
Taste is alright.
Be careful of those vegetable/egg/beancurd dishes with meat in them",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107198429972623127094/reviews
Jacob TAN,5,"This stall has a good variety of cooked dishes to choose from. Bought one packet of rice with fried pig liver, tofu with minced meat and sambal squid.
The pig liver is very tasty and not over cooked. It also does not have the powdery after taste which I dislike. It is as good as it gets at a chai fun stall.
The tofu is cooked in a savoury sauce with minced meat. Taste good.
The sambal sauce for the squid is very fragrant and not too spicy. The squid is soft and nice. Total price of $5.50 which is very reasonable.
This is one of the best chai fun stall. Will be back to try other dishes.

C,5,"Tried this place a couple of times. The servers were friendly and attentive. The food was good and definitely worth the price. I had rice, a portion of chicken, and a portion of vegetable for S$2.50. I hope they keep up this standard and pricing – I’ll definitely be back for more!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103681808350324057547/reviews
