The problem with this part of town is that there aren’t a lot of options and so people working there are a bit of a captive audience. They do have a lunch menu with a range of options, and the quality isn’t bad. I just wish it were a little cheaper.",

I ordered the half roasted chicken which i thought would be the small bird or spring chicken, but it was really CHICKEN! It was really well marinated and moist too.\n\nThe calamari sides and brownie ice cream desserts were really good too! Price is actually okay considering the portion.\n\nLovely place and will revisit again!",

      "text": "Great food. But since I love lengthy reviews, here it goes:\n- Fish and Chips\nGreat fish and chips. But since it wasn't beer or yeast battered, the crust was a bit thin (basically, not puffy). Honestly, this is more of an individual preference. They seem to use Cod, so it has a firmer and more moist texture.\n- Margarita pizza\nLovely pizza. It's the best pizza to test any pizza place. I wouldn't say the pizza is amazing, but it's definitely much better than your average Joe. I think the oven is an electric fired oven, so the crust has this plain burnt taste, much like you find with pizzas you do at home (wood fire has a smokey aftertaste, gas fire has a kerosene fuel aftertaste). The pizza is amazingly thin while the ingredients were a slight letdown. The basil and tomato were not as fresh as expected, or maybe just weren't at that quality I was expecting. But nonetheless, a great pizza for the price.\n- Pesto pizza\nMuch like the margarita, this pesto lacks where the margarita did too. The cherry tomato did lack that sweet burst I was craving. But the real hero was the pesto which was really good. The mint taste inside was great, combined with the shredded chicken sprinkled on top.\n\nThey do have a 1 for 1 promo which made getting a pizza here so much worth it. It's nothing life changing, but too good of a steal where price is considered in the equation.",
