      "text": "The Wagyu and foie gras Donburi was an absolute flavour bomb! The richness of the foie gras emulsified beautifully with the egg yolk, creating a fragrant sauce that coated the incredibly tender Wagyu perfectly. The portion was so generous, it comfortably kept me full right through dinner â€“ a testament to its satisfying size.\n\nWhile the culinary experience was top-notch, there was a slightly alarming moment when a nearby diner's metal chair unexpectedly broke. Thankfully, the manager handled the situation with impressive professionalism. A quick tip for expectant mothers: perhaps request one of the wooden support chairs for added peace of mind.\n\nDespite this minor incident, the exceptional view truly elevated the entire dining experience. Overall, this restaurant hits all the right notes of a top-tier establishment, delivering on flavour, portion size, and ambiance.",

They were both cook to perfection and the wagyu had a very unique blend of flavours that matches each other really well. All in all the food was really enjoyable and Vivian made our whole dining experience even more enjoyable.

Her recommendations were spot-on, and she checked in at the perfect times without being intrusive.",
