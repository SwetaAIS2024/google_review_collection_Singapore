Joakim Skjefstad,5,"I had the pleasure of meeting this bunch of people several years ago when I looked for a GUE Fundamentals diving course. Turned out to be the best course I have ever had, and I soon continued on the path of diving with them. The friends I made and the memories we shared were amazing, and they still are to this day. Good instructors and equipment, solid diving. Disclaimer: I work with this outfit these days, but it is still true.",9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108712944047750235458/reviews
