Ashley Liew,5,"Absolutely love the Christmas setup here every time if the year with its elaborate but not overly done Christmas decor, as well as Christmas carols. Lots of shopping available here all year round. The car park is easily accessible too, I could quite easily get a lot over the weekend too; slow down to look for the car park directions especially turning from the main road. Otherwise it‚Äôs easily accessible by MRT train or bus too. Long history with its first store opening back in 1932!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews

E,4,"TANGS at Tang Plaza is one of the most iconic department stores located on Orchard Road, and my recent visit confirmed its esteemed reputation within Singapore's retail sector.  It offers a diverse selection of goods suitable for both residents and tourists, with a particularly extensive range for those interested in fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products.

Location and Accessibility
Its central location on Orchard Road, directly connected to the Orchard MRT station via underground passageways, is exceptionally convenient, particularly for those visiting multiple shopping malls. The Scotts Road entrance is impressive and welcoming, retaining a touch of classic Singaporean architecture.

Store Layout and Offerings
TANGS surpasses the typical department store experience; it's a thoughtfully curated environment. The well-organized layout allows for leisurely exploration without feeling overwhelming. The ground floor showcases an extensive array of beauty products and luxury skincare brands, including La Mer, SK-II, and Est√©e Lauder.  The staff at these counters are knowledgeable and provided helpful service without being overly insistent.

On the upper floors, a stylish selection of fashion items is available, ranging from high-end international brands to local Singaporean designers.  The store's unique offerings distinguish it from other department stores and malls.  The menswear section also presents a noteworthy collection with a contemporary and understated style.

Food and Facilities
A delightful surprise at TANGS is the food area in the basement.  It features various takeaway counters and a small food court offering high-quality local cuisine.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103665268796109855493/reviews
SOS Fastlane HTTAN,5,"This is my family‚Äôs favorite Singapore department store (back when it was still known as CK Tang) and we used to come here from Kuala Lumpur for Christmas shopping, back in the 80s and 90s when KL was still a relative backwater with regards to its retail scene.

Still, for nostalgic reasons whenever in Singapore in December, I still like to come to Tangs for window-shopping and to marvel at their stunning Christmas decor as well as items for sale - including very detailed Nativity figurines in snow globes and ‚Äúexposed‚Äù versions, stuff that we can‚Äôt find in any Malaysian department store!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116879185954056892048/reviews
zell fantas,5,"I recently purchased the Dolce & Gabbana Devotion set and light blue set from Maatoori at Tang's Orchard, and I was thoroughly impressed with the service! Maatoori was knowledgeable, friendly, and went above and beyond to help me find the perfect scent. Her passion for perfumes and dedication to customer satisfaction shone through in every interaction.

Maatoori's expertise and personalized recommendations made the shopping experience truly exceptional. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a great perfume shopping experience!

Thanks, Maatoori, for making my shopping experience so wonderful",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114439523763228186778/reviews
