This is truly a store that holds the title \"economic\" at great value price. This has to be the most value pricing economic bee hoon store in Singapore. Come try with bee hoon, chicken wing, fish fillet, egg, Taiwan sausage or anything else and be surprised with the price.\n\nFull credit to the uncle never ending frying at the back and the older auntie infront serving the crowd tirelessly.",

      "text": "i don't understand how they make profit. or are they just a non-profitable funded stall. i see people ordering a lot, and only pay so little.\n\nfor instance, one uncle in front of me ordered 2 plates of bee hoon, he added 4 sides per plate. in the end he only pay $4.90!\n\nas for myself, i ordered bee hoon, 1 egg, 1 luncheon meat, half a ngor hiang, half a taiwan sausage (yes they allow you to choose half) and it's only $2.30! what!? where can you find this kind of price in 2025!?\n\nof course it's not the best that i have tasted, but if i could, i would rather choose to eat at this stall than other stalls even if they taste a little better. like the one near my place, just 1 beehoon with 1 egg and 1 fish fillet is already $3.20 knn.",

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve found a cheaper place in Singaporr. They sell bee Hoon packets",
