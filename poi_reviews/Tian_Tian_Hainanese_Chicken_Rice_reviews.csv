Lenon Tan,5,"Biased fan here, can confirm clementi stall same food standard as maxwell stall. Location coffeeshop facing MRT between NTUC Fairprice and Clementi Mall

Unique quality of tian tian: chicken meat and rice were moist, not oily nor dry as most chicken rice. Gravy sauce, chilli, even dark soy sauce were excellent.

Service was quick and accurate.

Small stall in non-airconditioned coffee shop, so i can only give 3 stars for atmosphere. Clean and plenty of tables.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108531854195491062188/reviews
Siriyakorn Tamsangchutti,4,"There are so many good chicken rice places in Singapore, but this store happens to be my favorite. The chicken is so tender and cooked just right, and the rice smells so nice that you can't stop eating it. Their chili sauce is also amazingâ€”I think I drank it, haha.

I would give their chicken rice an 8 out of 10.

However, this store is really famous, so you might need to queue for 10-15 minutes if you go there at peak times.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106804208825527357033/reviews
Ron Ng,3,"Came by for late lunch. Ordered the small portion of the chicken rice. I guess the visible main difference is you get soup along with your rice. Although breast meat is served, it is still tender and juicy. Nicely chopped in chucks and not smashed with gelatinous skin. Signature sauce draped across the chicken with freshly cut cucumbers. Chilli is slightly tangy and spicy. Nice pleasant bowl of soup. The rice that was on my plate is lightly fragrant but a little clumpy which surprised me.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102898821791109530498/reviews
David Tan,5,"Lived up to its reputation. For $6, the set came with boneless and succulent white steamed chicken and flavorful rice, a plate of bean sprouts and tasty soup. I finished everything cos it was so good. They also have roasted chicken if that's your preference.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117794888212061638357/reviews
Samuel Ng,5,"Surprised a franchise of Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken rice is now at Clementi from the original one at Maxwell Market whose history is mentioned below:

While 67 year-old stall owner Foo Kui Lian is now a familiar public face, making frequent media appearances as spokesperson of the brand, the business was actually started by her elder brother. When he started the chicken rice stall in Maxwell Food Centre in 1987, Foo, who always had an interest in cooking, started learning from him. When he decided to retire two years later, she took over the reins.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116466170234652095347/reviews
