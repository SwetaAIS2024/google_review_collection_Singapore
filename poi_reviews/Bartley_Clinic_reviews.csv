Botak,4,"An unlikely place to find a clinic amidst many spas, but surprisingly also very neat and clean.

Owned by a Dr Hisham, a Bruneiian, and he is well versed in handling LPAs. The compact clinic also charges 1 of the cheapest prices for doing up an LPA and is listed on the OPGO website.

My visit on a weekday afternoon saw no queues, and the whole process took about 20 minutes, including a short wait and consultation.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100060791396189603978/reviews
Daniel Ng,5,"Bartley Clinic was really efficient with short waiting time. Reception staff is also polite & fast in his service.

Dr Hisham is very approachable, perceptive & knowledgeable. He was able to diagnose me right away and is really candid in his sharing in a relaxed manner. He is also helpful to ensure I got what I needed to get better.

A positive experience for sure!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100110035401071252198/reviews
Elizabeth Charlotte Widjojo,5,"Bartley Clinic is not a conventional clinic you normally find in Singapore. The doctor here, Dr Hisham (who is also the owner of the clinic) cares a lot about his patient and will take his time to listen carefully to the patient's concern, then will advise accordingly. He is very empathetic, kind and knowledgeable. Would really recommend Bartley Clinic to anyone!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115647523327630287745/reviews
WL Tan,5,I was surprised to find this clinic around my Bartley neighbourhood area. It is really nicely designed and clean. No long queues and registration was efficient. Dr Hisham attended to my concerns and provided great explanation. They also do longevity and preventive medicine which I want to know more about and is a Healthier SG clinic. Surprisinly their health screening packages are quite affordable and comprehensive. Great to have a fantastic clinic and Dr around.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112980012209014454869/reviews
Aira Capotolan,5,"This is a very nice clinic. The place is new so its very neat. The receiving staff are also accommodating. The best part is the doctor on duty (Doc Hisham) is knowledgable and explains well. He knows how to explain his diagnosis to non medical persons
Will choose this clinic everytime i get sick (hopefully not often :p)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100231384579537450542/reviews
