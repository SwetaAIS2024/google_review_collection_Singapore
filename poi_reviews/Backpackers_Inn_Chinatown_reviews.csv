Nate Kelley,4,It's a really good hostel! I felt like all my belongings we're safe and secure inside our space pod and the location is literally a 2 minute walk from the metro stop! The toilet and shower are the same room so your toilet might be a little wet but the beds are really comfortable and fun. Also... Free breakfast!,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114756439087268144268/reviews

Anthony Bachtiar,5,"Backpackers' Inn Chinatown.
I got this place through searching on the internet about backpacker places in Singapore. The browser directing me to see this place and could be booked online. In my opinion, this place is good enough for me to stay in, besides the price is affordable, the place near train and bus stop. If you want to walk it is easy to go anywhere around China Town to see Art shops, night food markets, souvenirs and daily things you want.

The sleeping room and the bathroom are clean and comfortable, nice staff and helpful, and the easy access to come and go to this place.
To enjoy your stay here basically only one rule to obey is nicely sharing the facilities together and respect other guests.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117985888990332125586/reviews
