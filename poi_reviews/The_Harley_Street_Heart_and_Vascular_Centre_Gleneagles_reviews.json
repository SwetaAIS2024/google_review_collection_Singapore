He was also able to link to my other conditions (head, gastric etc. even though I hadn’t told him about them at first). I’m definitely very glad to be able to consult him. The staff at the clinic were friendly and professional in their service; one of them also gave detailed instructions (not every clinic does so) on how to take the medication. Great doc and clinic overall!",
