The other dishes were delicious too, but nothing exceptional. Staff were friendly, especially the lady who was always smiling. Don’t let the inconvenience deter you from trying out this place.",

      "text": "Cozy interior, I love the Mediterranean style tablecloths. The staffs were friendly and attentive.\n\nWe ordered hummus and pita bread, which was the highlight of our dinner. The chickpeas were coarsely grounded, not too smooth so there’s texture to it, with a generous amount of olive oil. The handmade pita bread was fluffy and delicious.\n\nThe grilled sea bream was deboned in front of us by the boss. It was a delight and thoughtful gesture. The fish itself was fresh, firm and juicy, although we’d prefer if it’s grilled a bit more. There’s only baby potatoes for the sides. It’d be great if they added salad or a mix of grilled vegetables instead of just the potatoes.\n\nStuffed peppers were average. No distinct or  “burst of flavour”, which they claimed it to be.\n\nPistachio baklava was a total letdown. It was so underwhelming I even thought of spitting it out. The filo pastry was soggy, there’s hardly any pistachio, it just felt like eating oily wet cardboard. Very unpleasant taste and would not recommend at all. Informed the boss about it but he just said it’s different from those in Turkiye, it’s their own style, so.. *shrugs*",

The fries in the meat platter was surprisingly quite good but some of the meats in the meat platter were slightly dry.",
