Loh Wan Fen Kelly,2,Cafe is severely short staffed with only 3 staff. There was a rather long wait for the food. Premises were not clean as well. A kids meal was $16-$17 and it definitely wasn‚Äôt worth the price. Doesn‚Äôt look or taste appetising.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106942300362111707634/reviews

KLUANG WIRE MESH,5,requested not to put whipping cream as my kids alergic to it. I didn‚Äôt expected this outcome from that boy taught they will give me plain  but end up so nicely made. It was really amazing and looking high standard serving of milkshakes. So delicious and colourfull. Perfect place to dine in for any food especially desserts üç®. Good service and kind with kids.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118130434699994696306/reviews
Michael Manes,1,"This place is woeful. The man serving us at the register couldn't have been any less interested, most of the dishes advertised on the screens weren't available (only way to know what the one menu on the counter with white strips over some of the items - so seems they've been unavailable for some time). The kids meal was missing 2 of the items advertised. After 3 of my preferences weren't available I landed on the Katsu Burger, which was terrible (worst part was the tomato sauce/ketchup on it, pretty much the worst possible choice of sauce for what it was). The chips were good at least, however was only served about 9 of them with the meal. Definitely opportunistic pricing - this place obviously trades in their location serving the kids play area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108540554892068016745/reviews
Robert Hoyles,5,"Amazing place for kids. The water splash park next door is great and the kids cafe is perfect for kids, with a little kids meal (including spaghetti, cake and a lollipop) and a little kids playground adjoining. Singapore Crab pizza was also great!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103842268267687216347/reviews
