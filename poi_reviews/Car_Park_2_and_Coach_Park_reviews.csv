Flo Yeow,3,"Super large carpark, but there's essentially nothing here. No shade, no proper lines, no proper road. If you're here for the first time, don't fall for it like I did.

Go all the way inside to Car Park B, closer to the shore line. Park your car closer to civilisation, closer to the park. Or else you'd have to walk quite some distance after you stop, and your car doesn't have shade here.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
