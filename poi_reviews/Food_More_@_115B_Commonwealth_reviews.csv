Walker Allen,1,"Be cautious of possible deceptive practices at the cai fan stall (#S02) by Unicuz.

I bought 狮子头 ($2) from the stall, but the female server claimed it contained fish and charged $3. Upon returning home, I found no fish in it. I went back to the stall for clarification.

The female server returned the extra $1 without an apology, insisting it wasn’t her fault and blaming a mix-up by someone else. Her dismissive attitude made it unclear whether it was a genuine mistake or intentional deception.

TL;DR: The cai fan stall provided incorrect information and overcharged for food. Beware of potential dishonest behavior.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114228628304672575396/reviews
ChowYang Neo,5,小炒王is very good. Reasonable prices and cheerful service. The pork rib king was tasty. The prawn paste chicken was good too. Curry fishhead was generous.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106822196037320239778/reviews
CK C,3,This kopitiam is quite a nice place to chill as it  is quite spacious and breezy. Food choices are diverse but the quality is rather substandard. I have tried the Indian food stall and the fried Hokkien prawn mee and both were mediocre.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews

Evelyn Siri,1,Drink stall aunty has no common sense. After I order “drinking water” and she doesn’t understand until I need to repeat 2-3 times for just a bottle of water and end up she poured the water from JUG!!!  I was so speechless and paid 1$ for stupid water.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101115163637529399501/reviews
