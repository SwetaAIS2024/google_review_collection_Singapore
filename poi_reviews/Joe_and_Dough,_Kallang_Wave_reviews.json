      "text": "I usually enjoy visiting this establishment for its delicious latte and mac and cheese. The coffee and most menu items are consistently excellent. However, my experience today was disappointing.\n\nI decided to try the Teriyaki Garlic Cream Pasta, but unfortunately, the chicken was not fresh, which affected the overall flavor of the dish. Even after avoiding the chicken, the pasta itself had an unpleasant taste likely due to its preparation alongside the chicken.\n\nAdditionally, Iâ€™ve noticed that one of the servers tends to provide portions smaller than expected, which can be a bit disheartening given the usual quality of service.\n\nDespite todayâ€™s experience, I appreciate the quality of the coffee and other menu offerings and hope these concerns can be addressed to maintain the high standards Iâ€™ve come to expect here.",
