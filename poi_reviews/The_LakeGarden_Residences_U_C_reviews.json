After going there once, my daughter wants to go there every Sunday ðŸ˜€\n\nWe didn't do picnic in the park but we would love to for our next time here.\n\nThen a full afternoon of play at the playground: trampoline, slide, monkey net, balancing on a wooden trunk...\nThere is a place at the entrance of the playground to park your bike or scooter.\nThere are toilets with drinking machine, a good shelter when it rains also.",

Feels like mid autumn festival all over again.\n\nCan't travel overseas nevermind, can come here visit the small small world to bask in some iconic scenes from overseas!\n\nNice place to spend 30-60min stroll. Nicer than botanic gardens due to the spaciousness in my opinion.",
