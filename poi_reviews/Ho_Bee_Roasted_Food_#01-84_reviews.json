Ah char was free n generous portion.\n\nChar siew is bad and like those used at WTM stalls n I rate this as 4 out of 10.  Review from others were misleading although individual taste\n\nQ is chaotic but lady operators were friendly n remind to take cutlery.   Overall, 6 for this visit.  May come back for roast pork n duck drum.",

      "text": "The food is delicious, the roast duck is juicy and moist, and has a rich meaty taste. The char siew is roasted as to a nice charred, not very sweet but good enough to be savoury. The archar is a highlight, very crunchy and sour to add to the taste. The owner can remember all the order which is very amazing. However the queue cutting is a problem as they let the regular jump in the order. Soup is also a nice touch to the meal",
