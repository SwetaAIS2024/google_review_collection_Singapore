Henry Cheng,4,"Chicken satay was slightly dry. I think I prefer the beef satay. Overall, the seasoning was on point on the meat. Lots of tumeric and spices reference in the barbecued meat skewers. The rice cake was quite dense. The sauce was the highlight of the meal. Spicy yet savoury to lap up the rice cake with the satay.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108151994390288524704/reviews
Al'qawi Rabbani,1,"We bought chicken and was told to wait for 1 hour after waiting upon collection we ask an young lady for an extra chilli but she gave my helper only one pack of chilli and after i came and ask for another one more pack of chilli the young lady respond she already gave more by only giving one yet she claimed more already?!! but if we still wants one more pack of chilli we might need to pay another 50cents just for requesting one more pack of it! That really doesn’t make any sense at all,why so stingy just for another one pack of chilli!! After waiting for 1hr few mins then we get this kind of responds!! Really didn’t know how to appreciate their regular customer’s /supporters at all!! Very2 dissapointing!! Will never come back to their stall anymore!! The reason why we ask for more chilli is because our young kids love to eat the chicken with their chilli but after this incident happens a few hrs ago we will never buy or neither support AHMAD SPRING stall again in future!!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110273484157024392436/reviews

Enn Tee,1,"Boss, I order take away beef satay and ketupat. Ketupat never give never mind, but the satay charred until like that? Felt cheated man. I’m never coming back again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117487193364901223045/reviews
daniel (d),1,"Chicken Satay meat was tough and cold despite long waiting time. Colour would be something not expected from a normal satay store, orangey and translucent.
Sauce was alright.

Ordered 6 chicken wings, only got 5. Paid the price for 6. Did not go back to get the 6th one as it was tasteless, tough, cold and dry. The lime and chilli can only barely save it.

Given a buzzer, other stalls has service.

Just skip this place.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106102918324481830657/reviews
