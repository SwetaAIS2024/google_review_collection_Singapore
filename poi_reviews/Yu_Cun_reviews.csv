K Tan,4,"Tried Yucun Curry Fish Head supposedly one of the best curry fish heads in town.
Served in a clay pot, the dish arrives piping hot, kept warm with a heating candle underneath.
Curry flavor is bold, medium spicy, thick and fragrant, well-balanced that complements the fresh fish head.
The portion is generous, making it great for sharing.
During our visit on a Sunday evening, the place was packed, a testament to its popularity.
Price slightly high nevertheless recommended for anyone craving a delicious and hearty curry fish head experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105592887493237423833/reviews

A sudden craving for fish head curry needed to be answered, so my wifey and I headed to Tai Seng MRT vicinity for dinner...

It was very crowded at the restaurant, with indoors seating fully taken. We had to settle for outdoors with tables set up along the five foot way üòÜ

The fish head in claypot came some 20-30 mins after we placed the order online. Served on a burner, it looked like we'd be enjoying at least a warm meal.

Strangely, their curry, while creamy, lacked the expected savoury punch. It appeared they were light on spices that typically flavour such curry sold elsewhere (and not necessarily from Indian stalls)!

I felt that this omission rendered the dish less enjoyable... So much for the ""best in the country"" claim?! ü§îü§£

Granted, they served fresh greens and fish meat -- if there were a top 5 list for fresh fish head curry, they would be in it!

But their hefty price of $38++ isn't really worth it for the portion size. Perhaps they are well supported by the hype, so no adjustment is needed?

I really dunno, but will hesitate to visit again üòÇ

RaChelle sy,4,"Their food is acceptable. Curry gravy is thick, fish portion is reasonable, I didn‚Äôt like that I had the high anticipation of ‚Äú best‚Äù curry fish head and felt really quite normal. The rest of the dishes were okay and not mind blown. The parking is big problem and have to find nearby building to walk over.. one thing to shout out is their service , they are very fast, responsive and helpful in-terms to assisting and ensure customer delight. Will recommend !",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101946108062311189159/reviews
Xinying Joxin,3,The curry fishhead is good. It‚Äôs like the curry we eat with prata. Haha. But the fried food (yam ring with small squid and prawn roll) disappointed us. All are overly fried. The kai lan is bitter. üòµ‚Äçüí´,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115148673539256861403/reviews
Eric Cheong,4,Self-proclaimed best curry fish head in Singapore. Fish is fresh with almost no fishy taste. Small portion is enough for two pax. Gravy is on the thicker side. Pretty pricey though. It's good but don't expect to be mind blown. Would come more often if only parking isn't a problem.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106232238192047603158/reviews
