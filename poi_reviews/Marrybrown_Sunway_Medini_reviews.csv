Priscilla Liting,1,"I wouldnâ€™t give any star to this place. If itâ€™s my first time eating marrybrown, I wouldnâ€™t even eat this brand again.

Chicken is extremely dry that itâ€™s so difficult to even swallow. And we order the bucket, which have 6 piece of chicken. Only 1 of the chicken thigh is still ok, the rest is super dry.

I have eaten this brand so many time and trust me itâ€™s the worst marrybrown I have ever eaten.

2 dec: wrote a feedback to marrybrown and store will take note on the above and improve on the quality. Hopefully it will taste much better the next time. Hopefully more review will come in soon so that I know if I should still risk my calories ðŸ˜‚",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104642951485650000202/reviews
Matt Yazer,1,Chicken is SUPER DRY make it so salty and the texture like paper. Have to wait like 20minutes because it crowded with people. Staff were ok they doing their job very in the kitchen . However the floor was dirty. The sink is disgustingly dirty . Will I come again. NEVER. Dine in ? Never. Take away maybe ok.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100348811894655993780/reviews

Kimberley Howarth,2,"First of all I tried to order a chicken wrap ala carte.... but they cannot do ala carte. I don't understand why. The drink that was offered in the set was out if stock too and they insist that I take the set with a Coke. I don't drink Coke. So.... nevermind. Cancel my order and ordered  something else. Then they seemed to have trouble with the register and could not enter one of the items I ordered.... hmm. No wonder the people in front of me took a very long time too, if the register was faulty...... Ok nevermind. At least after ordering and paying, the food was ready very quickly. The aircon was arctic inside... so I opted to sit outside... which was not too bad. Maybe a bit warm. Haha. You can't win... inside is too frozen, outside is too warm and sticky...
So the highlight point of this experience was that the burger had a really nice thick patties inside... not like some of the skinny flat burgers from some other gast food chains.... BUT.... haha. The burger was very dry. Dry overfried chicken. Dry patty. No sauce. And no chili sauce in sight either. Oh well. I like Marrybrown... but maybe won't come to this particular outlet anymore....",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114957590885643931784/reviews
guç¾Žä¸½,3,"After ordering, the waiting time is a little long. The air conditioner is too cold. For me, the chicken breast is very dry, and everything else is not bad. Parking is also convenient and there is no need to pay.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101789492726555603328/reviews
