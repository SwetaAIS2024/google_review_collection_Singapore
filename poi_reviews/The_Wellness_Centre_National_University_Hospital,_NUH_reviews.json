      "text": "This is my first health screening that I did in my life and I definitely recommend to have your health screening done at NUH Wellness Centreüëç The front counter staff, nurses and doctors are all very friendly to help. I was briefed well by the counter staff when I arrived and they make sure I understand clearly before proceed. The nurses are very patient too. When I told them I am scared of blood taking they take it very gently and walk me thru the process. It did calms me well. The consultations with Dr Karen after all my tests were very thorough. She is very kind and knowledgeable to let me understand my reports better. The environment of the centre is also very welcoming, they provide snacks and beverages like tea, coffee, water to let you consume while waiting. Also they provide referral to NUH specialist directly if there is a need. So all your health status and reports are within the same institution, making sure you get the care you need. The overall process of health check up is not rushed but at a comfortable pace. Very little waiting time spent, overall 5 stars for my experience here!",

They were warm and helpful, answering all the questions I had. The centre is well decked out such that any waiting time spent there is comfortable. Making an appointment for the check up was also a breeze, doing that through WhatsApp. Loved the sandwiches, banana and coffee provided. Maybe can provide blueberries and dragonfruit too - to aid in stool collection!  Overall highly recommend that everyone does their full body check up here at the NUH Wellness Centre!",
