The staff was very friendly.\n\nUnfortunately the food isn't good. Instead of (Western) fast food, it would be a good idea to offer local, fresh food. With the feedback that the food was inedible, the staff was also a little overwhelmed. They did their best to satisfy us, but unfortunately the choice of ingredients and method of preparation is not good. You can make improvements here.",
