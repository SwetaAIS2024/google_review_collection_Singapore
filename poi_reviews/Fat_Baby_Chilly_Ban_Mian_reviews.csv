Raihah Roslan,5,Fat Baby's Ban Mian dry (No. 4) is my favourite! I've already had it twice this week and the taste is just incredible ðŸ¤¤. The rich flavors keep me coming back for more. Iâ€™ll definitely return to explore the rest of the menu. Highly recommend giving it a try!,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116257709766286276422/reviews

Kumo H,1,"Deserves a 0.

Ordered a mee hoon kuay, $5.50.

Soup is like boiled water.
Mee hoon kuay is more like Chee Cheong Fun.
Ikan bilis was not crispy.
Serving was so small.

Donâ€™t waste your money.

I donâ€™t even want to go into details about the bungling, though pleasant staff.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103433717697604236949/reviews
