The teachers are incredibly welcoming and approachable, creating a warm and nurturing environment for the children. The variety of activities offered, from water play to yoga, cooking, and even robotics, ensuring that there's always something exciting happening. What's truly remarkable is how they've sparked my kids' interest in Chinese through engaging experiments, delightful songs, and captivating stories. It's truly an awesome place where learning knows no bounds!",

I really appreciate the years of taking great care of my kid by the principal Evelyn and the entire team. Kudos and my strong endorsement.",

The center teachers are patient and encouraging. My child‚Äôs favorite teacher wasÂº†ËÄÅÂ∏à.\n\nMy boy made some close friends fairly quickly and loved the center so much that he balled his eyes out on his last day with the center in Dec 2023.\n\nThank you GUG for giving Javier a wonderful K2 year. üëç",

Everyone is so closely knitted, teachers, principal, director and all staff are so loving, dedicated and caring.  My child used to be very shy and quiet, under the teacher's encouragement, she has opened up alot and is more expressive now.\nExcellent literacy and numeracy syllabus. The foundation in building their skills is excellent. She has no problem in coping with Primary 1 academically.\n\nBig thank you to Ms Zhang, Ms Yvelyn, Âº†ËÄÅÂ∏àÔºåTeacher Siti, Teacher Mochi & all the staff in GUG. Thank you for making my child 's preschool journey a memorable one with many sweet memories to remember.",

      "text": "If you are looking for a preschool in the katong/marine parade/mountbatten area, GUG Preschool Katong should be one of your choices. The principal and teachers there are nurturing and caring. The feedback given during parent meet teacher session is constructive and not just paying lip service. I thought the curriculum was very challenging but it will provide a basis for your child to enter primary school. One of the downsides of the school is that it is located indoors within a mall, hence they do not have an outdoor area for kids to play or explore. However, this is compensated by the periodic activities which the school organises and brings the students on excursions. My child enjoyed the dancing, singing, cooking and robotic classes which are conducted in school. They are not the cheapest in the area but definitely not ridiculously priced. My child thoroughly enjoyed the school experience.",
