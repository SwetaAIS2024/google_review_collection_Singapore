There was no one at the information counter to advise which service ticket to request for. Waited more than an hour for my turn and only to be told that I actually needed two different tickets for the different services. WOW! Such inefficiency is almost unheard of in Sg banks. So never mind I will withdraw and close all my accounts instead. Choose this bank if you have plenty of time to wait and plenty of patience for inefficiency.",

He's very helpful all the time from my observations.\nProbably it's the bank's outdated SOP  that brings down impact the customer experience n hence lower the ratings.  E.g. Having to go down to Branch twice just for opening an account is too much a hassle.  Staff follow SOP and I can see they're multi taskings while attend to random queries from \"cut -in\" customers ( that's  unfair to customers waiting patiently at the hall ).  Staff are definitely not rude „ÄÇ\nBank apps is user friendly",
