Scott Ng,5,"This is my personal review based on what I have experienced after attending a series of modules. Firstly, I find their lessons were very helpful in my learning and understanding of the bible through the perspective of believers. Secondly, the topics and materials covered in the modules were very useful in our daily walk with God in today's world. Thirdly, the course structure offers great flexibility for individuals who wants to learn more about God and the Bible at their own pace; as many of the students are working professionals. Fourthly, the teachers and students who attended the courses with me  have been all so anointed and forthcoming. Last but not least, I received many revelations from the lessons and that really helped me out in my life. So I give it a 5 stars rating. The pics were from their open house and not the usual classroom setting.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113822134459298973109/reviews
Dolly Cheong,5,"I have been blessed by Rhema Bible Training for one and a half years.

I have grown in the word of God and how to live and walk in faith.  The word of God has become more real and I am closer in my walk with God now.

Very encouraged not just by the word of God being taught but also moving in the Gifts of the Spirit in ministry. I have been edified through Rhema! Praise the Lord!

Thankful the learning and experiences.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112474251627681120982/reviews
lily koh,5,"Been so blessed sitting at the feet of Jesus through the anointed teachers, learning how to exercise my faith and live a victorious Christian life. I am who God says I am. I have what God says I have. And I can do what God says I can do through Christ. The modular courses are practical and have certainly equipped me in my Christian walk. Highly recommend the school to anyone seeking a deeper walk with Christ, to be like King David, a man or woman after Godâ€™s own heart.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118031319146145021832/reviews
FavorLiz Ong-Soh,5,"Going through the course, I learned about my full identity in Christ, understanding what the Lord Jesus Christ has done for us when He gave Himself up to die on the cross.  And when He rose He gave us the Holy Spirit so that we come alive in the spiritual part of us for we are spirit beings, children of God. There is nothing greater than God's love for us. Truly we are blessed to be so loved by God.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110286777979808988433/reviews
Liz Toh,5,One of the best things God led me to do was to attend Rhema Bible Training Center (Singapore).  I grew in the knowledge of God and in my relationship with the Father.  Everyday I was blessed by the revelations that came from the hearing and teaching of the word of God.  Thank you RBTCS for equipping me to answer God's call in my life. - Class of 2015,9 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107828215725593613/reviews
