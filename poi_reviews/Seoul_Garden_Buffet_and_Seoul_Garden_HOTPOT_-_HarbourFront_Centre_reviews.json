The spread was generous, the grill and hotpot combo is always fun ‚Äî and the service truly made it memorable.\n\nSpecial shout-out to Crystal, who was absolutely amazing! She‚Äôs super affable, friendly, and impressively attentive. She cleared our plates and changed our grill sheets before we even had to ask ‚Äî such proactive and thoughtful service really made us feel well taken care of.\n\nWith great food and warm hospitality like this, it‚Äôs no wonder Seoul Garden has been around for over 40 years. Will definitely be back again!",

Special thanks to Crystal for her special sauce, it's was delicious, and also Evan for his service, ensuring we have a great experience throughout our meal.. Thanks Crystal and Evan!

I‚Äôm so disappointed with this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm not sure why the Indian guy in the counter back was not marinating the food well!!!! So so bad.. unlike the bugis and Northpoint outlet .. those were so good!!! Took the premium items topped up more but gotten this. I had to add my own seasoning to make it taste better‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ shouldn‚Äôt have when here",
