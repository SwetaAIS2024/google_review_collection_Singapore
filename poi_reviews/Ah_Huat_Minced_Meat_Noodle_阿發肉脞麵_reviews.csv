TN Boey,5,"Perfectly cooked noodles, sauce blend and chilli with your minced pork noodles. Was featured on a tv show! Should definitely try this out if you are in the area.

The couple running this store are also very kind!

For 4 dollars, they provide a bowl that is full of meat and toppings.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105375668338316247264/reviews
YY,4,"Decent bowl of BCM, first time having it despite being at this hawker multiple times.

Noodles were rather small in portion, or maybe it‚Äôs the ingredients that‚Äôs very generous - not very filling for myself.

It is flavourful and generally no complaints though üëçüèª",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
