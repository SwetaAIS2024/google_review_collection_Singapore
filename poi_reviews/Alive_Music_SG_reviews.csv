Liew Shian,5,"My son enjoyed piano lessons by Teacher Victoria. It's been 2 years and I see great improvement as Teacher Victoria instilled proper technique, guided him joyfully, tailored the lessons to his pace, interests and target setting. Teacher Victoria is also a violinist in The Philharmonic Orchestra, Singapore. She's professional and dedicated in teaching students how to appreciate and the skills to perform different styles of music. I believed it's very important factor to motivate my son and keep the momentum going! Highly recommended!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115372153762822821618/reviews
T B,5,"I have been learning violin with Victoria for awhile now. Being an adult learner, it has not been easy compared to younger kids as kids usually pick up faster. But she is always patient and very encouraging. She shared with me ways to improve my bowing technique and intonation. Exposed me to various studies and I am seeing lots of progress compared to when I first started.
Always looking forward to my violin lesson. Thank you for your professionalism, Victoria. ☺️",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109018089363999630844/reviews
