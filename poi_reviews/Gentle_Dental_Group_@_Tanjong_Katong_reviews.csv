Ingeborg Neels,5,"I really recommend Dr Tan JD and his staff at Gentle Dental group. The receptionist at the front desk is exceptionally friendly and she puts a smile on your face the moment you walk in. Dr Tan is very professional, friendly and patient (understand that I am nervous). He always does an excellent job.
Only 5 stars for the whole team. Thank you.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103739638519973773403/reviews
Ron Bond Tan,5,"I recently took my daughters to Gentle Dental clinic for their dental check-ups, and we had an amazing experience! From the moment we walked in, the friendly front desk staff greeted us with warm smiles and made us feel welcome. The dental hygienist and dentist were incredibly gentle, patient, and kind, putting my daughters at ease throughout the entire process.

What impressed me most was the exceptional customer service. The team took the time to explain every step, answered all our questions, and made sure we felt comfortable and informed. They even offered a relaxing ambiance and entertainment options to help my daughters feel more at ease.

The clinic's commitment to providing top-notch care and service is evident in every aspect. I'm so grateful to have found a dental home where my daughters feel safe and happy. Thank you for an outstanding experience! We can't wait for our next visit!""",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117953972997146484588/reviews
Jim Alif,5,I had to remove 2 wisdom tooth and 1 normal one at the lower front jaw. Dr Tan JD was performing the surgery for me. I want to say I am very scared of extraction or any surgery with blood. But he assured me his experience and along the surgery kept keeping me comfortable. It was really not as bad as I thought due to his methods. I really recommend gentle dental as everything was smooth and even receptionist are professional service and prompt in response.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100334609924114761651/reviews
