      "text": "Situated on Lorong Sarhad in the heart of Pasir Panjang, Masjid Ahmad stands proud as a humble kampong mosque in its 1934 beginnings. Today, it serves the communities living and working in PSA Singapore Pasir Panjang.\n\nThe unique thing about this mosque is the colour contrasts that it possesses. The exterior is wooden-coloured with a yellow and whitewash while the praying hall is carpeted in dark red, giving that vibe of a small but effective operational machine.\n\nBus 200 is the only bus service that runs through the main artery road, South Buona Vista Road, perpendicular to Lorong Sarhad. Alight at Bus Stop 15079 (After Lorong Sarhad).",

The volunteers have also done a great job facilitating the safety measurements in view of our current situation.\n\nParking is widely available along Lor Sarhad & Lor Sari.",
