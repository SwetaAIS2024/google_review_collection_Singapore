sephora alice,2,"Been eating here for years and years since my friend lives nearby, but the portion of their food (rice included) severely downsized. Even when i added vegetables, she gave me a small dollop of it which I had to say it's too little. She eventually relented and added more vegetables for me. The pic is AFTER adding. You mean you expect customers to pay $1.50 for one teaspoon of veggie? Rice portion is for kids too. Disappointing.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107096688976539412594/reviews
nick wong,5,"$6.70 for brown rice + 4 dishes, decently priced in an air conditioned food court and neighbourhood vegetarian that’s open for dinner nowadays. some of the dishes weren’t hot but tasted pretty good still. they’ve been here for many many years so sad to see their low rating, trying to bump them up. they accept pay wave.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101740022496742652932/reviews
lucky ang,5,"Thank you for always providing cheap and delicious vegetarian food. Do visit San De if you want cheap food. 3 dishes plus rice at $3.00. Auntie is very nice, she discounts for my elderly mother 3 dishes for $2.50. Do get to know the auntie and she will give you a lot more extra. Where to get $3 rice with 3 dishes? Really cheap.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108881812166823154434/reviews
eddy khoo,3,"Super salty and expensive.  This stall has never ending queues but if you're looking for healthy food, this ain't it.  Besides being overly salty, the price points are not justifiable for the ingredients used.  Some soya selections are quite tasty (msg) and presented as mock sweet & sour pork etc but the salt level would probably give you a heart attack if you eat it daily.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100216526729811832950/reviews
Ping N,4,"Based on fried bee hoon plus ingredients which I eat twice a week,  I find all ingredients very salty, hope stall owner can reduce sodium by half to be healthier. I dont order fried food coz they are oily and taste like stale oil.

Otherwise all the braised and stir fried vegetables/tofu/pumpkin/eggplant are yummy.

Morning shift aunty serving us is grouchy, u better know what ingredients u want while u queue.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110979684514193763056/reviews
