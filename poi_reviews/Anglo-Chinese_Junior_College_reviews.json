      "text": "Wonderful Junior College providing a holistic education. Tremendously benefitted from my experience here at ACJC in 2003-2004, with lifelong friendships and bonds still going strong 20+ years later. Blessed to be part of the ACSian family, with teachers and even our former Principal being ever supportive of our individual endeavours. The sports facilities were fantastic too from the track to the swimming pool and gym, I credit a lot of my sporting journey from this too. Thank you, ACJC! üôèüèª",
