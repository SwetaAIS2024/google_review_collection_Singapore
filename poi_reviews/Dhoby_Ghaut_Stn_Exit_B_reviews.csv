Flo Yeow,5,"Personally quite like the fact that this is probably one of the better maintained busstops in the entire Orchard Road stretch. Shelters all through from the train station, and shopping malls, are a huge plus for my transit experience. The well maintained bus guides and transit timings, although not entirely accurate, is very helpful in allowing me to make public transit arrangements.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Dream like a Pro,5,"The bus stop has cover all the way to the MRT station. Even raining, you wonâ€™t get wet. There are so many bus lines available here to get you to many different places. The bus stop also has a signage showing the buses arrival times. This is super awesome when you know how long you have to wait. The bus stop is long enough for two buses to stop at the same time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102019001601931493221/reviews
