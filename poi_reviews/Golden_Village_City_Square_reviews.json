Lol.\n\nNot a first timer here, I’ve Been here like 10+ times or more as it’s near to my place and i am a big movie buff especially in cinemas. So trust me. Every time this is a constant disappointment.\n\nHonestly to me it’s pretty bad. The brightness, the contrast, the projection quality is very poor and pathetic. Image is so dull and blurry. I rub my eyes May times to check if problem with my eyes.\nOMG Dont even ask about sound system which sucks even worse.\nIt’s impossible for me to comprehend to have such a low quality cinemas in rich country like this.\n\nThe Air con at late night shows r turned off or something, starts to get hot.\nCleanliness is okay. seats are not that Comfortable. Leg space is cramped.\nThe ticket price vs experience u get is night and day.\n\nOverall this theatre is pretty old needs heavy upgrade of the system.\nTry and avoid at all costs.",
