amanda seow,5,"Love how this centre has fantastic facilities and interactive zones for the children to learn and explore. Best part, they allow learning to take place beyond the classrooms by bringing the kids outdoor in their daily routine.

Also, very thankful the teachers here are very caring and patient which helps a lot in allowing my child in adapting to the new school environment. Definitely would recommend this school to all parents!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106047109440740331806/reviews
Michelle Krapp,5,"We are very happy to have enrolled our child here. The owners and staff are very friendly, kind and patient!

As a first time parent, it brings lots of comfort to know that our little one is well taken care of. Personally I love how well planned the curriculums are and how consistent the teachers are in guiding the little ones to be independent in school. They are also very attentive to details and are always there to answer your queries.

An overall great learning environment with fantastic facilities! We highly recommend this centre to all parents!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113549013138236622259/reviews
