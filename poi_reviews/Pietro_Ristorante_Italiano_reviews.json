      "text": "I recently had lunch at Pietro Ristorante Italiano, and it was a genuinely enjoyable experience from start to finish. We had Pizza Margherita, Ravioli Al Tartufo, Spaghetti Alla Carbonara as well as a Pistachio Tiramisu as a birthday cake. The food was everything you'd hope for in a good Italian restaurant—fresh ingredients, rich flavors, and beautifully plated. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the sauces were full-bodied, and the tiramisu? Simply divine.\nThe ambience struck the perfect balance between cozy and vibrant, with warm lighting, tasteful decor, and just enough background music to create atmosphere without overwhelming conversation. It felt welcoming, authentic, and relaxed—ideal for both date nights and casual dinners with friends.\nWhat stood out most, though, was the staff. They were attentive and genuinely engaging with guests. It added a warm, personal touch that made the afternoon feel special rather than routine.\nAll in all, Pietro Ristorante Italiano is a gem worth revisiting. Great food, great vibe, and a team that makes you feel like you're part of the family.\nJust remember to reserve your table before heading down as it can get really crowded.",

Service was prompt and constantly refilled your water which was great. The price for the dishes are reasonable. They also allow you to spin a wheel for bills above $100 to win some small prizes.",

It used to be my favourite dish at Pietro but the one that I had today was stale, tough and tasteless. I only ate 1.5 pieces of meat (less the fats) and the accompanying veggies. Couldn't force myself to consume the rest as the stale taste put me off. Definitely not worth $28.90.",
