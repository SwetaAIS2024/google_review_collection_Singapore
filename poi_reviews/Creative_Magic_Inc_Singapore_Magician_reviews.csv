Clement Teo,5,They have been patient and helpful during my son‚Äôs birthday party. Even though a lot of the kids were late.

Kyaw Swar Aung,5,"We had a wonderful experience! The entertainer was incredibly patient with a group of high-energy kids and never once got frustrated, even with their many demands. Though we hired him for 1.5 hours, he generously stayed for over 2.5 hours, making sure the kids were having a fantastic time. My children were absolutely thrilled, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the service!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112741493193622673213/reviews
Clarissa Nah,4,"Had contacted Hong Wei for a magician for my child's birthday. He was enthusiastic, willing to brainstorm ideas & tweak his magic show & tricks in order to suit my party theme. He was helpful in offering other ideas and services which I didn't even think of. Although we didn't need his services in the end, would certainly contact him again if needed for a kids' magic show. Thanks Hong Wei!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108316652616250740905/reviews
serene tay,5,"Hongwei is a sincere, passionate and talented magician. My girls enjoyed his magic show very much. And not forgetting his help in hosting the cake cutting! Balloon sculpting was also superb too. Kids kept queueing and wanting for more and he can patiently accommodate to all their requests. Thumbs up!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103854350237807104186/reviews
