Ember Shen,4,"This lor mee is famous so i came here to try it. My sister say she didnt like it, which i know why.

1. It is very 重口味, strong garlicky taste.

2. The pork belly is diced like in 卤肉饭，and not big pieces like what other stalls do.

3. The fried meatballs are unique and good.

$4

The lady working at the stall looks fierce",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117465885711011307889/reviews
Jodeci Fine,5,"Yeah! So excited. Ventured all the way to CCK (Keat Hong) after noticing this seemingly old-school #lormee on Google maps. Definitely curious to check it out.

Indeed, lor mee is really popular among the neighbourhood, with every other table eating it.

Ordered fried fish lor kway teow for $5. Generous portion. Comes with 3 big pcs of fried fish with soft centre, cubes of 卤肉and half a egg. The ‘lor’ is very good, just the right amount of starchiness and very flavourful. They even add cut big red and green chillies for an added kick. So filling and taste hits the perfect note for me. Definitely one of the best hidden lor mee around.

CK C,2,"Overrated lor mee laden with MSG but yet tasted normal. The fried fish was stale, hard and essentially chunks of batter with little fish. At $5, nowadays you can get lor mee with good quality fish such as Ang Kor Li and not dory, which is served here. Even the garlic looked like spat.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Zhanrong Liang,1,"Ordered the spinach and fish sliced soup. The soup has no taste, only can taste the spinach. Not going back for the food in the future. The rice is undercooked",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102399910804636306936/reviews
Jeffrey,4,One of my usual go to place for my lor mee craving. One thing I like about their lor mee is that their gravy will not turn watery unlike most of the other lor mee stores I patronize. Definitely worth a try if you live around the neighbourhood.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114245811301243431771/reviews
