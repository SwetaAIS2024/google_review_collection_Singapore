Had white fried carrot cake with extra egg ($5) for breakfast, was normal. Chilli was served separately by the side. Coffee shop was warm.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107525471936198024/reviews
Sylvester Tan 陳文俊,4,"It's the best coffee shop in the area to me for, with the best breakfast and lunch selection. The food stalls are always good, if not great. Expect to queue at the stores, unless you're lucky. Coffee is good here too. The only downside here is the seating, very limited outdoor seats, so takeaway is the best option.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117497922361431311892/reviews
Patrick Lau,4,"Late dinner at the Zi Char stall.  Looks like new owners comprising young chaps.  Food quality is very decent full of wok hei and generous portion for $5/-.  Server possess good attitude, though we have to clear our own table.  Will patronise again cos across the road is 24hr NTUC FairPrice!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106881591692184457438/reviews
KLKK,4,"Nice and affordable Muslim Halal food amongst the other good food in this small coffee shop.

The mee rebus (S$3.80) gravy was rich and tasty.  You could taste the peanuts.

The lontong (S$3.80) tasted good but I would prefer the more concentrated type.  That being said, generous portion of vegetables.

Perhaps one area for improvement could be the bowl that they used.  It will be easier to eat it with a plate than a bowl.

Update as of 25 Jun:
The same owners also own the Muslim rice stall. The beef rendang is tender and tasty.  Must try!  Cannot miss it!  The bean sprout is crunchy and flavourful. Do not miss their sambal fish and black Sotong if you are seafood lover.

Both the husband and wife are very friendly.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105935163791451386420/reviews
Patrick Poh,3,"First time ordering take away due to covid. Wasn't overly impressed. Fish fried bee Hoon was a bit tasteless and the fish was not fresh. Maybe it's due to the covid situation, ingredients were kept a little longer. The soup was quite good. Has a traditional and great taste.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107673184510491093624/reviews
