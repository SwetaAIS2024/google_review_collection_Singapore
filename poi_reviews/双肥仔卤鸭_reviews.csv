Yan Chung,5,"Very friendly store owner.

Gave me free extra portioning, but please don't expect him to keep giving, he needs to make a living after all.

Taste wise is very decent, the pig intestines do not have stench. Goes to show he cleans the ingredients well before cooking. Portioning is pretty generous too.

Atmosphere wise it's a standard coffee shop, what's there to say? Except that it's fairly clean compared to other coffee shops that have sticky tables, this one is ok. The operators do a pretty good job cleaning.
