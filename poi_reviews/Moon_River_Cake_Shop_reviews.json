If they could put a litter more of the red bean will be fantastic and super!\nOverall, could try their others products.",

      "text": "This neighborhood old-school bakery has been around since my school days (2000s), but it’s no longer like before.\n\nBought a birthday cake from them on 21 May 2022 to celebrate my mom’s birthday. Paid $30 and was told it’s a discount from $33. Cake is large (30cm) but felt very light in the box. At that moment I felt I overpaid for it but let it go cos the design is cute.\n\nUpon cutting the cake it has a crumbly texture and did not look smooth. It is dry and the taste is disappointing.\n\nWhile eating, we found 2 large pieces of eggshell buried within it, it was horrendous.\n\nWe ate the leftover cake today and found a third piece of eggshell. Just look at its size.\n\nThis will be the last time I buy from this bakery.",

Despite my anticipation for a pleasant experience, I was met with rudeness and indifference. The lady responsible for baking waffles displayed unprofessional behavior. I hope management addresses this issue promptly to maintain the bakery's reputation for quality service.",
