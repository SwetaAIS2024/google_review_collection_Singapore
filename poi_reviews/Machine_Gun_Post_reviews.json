      "text": "Fort Pasir Panjang, located on the hill and cliff next to the sea, was completed in 1878 with two gun emplacements. The cliff’s high vantage point led the British to identify it as a defence site to protect the entrance to the harbours of Singapore. It became one of nine sites in which the British had set up their batteries, and is part of the British overall defence system for Singapore.\n\nLabrador Park is better known for having been one of the British navy's strategic defense sites meant to protect the harbor of Singapore in World War II. The bunker was sited to protect the 12-pounder guns on Berlayer Point – on the hill right above. Another machine gun bunker is located behind the public toilet further down, along the foot of the hill.\n\nThis defence position was part of a strategy based on the popular belief that an invasion of Singapore would probably come via a coastal attack, and so the placements of these guns were fixed facing the sea. In practice, they could be turned around. This was the case in February 1942, during World War II, when the guns were reversed almost 180 degrees and used by the Malay Regiment in their 48-hour struggle against the advancing Japanese 18th Division in the Pasir Panjang / Alexandra Road area.\n\nWorld War II relics such as machine gun posts, bunkers and secret tunnels - rumoured to lead all the way to Sentosa - can still be seen in the park. The former fort was a key bastion of the British defence against Japanese sea invasions.",
