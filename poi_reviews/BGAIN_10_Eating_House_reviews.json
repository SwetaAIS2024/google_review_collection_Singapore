My favourite stall would be the Jalan Tua Kong Mee Pok which used to sell spinach soup but now offered bitter gourd soup with many ingredients.\n\nThe drink stall is expensive tho $1.90 for small Teh Bing, $2.30 for bigger cup and $2 for ice lemon tea. Expensive for the standard offering in the kopitiam.\n\nRecently, there is a mookata store who joined offering $19.90 for 1.5 h buffet",

I saw there was a queue for the Economy Rice and tried it;- my choice of 2 meat & 1 veggie cost $3.40 which is very reasonable.  A the taste is good too!\n\nLor Mee is equally good in this kopitiam.\n\nPopiah here is also good and tasty.\n\nYet to try the other stalls here and will review in due course!\n\nAmple parking lots in the carpark just behind the block!",

      "text": "The roast duck and soy sauce chicken pretty good here. Pricing is reasonable too. One of my favorite dish is Boneless Roast Duck Leg Hor Fun with a wanton soup. I have tried their steam chicken, half for $5. The portion is quite a lot for 1 pax. Taste wise, probably a 6.5 out of 10, personally I will find the steamed chicken meat a bit dry. The soy sauce chicken will be a better choice. The rojak at the coffee shop is a must try. There is another stall selling otak, they will grill upon ordering. Be prepared to wait a little.",
