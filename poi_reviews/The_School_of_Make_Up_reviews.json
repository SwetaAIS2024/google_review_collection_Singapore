Super informative and hands on session.\n\nBefore this session I don‚Äôt even know how to use fake eye lashes and I was so stressed about it.

So useful and handy!\n\nWould definitely recommend this school for anyone who wants to have hands on learning experience and theory!\n\nThumbs up and big thank you The School of Make Up!",
