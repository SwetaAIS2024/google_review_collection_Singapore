We paid for the repairs and was told that the strong wind at my home is the cause of the string dislodging from the screws. When asked how to prevent more repairs. Was told no way. The guard rail metal strings have dislodged yet again. The blinds flap wildly. It is only a matter of time the whole piece collapsed. It happened before. Luckily it did not fall out of the window and hit anyone downstairs when it happened.",

Then she gave me a phone number to call.\n\nCalled the number and received a yes phone answer (must be company policy not to answer a business phone properly) . I asked for an on-site quotation and the guy asked me if I measured out my windows yet!\n\nWhen I said that I wasn't taking any risks because he might add additional costs, he just laughed like he was expecting to do business like this.\n\nIf you are interested look elsewhere, we found a good company in LeGate.\n\nThis company isn't serious for business and shouldn't be worth the risk.",
