Amanda Kerry,1,"The image speaks for itself. The hojicha latte is so pale and has barely any hojicha taste… Its also made from a blender. Definitely wouldn’t recommend getting hojicha from here, maybe the other drinks are better but I wouldn’t be back. Side note the staff is super sweet and tried offering to remake it but the lady manager/boss said it would require additional cost.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101252867240597274497/reviews

ayla banu,5,"really good quality matcha latte!! even tho the store is kind of hard to find as its location in the b level of a retail complex, I was pleasantly suprised as the very kind employee started making my drink, seeing her use actual quality matcha powder and preparing it in an authentic way, which you could definitely taste!! the matcha taste was very strong and deep, I would’ve loved to come back to try their hojicha but I unfortunately won’t manage before I leave singapore.. they charge $1 extra for soy milk which is pretty standard. would highly recommend this place, can definitely compare to the matcha I’ve had in japan!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100226862445265597096/reviews
Ryan Choo,5,"Where can you possibly get the best quality matcha from a cafe? Apart from here, there's no where else. Don't forget the equally tasty coffee that they serve!",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107681324451304259506/reviews
