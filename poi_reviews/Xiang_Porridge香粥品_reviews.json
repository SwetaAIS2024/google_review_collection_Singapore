Quite expensive for porridge but slightly too expensive. Used to be pretty cheap long ago. But it's still very hard to find porridge nearby so no complaints.",

The Cantonese porridge texture is just right with smooth cotton feel (綿綿的). Sliced fish is fresh and white, each slice with equal size. Pork meatballs are handmade. Youtiao used the right flour. It is crispy and not oily.",
