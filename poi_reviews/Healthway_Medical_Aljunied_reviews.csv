Jordan Low,1,"140325 went in for URTI symptoms, told the male attending doctor i was feeling feverish and other symptoms. Did not even take my temperature, upon checking my throat (which was already inflammed as i had trouble speaking, eating and drinking), response was ""oh it looks okay"". Checked my breathing (i already had phelgm), ""breathing sounds good"". Proceeds to tell me ""oh its most likely just a flu"".

Requested for anti inflammatory medication along side with the other prescribed meds (not sure based on his diagnosis why there's no antibiotics given my symptoms???), been taking it for the past 4 days consistently, lets just put it that there was no effect. If anything my throat worsened and decided to visit another GP today.

For a $77 consultation and medication fees, its not about the amount spent but the service provided by doctor when it comes to care for patients and the effectiveness of prescribed medication.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102365333307985072932/reviews

Tee Jet,1,"This is a very annoying clinic with very short business hours. I am a member of Health SG and chose to join this clinic. Every time I come to get medicine, the doctor is not there. I also need to work, and this clinic's business hours are even shorter than my working hours. I don't know how to continue to participate. I am considering changing clinics.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102510404073316890879/reviews
