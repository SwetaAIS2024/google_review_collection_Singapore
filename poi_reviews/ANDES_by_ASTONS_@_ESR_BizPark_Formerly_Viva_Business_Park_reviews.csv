Cedric Seet,4,"Ordered steak and fried chicken combo, steak was thinner than expected, cook was more medium than medium rare, and it wasnâ€™t seasoned. I guess cause they use the sauce for taste rather than salt & pepper. Fried chicken cutlet was juicy, sides were great as well. What was good was that the portions were great for me.

Service though was slow, waited about 30 mins for my meal, might be because they were understaffed. Was difficult to get them to refill water too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116120424406667932678/reviews
Yan Zhou Eric Tan,1,"The carbonara sauce was totally tasteless and bland. When we feedback to the waiter to ask the kitchen to check if there was any issue (as it didnâ€™t taste as bad previously when we came), the waiter simply dismissed us by asking us to give our feedback on Google review. The standard has simply gone done so much and so hereâ€™s the Google review as requested by them",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105587073779538945881/reviews
Nur Iskandar Abdul Malik,5,Food taste and quality well maintained. Ordering is by QR (as with most establishments these days). Pay first online style may not be elderly friendly. Having a cash payment option would be good. Would require one should there be a system outage (anyway).,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101058956703988824395/reviews
Alicia T,5,"Come here sometimes for family meals and takeaway. Place can get pretty noisy when packed, but canâ€™t help it. Food is usually consistent and tasty, sometimes a little more burnt under the chicken, or like todayâ€™s fish, hard on one end :/ (forgot to take fish photo) Too generous with the chili packets but at least I wonâ€™t throw it.
Cashier lady and waiter Uncle were friendly, but if prices are friendlier I would come more often! ðŸ¤­",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103946408411709004453/reviews
Suzaina S,2,"Standards have gone down so much. So sad that they can't even grill a decent steak properly.  Asked for a medium rare, but there were raw parts, and the fat on the sides were not rendered properly. Disappointing",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107985653639892917403/reviews
