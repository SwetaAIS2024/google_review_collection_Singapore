Ahmad Akram Mohamed Ismail,5,"I would say one of the best otak otak i have tasted, not your usual  otak otak (grilled fish cake made of ground fish meat mixed with tapioca starch and spices).

This otak otak has fish chunks marinated with spice paste and mixed with grated coconut.
Its has a mildly spicy flavour with flavour of coconut and. The coconut adds a gritty texture. Worth a try.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288525842576512037/reviews
