Amirah Natassya,1,Sales person who worked on 07-12-2023 at 15:00PM was so rude and unfriendly. What’s more ridiculous is that she did not even bother to run to us to let us know that testers cant be tested. She saw me wanting to try it and did not stop me then proceed to force me to buy the tester as she said “tester for selling”. I guess shop not doing so well that they have to result in selling testers. Very bad service and will definitely never recommend people to shop here. Scam and staffs should be taught properly. Perhaps owner of the store itself should do better. Very poor service and bad staff conducts.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105621317550475485052/reviews
Sapumal Amadoru,1,"Dont get caught to the sales girls. Purchased a perfume there for 50 plus dollars. The one guided me convinced again and again for something she called new brand instead of well known ones that i wanted to buy. Smell was good. But now after using it for couple of weeks, its just nothing. Smell wont last even for a 30 mins i guess. Its misleading info and a real disgust when they cheat in this manner. Not recommended. Dont waste your penny there.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104193995218845985621/reviews
