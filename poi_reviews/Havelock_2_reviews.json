There is something for everyone in this shopping mall even though it is only half occupied,  granted that it's newly opened mid 2018. A number of tenants were previously from Chinatown Square before it was closed to be refurbished into a hotel. You can expect to see interesting toy shops on the 2nd and 3rd level and basement 1 with shops selling creative handmade products. The Wing vintage shop occupied the 3rd floor and is a haven for those who are interested to own a piece of retro or vintage product. Havelock II is connected to Furama city centre by a sheltered walkway allowing easy access if it's raining.",
