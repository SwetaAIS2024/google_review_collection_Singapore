Read the feedback below:\n\nLocation: Very convenient as it is easy to access and there are plenty of parking lots, also near to Jalan Sultan Exp way/Tuas checkpoint/Sultan Abu Bakar immigration/Legoland/Sunway Bigbox/Puteri Harbour!\n\nFood & Drink: Tasted their teh tarik and nasi lemak, looks simple but it was super nice. Not exaggerating, but its the fact! Can be the next top nasi lemak in JB!!\n\nPrice: Affordable and reasonable price!!\n\nService: The service is satisfactory! Seem like they just opened this shop. But, theres always a room of improvement!",

Other food so so, most of  us didn't finish what we ordered. Slow service even though only 2 tables were occupied. Agreed that taste is subjective but if the whole group thinks the same when everyone had a different dish then go figure.",
