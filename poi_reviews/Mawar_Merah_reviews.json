Rice doesn’t taste n smell like Nasi lemak, chilli paste is not Nasi lemak chilli. Price was at $5 . Would consider a steep price compare to average at $3.50.",

To me the food is good, yes on the pricey side but come on, look at where its situated.\n\nFor me the dishes are reminiscent to homecooked authentic padang dishes that is hard to find nowdays.\n\nHey, if you want your michellin star nasi padang then by all means head somewhere else. But if you want the nostalgic home cooked padang dishes, then give it a try.",

The begedil was also soft, tender and tasty. The belachan was spicy and great to eat.\n\nI also ordered gado gado and took it home to eat. The gado gado was also good, but the sauce or gravy could have been thicker and this would have made it even better.\n\nDefinitely worth going back again to sample the other food.\n\nThere are also chai png, western and Vietnamese food stalls in the main coffeeshop.",
