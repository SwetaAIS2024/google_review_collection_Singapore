Ginny Toh,3,"Located next to United square. A small little Japanese style bakery. Place is nicely lit with simple set up. Staff were friendly.
Their breads look and smell so good. And there seems to be a wonderful varieties of breads to choose from.
Decided to try their set meal which was a quite a good deal - Ham & cheese sandwich with long black.
Coffee was light and easy to drink. Only bummer was, although I’m dining in, it was served in a takeaway cup.
Sandwich was served with a side salad.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113103868486256084260/reviews
SZ Lim,4,"Nice local bakery. Tried the croissant. Smells good but unfortunately doesn't taste as good as I expected it to be. It's still an average to above average croissant, just for that price tag I find it not worth it.

Service is good and they can reheat for you. Staff are also very friendly.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114108831723577323443/reviews
Lee C,5,First visit and it’s now my favourite bakery and cafe! The brunch set (until 1pm) at $15 ($1 top up for coffee) was well priced and delicious. My mushroom bacon cheese croissant was crispy and savoury and even the side salad was delicious!!! I bought the famous red bean bun and pan Au chocolate home. Both were lovely. The atmosphere was also chill and relaxing. Really rare to find such places in SG nowadays!,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115729096531821874557/reviews
randall,4,"Pretty alright bakery and cafe just outside of velocity. The area feels kinda quaint and detached from all the construction going on outside along the main road. The red bean with butter bun was honestly pretty nice! Got a bacon tomato pizza as well and it was nice when toasted.
Honestly a good place to sit and chill in the middle of the day.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109975281303071622618/reviews
Emily Lek,3,"Read good things about this place so came with high expectations. It was overall just okay, considering the price of the bakes as well. Would have been better if some of the food didn’t taste so soggy - like the crab croquette bun - after being warmed up (maybe they used microwave instead of toaster oven). Flat white was good even though the coffee is machine-made.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115648595160946580357/reviews
