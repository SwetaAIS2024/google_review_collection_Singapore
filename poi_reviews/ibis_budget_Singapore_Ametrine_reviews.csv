Martin,4,"I stayed in Singapur for 4 nights alone. Staff is very nice, room service was very good. The room was small but equipped with a large bed, good pillows, blanket and drinking water from the tap. Also with TV, kettle, soap and even toothbrush kit.

The only downside was the mold on the ceiling, which was a little discomforting.
Also the walls are thin and you can hear your room neighbors.

The hotel is located in a small street between the MRT stations Kallang and Aljuned. Both are 15 mins away on foot, which is quite far.

Luckily there is a bus stop, which brings you directly to downtown area in a very short time. Donâ€™t bother taking the MRT, take the bus.

Around the corner is a 7-11 and a washing salon, where you can wash and dry your clothes for less than 10SGD.

Nearby is also a Shieng Siong (supermarket), where you can buy cheap water bottles. The prices at 7-11 are way too high for water.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113426588017334415610/reviews
J V,3,"Had a decent stay - staff were friendly. However, as others have mentioned, theres mold on the ceilings. The most frustrating part of my stay is the hot water in the shower  - the water was hot for 2-3 minutes max before going cold on me",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117522903662417667208/reviews
Luis Miguel Navasca,5,"Very affordable compared to most hotels in Singapore.

Cathy Tucker,5,"Fast check-in.
In Geylang, so lots of convenience stores and choices of restaurants. we went for excellent mutton murtabak just 2 mins walk away.
But hotel is on a quiet side street.
Window doesn't open but AC is good.
Bathroom and bed great.
Very good value IMHO.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107757276647179392496/reviews
Fiona R.,5,"Very quiet area, spotless but no breakfast. The staff  cares about you.
A bit far from the tube station (15min walk).",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115092549324396536340/reviews
