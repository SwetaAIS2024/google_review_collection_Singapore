      "text": "I had a very disappointing experience at this dental clinic. They charged me $120 for what they called an ‚ÄòAI scan,‚Äô but it was just a regular X-ray, not even 3D as advertised. On top of that, they added an $18 disposal fee, and the 3-minute consultation cost $30. None of the prices were disclosed upfront, and it felt like they were hiding the costs and charging excessively. The entire experience left me feeling like they were more focused on making money than providing honest, transparent service. I definitely won‚Äôt be visiting again. On the other hand, I highly recommend Kim‚Äôs Dental Clinic for their honesty and transparent pricing. They‚Äôve always been upfront with their costs and genuinely care about their patients",

      "text": "When I walked into the clinic, the first thing I noticed was that the dustbin next to the dental chair was overflowing, which didn‚Äôt leave a good first impression. During my session, the dentist (male, whose name I unfortunately don‚Äôt know) performed my polishing, but the experience felt rushed. The entire procedure was completed in about 10 minutes, and I felt that my teeth still looked yellowish afterward.\n\nDuring the initial assessment, he mentioned that I needed an X-ray, highlighted that my gums were unhealthy, and insisted my wisdom tooth had decay that required extraction. While I declined the procedure as I wasn‚Äôt experiencing any pain, he persisted, expressing deep concern. Despite his insistence, I stood by my decision and asked to proceed with polishing only. Throughout the session, he appeared tired, uninterested, and even rolled his eyes at times, which didn‚Äôt make me feel comfortable or confident in his care.\n\nSeeking clarity, I later went for a second opinion at another clinic. The second dentist provided a very different assessment, stating that my gums weren‚Äôt as bad as described earlier and could improve with regular brushing. They also confirmed that my wisdom tooth wasn‚Äôt causing any issues and didn‚Äôt require extraction. On top of that, the second dentist polished my teeth more thoroughly, and they looked noticeably cleaner and less yellowish afterward.\n\nConsidering my experience, I‚Äôm left wondering where all the positive reviews for this clinic come from, as my visit was far from smooth. The lack of professionalism, rushed service, and attempt to push unnecessary procedures left me feeling uneasy. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be returning, even though the clinic is conveniently located near me.",

Dr Janet and her assistant were extremely patient and kind and caring towards my boy who was overly anxious over the small procedure. Their patience and creativity in dealing with him and his anxious antics and wailing deserves honorable mention. Truly appreciate very much. Thank you so much to you both üôèüôè",
