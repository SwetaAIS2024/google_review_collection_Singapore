The other dumplings paled in comparison cos the shengjianbao is so goooood. Also shoutout to the scallion noodles super flavourful!",

      "text": "Kinda disappointed at the size of the buns. Would you pay $29.20 for 12 pan fried bun? I thought I could share with 6pax given that the display looks like those you can get from paradise dynasty’s 生煎包. But it seems to me now that only me and my husband would gobble down because we are too embarrassed to give my parents & brothers.\n\nWhen I am at the shop front, the staffs are sloppy and takes time to attend to you.\n\nNo doubt the buns were small, it did justify itself as 暴汁, but the juice is not that abundance. Flavour is ok.\n\nSo much for the hype.",

They all have soup in it so be careful! ⚠️⚠️⚠️ the broth is so good and sweet. Skin is thin and there’s a lot of meat! Scallion oil noodles is really good but dries up rlly quickly, would suggest asking for more scallion oil and sauce if u find it too dry!",
