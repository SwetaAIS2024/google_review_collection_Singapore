Hence the forgotten photo. Unlike many other places that tend to cook it too hard, their pork chop was just right. Cooked enough and easy to bite. Tried their chicken chop this time and it again did not disappoint. Meat was juicy and the skin was the right amount of charred. Fried rice was consistently good. Will try their tobiko & XO fried rice options in future.",

The cook makes no effort to warm up the left over fried rice... what a miserable portion as well for $4.80.... might as well get take out from any kopitiam zhi char stall, guarantee larger portion + pipping hot rather than having shixshow Cold fried rice.",

      "text": "This is a relatively new fried rice stall located in Gourmet Street Kopitiam along Clementi Ave 3. Read some good reviews and decided to give it a try.\n\nArrived at 12.17pm and surprisingly there wasnâ€™t a long queue. My heart sank. Nonetheless we ordered their Egg Fried Rice with Pork Chop and Classic Meat Pie Rice. The stall assistant recommended that we try their fried sambal chilli and proceeded to add some onto the plate of fried rice. Tasted it cautiously and it blew us away. So savoury and fragrant from garlic, itâ€™s better than most chilli used in Ban Mian. Really complements the fried rice very well but it packs bit of heat that builds up after a while so be careful. Wonder if they sell it individually. The fried rice itself got a bit of wok heat so it was nice and the grains were well blended with generous amount of fried egg. Pork chop was a tad dry but the well marinated meat was tasty.\n\nThe Classic Meat Pie rice is actually a bowl of rice with a pork patty on top and it comes with a fried egg. But what sets it apart is the lard bits added to the rice. The broccoli added does help take away the fatty taste of the meat and lard. Rice is drizzled with a sweet sauce so itâ€™s a good blend between savoury and sweet.\n\nSo itâ€™s a nice stall with good offer of fried rice and Chinese style donburi. Total damage was $13 only!\n\nFor this price and quality, I do recommend to try it. And ask for more fried chilli.",
