I asked for less rice, dun understand why the staff shook the head, and  showed the expression of impatience. The cost is $10.70, and the fish is $4.5. Well, I'm not eating this stall again. Will try other stalls. The other 2 coffee shops opposite the road are newer and better foods.",

The economical rice stall offer good variety of dishes at  reasonable prices. The Indian Muslim stall prices are unreasonable and offer less variety and taste. For Indian Muslim food, better off  walking a short distance to the adjacent block 158 Indian Muslim Coffee shop.",
