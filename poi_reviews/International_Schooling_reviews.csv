Next-generation Gaming,5,"Being a one-on-one student in international schooling has been a really different but cool experience. I get to learn at my own pace, and the teacher actually focuses just on me, which helps a lot. If I don’t understand something, I can ask right away, and we go over it until I get it. That’s something I didn’t always get in regular school.

It’s also nice that the schedule is flexible. I can plan my day better and still have time for hobbies or just relaxing. I’ve definitely improved in subjects I used to struggle with, and I feel more confident now.

Overall, I think one-on-one international schooling is great if you like personalized learning and a quieter environment.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117348162291528858510/reviews
