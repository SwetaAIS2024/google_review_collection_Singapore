Justin Lee,5,Highly recommended place for French food. Fresh baked bread was one of the best tasted. Ordered the 3 course set lunch was such great value. Got the French onion soup for appetiser. Felt like it was a little too watery but taste was decent. Cheeseburger and fries were well cooked. The pine nut tart had the right texture and was paired with light cream which wasn‚Äôt too sweet. Would recommend!,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107374628830921760349/reviews
Lee puiwah,1,"I was there for Valentine‚Äôs Day celebration, the food was so so and not worth the price at all. The steak was so oily, the red wine was so normal yet so expensive. We waited so long for the main course to come even there‚Äôs not much ppl in the restaurant. The food was totally not related with French food, just normal western food. With such price and expensive service charge, the waiter didn‚Äôt even willing to help us take a picture even we asked politely, I was so speechless. Around RM450 for two person with such quality, no kidding. üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117292482519571893546/reviews

illion,3,"We heard about the 1 for 1 deal online and decided to check it out. The food was ok. The atmosphere was non existent. It doesn‚Äôt feel like a restaurant or even a French one. Their food is not cheap obviously.

The location is very far out from anything nearby so it‚Äôs best if you can drive here.

The toilet is outside in the vicinity and not part of the restaurant.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105995504965523032593/reviews
