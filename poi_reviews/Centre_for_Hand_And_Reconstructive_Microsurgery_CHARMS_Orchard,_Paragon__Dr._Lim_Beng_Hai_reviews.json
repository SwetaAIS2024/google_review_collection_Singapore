      "text": "I’m writing to share feedback regarding my 23-year-old son’s recent consultations with Dr. Lim Beng Hai for ganglion cysts on both hands.\n\nAt the first visit on April 22nd, I requested that both hands be examined, but only the right was assessed. Despite the MRI not yet being completed, surgical options were discussed immediately, which left my son confused. The MRI later revealed a partial ligament tear — a condition not typically requiring surgery, as confirmed by two other surgeons.\n\nOn April 24th, I requested aspiration instead of surgery. A steroid injection was given, but aspiration was postponed due to my son’s vasovagal response. When we returned the next day for the left hand, I explicitly declined a steroid injection based on medical advice. However, it was administered, with insufficient explanation that a local anesthetic would also be used. I’m still unclear whether aspiration was actually performed.. As I understand now after taking to other surgeons an aspiration is typically done first, followed by a steroid injection to reduce inflammation and lower the risk of recurrence .\n\nAdditionally, we were charged a first consultation fee on the 25th for  the left hand and had to request a detailed invoice manually. While I do not object to the cost,  a clearer communication, informed consent, and billing transparency should have been there.",

His hands and accuracy in procedure and after care - I know talent when I see and feel it. Then later on - all well known Drs and friends told me how highly regarded and famous he is. Such a humble and kind man. It was my luck to meet this Dr during emergency. God Bless this practice. It’s worth every penny. They know their work and are backed by decades of top qualification and experience and are talented in their field. Humble and with integrity to their profession.",
