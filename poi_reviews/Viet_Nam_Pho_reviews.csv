lontongstroong,4,"Affordable Vietnamese cuisine, which is a rare find here in Singapore. Pho is priced at $6–8, banh mi at $5, and shared items like goi cuon are around $4–5. Set meals — such as pho or banh mi with iced coffee (ca phe) — cost just 50 cents more than ordering the main item alone.

The banh mi was filling and simple, filled with a proper amount of crackling pork belly, sausage, carrot and cucumber julienne, coriander leaves, and a drizzle of sour and slightly spicy dilute sauce. The pho broth was lighter than most phos I've had elsewhere (note I've never been to Vietnam so I might be wrong here) and filled to the brim. The chicken meat chunks were soft enough and not dry thankfully.

There's only semi-outdoor dining option available, but the seating is way too closely packed and given the seating arrangement, it's not single diner friendly. Perhaps some outdoor patio umbrellas can be added to provide more seating.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews
LP Pua,4,"Ordered the Beef Pho with Coffee set for $8. The beef noodle soup had the typical Vietnamese beef flavor, which, while not my preference as I favor the clear soup type, was still acceptable. The bowl was large, filled to the brim, and came with a generous portion of beef—the most I’ve had in a single serving. The Vietnamese coffee was exactly to my liking.

The owner, who appeared to be Vietnamese, was very friendly. However, there are no tables inside the shop; all seating is along the corridors, which can get hot if you're near the sun. Overall, while not the best, it was an enjoyable meal.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Sarah,5,"We had the beef noodle soup, the rice vermicelli with shredded pork, and mixed spring rolls.

Both dishes are very good. The beef noodles soup was large with generous slices of beef. The soup was a little overpowered by the basil spice but still very delicious.

The vermicelli with pork was a delight. The sauce definitely made the dish.

Didn’t quite rate the mixed spring rolls. The skin on the fresh ones were thick and made it hard to eat, and the taste was slightly lacking. The fried ones were yummy but the texture a little off.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112317241939798037218/reviews

CK C,5,"This small eatery serves legit Vietnamese food and drinks, at competitive prices. For the price point, it is probably the best in terms of quality and quantity. The beef slices were very tender. The spring rolls were packed full of fresh ingredients. Staff were friendly, and can converse in Mandarin and English. E-payment was available.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
