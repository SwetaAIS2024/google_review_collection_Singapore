Abraham Lee,5,"Pretty solid hotpot imo and Iâ€™d rate it higher than the likes of the popular chains outside. The only downside is the levy needed to get in. But if you are already inside, one of the best options! Solid ingredient choices and they even have other variety of dishes as well. We had the pork broth and Tom yum soup base which was tasty and blended well with the ingredients. Service is prompt and polite and the ambience is plush and oriental. I guess it helps if you have vouchers to redeem to get a free meal as well!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews
Jovan Kun,4,"The hotpot is good especially the tom yum and pork bone base. If you get 2 different base, you can choose 4 meats and 5 veggies ( mushroom, tofu, veggie etc). You can add more but it's kind of expensive S$2/ each.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105403939525392995024/reviews
Jolyn T,5,"To me it is one of the most affordable individual hotpot around MBS. Love their concept and love that I get to experience this inside the casino.

Plus we also used the casino vouchers!

We had the individual hotpot and the build your own noodles. Paired that with some wines, voila ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101065326896047261376/reviews
Shinichiro Yamaji,4,"I enjoy having ""steam boat""(hot pot),.First of all, you can choose your favorite ingredients and add any topping you like. for example, Beef, seafood, noodles, shrimp dumlpings, handmade  balls, homemade fish glue and so on. I like soup base not too think and not seasoned. it's so good. I felt like home cooked style hot pot.(cozy eating place)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109210383038334796633/reviews
Phatt Asa,4,"Despite the bustling crowds, Fat Choi Hotpot's shrimp was a standout, cooked to perfection.

However, the overall experience was marred by crowded conditions and slightly neglected table cleanliness.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117246556409748646242/reviews
