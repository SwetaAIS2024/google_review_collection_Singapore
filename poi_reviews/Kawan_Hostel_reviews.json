      "text": "I stayed at this hostel in Little India, Singapore, during my trip in March 2024. While the location was fantastic—convenient and close to many attractions in the area—the experience overall was just okay.\n\nThe biggest downside was the price. It felt quite expensive for what was offered, especially considering the size of the rooms. They were small and a bit cramped, which made it feel less comfortable than I had hoped. However, the hostel was clean and had the basic amenities you need for a short stay.\n\nThe location, though, was definitely a big plus. Little India is vibrant and full of culture, with plenty of food options and things to explore nearby. Overall, I'd rate the hostel as 3 stars—decent for a short, budget stay, but not quite worth the high price tag. If you're looking for something affordable and central, this could work, but don't expect luxury.",

Rooms are not so big but the location is good near the city center, restaurant, bar, sightseeing and public transport. They provide complementary breakfast and free Singapore SIM card with Wi-Fi. Staffs are professional and helpful. Kitchen facility with bread toaster, micro-oven, instant tea & coffee makers facility was good. Complementary breakfast with bread, butter and tea or coffee.",

Rooms are shabby,no secure atomsphere,no records of guest moving & out, cockroaches could be seen on the beds & floors. Only Reception looks attractive.",

Its near MRT and to each of the tourist spot in Singapore. Its very accessible and its cheap. The one who assisted us named Mikey was a Filipina shes so kind :) The restroom is nice, no issues with the shower and the toilet.  Just don't expect for the free breakfast they offer, because its only bread, not the typical breakfast :)\nI would recommend this hostel for sure. Thanks !",
