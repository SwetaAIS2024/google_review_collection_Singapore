Generous portion, order large if you have buffet appetite.\n\nCome before 12pm because sold out damm early due to popularity. The black/white carrot cake also must try.\n\nHighly reccomended!",

      "text": "Found this stall through some viral Facebook post by some food reviewer. Honestly one of the best bowls lor mee I‚Äôve had by far. Broth was thick but not too starchy, consistent enough to have that succulent texture and taste wise, definitely can beat a lot of ‚Äúfamous‚Äù lor mee stalls I‚Äôve been to. Ingredients are top quality and super generous!! (Maybe because the owner/chef is a huuuge dude and that‚Äôs how bodybuilders eat lol)\n10/10 for $$ worth\n10/10 for broth\n12/10 for customer service (owner is always smiling and is super polite to everyone - even to this older person queued in front of me who was trying to give him a hard time‚Ä¶very rare for young people to have such good attitude to especially in a hawker setting where no one expects such.)\n\nHighly recommend!  Do support this young hawker with good attitude and good food üëçüèªüíØ",

      "text": "Chance upon this lor mee stall at this hawker centre at 50a marine Terrace. The Lor Mee stall occupied half of the Xing Long cooked food which sell stuff like fried carrot cake and etc.\n\nA bowl of lor mee starts from SGD$4 onwards.  The bowl of lor mee came with items such as half a braised egg, braised pork belly. Fried fish and fishskin as well as beancurd skin roll. Opted for the combo of yellow noodle and beehoon.\n\nGravy is quite dark in colour and on the sweeter side which i not such a big fan of. Gravy turns watery quite fast as well.  Not bad but quite easy to jelat due to gravy. Overall, still a decent bowl of lormee.",
