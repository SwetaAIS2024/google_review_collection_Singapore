lilyleanna,1,"Came here on 27 Feb at 4pm. Your cashier manning the counter is busy with her phone. When I called her to make an order, she sounded pissed. I told her I wanted Rose Lychee. She has the audacity to ask me which One in a rude tone. She said Lychee got so many types, which one. I mean there is only one rose lychee right? After making the drinks, not even a thank you. Do I owe her a living?",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101753819474938036300/reviews

Ledon Wong,1,"Buy at your own risk! Had a very bad experience on 04 Feb 2024 at around 4.45pm. Ordered the so-called promotion drinks, was told only after ordering that we can pay using cash only. We only have a $50 note and they have no change for that. No solution from them they did not try to find smaller change and tried to push everything to the customer to pay in exact cash. Finally they agreed for us to pay using pay now and yet insisted on us to show proof of payment when they can also check on their end but theyâ€™re too lazy to check.
Just very irked by their laziness and also pushing all the problems to the customers. Especially when it is supposed to be the vendor to prepare small change.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103010729946586457274/reviews
rosie,2,"The drinks are fine but the service is terrible. Messed up our order a couple of times in the past but that's fine, mistakes happen. Slow to take order because they were chatting amongst themselves, that's fine too, not my problem as long as they don't ignore us. What I cannot tolerate how exceedingly rude the two girls at the counter are, to not only myself but the other customers waiting, makes me wonder if they are being underpaid?? not the first time my friends and myself experienced the disrespect from them, girl get a new job if you're gonna be this rude at randos just trying to enjoy their beverages.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116930872578132588646/reviews
