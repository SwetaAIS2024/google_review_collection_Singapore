When I went there for the first time in a while, I was impressed to see that the entrance to the rail corridor had been maintained.

Until then, although it was thought to be an entrance/exit, it was a back route that had to be climbed over a fence and then passed along a plank across the irrigation canal.

Since it's nostalgic, I'll also include a photo taken in April 2021.
