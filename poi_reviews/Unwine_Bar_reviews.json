They are also serving free flow cold brew green tea.\n\nOverall good value for money and would recommend for a casual lunch if you are looking for a place to eat in IOI.\n\nPost 2nd visit review: second time ordering fried chicken and both times inside of the chicken was red and looked unappetizing. Provided feedback to management the first time and they did not really action upon it apparently. I would suggest to avoid the fried chicken.",
