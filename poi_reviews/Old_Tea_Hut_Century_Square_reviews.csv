Tay Yeng Hwee,5,"My daily drink - the ice lemon tea kosong. Always love the service here, staff knows exactly what I want just from my face.

Weekends seem to have only one staff in this outlet, so queue can sometimes be long during peak period. But staff was friendly and always get my order right.

Kudos to the service staff here - ain’t an easy job standing for so many hours. But they keep my eyes open with the great service and my daily caffeine. 🙂👍",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101419208683958086223/reviews
Siah Hx,3,"I wld say Just another ""coffee shop"" in neighbourhood. Nothing to wow about. And price isn't exactly cheap too.

Tried their Teh C Ice, hmm... average tasting, kinda diluted and not because the ice had melted.

There are better coffee/tea shops in and around SG.

Outlet is located at level 1, facing the road.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103944670556353820143/reviews
SZ,3,I ordered salted lemon with an additional of 20cents lemon to make it more sour. Imagine my disappointment when I see 4 micro slices of lemon and 2 unsqueezed lime. What’s the point of putting lime in the drink without squeezing it first? Am I supposed to fish it out from under the ice? It goes to say the drink is just a salty sugar concoction without much citrus taste. I had better ones from novena outlet.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106389252403483357700/reviews

Amanda Dan,1,"“I used to love coming to this tea hut, but today left me feeling incredibly disappointed. I ran all the way there, excited to get my usual coffee, only to find the shop closed far earlier than usual. This isn’t the first time it’s happened, and it’s becoming seriously frustrating. The sign said they’d be back at 12 PM, but I arrived at 10:46 AM—well before noon—and it was already shut down. I can’t rely on this place if they’re going to keep closing without warning. Hopefully, they’ll start sticking to their posted hours so customers like me aren’t left disappointed. But until then, I can’t recommend it.”",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116026186875072006092/reviews
