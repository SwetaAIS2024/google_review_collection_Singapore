      "text": "Nestled in a still-developing neighborhood, this small kopitiam is bustling at 5 pm on a weekend! Despite its compact layout and narrow seating, the place is packed.\n\nThe popular Ipoh tze char stall already has a line at 5 pm. Their Moonlight Hor Fun ($6.30) is silky and smooth, gliding down easily. The prawn paste chicken (small portion) offers nine pieces for $12.\n\nWe also tried the 三拼 from the roast duck stall, a reasonable choice at $15. The duck has a distinctive herbal flavor that stands out.\n\nAnother favorite here is the Yong Tau Fu, with a fast-moving queue. For $5, you can select five ingredients with rice or noodles, or six without. It’s very budget-friendly.\n\nOverall, the food is decent but nothing extraordinary. Judging by the crowd, I suspect the kopitiam’s popularity might be due to its connection to celebrities.",
