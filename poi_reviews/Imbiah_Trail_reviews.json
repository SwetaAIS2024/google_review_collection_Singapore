The bad part is you can hear loud music from the other corner of the island, which spoil the serenity and calmness this track should have. Found a beautiful chameleon along the way though.",

If you are a nature-lover as well as sport-lover you need to be visiting this amazing trail once!\n\nIn the first place, me and my friends want to buy a cable-ticket to comeback to Vivocity but the price is not kinda reasonable so we dicided to take this trail and its been a really splendid journey for all of Us\n\nAlong the trail are breath-taking flora, when you take a stroll you could observe gently the beauty of the forrest located in this island!!! Following the road, I heard a tons of sound from birds and monkey which make this place more vibrant 游녨游낕\n\nWhen you come through the forrest you can see the city clearly!!!!",
