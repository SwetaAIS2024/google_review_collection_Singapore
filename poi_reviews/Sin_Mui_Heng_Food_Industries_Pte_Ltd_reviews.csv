Xavvy-licious Serene. S,5,"I always purchase SMH Char Siew Baos but didn't realised that they actually have dumplings in their product line!

Tried the dumplings in the following flavours:
Lotus Leaf Nyonya Chicken Dumplings - I loved this the most! Well flavoured chunky chicken bites wrapped with glutinous rice in beautiful blue.

Lotus Leaf Chicken Dumplings (Purple Rice) - a healthier choice with higher anti-oxidant! The overall texture was great!

Lotus Leaf Red Bean Dumplings- I will eat this like a dessert! Great for vegetarian.

Lotus Leaf Assortment Dumplings if you want to try all flavours!

And the dumplings were wrapped in lotus leaf instead for a lightly added flavor. As for the size, do not worry about over eating. I love the proportion and the convenience! Just steam to reheat and its all ready to eat!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100045563829427788842/reviews
SgLbH,2,"Found 1 big piece and 1 small piece of onion skins inside the glutinous rice! Not the first time. Ever since they ""improved"" the recipe, onion skin is the added ingredient! Their chicken charsiew pau is overly sweet - should reduce sugar by at least 50%! Chee Cheong Fun has a very small packet of sweet sauce - should provide 2 packets for each box. I think SQ Krisflyer lounge at Changi Airport is using their chicken charsiew pau & siew mai in the buffet spread.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114574893316841725235/reviews
