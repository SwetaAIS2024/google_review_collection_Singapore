wee see heng,1,"If you are looking for girls to chit chat (English or Chinese), or looking for girls to sing together (English or Chinese), this is not the place. They don't really can understand English\Chinese, cos when I try to chat with them, can tell by their face they don't understand and they don't care and bother to find out what I trying to say...
Will serve you a plate of fruits that not really look good and taste nice of $10 when your 1st call drink.
Went here twice, 1st time, 1 girl keep complaint about other customers: said them all very Lustful, touch here and there, just want to sleep with her... means if you are looking for happy experience and happy ending, also not this open concept KTV. 2nd time, no service at all, girls show tired face, black face and temper. can't chit chat at all (don't know what to talk about when they don't bother). my drink not finish around 1 plus to 2 (they closing at 3), 1 girl already ask when am I going to leave? I said when I finished my drink, then she ask the other girl and waiter to come and drink my drink to get it finish fast, and the girl show face of the drink taste terrible to me... after tips she ask me to give the waiter tip too...
That was my really bad experience here for everyone reference.
I always ask myself when I met this kind of cases/peoples, I did anything wrong or any words offend anyone of them there? answer is NO.
I think this place is just a group of princess that don't know what they are doing, or open business just to serve their own country peoples or customer that understand\like their custom\songs etc...
