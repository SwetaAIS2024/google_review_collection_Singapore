My guests love the variety of sauces and even dabao the only remaining nacho cheese and  black pepper home. ðŸ˜‚\nThe mac and cheese were a hit amongst the youngsters and were wiped out within two hours!\nMy first time catering western cuisine and definitely wont be my last.\nHighly recommended for those who want something refreshingly new and away from the rendang n ketupat spread for Hari Raya.\nFriendly staff and very responsive during enquiry.\nOverall 5/5 stars.",

It was quite disappointing because we have been meaning to try it for awhile but it wasn't as tasty as it could have been. The nacho cheese on the volcano burger was cold, the buns was cold. The beef patty itself was delicious but still.. pretty standard. I wish they added more onions, lettuce & heat the buns with butter or SOMETHING just dont serve them cold? I love the hawker center itself but Brostern, this is a stern warning to please do something about your burger aside from your patty. I want to support local businesses!",
