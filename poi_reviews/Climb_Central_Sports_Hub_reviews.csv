Mohammad Firdaus,5,"My first visit to Climb Central Sports Hub was a fantastic experience. I appreciated how straightforward the process was: filling out the waiver form, making payment for the session and equipment rental, and getting started.

What stood out to me the most was the emphasis on safety. The staff conducted a thorough safety briefing and practice session before issuing name tags. They ensured that everyone above 13 years old was proficient in belaying and gave us a chance to familiarize ourselves with the automatic belay system. This was a step I hadn’t encountered at another climbing venue two years ago, and it made a big difference in building confidence.

I also liked how every course was clearly labeled with its difficulty level. This made it easier for amateur climbers like us to pick suitable challenges. I managed to complete four courses designed for children, which helped boost my confidence as I reacquainted myself with climbing. Our daughter had an amazing time too—her enthusiasm was infectious. She eagerly explored different courses, and seeing peers her age climbing alongside her inspired her to push her limits and aim higher with each attempt.

The entire experience at Climb Central, from the organization to the positive atmosphere, rekindled my interest in wall climbing after more than a decade of inactivity following marriage. I’m excited to return regularly with my family and continue exploring this rewarding activity together.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115818254355459786902/reviews
Cheok Olivia,5,Climbing gym friendly for beginners and experienced climbers alike. Has auto-belay lanes for those who climb solo and they change their routes fairly often.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102626143264279184348/reviews
Nikto Niemand,3,"Only thing that marred the experience was the instructor being unnecessarily and persistently sexist while doing the safety training.

Otherwise the staff helping with registration and rentals were really nice and helpful, and the climbing facilities themselves were great. Lots of fun options and the autobelayer worked better than I thought it would.

Once you get past the safety training I think you can just get to climbing with friends or alone, the bad impression at safety training makes it hard to wholeheartedly recommend this place but hopefully it's not something you have to keep experiencing. Just be prepared.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115412605496210164214/reviews
Dr Reviews,4,"Climb Central located at Kallang Wave mall   is a pretty good place to rock climb for all levels of wall climbing be they  beginners, intermediate or the experienced climbers.

If its your first time climbing at any Climb Central branch then even if you are an expert, you will still have to attend a mandatory lesson to get yourself a pass.

The staff are quite nice and are willing to help. The place has the manual and the automatic belay system. Their walls can be quite challenging with the jutting out pieces getting smaller or tougher to grip onto as you make your way higher up the wall.

There are lockers and cupboards placed there for precious items and they have  changing rooms which are in the bathroom.

They also added a water cooler near the lockers for which you would need a bottle to use.

Overall its a pretty good place for rock climbing but if you have really young kids, it might be a bit tough on them.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112747621045786494145/reviews
YOLO,3,"Good climbing routes with mix of lead climbing , auto belay and bouldering . The staff is good BUT the facility lacks the basic infrastructure for a women’s toilet inside the gym for which a female has to go find one around the mall , good luck with finding a restroom and using it if there is a concert at the venue.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100969296331325030457/reviews
