Pei,5,"Located within River Wonders, this unlimited boat ride offers the chance to spot Amazonian animals like jaguars, tapirs, and giant anteaters along the river for an additional $5 ticket.

Keep in mind that animal sightings are not guaranteed due to their naturalistic enclosures.

There are a few gentle slopes during the ride for a touch of excitement. Be aware that it can get quite hot in the afternoon.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107008951870777106419/reviews
Dru Lu,4,"It’s a pretty fun amusement park ride, but not so great if you actually want to see animals. Half of the animals are either missing or not quite visible as they hide away. The great thing about it is that you can re-queue and go on the ride again if you want another chance of catching the animals. Be careful on the first drop as there will be quite a lot of water rushing in, lift your feet up if you don’t want wet feet!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115927493800245457440/reviews
xiaxin yang,4,Love it! It is very intersting to see the different animals especially the capabaras! I recommend trying it. It cost 5 dollers which is quite expensive but with the membership you can go on it for free! You also can ride it unlimited times as long as you do not exit the ride. My only complain is that it took  too long to get off the ride.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114648719448276613575/reviews
Luna Tan,4,"The ride is okay, managed to see quite a few animals in the enclosure. Though we do feel the boat moved a little too fast for us to enjoy the animal sightseeing.

We went on a weekend at about 12pm+ and there wasn't a crowd. By the time when we finish the 5 min ride, there was a long queue. Guess we were lucky!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103424959065800982758/reviews
Alvin Koh,5,"Ride was not bad, visit on Sunday and to our surprise there is no queue. They allow us to re-ride again again. Due to the re-ride we get to see more and more animal as sometime these animal hides and not able to see all of them. Took us a few ride to get to see all the animals in action. For those who don’t want to be disappointed have to go for the multiple ride to see them.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110030848720883479359/reviews
