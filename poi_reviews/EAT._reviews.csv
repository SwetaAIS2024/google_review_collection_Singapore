Anson Chew,3,"I stopped by Eat. at HarbourFront on a public holiday and ordered the laksa set (which came with tea) and the curry chicken chop rice. The pricing felt fair for the quality nothing exceptional, but decent enough for a quick meal. However, the public holiday rush seemed to stretch their staff thin. It was hard not to notice the leftover plates stacking up on nearby tables, spilling over due to delays in clearing. This understandably affected the overall dining atmosphere.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114748016520143042702/reviews
Richmond Tan,2,Great service by uncle/aunty. However the food standard and is really quite bad relative to other eat outlet. Noodles were plain (minced meat/fishball) and lacking in taste. Added more chili but the chili and vinegar are pre mixed hence you cannot add too much or it’ll be very sour. Hope management can look into QC-ing the quality of food.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116119821736536489529/reviews
Emily Tan,3,Food is average but service is 1 star. The uncle who cooks and the cashier uncle is always bad tempered. A few times I saw the cashier uncle scolded the elderly when they made their order slowly or clarify with them about their order. Shouldn't treat your customer so rudley especially to elderly!Management should give training and give warning to these 2 men.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108138737995015900194/reviews

Almost every time I visit Harbour Front, I find myself eating at EAT. It’s a reliable choice when I’m unsure what to eat. This time, I ordered their dry mee pok. The flavor is decent, and the portion is just right. The fishballs are chewy and relatively big, although the toppings are minimal. The overall taste of the mee pok is light and not overwhelming.

The Teochew fishball soup is another dish I tried. The fishballs have a nice texture and a distinct meaty flavor, served simply in broth without additional ingredients. The broth itself is flavorful enough to be enjoyed on its own.

Strangely, when I alternated between bites of mee pok and sips of the fishball soup, the mee pok seemed to lose some of its appeal afterward. Maybe the simplicity of the soup overshadowed it.

A dependable stop for simple, hearty meals.

Natasha Tjahjadi,4,"The chicken cutlet lor mee was pretty good! The chicken was crispy with sufficient amount of meat and lor mee was nice and light.

Always value for money and decent food! Don't know why people rate eat so low.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101744417641852989607/reviews
