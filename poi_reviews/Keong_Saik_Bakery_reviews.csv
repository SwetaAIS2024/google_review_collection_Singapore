Audrey L,1,"Another overated cafe found on Google maps. The interior has a modern industrial vibe — spacious and stylish, but it lacks comfortable seating like couches.

The coffee was priced higher than Starbucks, yet tasted worse than a typical kopitiam brew, maybe the 3 in 1 coffee you made is better.
The salmon bagel was overly chewy, not up to standard which was quite disappointing.

Overall, while the environment is pleasant, the quality of food and drinks did not justify the above-average prices.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106228869753266299155/reviews
亦泓,4,"Decent options for pastries and cakes both sweet and savoury. Unfortunately no loaves happen to be available when we visited.

Good enough matcha latte, not overly matcha pungent for people who cannot do the original legit, but they cannot omit sugar was told premix with sugar.

Tried their hotfood some laksa baked cheese mac, i think teenagers will like it. Certainly good enough to keep people looking for some comfort food happy. Nice decor wit array of plastic baked products on display like a museum, good amount of space used up for it but to begin with we didnt see much crowd compared to syip across the mezzazine.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115530236241481136259/reviews
Kevin Huang,5,"Cosy cafe with space (which is not common in many commercial cafes). A bit of a home feeling with unique pastry choices.

Janet, the service staff who attended to us, was very friendly and gave good suggestions for our food choice.

It was such a pleasure to dine and have coffee here!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107560681773196234878/reviews
Julius Tan,5,"Happened to buy their clairssants at a Takashimaya food fair. WOW I really enjoyed their pastry, both the mentaiko and chicken floss otah clairssants are really good and moreish, you really can’t stop at one. Would definitely be back to try their other products and pastries.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113038098593710664705/reviews
Fabian Lim,1,"We read the good reviews and decided to order food from Keong Saik for our corporate event.

It turns out to be a nightmare!

Customer service was terrible when we wanted to add additional items, delivery was so late that we had to amend our break timing, leaving my audience hungry, hopefully not angry. But we were angry.

When the delivery came, there were missing items. OMG!!!

If you want to be embarrassed and your audience hungry, please be my guest.

I won't recommend.

Sometimes, I wondered. Can average quality food give Keong Saik bakery the permission to be arrogant in their service delivery.

What a bad before and after taste.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117953865555606690766/reviews
