Charles Sng (aMusephotographer),5,"Noticed this nice cafe near my neighbourhood and finally went there for their breakfast for two promo with my wife. For just $10, each of us have a nice fluffy sandwich with ham and a nice cup of latte. We enjoyed our breakfast very much. The staffs there are very pleasant and the atmosphere is joyful despite being busy during the morning peak hours. Will visit again ðŸ˜Š",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108112449845115745267/reviews

Alexander Finch,5,Slightly easier on the wallet compared to Starbucks - almost exact same business model - suntec branch would go for Starbucks over this because of the awesome view - but on the plus side coffee bean is less crowded / better value / good for studying / meetings etc... Both solid options ðŸ’¯,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115103887783401766906/reviews
