Jasmine Therese Ng,5,"We had a great dining experience at this restaurant. It‚Äôs a gem for anyone looking for good food in a relaxing, family-friendly setting. The ambience is calm and welcoming, with plenty of space and thoughtful touches that make it easy to bring kids along.

We ordered the steak and pork, and both dishes were spot on. The meat was tender, cooked perfectly, and full of flavor. Portions were satisfying, and the prices felt very reasonable for the quality. It‚Äôs definitely a place we‚Äôd return to. Great for a casual dinner or a relaxed weekend meal with the family.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111797903298053588563/reviews
Bernard Lim,5,"Lovely homely place with a wide spread in the menu!

We had the oysters which were fresh, sweet and plumb. The pork was fragrant and paired perfectly with the whipped potatoes. The Dons were very well done too!!

Also, kids eat for free! Such a good deal! Savings!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117750931718255847749/reviews
Jason Lim,5,"Happen to stumble upon this outlet of Lazy Lizard in Upper Thomson.

Surprised by it's selection of food on the menu. Particularly the Japanese üáØüáµ menu.

The gang tried one rice üåæ bowl üçö each.

We were all impressed and blown away by the portions and taste.

Also impressed with the warm welcome and service rendered to our table.

Highly recommend anyone to check this outlet out if happen to be in the area. üëç",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108711445962963678471/reviews
Janice Sam,4,"We (family of 3, 2 adult one child) come to Lazy Lizard Upper Thomson a couple of times alr. The food are awesome. Kid eats for free with one main ordered. Kid portions are quite huge. The kids food are a little bit on the salty and sweet side. But once in a while should be fine. Pizzas are delicious, especially truffle salami.

Not a lot of people, always managed to get a table promptly.

Service staffs are attentive.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109352286047597880850/reviews
Amber Deux,5,"First time here!

Tried their Hokkaido Oysters. Half dozen for $10, super worth it. The fresh one is fleshy and fresh. The baked cheese one is juicy with a generous layer of savoury melted cheese and mayonnaise.

The pork rack 350g is super huge, probably can share with someone. The meat is super soft and tender, the peppercorn cream sauce is so fragrant and enhanced the flavours of the meat. Love the fries that taste good even when cold.

The sirloin steak is good too. The pepper taste is on the stronger side with a spicy kick.

They give a free juice or double scoop ice cream for a Google review.

I will definitely be back to try more of their dishes",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103937834318495304089/reviews
