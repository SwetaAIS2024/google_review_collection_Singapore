      "text": "3.5 stars!\n\nOrdered their butter chicken roll for $8.90. It's a long thin wrap and on the smaller side.\n\nThe chicken meat is a bit dry and the wrap has no sauce, but it's decently flavourful! Had some crunchy veggies inside but wish it was more filling. Prata wrap is very crispy and nice!\n\nOverall not bad taste and an interesting concept, but I personally wouldn't buy again haha. I do like that they provide a small seating area with free tissue, and that the staff helpfully informed us that it will take 7 to 8 minutes to prepare the food.",

The momos tasted as if, they were market frozen ones ,tasted full bland and not even salt was there. The staffs were polite and quick with the order.",
