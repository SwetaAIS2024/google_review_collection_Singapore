If you are afraid of flying bugs don't come here. There will be flying bugs but thats just due to the proximity with nature.",

      "text": "The whole unit is rather dilapidated. The drawers are mostly broken, cupboard doors mostly coming off too. Don't know why they don't bother to repair it. Kitchen toilet cannot be used. The flush is not working, if you get someone to come and fix, the water will be leaking. So in the end cannot use. The other toilet door cannot choose smoothly. You need to exert force to close it. Children will not be able to use.  The other toilet smells. The pillows are with hair. The chopping board has hair too. Goodness. The cleanliness is worst. The whole place is full of ants, millipedes and slug, and all sorts of flies. The microwave had splatter on top and the side. I need to clean it my myself before using it, with the fear of what was being heated up before me.  I hope the cleanliness can be improved as the price of the chalet is not exceptionally cheap yet the standard is as such.  Another thing is I wasn't given the swimming passes, and I had to go all the way back to the CSC check in office to get the coupons then back to the swimming pool then go back to the isolated chalet...",
