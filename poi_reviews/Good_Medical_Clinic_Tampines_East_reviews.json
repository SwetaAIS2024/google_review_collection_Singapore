As a FTM, his answers & advices made me more confident in caring for my sick child. Thank you Dr Wei for the excellent care.\n\nThe receptionists (Jannah & another malay lady) were also helpful in making sure the registration was smooth. I noticed that there was a crowd of ppl but they cleared them swiftly.\n\nDefinitely recommended for families with kids. There's also a small area for kids to sit & read books.",

Made a wasted trip, not very nice for patients who are feeling unwell so i think if you were to close registration earlier than stated, it would be nice to state it online. Thank you",
