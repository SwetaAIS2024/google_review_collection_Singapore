Orange,4,They gave paper straws for the mochi matcha strawberry which melts like 5 min into the drink. Drink is not overly sweet. Staff is nice in introducing new drinks,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
Homey Cow,5,"This is a compliment to the 2 young Starbucks staff on duty at Yew Tee Pt branch on 21/4/25 (Mon) at around 8.30pm. The young lady staff recommended my daughter to try Sea Breeze Mint Chocolate Coffee Frappuccino (Less Sweet) if she would like a not too sweet cold coffee. It is indeed nice, esp cuz it has similar taste as Starbucks' X'mas Peppermint Mocha, which is our entire family's favourite drink! They also prepared my hot Pure Matcha Latte to perfection! Their cheerful and warm disposition, as well as their great work attitude, is highly appreciated!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112284742048734014595/reviews
MD Yasin (lokisg3),5,"Dining at Yee Tee point next to Yew Tee MRT. The store can be found on the first floor and it is well hidden. If you like a quiet place, with less people and dislikes having everyone staring at you eating from the outside. Then this is your place, only a few downsides. No windows to look outside, food might be limited but it might be me coming after lunch time and the seating might be small or limited the numbers of people seating. Other than that, the server is super nice, even serves my food and drinks to my table which I could collect myself since I'm very close to the collection table.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110169556115366075748/reviews
Nate Spoiled,5,"1st time eating here. The experience is great. Food taste good. The staff are very welcoming.

Our order is in the pics. Drinks is oatmilk cocca machiato (very bitter) & flat white.

Deep beef pie and the creamy chicken foldover is the must try item. They taste really good. Beef pie with the strong aroma tomato base and the foldover and maple pecan apple cake, both taste is well balanced.  Come try!

P.s. : I have sweet tooth. ðŸ˜…",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112990853643161056613/reviews
Emily Ho,5,"I've been here a few times and always enjoyed their breakfast sets, especially the meatless wrap. Wish they put it back in the breakfast set menu! Service was always good. They were OK to add a little bit of oat milk to my black coffee, which I appreciated very much.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106638367480970822498/reviews
