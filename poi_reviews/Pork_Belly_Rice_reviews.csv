Mr Wang Wang,4,"I visited during a weekday lunchtime and decided to order the beef noodles. The service was impressively fast, and my meal arrived in no time. The noodles were quite enjoyable, with the beef slices tender and flavorful, although the separate broth have had a bit more depth. Overall, the dish was satisfying but not outstanding. The portion size was quite small for the price of $5.00, making it a decent option for a quick, convenient lunch. The restaurant was moderately busy but still had a free seating arrangement.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100792947771991544056/reviews

Jodeci Fine,5,"Went hiking in Ubi industrial area for fun and finding hidden gem stall along the way.

This is our latest find '老祖宗卤肉饭'. Stall name looks cute & serious. 竟然连老祖宗的名都用上了. Of course we must give it a try. Only one main item in their menu. Got a bowl $5 to share(reasonably priced & generous portion). Boss freshly fried an egg and cook/reheat braised meat just in front of you. What we observed is uncle always looking focussed while preparing and imo it's quite authentic.

We are surprised by the portion of braised meat. Very appealing & appetizing. Also with a bowl of flavourful soup! Mix every grain of rice with the wonderful braised meat. 哇 我的老祖宗啊! So delicious!! Braised meat was well-cooked soft(入味), with yummy fatty bits and with wee-bit of vinegar taste. Reminds me a little of bak chang filling. Perfect 卤肉饭 in industrial park. Will surely be back again!
