      "text": "I’m an occasional traveller to this area, and often felt that whoever planned the architecture/walkway for this bus stop kinda dropped the ball on many things. Here are some possible points of improvement from a layperson’s perspective, which could’ve improved the commuters’ user experience (UX) significantly:\n\n1) Thickness\nThe pillars are way too thick, and the bigger base actually takes up much more space than it should, had they gone with a more streamlined shape\n2) Quantity\nThere are way too many pillars to support an unnecessarily thick roof. The objective should’ve been to provide more shelter, and they shld have gone with a lighter material with a larger surface area, hence reducing also the thickness and frequency of pillars\n3) Focus on the end user\nFor a customised shelter, the pillars feel haphazardly placed, often blocking important walkways or merging lanes, hence creating pedestrian “bottlenecks”. If the pillars were the legacy product, the walkway planning should’ve catered to the existing structures, bearing in mind rush hour human traffic since Sengkang is one of the largest yuppie towns in singapore.\n\nHope more care can be observed in future urban designs so we as the public transport commuters can have a better overall travelling experience!",
