joestoys,2,"Over price drinks on par those big clubs but they limited selections of drinks…. Come on la…. You can sell Louis XIII but don’t have Hendricks???  Again over price mediocre finger food.

Not worth for you to stay long.

Band only consist of keyboard and drummer plus singer. No guitars. Average singing. No big deal.

Plus nice visual lighting LED.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114651806834704567887/reviews
Shervin Lim,5,"Highly recommended if you want to chill and listen to some live bands. My new favourite hang out place for Friday. Everything deserves more than 5 stars, I would love to rate higher if I could. It’s always an awesome night whenever I spend my time at here. Staff, singer and the band are so nice and friendly. A place where u won’t feel bored even if you spend the night alone. I thought singer is just to sing, his jokes never failed to entertain me. Also love how he hyped everyone up and the atmosphere was so good. Together with the band(keyboardist and drummer), they are so amazing. Will definitely make a reservation and come back soon!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116547353242078609844/reviews
Caroline Tan,2,Live band singer was not bad but the audio system is way too loud for a small space. Couldn't really enjoy the live music as a result. Drinks were quite pricey. They don't seem to have their own kitchen so food orders (mainly finger food and 串串) are from the shop beside. We waited for 25 mins before they started serving us our food orders. The remaining food orders took were served progressively over the next 1 hour (with us asking for the food 4-5 times in between) and not all orders were served eventually. Also the food were way over priced. $12 for fries quantity not more than Mac's large fries and wasn't even hot when served. Only saving grace was the decent band but guess there's s lot better live band places around...,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114476380299876029753/reviews
deenie,4,"Been here quite a few times. The main pianist Zach and drummer Joe are talented and entertaining but they're not always there. The quality of singers really vary so check their socials before you come.

Highly recommend Weina. Benita, Jylian also alright. Niko, Aggy and Anthea are terrible.

The service also unpredictable - sometimes very prompt, sometimes they forget my order or take very long. But generally the drinks and food here are very expensive. Take it as you're paying a bit for a concert.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108790837788876807283/reviews
Meerkat V,4,"Really expensive cocktails even without their promotions and happy hours. Cocktails imo was average and nothing to shout about. Really unique concept of mandopop live music but however, felt the music was way too loud for the small space and the breaks in between songs from the chit chat + the breaks between performances (30mins) were too long. However, music chosen was enjoyable as it was pretty much well known music but all our song requests did not get through a single time..

Service was great from the bartender personally attending to us to recommend their cocktails. Place might be a lil too cold also for some.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100734924718125063611/reviews
