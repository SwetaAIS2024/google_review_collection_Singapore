Tricia Loh,5,"After reading the good reviews, my husband and I decided to try Shukuu izakaya out. No regrets! The sashimi platter was fresh and thick cut (worth it!), the kani gratin was so good, spicy salmon don was delicious, mentaiko rosti was tasty and their kushiyakis were üëçüèº (except pork belly slightly drier and not fatty enough ü§≠)
Really enjoyed the dishes a lot and we were beyond full as we over ordered - we left with satisfied happy bellies.

Staff were attentive and friendly as well. Will definitely return again to try other food. Recommended and thumbs up!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117666560338871938061/reviews
Donovan Leong,5,"I was here for the free flow sake event over the weekend. It was very worth it, tried so many different kinds of sake, from the hot ones such as junmai to daiginjo to doboroku.
The staff were friendly, and willing to explain the art behind the sake brewery and its food pairing as well.
I ordered some food items including skewers and the oden, pretty decent food. Crowd was great and it wasn‚Äôt too packed for the event. I was glad to be able to bring home the special event sake cup and also a tote bag.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114823484124057377487/reviews

Jolin Ang,5,"The food at Shukuu Izakaya Bar was impressive, with the cod fish and pork skewer standing out as highlights‚Äîperfectly cooked and full of flavor. The other dishes, like the eggplant, spicy salmon don, and oden, were also delicious, making for a well-rounded and satisfying meal. Would recommend to my friends :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117528807173959205566/reviews
