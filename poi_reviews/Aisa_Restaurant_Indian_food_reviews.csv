Lavender ‚ÄúLav‚Äù Sunrise,2,"All I'm saying is, waiting 30 mins for 2 leftover plain pratas and mutton that is available from the counter isn't normal. Especially when 2-3 customers who came after me got their food and left within 5 minutes.

Usually I have a decent experience with this restaurant, so I really hope this was an outlier because their food is really good for the price.

Restaurant is also decently clean.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112842606218288484732/reviews
Zhafy Zhaf,1,"Bought teh tarik one week and paid with paynow . Was charged 1.40. The following bought same teh tarik. Was charged 1.80. was given the reason unable to use paynow below 5 dollars. Really had no cash on me. Was told that extra charges will be added as below the $5 mark and the ""boss"" had just changed the system.The cashier had me wait for a solid 10 minutes while i was on crutches and didnt have any empathy towards me.Dont come here if no cash and dont wanna be scammed. üëç",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108016098175256870635/reviews
Mas Andi,5,"This small local Indian restaurant serves your usual mamak stall cuisine. Their curries are good and slightly more spicy than usual but for those who love spicy & spices, you would love this place. At the moment, they offer a lunch hour special for Mini Chicken Briyani for $5.00 & Mini Mutton Briyanj for $5.50, both meal comes with a cordial drink. I would say that is a good deal and the portion is nothing mini. Its a lot for locals and it comes with raita (cucumber, onion & chilli yogurt salad) & papadom.

In August (last month), they also had another meal deal but it was Mini Chicken or Mutton meal but instead of Briyani rice, it was served with white rice.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110845888857973818763/reviews
Claudia xuan,5,"Ordered one Egg Thosai, Chicken Masala and Teh Halia. Chicken Masala was spicy but tasty, the sauce goes very well with the Thosai.

Classic Teh Halia that aint too sweet or overpowering. Total bill of $8 for a hearty and filling meal.

Friendly service and quick serving of food. All good!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102342605769118777419/reviews
