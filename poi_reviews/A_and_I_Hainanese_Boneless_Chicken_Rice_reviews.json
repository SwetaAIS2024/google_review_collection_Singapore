Chill is also very nice. Highly recommend, although it was always long Q and long waiting time. Many times, it sold out before lunch .",

      "text": "Read pretty good reviews about the chicken rice, and as was in the vicinity, decided to takeaway half steamed chicken and half roasted chicken with 4 packets of rice for the family.\n\nThe rice was very fragrant and I can smell its aroma in the car even though I put the rice in the boot.  They were generous with the chili and soy sauce.  However, I find the chili too spicy for my liking but the 'sweet' soy sauce is good enough for me.  We were pleasantly surprised that the roast chicken was so tender and juicy.  I haven't eaten roast chicken for a very long time because among the many stalls that I have tried, the roasted chicken tends to be dry, so naturally I'm impressed with this roasted chicken. The steamed chicken is equally tender and some collagen can be seen nicely coagulated on some of the pieces. However, it can be observed that at the bottom of the box, some of the chicken blood has mixed with the chicken juices and leaving a reddish liquid at bottom of the box with the cut chicken in it and that sort of affected my appetite.\n\nBut overall, I love the rice and the roasted chicken very much. I will definitely come back for it again! However, expect to queue for a bit though.",
