Esviyola D,5,"Five star for this lovely Maplebear school. We stay at Valley Park condo hence there were other preschools within a stone's throw, however we chose Maplebear Gracefields because: 1) outdoor playground (so children could play in the open space safely), and 2) bilingual curriculum. The bonus parts were: loving and kind teachers, fun school holiday program, and diverse student base. We highly recommend Maplebear Gracefields if you're looking for a great pre-school for your children.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117031238247741192442/reviews
