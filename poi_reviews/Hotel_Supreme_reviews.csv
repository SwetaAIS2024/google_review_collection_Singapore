Emma Felices,2,"The staff were approachable and kind. However, the room is musty, the beddings, towels and curtains were too old and should have been disposed of. Rooms were dirty. There were dried rice and hair balls on the carpet. Bathrooms need hard scrubbing to remove the molds on the crevices. Not worthy for the price.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101416027269796349326/reviews
Khalid Gibran,1,"The most dirties hotel in Singapore I have ever stayed. Mouldy rooms, dirty linen, curtains, carpet and floors. When I went and complained the reception person didn't even apologize but gave me another key. When I opened the room a woman walked out and the management said she was a staff but didn't look like it. Other than a stellar location I will not encourage anyone to stay here. There are other brands such as value and hotel 81 which are 3 stars but great value for money.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100735569628066422753/reviews

Nguyen Long,1,A random guy came and knocked my door 5 times from 10pm-5am. No security whatsoever. It was freaking me out. The rest was just unacceptable. The host was nice and polite but was helpless.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107990380186775989495/reviews
