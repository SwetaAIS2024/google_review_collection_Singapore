Li Yen -,4,"Fishballs dry meepok noodles, I was eating it twice in two consecutive weeks. So far, it is one of the good dry meepok noodles in Tampines. The noodles were not overly sauced. It has a good amount of black vinegar and chilli paste. The small bowl of soup was flavourful.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107209361835014317044/reviews
Chia Zyn Loo,1,"Missed the previous Zi Char stall, will not recommend the current one. Bad experience for me. Your mileage may vary, a.k.a at your own risks. Unfortunately, this one stall brings down the rating of the coffeeshop which does have loads of other great options and selection.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112009614552298033741/reviews
xXJJLEXx Nat & Jon (xXJJLEXx),5,"Upgraded coffee shop that offers 24h dining. The dim sum is freshly steamed to your request and affordable. The prawn noodles soup is acceptable. Not watered down. Just the one stall sells from pork noodles to prawn noodles laksa and even porridge.
Very brightly lit and many patrons. Down side, the drink stall takes only cash in the night.
There are other stalls worth a mention but opens till 930 or 10pm
Western food is awesome as well as the roasted meat rice. The wanton mee is great.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114328372057657880511/reviews
Terence Ho,4,Most of the stall food is nice and service is good. Even the coffee stop service is normally good except for one particular woman with short hair. No patience and very impolite.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115355497848020652120/reviews
Alan Lye,5,"Fishball noodles the best. Just remember when ordering, order for more chilli sauce and vinegar for your dry noodles for the extra kick and flavours.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112970661107136812220/reviews
