Janet Au,1,"Waited like 15mins to buy a cup of tea, ended up it taste like drain water. I am sorry to say that, is really yucks. Please provide training to your staff before they learn to make drinks",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105193458024921182392/reviews
Alvin Lim,1,Very disappointing. Food/drinks took very long to serve and the staff were taking their own sweet time when it’s peak hour (i.e. weekend). And the tables were very empty because people were just queuing. This is unlike other outlets. Definitely not coming back again.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103725865897730883787/reviews

Javier Tan,5,"New place is great and bigger in size! They have a clear boundary for their shop this time!

Great place and food here was good. Cleanliness was pretty much there and they had a clear order system there. Only issue was that people stay too long so the queue was a little long.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106617631020704357051/reviews
Bong Bong,1,"Please on the air conditioner. Drinking my hot coffee while eating the eggs here I was perspiring by the time I finished.
I understand you may be doing this to make customers finish up faster and leave but can try to make it comfortable at least.

Thanks. Feedback from a regular customer.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112660348010776127967/reviews
