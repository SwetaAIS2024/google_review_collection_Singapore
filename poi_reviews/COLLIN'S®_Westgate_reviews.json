Staff are helpful if you require their help to take physical order (rather than QR code ordering) A good selection of mains and drinks (including Twinings hot tea that comes in a small pot)\n\nYou have to try their side dish- brussel sprouts- it was crunchy with a light sweet sauce that went well with it. No bitterness.\n\nI didn‚Äôt expect the mixed grill came exactly like in menu photo- a rather large stone platform. It was good for photos lolll! But some may find it difficult to eat from it- but there is nothing you can‚Äôt resolve if you ask for a side plate.\n\nWe had 3 mains, a lychee drink and a hot tea. The bill came up to about $100 plus. Joining Collin‚Äôs as member is free- all you have to do is to download their app and get your account set up. I enrolled as a new member and got 5% off straight away and the final damaged was about $98 üëçüèª\n\nWould be back for more. Besides the queuing, i must say I enjoy the food, ambience and service a lot.",

I ordered the Dirty Honey Latte, which the menu clearly stated would be served cold ‚Äì but it came hot without any explanation or option. That was disappointing, especially on a warm day when I was expecting something refreshing.\n\nThe tiramisu was available, so I gave it a try. Presentation was nice, but it turned out to be overly sweet and lacked the rich, balanced flavors you'd expect from a good tiramisu. Both the coffee and dessert leaned too heavily on sugar, which overshadowed the finer details.\n\nWhile Collins isn‚Äôt particularly known for its coffee or desserts, I had hoped for a more polished experience. Service and ambiance were fine, but the offerings didn‚Äôt quite meet expectations. A solid 3 out of 5.",
