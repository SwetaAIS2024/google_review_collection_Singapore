But not many can cooked a well balance taste with good noodle texture. This stall seem have it all.\n\nFirst, this hawker centre was new to me. No idea what to eat so keep browsing around, finally realized many customers having a  yellow bowl on their table.\n\nEspecially many of customers are elderly, they must be either authentic with good flavors or very cheap. Yes. I'm both strike the right answers.\n\nTheir noodles was very well cooked with slight tenderness yet very flavourful. Simple ingredients like mushrooms, minced pork, meat or fish balls, thin slide lean pork etc.\n\nNo wonder so many elderly loved their noodles, good flavours and affordable prices at $4 and $5. And they serve Lor-Mee and Laksa too.\n\nOverall, this noodle stall is definitely worthy to try. I do highly recommend to all especially new comer.",

Asked for extra pork lard and the stall gladly provided :).\n\nThe noodles was cooked just nice and the sauce nice. The sauce can be kicked up one notch with extra flavoring. The soup was flavorful. It should be more of a 4.5 star because the sauce could be better.",
