Sophie Su,5,"Lady boss is an extremely friendly lady who has built a great relationship with her regulars, judging by the warm interactions with them as I dropped by for the first time.
She also gave me the remote to turn on the fan if I was feeling warm. So sweet!

Pistachio cake tasted great and was just the right size. She offered the information that my buckwheat tea could be refilled once, another nice gesture.

Highly recommended for their healthier desserts that are just as delicious. üòã",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106512544371394460388/reviews
Germaine Lau,5,The Japanese shortcake was absolutely delicious and *LIGHT* which is uncommon since cakes are usually heavy and very sweet. This is perfect for those who want a lighter and healthier choice of dessert to enlighten your mood. The delivery was earlier than appointed time despite it being very early in the morning with no damage or whatsoever on the cake. Seller made sure to send me updates and is a quick replier. Would definitely order again!,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114578521105102267409/reviews
Lala Belle,5,"Amazing food, atmosphere and most of all service. Stumbled upon this cafe at Biopolis and it has been the greatest find! The hot chocolate, cookies and macarons are a must try! The best part about this cafe is the vibes and service, every time I drop by I feel so welcomed. The owner really goes the extra mile to make everyone feel welcomed. She is super friendly and thoughtful! If you‚Äôre lucky you will be greeted by Tokyo, their cute little golden retriever doggo who will be around usually on Saturdays. 11/10, absolutely love this place. ‚ù§Ô∏è",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108868110636230702056/reviews
Erielle Villanueva,5,"Delicious and perfect-looking macarons with strong flavours, and just the right amount of sweetness! The owner is also very kind and friendly. I would recommend the strawberry cheesecake flavour or chocolate butterscotch.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101518593700072864820/reviews
