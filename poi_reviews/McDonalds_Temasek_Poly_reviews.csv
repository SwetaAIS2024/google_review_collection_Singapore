Pei,3,"We waited 15 minutes for our food and then asked about it, only to find out it was packaged as a takeaway.

The new sausage McGrindle stack was delicious, and I preferred the slightly spicy potato pops to the original hashbrowns.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107008951870777106419/reviews
jonathan “Drfeelgood”,5,"Helpful staff even though they were very busy.

The payment kiosk had problems printing but the staff did what was necessary to get the order delivered.

Place was a little hot due to non air-conditioned sitting.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103471111736209790560/reviews
melvin tan,1,"Ordered large shaker fries, waited, and waited, and waited, and waited, and waited. For 50 minutes, even checked with the person at the counter multiple times, got asked to wait again. After 50+ minutes of waiting for a large fry, i went back to counter to clarify. TURNS OUT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE ORDER SLIP. idk what the problem was but 50+ min for fries is a no no man. will be weary when i order next time.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107378819055299723642/reviews
joe,1,"I ordered my food via the app, and went to pick it up after 30 minutes, but it was super crowded. we managed to squeeze in and ask the staff if our food was there, as there was a notification saying our food was ready for pickup. the staff said no, so we stayed there waiting for more than an hour, and we also asked them multiple times about our order, but we kept getting told that it was not ready. Only after the manager came out, our food was ready, and it turned out, it had been outside the whole time, yet all the staff said that our order had not been prepared and was not on the counter. Additionally, the food was cold, and my Sprite did not taste like anything; it was so diluted. A speechless encounter.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112940764644529405799/reviews
Irfan llama,1,"i had placed my order around 10-15 minutes ago and thereafter asked a crew named Roger if they had my order ready. instead of telling me it was not ready or they had it prepared already, he muttered out “go to hell” i am so hurt by Roger. i was left there speechless with my feet rooted to the ground. i am angry with Roger.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114324174860855605337/reviews
