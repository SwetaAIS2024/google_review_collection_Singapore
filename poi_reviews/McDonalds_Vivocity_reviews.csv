Nanshad Daruwalla,5,"I recently visited McDonald's in Singapore and tried two different burgers on separate days: the Samurai Burger and the Double McSpicy. Both exceeded my expectations in every way.

The Samurai Burger was packed with flavor—a perfect blend of savory sauce and juicy beef. It had just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness that made every bite satisfying. The texture and freshness of the ingredients truly elevated the experience.

On another day, I went back to try the Double McSpicy, and it was equally impressive. The spice level was perfect—not too overwhelming but with enough heat to keep things exciting. The patties were juicy, and the crispness of the lettuce added a nice contrast.

Overall, McDonald's Singapore delivered on both flavor and freshness. Each burger felt unique and satisfying, showcasing a great take on classic fast-food with a local twist. Highly recommended if you're looking for a burst of flavor with every bite!

PS: The seaweed shaker fries was the bomb.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101931191860738796081/reviews
Fairy,4,"Food at this Mcdonalds is very well prepared and tasted very good.

However, the tables were not clean during lunch time. Maybe short of staff. That’s why I deducted one star.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110707374703256523409/reviews
Wei Hao Lim,1,"Stop pressing the button to tell us to collect when you are not ready!! It just defeats the purpose and caused so much confusion for the consumers.  What's the point of the system? So you can keep to your kpi?
