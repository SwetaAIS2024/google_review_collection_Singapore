Benedict Correya,5,"Visited for breakfast meal and had a pleasant experience. The outlet was clean, well-maintained, and offered a comfortable environment for dining. The food was fresh, hot, and tasted great—just the kind of quality you'd expect from KFC. It’s a convenient spot for a quick and satisfying meal, especially for those living nearby or passing through the area.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113292377967743781974/reviews
Lings Christine,1,"The Chinese staff that at the counter is so rude , we are fine that wait for 1hour but can his attitude be nice? None of the customers over there is rushing him , although his attitude is not good but customers still talk politely to him , We know that he is very busy but just can’t he talk properly?",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104097534594492091230/reviews
Yong Peen Ong,1,"I had to wait quite a while for my order, even though it wasn’t busy. There was a screen showing pick-up status, but unfortunately, the “Ready to Pick Up” section remained empty for a long time, suggesting delays in the kitchen. It made the wait more frustrating. I hope the team can work on improving order speed and communication.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118109604185564235517/reviews
DORIS ANG,5,"As far as non-mall KFC outlets go, this one is alright. Visited at 4pm on a Friday, so there was no queue. The service staff was prompt and attentive. Ordered the Zinger stacker, because apparently the ETC burger was sold out (for this outlet, interesting)",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105258967250652112672/reviews
Wanga,3,"Haven’t had KFC in a while. Bought this today for dinner and it was surprisingly not too bad.
I opted to swap out my whipped potato for coleslaw.
However, do note their standard is inconsistent. They always forget to include cutleries even when I request for it in my app order. Need forks to eat the cheese fries

There was no queue before 6.30pm. Usually by 7, the queue would be quite long.
Lady at collection/ pick up order counter can be quite hostile and rude.

I ordered the spicy pockett but was given BBQ instead. Disappointed",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109266329478172341849/reviews
