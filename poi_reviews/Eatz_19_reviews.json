      "text": "This is really a gem!! The food me and my friend had was really delicious. Thanks to Chef Nora for the recommendation and cooking for us! She is really hospitable and kind that she even offered chilli padi to cater to my taste. I had the yellow curry with seafood linguine (12.80 sgd) and my friend had Tom yum salmon spaghetti (13.80 sgd). We both topped up $3 for the soup of the day and a drink. I’ll say the seafood portion is really generous and cook to perfection. There’s no GST or service charge either. I’m really impressed and will be back for more!!",

What amazed me most was the food. I usually don't drink mushroom soup but this is so nice that I finished every drop. Soup is made from fresh mushroom and full of fragrance. The garlic on top of the bread is made of fresh garlic and tasted so so good.\n\nBlack pepper chicken pasta tasted yummy with generous portion of chicken. If you like peppery taste then definitely you will like this. The pasta was cooked in a perfect texture.\nPractically nothing to complain but alot to compliment.\nThe chief might look young but she is really good. Definitely will return soon.",
