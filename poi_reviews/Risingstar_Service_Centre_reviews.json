Mr. Kok was very helpful to keep us posted on the work progress. Our TV was repaired and reinstalled at our place. We highly recommend such reliable, professional and courteous TV-repair service.

He is able to turn around the repairs the next day, and brought the TV back to me, and help me remount.\nHighly professional, reasonable price and excellent service.\nGlad I called him.",

Got a reasonable quote after sending some photos across.Brought the set down and the nice gentleman fixed it within the same afternoon. Even helped carry the TV to the car. Brilliant service and honest business. Thank you!!",
