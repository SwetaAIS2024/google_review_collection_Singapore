Francis Kwang,5,Lots of new F&B. Famous River South Prawn Noodle is now opened here. The Japanese food street has been great. Always clean albeit crowded during lunch time. But the F&B mix is good. Muji and DDK are there as well. Too bad there‚Äôs no sheltered walkway from the MRT station.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115353246724953608735/reviews
Skyy Strike,5,"I enjoy this mall very much. It has two supermarkets with very different varieties, great coffee shops, and a selection of extremely good, authentic and reasonably priced(for the standard) Japanese cuisine. Also, not a cookie cutter mall in Singapore. One of my favorite malls.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104403953361454253143/reviews
