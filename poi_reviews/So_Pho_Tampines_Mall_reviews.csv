Avi Arora,4,"The food was good – I had the Vegetarian Fried Rice with Lychee Iced Tea.
There was a 10-minute wait at lunch, so factor that in if you're going then.
The ambience was nice.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118127716762039827635/reviews
Timothy Hong,4,"Been here more than 3 times.

Overall the food was acceptable.

Just that the waiting time will be slightly longer during peak, approximately between  10-15 minutes.

It's a Vietnamese Restaurant, so their coffee will be good.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101545813356617494178/reviews

Sook Han Lee,4,"Got here at 1pm in a weekday. The crowd was just starting to thin out and we got to pick our seats.

Chose 3 vegetarian dishes and had the lemongrass drink (was a but diluted).

Vegetarian summer roll was refreshing and went well with the accompanying chilli sauce.

Stir fried pho noodles were tasty and chewy. It's a good portion for two to share if you want to try different dishes.

Mango and papaya salad was the best among the three. Tasty and flavourful. It was well balanced.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105051599568576260383/reviews
