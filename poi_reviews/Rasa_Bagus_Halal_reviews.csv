Bloc Memoire,5,"Fried rice done right ! It looks plain but it is very flavourful. Sunny side up egg is perfect, rice was accompanied with Chuck's of chicken and extra fried egg. The portion was very generous.
The satay and Vegetarian tom yum noodles were very good too.
Will be back here again to try their sting ray

The service staff are very friendly too",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106169604833860052715/reviews
Swan Tan,5,"INSANELY GOOD FOOD. YOU MUST COME AND TRY. My family and I were BLOWN away. Their stingray chili and sotong sambal is so crazy good. Seafood all very fresh. We didn‚Äôt expect the food to be this good and we walked away super satisfied.

U WILL REGRET IF YOU NEVER COME AND TRY THIS. Service is also super good. Food served fast and fresh. The male waiter made good recommendations on the food and is very friendly",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114353923214220466703/reviews
rashad aljunied,5,"Great food and homey location beside the park.

Salted fish fried rice well seasoned only the salted fish was a little too hard and overcooked

Stingray was well cooked and tender with a spicy sambal, not too sweet

Hotplate beef was tender

Salted egg prawn while a little pricey than other spots was excellent with generous gravy

Highly recommended halal spot in punggol and even has a prayer room for Muslims to pray

Service was very attentive also. Hope it expands",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100813776931228540656/reviews
