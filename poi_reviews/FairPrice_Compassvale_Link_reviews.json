To my surprise, i was welcome by wendy and angie at the cashier, both are very polite and friendly especially angie.. kept apologising for the lapse although its not their fault but their professionalism is awesome. Plus a small token as gestures was given to me. I was really amazed on their customer service..once again thank angie ng and wendy..i will definitely come back and shop at ntuc compassvaleüòçüòçüòç",
