      "text": "The worst hotel I stayed in JB. First thing enter into room is a strong smoking smell, as in walk in further it smells like musky body odor of a sweaty worker. Aircon barely working, if you turn it to higher fan speed it’s super loud.. the wall papers are stained and torn like a haunted house. The Tv can change channel cannot turn off (had to off the main switch). The fridge was off, unplugged and when you opened it it’s full of mold. The toilet starts to leak when you flush it. No amenities and hand soup just a shower gel mounted on the wall. All the wall plugs are loose, not a single plug can stay on well. I know it’s a budget hotel, but this is barely acceptable.\n\nSaw this place when touring around last trip and decided to give it a try considering it’s quite decent looking outside - oh boy, how wrong we were. Only plus point is the location and the price",
