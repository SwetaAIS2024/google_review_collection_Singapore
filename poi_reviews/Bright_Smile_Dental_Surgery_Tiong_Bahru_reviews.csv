SiowBoon Tan,5,"Went to Bright Smile for crowning. The service provided by Dr Chong was excellent. He was very careful, patience and explained every step in details so that you knew what was going on and what to be expected. I could see that he put in effort to make the whole treatment process as painless as possible. I strongly recommend his service.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117849693115353245328/reviews
Mag L,5,"Dr Chong is an assuring, patient and non-judgemental healthcare professional. He takes time to educate the patient and explain the steps of the procedure. Even though I’ve moved houses, Bright Smile will still be one of the few dental clinics I go to.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102574959092919495418/reviews

dude car,1,"Saw Dr Du. The cleaning was expensive snd the most painful cleaning I have felt. It has also caused me teeth sensitivity to air and sometimes water even after more than a month has passed. I didn’t have any sensitivity problems before, even after doing cleaning elsewhere.

Also, I had a very occasional slight pain on one of my teeth 1 out of say 20 times that I ate. I regret bringing it up. The dentist got me to bite down on a metal rod and grind my teeth left and right to identity the pain spot. I wonder if that caused more damage as immediately after the visit and until now, that tooth has slight pain EVERY single time I eat. Not trying to be mean but sharing honestly for others who read reviews to consider. Pls go elsewhere.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105537331028920614471/reviews
