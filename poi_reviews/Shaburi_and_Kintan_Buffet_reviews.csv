Irene Lim,3,"We tried the Shaburi option and upgraded to the premium beef ‚Äî not surprisingly , the ‚Äútasty beef‚Äù didn‚Äôt quite live up to its name. Texture and flavour were lacking. The condiments were okay, nothing particularly memorable. The buffet spread was average, maybe slightly below expectations in terms of variety and quality.

On the upside, ordering is done via QR code and food is served quickly. Service was fast, efficient, and clear ‚Äî staff were attentive and prompt throughout. For the price we paid, it‚Äôs still a reasonable option, especially if you‚Äôre after a no-fuss, quick hotpot experience.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105804445185126817371/reviews

Napat Lipimongkol,5,"Limited oyster & snow crab promotion ends tomorrow. Today I come at lunch which costs only $35.80++ for 90 minutes hotpot buffet, plus free-flow fresh oyster & crab.

I had above 50 oyster, crab, shabu beef+pork+chicken, curry, mac n cheese, gyudon, chawanmushi, karaage, desert, milk tea and white chocolate fountain. For me, that was a solid $0.72++ per oyster only. The best deal in town I've known for this fresh juicy oyster! I forgot to take photo for other dishes, as very busy with those oyster. Overall it's only less than $43 nett per pax~~ Thank you for making my weekend dayü•∞ The staffs are kind and helpful. They also refilled soup and oyster regularly.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108685617155246810836/reviews

Pete Klimek,5,"If you're searching for the perfect hotpot and Japanese grill experience in the West, look no further than Shaburi & Kintan Buffet at Jem, Jurong East‚Äîa culinary oasis that delivers on every front.

From the moment you step in, the ambience sets the tone: clean, modern, and surprisingly spacious. The tables are thoughtfully arranged to offer both comfort and privacy, a rare luxury in most buffet settings. Whether you're dining solo, on a date, or with the entire family, there's a seat for everyone‚Äîwithout that cramped, elbow-to-elbow feeling.

Now, let‚Äôs talk choices‚Äîbecause this buffet delivers. The variety is sublime. From premium cuts of meat for the grill (yes, the Kintan side is a meat-lover‚Äôs paradise), to fresh seafood, vibrant vegetables, and a hotpot bar that caters to every broth preference and dietary whim, it's impossible to walk away hungry‚Äîor disappointed. Whether you‚Äôre keto, pescatarian, or someone who just wants to pile everything onto one plate (we see you), Shaburi & Kintan has something for you.

Service? Impeccable. The staff are attentive, friendly, and efficient, keeping the experience smooth and stress-free‚Äîeven during peak hours. Empty plates vanish like magic, and drinks are refilled before you have to ask. Speaking of drinks, the free-flow non-alcoholic beverages‚Äîincluding tea, coffee, and soft drinks‚Äîare a refreshing touch that adds serious value to the meal.

And just when you think it‚Äôs all over, along comes the dessert: light, sweet, and satisfying. Not an afterthought, but a perfectly included finale to a feast.

What truly warms the heart, though, is their special senior pricing‚Äîa thoughtful gesture that makes dining here even more inclusive and appreciated. Anyone over 60 gets a discounted rate, making it an ideal spot for a multi-generational family gathering.

In short, Shaburi & Kintan Buffet at Jem is a gem. Quality, variety, service, and space all wrapped into one very well-priced package. It‚Äôs not just a meal‚Äîit‚Äôs an experience.

Perfect. Just perfect.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115651891130079828399/reviews
