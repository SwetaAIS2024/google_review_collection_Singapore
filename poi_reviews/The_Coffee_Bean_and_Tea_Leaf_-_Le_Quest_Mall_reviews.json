      "text": "I was over the moon when Coffee Bean opened an outlet at Le Quest Mall. There isn‚Äôt any decent cafe serving good coffee and cafe fare in the vicinity. Been here twice for brekkie after a morning walk. I had the Pancakes & Eggs Platter with an Iced Latte on the first visit and was pleasantly pleased‚Ä¶.pancakes were light and fluffy a little cold when it was served. (Maybe due to the cold aircon). The Breakfast Waffle Platter I had on my second visit was a little disappointing. Portion was substantial but the 2 chicken sausages and scrambled eggs seems to overshadow the waffle (only half a round waffle was served) which should have been the main star. The waffle was tough, doughy and dry. I doused the pancake syrup and extra butter on the waffle hoping they will soak through but to no avail. The texture was just too dense. Regular latte was good though. I hope they will beat the odds and stay put because a a lot of other food outlets at Le Quest Mall didn‚Äôt have much staying power. Quiet on weekdays and even on weekends.",
