KKT,4,"Another alternative location for A Kitchen at Downtown East.. they have many varieties in the menu to choose from, serving portions are big. Generally the foods are tasty and nice.. as for pork trotter, it would be better for me if they are softer and easy to bite off. üòÜ Overall, I think it's more value for money than typical zichar.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399770588752359508/reviews
JoFri,4,"I ordered the ËÑëËä± and the mala flavor is nice and there‚Äôs ÈáëÈíàËèá inside, not too bad. They got beer promotion but u gotta self service, and I got myself a ÈùíÂ≤õ for $5. I also ordered the bbq stuff like the ËÇ•ËÇ†, but inside they wrapped it with Â§ßÈùíËë±, which not quite to my likeness.

I sat inside and it‚Äôs hot, like, aircon not working. I‚Äôm not sure if its bcos its near to the kitchen. There are private rooms in there, so i can‚Äôt imagine sitting inside so hot.

Overall, I quite like it and will be back to try other dishes. I think i‚Äôll sit outside open air to be safe.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106235103778529249064/reviews
Yang Zutian,1,"Infuriatingly slow.
Waste time.
Waited for an hour.
Cancelled order and left hungry.
Deceiving menu design.
Prices are ridiculous.
Eat skewers like eating 10 course meal, served ONE AT A TIME.
Refer to image below. Tiniest Sotong paid $8
Though taste wasn‚Äôt the worst, definitely something wrong with service system.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105837109016902362336/reviews
Diana N,2,"During crowded times. super slowwwwwwwwwwwwwww service.n think Chef cooked.for the wrong table. Those who came after us n ordered the sam dish , got all their food served. We end up munching our plain noodles.n vege which I ordered later separately. Told 3 servers, they stared blankly n never follow up.  Food taste good (thr only saving grace). price above.norm. afterall a restaurant.  Need to improve their ORDERING SYSTEM TO GET THE SEQUNCE OF FOOD ORDER CORRECTLY. FIRST COME FIRST SERVE.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112282458312997500369/reviews
Stephanie Lim,1,"Doing a community service here. Come at your own risk.

Food was terrible and tasteless. Service was very slow, our orders came one at a time. When we ask the waiters where is our food, they just simply acknowledge and didn't give us an update. For the same price go to the one at pasir ris 8 xiang xiang hu nan is soooo much better. Disappointing.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111378387613376315263/reviews
