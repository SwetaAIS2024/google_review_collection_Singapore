I was there together with a few of my colleagues in the afternoon, to have our lunch. It mainly caters to indian/bangladesh contract workers and others too. The prices there are quite reasonable. I had a plate of rice with chopped curry mutton,(quite a generous portion) a piece of fried fish and vegetables. It costs me $6.00.",
