      "text": "We ordered several dishes including Siew Mai ($6 for 4pcs), Glutinous Rice in Lotus Leaf ($6 for 3pcs), Black Bean Spare Ribs ($6), Pan Fried Carrot Cakes ($6), Deep Fried Yam Ball with Lychee ($6 for 3pcs), BBQ Pork Cheong Fun ($6.50), Ha Kow ($7 for 4pcs), Vinegar Pork Trotter ($12.80), Mixed Vegetable Lo-Han Style ($18), Ee-Fu Noodles ($18), and Stir-fry Hor Fun with Kai Lan ($18).\n\nWe visited on a Sunday morning, about 10:30 AM. Although the restaurant wasnâ€™t too busy when we arrived, it filled up as we left. Overall, the experience was pleasant, with great service and a nice environment. However, some of the dishes could be improved. The mixed vegetables were slightly undercooked and lacked flavour, and the Ee-Fu noodles were a bit bland. The Hor Fun had a nice wok hei, but the flavour could have had more depth. On the positive side, we really enjoyed the Deep Fried Yam Ball with Lychee, Siew Mai, and Ha Kow. The Pork Trotter was fine, though not particularly standout.\n\nIn total, we spent $134. The service was excellent, and the ambiance was lovely. With some refinements to the food, the dining experience could be even better.",

Most of dishes were above restaurants grade, where my family enjoyed.\nOne thing that we must emphasise was that all the service staff were excellent and impeccable. Namely Ms Kim and Mr Wang and thanks to all the staff who had served us\nWell done. Keep it up",

      "text": "Horrible experience!!\n\nWent on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum with the family. Placed our order at around 1220hrs. Drinks were served pretty quickly. We waited for almost an hour and thought something was amiss as the earlier crowd had already dispersed and our food was still not served. Upon checking with the wait staff, it was then made known to us that our food orders were not keyed into the system at all, after more than an hour!\n\nNone of the wait staff bothered to check in with us, despite us having no food on our table for more than an hour. No service recovery was provided at all upon realisation of their mistake.\n\nJust putting this out here as awareness for others.",
