Zi Xiang Ong,5,"Many thanks to Dr Harvard for his professionalism and care for my wife‚Äôs recent surgery. I felt very at ease that my wife was under his care and I no need to worry so much. Also very appreciative of Hanah who picked up the call in the late night when my wife had to go the A&E due to her intense pain and she was attended shortly after.

Very glad that my wife is much better now and thanks to everyone in the clinic.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109697404710168318183/reviews

Dr Harvard was very kind, helpful and patient in explaining the issue that I was facing for the past 1 month and the procedure went smoothly. He listens to my problems and I am very glad the issue had resolved and am able to be back to my normal energy as before.
