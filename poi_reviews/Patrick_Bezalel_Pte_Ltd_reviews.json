That makes the experience all the more beautiful.\n\nDavid and Angie were two such staff who welcomed me today! They happily showed me some features of the paintings (like the AR) and also how the pieces are mounted :)\n\nGlad to have taken time from work to see the art in person, and the wonderful people at work to create a good experience for customers.\n\nShalom! üòä",
