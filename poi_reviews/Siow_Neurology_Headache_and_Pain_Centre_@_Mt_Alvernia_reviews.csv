Simon & Christine Loh,5,"I have known Dr Siow since 2008.  My elder boy had been suffering from severe headaches since primary school and one day, out of desperation to try to seek treatment for my son‚Äôs persistent and severe headaches, I did an extensive search on the Internet and found Dr Siow by chance.  It turned out to be one of the best decisions that I have ever made in my life.   I am just so glad that we found him because my son‚Äôs migraine showed drastic improvement after seeing him and I can safely say that severe migraines are a thing of the past for my son now.

Dr Siow is a very experienced Neurologist as proven by his prompt and accurate diagnosis of Meningitis.  I am so glad to have had both my sons put under his care when they were diagnosed with Meningitis sometime in 2010, one after the other.  Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes (meninges) surrounding the brain and spinal cord and if not treated in time, it could lead to undesirable consequences.  Proper diagnosis and timing is everything where Meningitis is concerned.   I do not wish for anyone to be diagnosed with Meningitis, but in the unfortunate event that it happens,  Dr Siow is the doctor to go to, no doubt about that.

Over the years, we have built up a very close relationship with Dr Siow.  He is a very friendly, approachable, caring and humble doctor.  He is very understanding and accommodating and would only give his best to his patients.  He is always very cheerful and it‚Äôs such a joy to see him either at his clinic or whenever he does his ward duties despite the fact that we are unwell.  He has proven time and again that we made the right decision to have engaged him as our Neurologist.  My sons describe Dr Siow as a very special and caring doctor who would not hesitate to go out of his way for his patients and he always puts his patients‚Äô wellbeing as his priority.

Dr Siow is supported by a team of very professional nurses at his clinics and they too, like the boss himself, are very friendly and helpful.  They too would not hesitate to go out of their way for us, the patients and I speak from personal experience.  Keep up the good work, Nurses!

Thank you so much Dr Siow for all that you have done for my sons.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101067032087135052489/reviews
Thomas L,5,"I was attended to by Dr Charles Siow in 2022 when I was admitted to MAH for a suspected stroke. He was very thorough in his assessment and eventually assured me that all tests were clear. His friendly and candid disposition was refreshing and comforting at that time of confusion and worry!

Since then, regular check ups are seamlessly arranged and each session is more of a friendly catch up with Dr Siow to ensure that all things are in order.

To top things off, the ladies at the reception are warm and friendly too! Amy is always so full of energy and communication is seamless through telephone/ messages! Reminders are sent to ensure we don‚Äôt miss appointments, and any changes in appointments are quickly rearranged should there be any last minute changes.

Let‚Äôs be honest - We all want to be healthy and NOT see a doctor too regularly. But if ever the need arises, Siow Neurology Centre makes it a pleasant experience. ü§ó

Thank you for all the care and concern! ü´∂üèº",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110282124805918925821/reviews
