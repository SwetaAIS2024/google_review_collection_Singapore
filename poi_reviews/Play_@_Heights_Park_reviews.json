From the exciting water slides to the gentle splash areas perfect for younger kids, there‚Äôs something for everyone, and we always find new ways to enjoy ourselves.\n\nWatching my son‚Äôs face light up as he runs through the water and tries every attraction with such excitement is truly priceless. It‚Äôs a place where we can both let loose, have fun, and build memories that I know we‚Äôll cherish forever.\n\nWe‚Äôll definitely be coming back often ‚Äì it‚Äôs a perfect spot for us to enjoy time together and make even more happy memories!\n\nThe park just need some maintenance and cleanings done",

Hoping Town Council will put up this information upfront.. so many parents (and kids in swimsuit) came at 8am because that‚Äôs whats written on the website.\n\nAnd at 930, it‚Äôs only the fountain that flows to the mini lazy river. The water sprays start at 945am.\n\nThe rest of the park is amazing, just please manage timing expectations of the water park.\n\nAll",

The playground area is large enough to accommodate plenty of kids, but definitely not the wet area. Anyway, bring lots of water as the vending machine was down. Overall, it was a nice experience",

However, not many people are born with BASIC common sense.\nAlthough it‚Äôs a FREE public residence area, the basic common sense in some people to know to remove their god damn footwear when they enter the waterpark area. One of the example in 3rd picture I included.\n\nAlso on the day I went, there‚Äôs IRRESPONSIBLE parents who literally just let their kids play without supervising. There‚Äôs literally a sign stating ‚ÄúDO NOT BRING THE SAND FROM THE SAND PIT TO THE WATER PLAY AREA‚Äù\n\nMy husband had to stepped up to inform the young kids parents as their kids happily scooping the sand to the water play. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nreason some people don‚Äôt deserve FREE play area.",

It has water play and sands play.\n\nThere is a public washroom nearby where you can clean up your child after all the play.\n\nThere is also a bbq pit there if you fancy that sort of thing.\n\nWill definitely come back again as my child throughly enjoy it.",
