Go Green,5,"It is a famous nature trail in Sentosa but the length is short.
A 3 hours' hiking route connecting nature trails & scenic spots in series is recommended:
• Harbourfront MRT & Vivo City
• Harbourfront Boardwalk & Sentosa Boardwalk
• Resorts World Station & Imbiah Station
• Madame Tussauds & Imbiah Lookout Station
• Imbiah Bridge Canopy Walk → Sentosa Nature Discovery
• Imbiah Nature Trail → hill top (Megazip Advanture Park & Bird Watching Tower)
• Imbiah Trail → Siloso Beach Walk → Sentosa Sensoryscape",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100629515701423718340/reviews
Di Di,5,I was the only one walking the whole trail by myself on a weekday morning. It was tranquil and peaceful. The forest is well sheltered by tall trees.I took a free bus shuttle around Sentosa.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews
Lavi Shiffman,4,"A nice and quite easy walking circular loop that gives you the opportunity to dive into the old rain forest of Sentosa island.  The trail starts at Inbiah station (the middle station of the cable car, the one you get off when coming from the city).  It takes no more than 20-30 minutes to cover the whole trail.  On the trail you'll see tall trees, waterfalls, the old British gun garrison and if you're lucky some wildlife.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111153691460234113747/reviews

Damcho Tshering,5,"If you're looking to explore nature on Sentosa, the Imbiah Trail is a hidden gem. This easy-to-navigate path winds through lush rainforest, with beautiful tropical plants, occasional wildlife, and scenic lookouts. It’s perfect for a peaceful, nature-filled escape from the island's busier attractions.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116833702802756994837/reviews
