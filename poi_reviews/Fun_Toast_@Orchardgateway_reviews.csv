see you latté,5,"The Fun Meal I had this afternoon was very toothsome! The must-try BBQ Prawn with Rice (SGD8.90) and signature Yuan Yang (SGD2.20) were good-sized and prepared to my taste🎯🎯

Succulent prawns with long beans, eggplant, lady's fingers and onion in a tangy tamarind (aka assam) sauce were well-flavored, marinated and cooked. Excellent medley of sour, sweet and savoury  flavors coming together harmoniously. Piquant and nummy😋😋 Yuan Yang, as always, was fragrant, thick and had the perfect ratio of tea-coffee-milk and sweetness👍💪

Fun Toast @Orchardgateway has a variety of food & beverage choices at pocket-friendly prices and a clean, ample space. Direct access to/from Somerset MRT Station and nearby office buildings via the underpass makes it a convenient spot for take-out, casual meal, social meet-up, pit stop to rest tired feet or after-work chillax.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109562020139406369328/reviews

Rinaldi Sugiono,1,"I've bad experience eating here. I bought a cup of coffe and just wanted to take picture of the coffee but the store manager dones not allow me to do so. I tried to explain that I am taking coffee picture and not taking a person's picture, but repeatedly being told cannot take picture.
There are better food stalls opposite this shop which I ended up eating.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101246214693398541789/reviews
Myoki,1,"Kaya butter toast was rather lacklustre. The toast was stale, and the kaya butter was disappointingly sparse and thin. Overall an underwhelming experience.

I’ve had much better kaya butter toasts elsewhere with fresher crispier toast and more generous amount of kaya butter (iykyk)

Reply to owner: Yes, bought it at orchardgateway b2 and had it on the go",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100577707073950140653/reviews
Jesse Lee,3,"I order the plain rice rolls and Shui Mai. The Shui Mai meats tasted like meat paste without any pork texture or taste.  The rice roll was small and didn’t like the sauce.

The cashier wasn’t the most friendly or helpful to a tourist. Maybe I should have eat the safe toast and coffee combo.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105809324767030388498/reviews
