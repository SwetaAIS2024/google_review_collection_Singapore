Megumi Low,1,"This Loaded CheeseBurger Crispy Fries is supposed to be worth $11.50?? Even at $9.50 for an add-on deal, the portion is unbelievably small and had barely any of the meat toppings.

Didnâ€™t get pictures of the pizzas but they were also messy and had very little toppings.

When we got there to pick up our orders, one of the orders was missing and when we notified the staff of the missing order, they did admit that it was missing but did not propose any solutions or intention to fix the issue. Only after we asked them several times abt it, did the lady ask if we could wait 10min and told the kitchen staff to start preparing. It ended up taking less than 5min to come out and the lady was friendly during the interaction- I suppose they were busy and this is not questioning their attitude. But would say they could use more training in customer interaction.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117674106708704012479/reviews

taishun kozuki,1,"What the hell is this? The portion of the crispy fries is the worst I have ever seen. Even McDonald's would give more than this. And it cost $9.50 original price??! This is really unacceptableðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ This is a $2.50 portion. Look at the menu pictures and look at what I got, this is misleading advertising. This is outrageous!!ðŸ¤¬",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107482537998175654844/reviews
Preetpal Singh,1,I urge everyone to stay away from this outlet. Ordered dinner via FoodPanda. Waited 2 hours. No one answers the call. I visited the outlet in person and found no one in there. Contacted FoodPanda and the support staff insisted it's open although I provided photo as proof. I have since uninstalled FoodPanda app.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108262308693013373093/reviews
