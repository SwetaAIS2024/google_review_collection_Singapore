Charlene Kua,5,"Service is immaculate , kudos to restaurant manager Ibrahim! Food wise it’s faultless, more importantly what sets an F&B business apart from competitors would be the personal touch, I would definitely return to this bar purely based on the positive experience I have had with Mr Ibrahim !",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106930870882862857715/reviews

Joey Tan,5,"We had an impromptu work lunch at this casual pasta place, and was lucky enough to get two seats indoors. I loved the beef bolognese linguine and finished the entire plate with aperol spritz. The prices are very reasonable, about $16-18. Tasted even better than some higher end Italian places.

The only negative feedback is different staff kept trying to take away my aperol spritz glass which was not empty,  without even asking me if it is ok. It happened 4 times.

I would suggest that you ask your staff not to clear anything without first asking, or better still, leave my glass alone - your place is alfresco and i like to slowly sip my drink with ice.

Other than that, i really enjoyed lunch there and will be back to try other things but please don't touch my glass.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108800978321384657741/reviews
