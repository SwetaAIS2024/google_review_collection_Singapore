Junwei Ng,1,"I'm not kidding but, this is one of the worst wonton mee I've eaten. The soup has a weird flavour, don't know how it was prepared. Noodles were too soggy and charsiew had no charred taste at all.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103771560846603260776/reviews
K,5,"Recommended:
1) Prawn dumpling noodle (choose mee Kia! With chilli). Skip the mee pok, as it does not soak the gravy.
2) Chicken cutlet

Not recommended:
Kopi o kosong tilo (not thick enough)",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109386738253826668143/reviews
wen,4,"After grocery shopping I decided to packed rice for dinner. Was hesitant as the food looked cooked for awhile. Was there at 550pm.
However the curry potatoes were calling out to me so I decided to buy that with a veggie. Cost $3. Rice was a little lumpy.  Overall was ok.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105782342636269836215/reviews
Timothy TM,4,"Noticed long queues for this old school discreet store often, and so tried it one day. The economy rice like bee Hoon, satay beef, mushroom, fried chicken were all surprisingly good. On Wed and Sat they have special menu like laksa which was also nice, have a old school, ah-ma style taste to it. I like it! no wonder theres a queue - good food and good price. Only thing is limited tables especially at peak hours. Will try the recommended wonton mee next time.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116897826354325250403/reviews
Ben Cho,5,This snack bar has been our familyâ€™s favourite. We sometimes come to Bukit Timah Plaza just to order something here for lunch. We particularly like the noodles here. The wanton noodles is highly recommended. They now have a seating area in the open atrium which certainly heightened the dining experience. Try it and you will come back again!,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115743453596718043490/reviews
