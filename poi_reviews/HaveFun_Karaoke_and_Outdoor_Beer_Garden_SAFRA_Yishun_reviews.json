      "text": "Service sucks. Waiter did not pass the promotion menu. Manager tried to argue his way out of it. Manager is a real gangster and ask what you trying to achieve out of your complaint. VER RUDE. Doubt the company cares if the manager is such a gangster and super defensive and tries to change the story to make it your fault. Manager insists waiter says he run out of menu and said will get back to us with the promo menu WHICH IS A LIE. Be mindful and make sure you ask for the promo menu which is half the price. They will just make it your fault. Their slogan, Good things happen is super ironic. While you are looking for a good time, be mindful this WILL not happen. Just look at the negative reviews.",

The music and ambience was great as well, came here afew times for live music and karaoke. Should you wish to mingle and speak with your friends this isn't the place for you, as the music can be a tad bit too loud.",
