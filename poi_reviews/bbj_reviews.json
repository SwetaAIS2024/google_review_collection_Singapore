But our dog got a bowl of iced water upon moments of being seated. Just that the outside area is self serve but we get notified of the food and drinks being ready quickly.\n\nThe food is good and well priced too - the burger is just phenomenal. I appreciated the zero free alcohol as well. Inside, it was cooler and has a family friend bar pub vibe. What a great gem in the neighbourhood.",

Drinks are plenty and reasonably priced. Food during nights feature burgers, bar bites and an awesome condiment bar. They seem to serve local food during daylight hours.",
