      "text": "Great place to come try some genuine okonomiyaki with Japanese restaurant vibes. Itâ€™s a bit small and it gets crowded fast plus it doesnâ€™t take reservations so pls do come early. If you sit at the counter the okonomiyaki is cooked in front of you and the staff will ask for your preferences. Ingredients and fresh and the taste is close to the ones we had in Osaka and you can choose up to 3 toppings for free or add on more for extra money. The sides were also good especially the pork gyoza and chicken karaage. Staff were also friendly and will explain the dishes to you and recommend suggestions as well.",
