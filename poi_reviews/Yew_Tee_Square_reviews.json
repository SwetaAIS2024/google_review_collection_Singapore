      "text": "Life threatening & traumatic experience.   My wife, myself, my elderly mother of 94 years in a wheelchair & her maid were trapped in the lift in Yew Tee Square.\n\nA completely mismanaged building where it took more than an hour to rescue us.\n\nThis traumatic experience has raised several glaring issues :\n\na.  The telephone number in the lift was wrong and there should be a correct emergency number to call.\n\nb.  The Intercom system was either not working or there was no one manning it.  And even after it was evident the lift was stalled, someone should have called us via the intercom or attempted to reach out to us.  If a person or elderly were stuck inside without a handphone, it would be disastrous.\n\nc.  The tel number we called in repeatedly apparently does not have a caller-id system in place or a system to identify repeat callers.  Each time we had to repeat who we were and what building we were trapped in.\n\nd.  The emergency response team took slightly more than an hour to reach us.  This is unacceptable ; we were told that it was 25 mins.  And if the team were going to be delayed, someone should have kept us informed of the status of their ETA.  There were no such assurance.\n\nThese are glaring mistakes and reflect how badly mismanaged this building is. Absolutely unforgivable.",
