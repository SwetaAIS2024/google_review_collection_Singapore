They now pass you a buzzer while you sit to wait for your food. There is no spring onions, I added them on my own to lie to myself that I had my greens for the day. The dry minced meat noodles taste good too and I always ask for additional chilli.\n\nThe teh in the same coffee stall has a rich aromatic tea leaves flavour. It was not diluted. The taste of the condensed milk was not overwhelming and it was also not too sweet. They sell kaya butter toast with half boiled eggs too.",
