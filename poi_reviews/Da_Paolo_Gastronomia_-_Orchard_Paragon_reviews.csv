ivy wei,5,"Such a hidden gem in the middle of Orchard!
Da Paolo Gastronomia is everything I love in a dining spot—cozy, low-key, and full of honest, hearty Italian food.

I came for the lasagna (which I heard people queue to takeaway!), but ended up loving the truffle fries, handmade pizza, and in-house gelato just as much.
Everything is made fresh and served in a space that feels calm and relaxed—no trendy decor, just real Italian vibes.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113628923502030797942/reviews

Rongtin He,5,"Didnt know this place is so popular until I had lunch here, the crowd is always full, people ordered wide variety of food. I tried their truffle fries, lasagna and gelato.

Dave Ng,3,"Nice ham and cheese croissant, coupled with Americano and Cappuccino. E-order but need to pay service charge. Good for quick bites and rest, but suitable for chat or discussion as the crowds are noisy (during my visit).",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102670815999657293644/reviews
Abraham Lee,4,Great atmosphere and fantastic range of food - the deli has a good range of cakes too!! Prices are unfortunately very much overpriced. Nice overall atmosphere and seems like they recently underwent a revamp to install more seats. Great atmosphere overall. Service is via a QR code on the table.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews
