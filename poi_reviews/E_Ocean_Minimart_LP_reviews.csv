Daisies Dahlia,1,"Long hair tan skinned lady cashier is very rude. Love to use her phone and text for a long while and let the customer wait before processing payment. Did not inform customer that plastic bag need money and when customer ask for plastic bag, she rudely reply need $0.10 and gave an eye roll. Please fire this nonsense staff and get better staff. On top of that your store always never open late because she is late many occasions I saw the guys waiting outside your store to start work or deliver stocks but the lady not around damn nonsense.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106375767344301965407/reviews
Keith Seow,1,Store charges 0.20 to 0.40cents more for per transaction if not using cash. Blatantly  inflating item cost when commission to such card/grab companies is a mere 0.4% at max. Case Singapore pls look into it.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105230956513638516347/reviews
WHT,1,"Decided to clear some CDC vouchers at this minimart out of a few found in the area which accept such vouchers.  'Hidden' on the edge of a foodcourt, I had some difficulty locating it.  Even though I'm a resident here for decades, I've never patronise this minimart before.  Bought some canned sardine, shaving gel, Lysol disinfectant spray, etc, but the items are mostly much costlier than similar ones found at nearby Fairprice Supermarket.  Manning the counter was a stern looking plump woman who later grabbed my handphone while trying to scan the QR code and didn't bother to issue any receipt for my purchase!  I was definitely not thrilled with her behavior after spending $38 of my vouchers in this minimart.  I had wanted to spend more but I needed delivery service, so I asked.
However, the woman seemed agitated and bluntly retorted 'No!'.  Summing up, I'll give this minimart the benefit of doubt and might even decide to patronise it again!
Update: I made 2 return trips after this review and cleared most of the first tranche of CDC vouchers here.  On my third trip I noticed a price discount in some canned food. Eg Sardine 425g now cost $5.10, previously it costs me $5.95!  I know the prices are mostly still costly as compared to elsewhere I am familiar with and the entire experience is mediocre at best.
However, this MiniMart is easier to reach from where I live and it offers me the option to clear my CDC vouchers.  That's why I made these return trips!
Final Update:  Almost a year passed, l was so glad l never return to this minimart again.  I realised it gave me PTSD thinking back.  I was discriminated against every time l was there, l don't know what's their problem but it's totally unacceptable and absolutely disgusting!
For those who are supporters of this minimart, l say this to you, birds of the same feather always flock together.  As far as l'm concerned, my money or CDC vouchers are better spent elsewhere where l'm able to derive a much more pleasant experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110351378798452539802/reviews
