Sean Goh,4,"Chance upon this stall sell various type of noodle in the coffeeshop opposite Serangoon sports Complex. This was my second visit, the first time when I was here, they were already closed. Apart from Lor mee, they also sell fishball noodle, mee rubus and laksa. Over here, they have the normal lor mee as well as the signature lor mee, both are SGD$4 and $5 respectively. The difference is the type ingredient the lor mee has.

Ordered their signature lor mee, which comes with fried fish fillet, fried wanton, nor hiang as pork belly. I was given fishcake as substitute since i opted out the pork belly. Gravy was flavorful and  has a distinctive herbal taste. Besides that, the gravy has a nice consistency.

Overall, i enjoyed the bowl of lor mee, and would come back again to eat. There is also a popular roast meat joint in the same coffeeshop.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
