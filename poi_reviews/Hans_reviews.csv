Jonathan C,5,"Was there for a dinner with a friend. The food was always same  standard. Decent and affordable.

I dropped a bunch of keys there and I only realised 2 hours later.

I went back and asked if they found my keys and they said yes and returned me my keys.

Very happy and grateful to encounter such professional and helpful staff working there.

Keep up the good work!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106343763313175948149/reviews
Jason Lim,5,"One of my favourite Hans outlet in Singapore 🇸🇬 love the way they prepare their Scrambled Eggs with Bacon, especially their bread slices - nice and thin. 👍❤️ Some other outlets serve them thick and it's not to nice to eat. 😞 thinner slices brings out the taste of everything in the dish. 🙏 ❤️ of course the ambience is nice and quiet. Peaceful whereas other outlets are always to so busy with customers trying to out talk each other in terms of volume - other outlets can be too noisy. 😞 highly recommend this outlet for anyone who prefers to eat in peace.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108711445962963678471/reviews
Ng Wei Jiang,2,"Mediocre food, unpleasant atmosphere. We ordered quite a bit of food to try, only the bacon in the pasta was good. Even the kopi was a 3-in-1 mix.

The ordering and waiting system was messy,  and the tables/trays were extremely smelly, like the cleaning cloth was not rinsed.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111778581349089826658/reviews
Wilson Chang,3,"Update on Tuesday, 5 December 2023 (lunch hour)

Expect to wait a while during lunch hour. We waited 25 mins for our food even tho it's only less than half full. I think the kitchen is short-handed with only 2 chef.. ?

Taste is ok but a bit saltish as before. Serving portion is adequate for the price paid (see photos).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102589058598808274925/reviews
Z O,2,Can't believe this uninspired slobbed together plate of pasta is 15 dollars. Still need to take your own food from counter.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105068729613496557064/reviews
