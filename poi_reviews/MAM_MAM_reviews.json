      "text": "Wasn’t sure what to get, so they recommended the spicy crusted chicken rice set. It was definitely a good treat but not quite spicy . Felt the portion was a little small. The staff were friendly & they had an interesting way of collecting your meal for dine in or takeaway, where they pull out a trolley of food and you pass them according to your buzzer.\n\nIf you’re looking for lunch, probably want to go earlier to avoid the working crowd. And less seats around as well, since that’s the only dining area in the building",

I waited for another 15 mins for my actual takeaway order. Upon opening my bento box in pantry, there is no Japanese pumpkin veggie, only purple pickled radish and  chopped, preserved salty, pickled cabbage with some cucumber slices. Very disappointing.",

Their porridge has the perfect consistency and comes with a fragrant scallion ginger sauce and is my usual go-to.\n\nTo get here from the wards, register at the reception counter at Zone D. Let the reception staff know you’re headed to the cafeteria at Tower Block. There are a few gantries to get past and a bit of a maze to navigate - follow the signs carefully. You may want to avoid visiting during lunch hour as it gets really packed with healthcare/corporate workers.",

Slightly pricey for a work day lunch, but the food quality and comfort from air conditioning is worth it (evident from the massive crowds during peak lunch hour).\n\nLocated at the NUHS Tower Block, this place is probably not too convenient for non-staff, as the linkway from NUH requires staff pass for access, and the only way is to walk one big round to come in by the main entrance.",
