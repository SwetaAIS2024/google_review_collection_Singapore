Sanjiv Karthigasu,1,"18th December 2022, approx. 10pm - upon entering an empty (no patrons) store, not even a greeting by the retail associate. He just stood behind an island and observed us trying on sunglasses. When we found something we liked, we asked for the price and he told us the price with a smirk, perhaps insinuating that we weren’t able to afford it. We thanked him and walked out. Five minutes later, we walked past again and this time, he was seen being overly attentive (smiles and all) to two women patrons. Bottega, you need to remind your retail associates that “that era” of luxury retail being exclusive and inaccessible is over - buck up!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101844643534538397608/reviews
Kayleen Kok,1,"Very bad service. The sales person very pushy and rude. I would say it is like the express counter with express services. Either take it or leave, don’t bother them too much. I wish the franchise boss can hire a mystery shopper to rate them.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108956892787783625130/reviews
