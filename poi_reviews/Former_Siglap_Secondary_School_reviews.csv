Bobby Tan Wah Min,4,I went to Elias C.C. and was told that the vaccination had been shifted to Former Siglap Secondary School. I took my 4 shoot or my 2nd booster shoot at this centre. The waiting time was excellent and not crowded.  This place seems to be good and excellent for people taking their vaccination. Many thanks to all the hard working people who does theirs work around this areas including those who direct people to the right areas. I also found the place to be cosy and spacious for people to move around. Thank you and have a nice blessed evening.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116738777436941844460/reviews
