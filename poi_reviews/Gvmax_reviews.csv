Shamir Shamir,1,"GV Max screen is excellent. But you can’t be having 30 minutes of ads! Movie scheduled at 9.05 but started at 9.35PM. 10-15mins of ads is acceptable, 30minutes is not especially when the same ads are being repeated. Pls look into this GV.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117238857219163155109/reviews

Biyang BryanLi,5,"Given that Dolby still doesn't open a Dolby Cinema hall in Singapore, this one is the best alternative to that! Although it doesn't have Dolby Vision effect like the Dolby Cinema halls, the sound system is astonishing as Dolby Cinema I have experienced outside of SG!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101884016476918892532/reviews
Zeiss Ileitis Kiat,5,"Pleased with the experience. While it's not IMAX like Shaw Lido, there were no disruptions from restroom goers or latecomers walking in front of the screen. GV should consider introducing IMAX to rival Shaw Lido's subpar IMAX management. A welcomed change awaits!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109603629253278219603/reviews
