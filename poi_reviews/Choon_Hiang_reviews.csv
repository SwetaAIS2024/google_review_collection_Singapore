Hoong Wai Wong,5,"One of the best fried hokkien prawn noodles that I have eaten!

My wife remarked that the 3 prawns are quite large for the medium $5 portion. The noodles are also very flavouful having soaked up the prawn broth and gravy. Quite strong umami taste.
The chilli is slightly sour and spicy, contrasts well with the noodle broth, pairs well.

Must eat, will order again next time!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106237336061537561898/reviews

Gibson,5,"My go-to meal whenever I am here at East Coast Lagoon Food Village! Have tried their Fried Kway Teow, Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee & Chicken Fried Rice on multiple occasions (More than 20 times) consistency in flavour is always there!

Did I not mention that the price has been $4 ever since pre-covid days and it still stands as such. The takeaway box is FOC as well, no such thing as 20 or 30 cents charge. Highly recommend everyone who sees this review to try it out!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106787826544962434759/reviews
