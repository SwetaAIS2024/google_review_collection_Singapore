Abhik Nag,5,"Indian street food lovers must go here!

I ordered the Chicken Popcorn and it was absolutely delicious — crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and perfectly spiced. Fresh and packed with flavor.

The staff were friendly, the ambiance was warm, and the menu has a fantastic variety. Definitely planning to come back and try more!

Highly recommend for anyone craving real Indian street-style food with a modern touch.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113546730482114984185/reviews
AL,5,"The best compliment to a chef is a cleaned out dinner bowl. Ridiculously tasty biryani and butter chicken / paneer bowls. Slightly on the fusion side of things but retains authenticity, spice and flavour. Wonderful incognito speakeasy street food vibe with a charismatic proprietor. The price point is palatable for the quality. So easy to walk past this place and miss out altogether, but I often wonder how this place hasn't already gone viral, with all the serious cravings it's caused me!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102977145239894710518/reviews
Rachel F,4,"Food tastes good as it looks. A little salty for my tastebuds but enjoyed the chicken curry bowl very much. Masala tea was great, too. Fun and cheerful owner.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114669589387392072988/reviews
Sheen Cher,5,"We had an amazing experience at Semolina, an authentic Indian restaurant serving some of the best Indian food we’ve tried! We ordered the Aloo Tikki, Mysore Masala Dosa, Butter Chicken Rice Bowl, and Masala Chai, and each dish was bursting with flavor. The Butter Chicken Rice Bowl was definitely our favorite—rich, creamy, and perfectly seasoned. The combos were spot on, and the service was excellent. Highly recommend Semolina to family and friends! We’ll definitely be back for more!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108631126783137464960/reviews
archana jadhav,1,"The owner is very rude with his coustomers. After coming for such far away you expect to have decent food and communication. But our day was ruined by him. Owner has hearing difficulty , please tell your order and check if he heard correctly.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104779464690700601820/reviews
