      "text": "To my disappointment the processing of immigration entries at Singapore for foreign visitors were applauding. The queue wait time was over 2hours at Tuas check point for bus passengers crossing from Malaysia.\n\nOn the other hand, entry point for Singaporean passport holders was fast. My count was about 5 Singaporeans over the two hours.\n\nIf only more counters could have been opened up to speed up visitorsâ€™ lanes. It would helped also if a couple of local counters were used as well.\nAlso please consider fast lanes for seniors visitors, parents with young children.\n\nSome considerations for Singapore immigration.",
