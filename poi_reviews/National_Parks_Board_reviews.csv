Adrian Yong,5,The Botanic Gardens is ever so popular and well maintained. The food at Prive was so so.

Cork,5,"This place was amazing, all the orchids were bred to be so unique and so beautiful, I spent hours looking around and enjoyed seeing what they had to offer, some of the paths were closed for maintenance and for upgrades, this just made me want to go back another year to see what more they have! The gift shop was nice too and had orchids for sale in a vial that you can take home and plant!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113830752140666898526/reviews
