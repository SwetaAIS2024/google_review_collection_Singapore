Glen,1,"HORRENDOUS WAITING TIME! Do not order from this place. An estimated waiting time of 1-2 hours for the food to be done.
Order at your own risk! Please do not order from this place! They have too many orders to handle and lack of manpower to handle it. 1 out of 5 stars is already a compliment as it should be given zero. Management should come over and check this place out and try waiting too!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106919239285712162809/reviews
