jayden,4,"The taco is above average, I personally like the fish taco more than the prawns. The wrap is soft and easy to eat, my older parents was also able to eat the taco wraps, the size is just nice to bite. The combination of sauces and seasoning also brings out the flavours and isn't over powering.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
Kiki Abarai,5,"Smallest tarts ever!!! Bite size tarts with lots of flavours to choose from. I had the steak, onion soup, salmon, quail egg & tuna. Both my husband & I enjoyed the tarts. It served as appetizers before out main food arrives. The staff too were friendly and recommended us the popular choice.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115857312123438438812/reviews
Vee Ng,1,"I recently tried the cheeseburger spring roll dish, and I was extremely disappointed. Not only was it overpriced, but the taste was far from what I expected. The flavors were bland, and the texture was off, definitely not worth the money.

To make matters worse, when I brought my concerns to the staff, their response was simply “ok and sorry.” No effort was made to address the issue or offer a solution. For the price they charge, I expected much better quality and maybe better customer service. Unfortunately, I won't be buying from their stall anymore until improvements are made, and I wouldn’t recommend this dish to anyone.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115299571315479061127/reviews
CP,4,"This area used to be occupied by a Thai food cum bistro place before Covid and now it has transformed into an eclectic place with various food outlets housed in containers. Among the food stalls, I find this one rather exquisite and tasty, and goes very well with a glass of Prosecco, while admiring the sunset the planes taking off just a stone’s throw away.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861923464679544218/reviews
Sophie R-D,2,"Ordered 2 tacos at 7:20, and only received them at 8:05. Food felt overpriced for what it was. Will return to Cosford Container Park but very likely not to Tarts Man.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106679790065718322889/reviews
