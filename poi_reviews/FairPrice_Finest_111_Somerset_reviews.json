It‚Äôs a bit smaller compared to some of the other FairPrice Finest outlets but still a decent size given it is in the heart of downtown. Always appreciate the service here that never fails to be friendly and professional even during peak hours. After checkout, feel free to ring the bell if you also appreciate their good service! üôèüèª",
