      "text": "I had the pleasure of discovering Zeppelin & Co. located on level 2, hidden at one corner of Sim Lim Square. Upon entering, I was immediately drawn to the cozy ambiance and unique decoration that sets this store apart. The cafe within the store is a delightful addition, allowing customers like me to enjoy a cup of coffee while exploring the range of headsets and earphones.\n\nThe service staff at Zeppelin & Co. were incredibly attentive. I appreciated their gesture of asking me where I would like my coffee placed, showcasing their dedication to providing a personalized experience. The service overall was satisfactory, and the coffee served was delicious.\n\nDuring my visit, I had the opportunity to meet the lady boss who patiently explained the features of wireless earbuds to my friend. Her attention to detail and willingness to assist made the experience even more enjoyable. Zeppelin & Co. is truly a place to consider for a relaxing audio exploration session in the heart of Sim Lim Square.\n\nOverall, my time at Zeppelin & Co. was delightful, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a unique audio experience paired with a cozy cafe setting. It's a hidden gem that is definitely worth a visit!",

      "text": "Great coffee and service! It’s a gem within the hustle and bustle of Sim Lim Square, with its calmness and coffee smells! I was there on a Sat, and it was rather busy. Nevertheless the staff were very welcoming and patient to ensure all customer were well treated! 😃😃😃\n\nSo I initially popped by Zeppelin for coffee and didn’t expect them to carry Bose Bluetooth speaker.\n\nThe owner were very kind and very patient to let me try the different speakers.\n\nEventually I decided on the Bose Revolve+ II which greatly complements my home and the sound quality is 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻\n\nA shame that I didn’t manage to try their food during my visit there but I’m sure I will be back soon!\n\nAll the best Zeppelin & Co! I am sure with the hard work of the owners and staff, your business will thrive well!!  😃👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",

      "text": "What a little gem! Was looking to buy headphones and a digital music player. Visited a few other places in Adelphi, but when I walked into Zeppelin knew this is where I would be buying something.  Fadli was super patient and helpful. The first day I bought a DAC dongle after trying out various options. The second day I returned to get myself in ear headphones. They had the entire spectrum from budget to super premium and guide everyone really well. And don't miss the coffee and cake. Superb! This was my first visit here, but will be visiting the next time I'm in Singapore again! If you're local don't miss the opportunity to visit this place and upgrade to audiophile music!",

      "text": "Seriously one of the best chillout spots in Sim Lim, in addition to the great decor you also get access to try out a wide range of headphones, Iems from the basic to some of the most premium stuff. I purchased one of my initial premium headphones when they first open and coming back again today for several tryouts I am really glad to see the vibe is still the same as before if not better. Thanks for creating a fantastic shared space for all.",
