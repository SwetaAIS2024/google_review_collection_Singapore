Awesome place to enjoy your favourite cup of coffee.\n\nHowever I’d like to ask Starbucks to reconsider putting straws at the self service counter.\nIt’s really sad that having introduced a lip drinking cap, we are still seeing 95% of people using straws and choosing to use a throw away plastic cup compared to using available cups for in shop consumption.\n\nPlease do consider and try to help educated us lowly simple minded people that every other plastic cup and straw plays a part in the saving of our Mother Earth.",
