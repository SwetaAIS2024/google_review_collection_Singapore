      "text": "Another great dining experience at genki sushi. Sushi comes out quick and freshly made. The frequent special, unique offerings keep things fresh and interesting. Still a great fan of their bullet train delivery system, much better than the continuously moving train belt with sushi on display for who knows how long and handled by who knows who. Lovely outlet. Will definitely be back.",

The sushi rice wasn’t packed tightly, causing it to crumble when picked up. Overall, a quick meal in the neighborhood.",
