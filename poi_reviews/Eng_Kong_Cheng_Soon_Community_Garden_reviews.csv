Nick Lim,5,Its amazing what our hobbyist urban farmers are capable of achieving. Too bad our land authorities are not releasing more land for such temporary leisure farming. It could to some extent increase our food security. Our bureaucrats should visit more of such community gardens.

It's located right by a playground and exercise area, so it really becomes a good community led space for the entire family.
