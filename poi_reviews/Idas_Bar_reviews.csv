Janice Lee,5,"I had just discovered the Dempsey of the South, which is Gillman Barracks! And Ida’s Bar is right in the middle of this quaint place of scenic nature. Walking to the Ida’s Bar during the cool evening or night is an enjoyment in itself, where I am surrounded by lush greenery and cool breezes.

Ida's Bar has this idyllic, rustic, nature-embracing feel with the lots of potted plants, clay potteries, rattan chairs, wooden furniture and lots of amber transparent bowls with candle lights. Given its alfresco nature, I can really chill at this warm, comfy place while enjoying the scenery of nature at Gillman Barracks. At the same time, the bar is playing vibrant Caribbean music to add liveliness to the atmosphere. Dining here is really one of the relaxing enjoyments in life.

The food is very good and ranges from unique surprises to lovely good old familiar classics, with a bit of twists.

The service here is very warm, friendly and helpful, making the experience a totally enjoyable one.

My favourite here is definitely the Iberico Pork, straight from the grill. It features this lovely familiar meaty sweetness with char, completed with juicy good bite. This is so good and satisfying to savour.

Potato Gnocchi here retains the starchy, slightly stretchy goodness that I love about gnocchi and add in some refreshing twists, such as the fluffy texture and the special sauce. The sauce is creamy, tangy with a hint of spiciness. This dish is full of exotic, balanced, nuanced distinctive flavours

Ida’s Semi Freddo Doughnut is a must-try here. It is so unique and blissfully good. The taste is creamy rich sweet with a hint of tangy taste. The texture is like ice cream, albeit finer, more complex flavours. Almond adds the savoury nutty kick and the contrast in texture, making it even better.

I also love the floral theme of the cocktails here.

Thoughts: Awesome place to chill amid the lush greenery and enjoy good food",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106560684916099273567/reviews
Julia Gumpl,5,"Please go here!
Amazing drinks, incredibly nice atmosphere and wonderful service.
This doesn’t feel like Singapore - in a very good way. The beautiful lighting, great music and tropical plants put you in a kind of holiday island mood (take away the street and you could be in an elegant beach bar in Koh Samui).
The staff has a lot of knowledge of the drinks, the food and even the glasses in which the drinks are served.
So please go here and support a place that is all about great service in a very unpretentious and just super nice way!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112329728654844945185/reviews
