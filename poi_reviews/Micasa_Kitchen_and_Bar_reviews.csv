Khoo Chee Yam,5,"Running out of dining idea, did a quick search on Google map for restaurants near me and saw Micasa. I was drawn by the paella on the menu. Ordered the ultimate seafood paella, croquetta de jamon iberico, charcoal grilled Iberian pork ribs and live steam clams (lala), wine, butter and garlic confit. Paired with Bordeaux Blend.
The saffron rice is cooked just nice, the rice crust, sweetness of the prawn and clams elevated the dimension of the dish.
Texture of the croquette is not just plain creamy, cured ham could have blended better to the croquette instead of laying on top.
The grilled pork ribs is tender, not overly grilled and hardened. The chef offer the fermented chilli sauce to pair with the ribs, which nicely ‚Äúwashed the greasiness‚Äù down.
The live steam clams (lala) another dish not to miss. The savoury from the soup and the sweetness from the clams complement each other.
And shoutout to the chef, very welcoming and made the guests feel homely.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114844620013502309635/reviews
Chee Kiong,5,"Service and food were excellent.
Oysters were very fresh.
I didn't see much pictures on the potatoes but IMO, they are the must order.
I can't differentiate authentic Paella. Can only say the ingredients were very fresh.
3 items good for 2 pax.
Would definitely visit again!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102894000794903429883/reviews
Kay Jun Tan,5,"This is our second visit, so shout out to Silva, who made our experience here even better than the first.

All the dishes here are good as my wife and I have our own favourite. The octopus like what all the other reviews said, is a definite must order. However if you are alr having the squid ink paella, you could skip it as it alr has octopus in it.

The wine selection are excellent as well!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113713738481903826585/reviews
Chee Wan Lim,5,"A meal worthy of a birthday celebration üéÇ
We enjoyed the dining experience.
Ordered the Angus Tomahawk which the birthday boy loved to bits.
The other dishes - Seafood Paella and Chicken Paella were delicious too.
Attentive and friendly staff complete this fantastic experience",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118275892572972593141/reviews
Si Lei Agnes Goh,4,"Update: Back here for a second time with my hubby who loves Spanish food. He enjoyed the food but noted that it‚Äôs too heavy on the palate for me. I do find the pork ribs too oily (but secret chili and garlic blend was great) and cauliflower too salty and oily, but I guess that‚Äôs just me. Thanks to Mikey for giving us two little macarons to cleanse our heavy dinner!

While there was only one main service staff, he did his best to serve us with professionalism and dedication, and even recommended dishes for us. I ordered salmon fillet, which was not bad. My friends ordered Squid Ink Paella and Ultimate Seafood Paella. The latter was pretty nice with big, juicy prawns and sliced fish and clams. Overall experience was pleasant, I would be keen to try their set menu!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116102026795437651477/reviews
