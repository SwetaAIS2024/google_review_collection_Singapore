      "text": "Authentic Thai food with some hits and miss, but overall was still good! Plenty of seats avail for dinner and spacious for baby stroller. Draft beers (Carlsberg & Blanc) are available at the drink stall to pair with the food. Would come back again to try other dishes.\n\nOrdered the steamed Seabass, can be a little spicy for some but was shiok, almost brought me back to BKK. Favorite was the stir fried Lala - a little spicy with rich coconut flavours. Phad Thai was nice but gobbled down too fast, no pics taken.\n\nBasil chicken can be improved with more basil leaves/flavour, Prawn cake can be firmer with larger prawn bits. Both dishes still tastes good but can be better.",

      "text": "Thai food was quite tasty but are of small portions given the high prices. Hence, I prefer my regular thai food elsewhere. As for the atmosphere, I went on a Saturday night and the drinking crowd was lively and loud. Given the poor acoustics of the ceiling and walls, the sound was unbearable for my family and me. In addition, the large wall screening of old MTV karaoke videos were also loud. Hence, not a conducive spot for a normal quiet dinner with my family. So for the important question, will I return? Nope and neither would my family members.",
