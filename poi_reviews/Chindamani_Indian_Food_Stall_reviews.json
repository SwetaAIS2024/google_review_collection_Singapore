Especially plain prata, too crispy not sure if it's a prata or deep fried flat dough.\nPrata  should be more flaky, fluffy and it will soak with curry when you dip into the curry.\n\nNot even close to my Top 20 prata place to visit",

Even though there is no 1 plain prata option i think as long as you order 1 plain plus another it is fine.\n\nIt is on the cheaper side but they are indeed very crispy. Fish curry is mildly spicy but it is definitely a good dip. Prata is still crispy after soaking. Other than that i think ordering 2 is just right. Downing the third feels a bit gheedy.",

They are really consistent with their pratas irregardless the outlet.\n\nLoved the fish curry together with the plain and egg pratas. The square-shaped pratas are well-worth the price and quality.\n\nRemains 1 of my favourite prata joints in Singapore.",

      "text": "Now you can avoid the snaking queues at Serangoon North and instead head to Bishan for your crispiest-prata-in-Singapore fix!\n\nWe were there at 830am and through till 930am saw only a max of 5 people in line at any one point.\n\nJust like the Serangoon branch, the workers sway with the music while maintaining a smile and interacting happily with customers. Nothing better than seeing people who enjoy what they are doing, cos you can be assured the food they serve will be cooked with love.\n\nI believe in order to get the prata that crispy, it has to be pretty oily. They do leave it to rest for a quick minute before serving it to you, but my family and I are used to dabbing our pratas with tissue regardless where we dine at. Be careful while doing so, because it's so paper thin the prata could crack in the process! I sampled both the egg and plain without curry or sugar and still found them enjoyable. The egg prata offered nothing to shout about, but I guess the crispy prata is what you should be primarily heading there for. Crispy, slightly sweet, slightly salty. The curry is thick and spicy for those who enjoy the kick.\n\nNestled in a quiet coffeeshop that offers many other breakfast options, it truly is a relaxing way to spend the morning.\n\n**sorry no proper photos of the prata cos it was too enjoyable!\n\n@goodfoodwrite - instagram & YouTube",
