Forest BK,5,"üê∂Dog Run @ East Coast Park is the larger of the two Dog Runs at East Coast Park. (The other is located near Bayshore Underpass access area).
üê∂Conveniently located at Parkland Green, near the Marine Parade Underpass access at East Coast Park, residents living nearby can bring their dogs here and unleash them to roam about freely. It makes the dogs happy and gets more sociable.
üê∂Nearby are several pet-friendly cafes with outdoor seating.
What a great way to spend time with your pet.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Aw Jun Ming,5,Love that place. Many many dogs gathered there. My dog also love it there. I think it is one of the biggest dog runs in SG. Seeing my furry baby enjoying herself makes me happy!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106616329433028381955/reviews
T0m2y Ch00,5,"First time bringing my dog there. The experience was good. Area was well kept and other dogs there are friendly and well behaved. They all played and sniff together like a bunch of small kids.

If possible, Nparks can set up more sitting areas under the trees like the one at Bishan-AMK park.

Anyway, recommended site for those that wish to let their dogs unleash and run around.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102727811964660447690/reviews
Kerris,3,"Coming from London it was a bit of a surprise to see what constitutes Singapore‚Äôs ‚Äúlargest dog run‚Äù. It would be considered quite small compared to the UK‚Äôs parks and green spaces. In terms of enjoyability for your furry companion, it depends how your dog is really. If they are a robust, boisterous, fearless type that loves the company of other dogs then they will absolutely love the dog run. It also has water taps for washing doggo up (and presumably giving them water). At peak times there can be 10-20 dogs in the run, some are well trained and well socialised and some (nearly always the small ones) are not. I‚Äôve never seen a dog fight here though. It‚Äôs usually just nippy little small dogs or dogs with no social skills,  running at other dogs -  and then the other dog will tell them to get lost. You can also get lucky especially If you come early or late, I believe the run is lit up until 10pm. During those times the run can be empty,  and you can throw the ball and hog the area all to yourself, or have a pleasant interaction with one or two dogs rather than a crowd of them. Overall it‚Äôs good that Singapore creates these spaces for dogs, without them I am certain there would be many depressed doggos indeed.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111994225819259498716/reviews
