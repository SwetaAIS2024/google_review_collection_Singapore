Therefore, very unlikely MSG was used üëèüèº.\n\nLocated in an industrial building located on the Ground floor, situated in between rows of 2nd Automobile resale, Queue forming during lunch time.\n\nValue for $$, worth to Q, (between 10-15min). I had the dry noodle version. The chili and sauce were complimentary to the yellow noodles, cooked perfectly. in addition to the amount of Pork Lard added which enhanced the flavours.\n\nTo wash it all down, sipped on the Prawn broth that has been brewing since the early dawn.üòã\n\nI will definitely return to this stall whenever I am in the area. üëèüèºüëèüèº",
