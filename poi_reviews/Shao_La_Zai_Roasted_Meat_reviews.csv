S,5,"[Oct 2024] Good stuff! Friendly folks at the stall. The noodles are cooked just right, with some bite in them. Meats are roasted well, tender and flavourful. Portions are generous, making it really good value for your money. The noodles in the picture was just $6! Wow! And to round it all up, the soup they serve is rich and full of flavour. Not the usual clear, thin wonton mee soup. Can tell that they boil it with lots of meat and root vegetables, and served with big chunks of tender carrots inside. I think the type of soup changes daily, so see what you get that day. Definitely recommended!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101242261909961926210/reviews
Upstairs Fromyou,4,"Tender char siew, not too sweet, good serving of cucumbers. Soup has old cucumber and pork in it, not the thin watery stuff that is usually given. Reasonably priced. I will be back again to try the other meats.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105665526166967001715/reviews
Brenda Ng,5,"HELLLLLA good roast place. The crackling on the crispy pork is ALWAYS on point. Char siew’s meat to fat ratio is good and always juicy not dry. If you’re a fan of herbal roasted duck you should also definitely try this place! Their noodles also deserve a shout out - noodles are cooked to perfection and QQ all the time. The guys behind the stall are always so nice, polite and happy. You can tell they really care about their customers and the food they prepare.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101905439013857817085/reviews
