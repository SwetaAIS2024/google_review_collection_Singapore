H. Glas Santurya,3,"Simply delicious, all in one. Tender bits of mutton in fragrant briyani, starchy yellow dhal, a sharp kick of sour rasam, and the satisfying bite of fried chicken with the bone in. Add a boiled egg and the crackle of fresh pappadum, and you‚Äôve got the perfect meal. From across NTU, I walk the 20 minutes‚Äîit‚Äôs my way of earning the food and making it a healthy ritual. A warm, comforting break from the stress of traffic and daily grind. Hearty, affordable, and packed with flavor‚Äîjust the recharge I need.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117895824442696255705/reviews

Seaweed Soup(M)($7)üëç - Worth it. Many ingredients can be found in this awesome bowl of seaweed soup.

Fu Yong Omelette(M)($8)üëå-  Fluffy omelette with a light crisp & is not very oily at all.

Sweet & Sour Pork(S)($12)üòê - Chewy tender but floury meat in sweet & sour sauce. Looks great but the taste weird.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103078870952547064508/reviews
Bloody Toad,4,Huge coffeeshop with a wide variety of stalls! The Mala Xiang Guo Taste fragrant! But more to the costlier side though because their Chinese kebab are also on a little higher price ~,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113593135148233291633/reviews
