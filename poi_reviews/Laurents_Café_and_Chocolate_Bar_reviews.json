      "text": "Extremely rude attitude from the owner I presume named Iveta. Truth be told I have been supporting Laurent Bernard for the longest time but I have not patronised this shop for the last few years because of the terrible customer service. My friend always celebrates my bday for me with Laurent Bernard cake and we didn't have any issue but the last experience with a chocolate cake Lola was awful. The cake was so dry and unpalatable, even those cheap cakes you can get anywhere were more moist. As the bday girl, I was definitely disappointed and it definitely spoilt our day thus my friend contacted Iveta about it. We did not even finish one slice of the cake as it tasted so dry hence we wanted to see if they could substitute it with something else, if not a refund. As a business, please take note that customer service is imperative. Even if you as the owner do not want to want to do anything about the customer's poor experience, at least be courteous. Iveta was rude and condescending in her messages. She was even accusatory in her tone to my friend making it seem like we were out to \"cheat\" her to get a \"free\" cake. We don't have time to play such mind games on a person's bday FYI. I had always supported LB brand esp their chocolates because I found it good. Therefore, it was disappointing that on my bday then, the cake was not up to par like usual. Moreover, instead of respecting us as already disappointed customers, Iveta's tone was very rude. She even maligned my friend saying that we \"threatened\" her staff for freebies. Super shocking but my friend continued to be polite. I happened to write this review today because a friend of mine told me about the poor CS at LB recently which reminded me of my own traumatic experience so I decided to post today. I have all the evidences of the WhatsApp screenshots between my friend and Iveta which I do not want to post here. However if Laurent Bernard does see this message and tries to continue to make us more aggravated, we, as customers have the right to post our truthful review of what we have experienced. Please remember that if you think your food is good, there will always be somewhere new and better. If you want to exist in the F and B line, kindly think twice about being haughty and rude to loyal customers.",
