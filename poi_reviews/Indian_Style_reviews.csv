sk sk,5,"Visited for lunch today with family via eatigo discount. The staffs at the restaurant are very humble and polite. Ambience is good,service was fast. Food tasted awesome, and they followed instructions when we asked them to make everything less spicy ,coz of our child. Will recommend this restaurant. Its just 1 min walking distance from Thomson Rd ( Opp Novena Ch) 50031 bus stop. But if you visit via MRT ( Novena) it's 4 min walking distance,coz of construction going on the road.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104473319859158664706/reviews
sushma yadav,5,"Indian Style truly feel The cozy atmosphere, warm lighting, and friendly staff create the perfect setting to enjoy authentic Indian flavors. The Garlic Naan was soft and flavorful, the Paneer Butter Masala rich and creamy, and the Mango Lassi refreshing and sweet. Every bite brought comfort and a taste of India. Highly recommend this place for anyone looking to enjoy a heartfelt, delicious meal.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116659599337918202764/reviews
Steph Hazel P,4,"Authentic Indian food cooked by chef from New Deli. Food is tasty and not bad. Naan is thin, fluffy and nice. Tandoori chicken is quite nice too but the butter chicken is too sweet. Chicken Bryani is not bad but we still prefer the Kerala style. The Masala Cha was very diluted. Masala tea cost $5.50 each for a very small cup and the small glass of lime soda at $5.90. Drinks are way too expensive. Masala chicken is $18 for a small portion. We ordered 4 cha masala (too diluted) , 1 lime soda (quite nice),2 garlic naan, 2 plain naan, 1 tandoori chicken, 1 dry Gobi Manchurian and 1 tandoori boneless chicken .With Eatigo 30% discount, we paid about $105 for 5 of us. Price is on the high side without Eatigo.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106462730224089071048/reviews
Ms. Suchi Singapore,5,"NEW INDIAN RESTAURANT IN SINGAPORE
Indian Style.sg brings you a symphony of flavors that will tantalize your taste buds and leave you longing for more.

I experienced the bliss of theirÂ Bento Box â€“Â Lunch Meal which offers a perfect blend of flavors, ensuring a satisfying and wholesome meal.

I savored the healthy and tasty Vegetarian meal ,which became my absolute favorite for its rich and aromatic spices. Non vegetarian dishes are available too.

I also Indulged in the velvety smoothness of ourÂ famous Dal Makhani, which was  slow-cooked to perfection.

We loved the dessert Carrot Halwa. It was rich yet light.

It's a lovely place to enjoy quick bites or indulge in meaningful conversations over authentic Indian food.

Ambience is cosy and service is ideal.

I recommend Indian Style. Sg highly as each dish is crafted withÂ Love and authenticity, promising a culinary journey that captures the essence of Indian cuisine.

Thank you  Manager Ravelline James Wong and chefs Pradeep & Vivek for giving us such a pleasant dining experience.

nithya nair,4,Food is pretty nice. One can use eatigo to get some discount. Staff are friendly and ambience is cosy. A little hard to find the place though with all the construction work that is going on. It is located opposite the novena church. PS this price excludes drinks.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110430336739735794665/reviews
