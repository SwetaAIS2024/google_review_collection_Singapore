      "text": "I don’t know how an arcade can help us to have more appetite to eat in already a stressful and noise-polluted society like Singapore. Don’t ever eat at the foodcourt here.\n\nThis is a mall in the neighbourhood with more and more enrichment services for school- going children and even after school care centres with indoor swimming pool.\nA bicycle park with cctv with no smoking, no littering signs and many smokers inside it from the various food delivery services. Best is this bicycle park is facing a childcare centre just opposite the mall on street level. See attached photo- no smoking and 2 guys are smoking there. We can share the mall, the parking lots but you can keep your smoke to yourselves.\n\nUpdate: 23 Feb 2025\nSo much for the management reply. Look at the latest video footage of action (if any taken) post reply. The bicycle park is the openly approved (guarded by cctv) smoking point.",

However, it does have a NTUC finest for convenience and a few food options like KFC, Long John, Subway, Pizza Hut, if you’re looking for a quick bite. It’s a decent spot for essentials but not really a place to spend much time.",

I visited it in a weekday lunchtime and there were barely any people in the restaurants\nAnd food court. I guess it gets more crowded in the evening. There’s a supermarket and Kopitiam Food courts carpark is situated on upper levels.",
