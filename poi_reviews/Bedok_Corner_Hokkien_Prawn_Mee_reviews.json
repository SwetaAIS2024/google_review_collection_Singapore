The version here is more on the dry side which is a good change since the last i had was indeed more like noodle soup. There are 3 prawns, with squids, calamansi and typical sambal belachan. Pleasantly surprised the halal version is as good as many of it's competitors. Well fried, robust flavour, prawns and squid tasted fresh.",

Personally I’m not really into the chili but it’s still spicy and taste pretty well.  As this is a halal store, no lark but I’m surprise that even though with it, it still taste a lot better then others. Worth trying IMO.",

      "text": "I absolutely adore and love the old skool hawker centre gem that is Bedok Food Centre. I'm like a kid in a candy store when I'm there. I get unnecessarily and unwittingly greedy. Rambang mata for those who understand. Everything catches my eyes there especially since almost everything there is halal. More importantly organically it is akin to a beautiful village gathering of some of the best local and Nusantara food packed tantalisingly like a food paradise under its ageing roof that has stood the test of time.\n\nBut this special mention is for the Hokkien Prawn Mee stall. It is hard and rare to find the real deal authentic in flavour bomb hokkien mee that is halal. To let my sister savour the real deal I first asked her not to immediately squeeze the lime given; which she initially remarked we don't need it right. I got her to pick up the freshly cooked delicious starchy dish and taste that first. Her eyes lit up over how sedap it is. Then I told her now you squeeze the lime to taste the next level flavour bomb when tanginess is mixed to it. Her eyes grew even bigger to match the smile of having tasted something so good. Finally I told her now you add some of the special homemade chili they've left on the side of the plate and go for the full soulful soulfood joy :)\n\nI'll find excuses to pop over to just eat this fresh there. This time we pair it with  Oyster Omelette just to create a lovely humming dancing balance in our mouth.\n\nLife is all about simple soulfood joy that creates beautiful memories shared with your loved ones.",
