Teo Zhi Wei,5,"Hard to find good rojak these days, but this place lives up to the hype! Tried the regular rojak and the one with BBQ—both were delicious. Loved that they use charcoal to toast the ingredients, giving everything a nice smoky flavor. Added tau pok, youtiao, and cuttlefish, which were perfectly cooked and paired wonderfully with the flavorful paste. My family enjoyed every bite. Highly recommend!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116674502466778029623/reviews

If you like rojak (Singapore style), this is one rojak stall that you cannot miss. Rojak is a sweet and fragrant dish which can be an afternoon tea snack, or as a starter to fire up the appetite before a meal.

This stall used to be at Joo Chiat, and has been around for decades. They upped the standard of rojak by using charcoal fire to transform the usual 油条（youtiao) into irresistible, crispy, and fragrant bites. It makes a whole world of difference to the taste, just like adding the magical wok hei for fried noodle/rice. Their rojak sauce is also rich and thick, served with a generous amount of crushed roasted peanuts.

They also sell stuffed dao pok, and offer century egg, as well as grilled dried cuttle fish as options.

This is now my regular spot when I have rojak cravings.
