Muhammad Hafiq,5,"Great spot for karaoke! The mall isnâ€™t crowded at night since itâ€™s not in a residential area. Service was good, and the equipment is well-maintained. Pricing is also reasonable since itâ€™s based on the room, not per person. The small, air-conditioned room I used had 2 mics and could comfortably fit up to 4 people.

Looks like they have a snacks area (you need to pay for it if you want) near the counter. This karaoke spot is also family-friendly. Will definitely patronize their outlets again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107992483335064360795/reviews
Bosco Lim Hearted Moments,5,"Very nice and clean place! Sound system is awesome, as expected of every Teo Heng branch. Thank you to the staff who make it really fast to clean out the room for our sessions! :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114838669339026162946/reviews
R,3,We booked the small room during peak hour for $18/hour. The sound system was pretty bad and the room had little to no ventilation so the air was stuffy. I feel this outlet really need an improvement in their equipments otherwise it's really hard to keep up with the other competitors. Drinks are still at $1/can which I have to say is a real steal.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101187717960139599104/reviews
RCSC,3,"Friendly uncles! Clean rooms with no weird smell. These factors aside, the karaoke system damn jialat. Cannot even search. Need to scroll endlessly... thankfully I have songs to sing from the Top Songs list. Else Idk how to find my songs already.

System said enter the 1st alphabet of the surname of the artist. Nothing correct appears. Then all artists/songs are NOT sorted in alphabetical order. Totally impossible to search.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101381356185028377091/reviews
