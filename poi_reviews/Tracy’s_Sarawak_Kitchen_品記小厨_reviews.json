      "text": "Non aircon, coffeeshop. Ordered Tomato Wok Hey Kway Teow. It is a unique twist to the traditional seafood hor fun, with the base being tomato. Taste is sour and tangy, in an appetising way. Surprised to find char siew in it, which added sweetness on top of sour. Prawns are fresh and firm. There is a charred feel to the kway teow, although I would not go so far to say is wok hey. Added an egg (+$1) which when beaten, the yolk further creams over the kway teow. Overall acceptable, added 1 more star for uniqueness.",

Can taste the pork oil taste overpowering cause me unable to taste the Mani + egg + garlic (authentic taste)\n\nThe Laksa has a heavier 'asam' taste compared to the usual one I had at Bedok/Sengkang.\n\nThe portion is okay, but the ingredients are so-so (egg, taugeh, and chicken meat). Ermm... the two fresh prawns are very good.\n\nPrice-wise, it's average.",

The tomato version is interesting, gives a tangy taste to the mix for wok hei hor fun.\n\nThe money cai with egg has a crunchy bite, makes it easier to chew the normally fibrous vegetable. The braised meat has a good  mix of fatty and lean meat, nice!\n\nKolo mee is good, overall can eat!",
