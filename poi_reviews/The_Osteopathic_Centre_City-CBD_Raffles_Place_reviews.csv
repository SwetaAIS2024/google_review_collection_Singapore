Sarah Pang,5,"I am a professional tennis player and have worked with many therapists around the world.  I have struggled to find a fitting osteopath to work with since my previous practitioner left Singapore during Covid.

That is, until I met Irqa.

There are some clinicians who can be technical in their work, and others who do magic. Irqa is a miracle worker and every session with her unlocks a deeper level of healing, and subsequently performance in my body. I think most impressively, was an injury I was working through. I  was so sore, I couldn't even lift a car boot! Irqa worked her magic on me and in three weeks, I was able reach the finals of the nationals, and most importantly, play pain free.

I could not recommend her enough.

P.S. I also appreciate how cost efficient and simple the clinic is. No frills, just pure, straight up treatment.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114579736302414188327/reviews

Ann Ng,5,"I highly recommend Iqra Kazee for anyone dealing with muscle or joint issues. I recently visited her for a hip strain, and her expertise and care were exceptional. Not only did she accurately diagnose the problem but her treatment plan was effective and tailored to my needs. After a few sessions, I felt significant improvement in mobility and pain relief and very happy to be able to squat again!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105805161557600261078/reviews
