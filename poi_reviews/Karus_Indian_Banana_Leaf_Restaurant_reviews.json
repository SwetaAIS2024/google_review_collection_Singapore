The yellow rice and 2 side veggies, always delicious as well. Free flow poppadoms are light, crispy and yummy.\nService is quite efficient but can be challenging when the restaurant is full.",

Both dishes were delicious, but the butter chicken stole the show - it's hands down the best I've ever tasted! Rich, creamy, and full of flavour.",

Very limited parking available at the next building.\n\nWhile the food was decent, I probably will NOT be back for a while until they \"clean up\" their act.",
