JM V,5,"On the third day of touring with our friends, we woke up early to catch our flight to Kuala Lumpur. We headed to Changi Airport Terminal 4, known for its modern design and relaxing atmosphere.

While waiting for our flight, my wife and I decided to grab breakfast at Burger King, located in the International Food Hall. The area itself was impressive the seating space was cozy and spacious, offering a premier experience that made waiting for our flight feel comfortable and relaxing.

For breakfast, I went for the Bacon Burger, while my wife chose the Chicken Burger. Both meals were satisfying, but I have to say my Bacon Burger was especially delicious. The smoky flavor of the bacon paired perfectly with the juicy patty, making it a hearty and flavorful breakfast.

If you ever find yourself at Changi Terminal 4, make sure to check out the International Food Hall. With its cozy ambiance and wide range of dining options like Burger King, it’s the perfect spot to relax and fuel up before your flight.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113607140413131397124/reviews

Maxine Jong,2,"Took an early morning flight and decided on a $8.70 meal. Was quite horrified by the look of the grilled chicken. Reluctantly took a bite into the burger. Chicken was crazy salty. Fries were meh. The only thing
worth eating was the slice of tomato in the burger. Counter staff gave me coffee instead of tea. Another customer got fries instead of onion rings. No standards at all. Sometimes in life we make horrible choices and this was one of them.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112029095114323874984/reviews
