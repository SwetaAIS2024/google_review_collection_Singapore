Ethan Lee,5,"It's a trustworthy childcare center. I was lucky to have passionate teachers for my daughter, who are genuinely caring of my daughter's wellbeing and development. The school is also relatively diversed in students with mixed race, ethnicity and cultural background that i see as a benefit for my daughter to learn to be inclusive and considerate.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102806233677387316220/reviews

Vivian Chu,4,Teachers are great. Campus is huge. School canteen food is horrible. I saw my child having the food during the first few days of school. I would never want to eat the food there myself,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109997963169380532983/reviews
Q4n,1,"Some teachers there were amazing I still miss them and iam very thankful that they taught me. However when
my ""friend"" accused me of something terrible and victim blamed me, the principal took the other person's side and never bothered to even ask me about my side of the story. The only person who truly cared and asked me about my story is the counselor. She made me feel that atleast someone would hear me out and that they cared about me even the tiniest bit. I truly hope this school will take their time to listen to both sides of peoples storys and handle situations like mine professionally.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110971159778353220149/reviews
