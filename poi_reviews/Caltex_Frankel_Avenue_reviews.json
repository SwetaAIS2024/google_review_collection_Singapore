Just wanna deduct all my vouchers for petrol b4 implying my discounts. When asked, the pitch rose up.\nHad been to few other Caltex outlets and never had this experience before.",

Friendliness and kindness like this doesn’t come easily in the Singapore service industry, therefore I was very very surprise and was questioning if I was dreaming. It was an amazing experience and I’d like to compliment the staff working at 9.55am on 16 Jan 2025. What a great way to start my day!",

But yesterday 09 Nov at about 10pm, i had to top up the tank as it was running low. The lady on duty assisted me on my apps (inactive as i seldom use) and payment. She was the most friendly and helpful customer service staff i have met. Thank you.",

      "text": "Horrendous experience at this petrol station's workshop. Technician, Khoo Wea Meng, was impatient and unprofessional. Price seemed high.\nMy sliding car door was opened, stuck a pillar and could not close. I asked for 2nd hand parts. Wea Meng quoted S$1,485 saying his suppliers could only supply an entire door at 1k+.\nA quick search on Carousel had door motors at $100. He gave a curt response telling me to go buy the parts myself then send it to him to use. Unbelievable. His reluctance to source.\nTo save money, only the brackets was to be changed. Imagine my surprise, when Wea Meng then said the old motor should still work.\nNow my door opens but with a loud cracking sound. The failure to replace the motor and locking mechanism was blamed.\nPlease avoid this workshop, for your peace of mind.",
