What sets them apart from typical tuition centres is through the focused small group learning which helps me and fellow students to further understand on concepts which we were severely lacking.\n\nTutors shares wealth of knowledge throughout the course of study and cares for my and fellows students' well-being. Plus the centre is spacious and conducive for learning.\n\nI always feel at home here at Learners Exploratoriumand highly recommend that you should pay a visit.",
