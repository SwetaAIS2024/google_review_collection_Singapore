Loved the feeling of being away from the rest of human civilisation!\n\nAccommodation is not posh but sufficient if freedom is meaningless to you.\n\nLoved my nervous brisk walks into this resort :) The adorable wild dogs along the path were a wonderful and inspiring reminder to keep fit.\n\nIf youâ€™re looking for more solitude in your life, Concierge service will surely provide confinement services. Two weekends? 8 weekends? No problem. Just sign extra.\n\nQuite a romantic place. *french accent* Once amour always amour...",

Recommended stay in the resort is 24 months.",

It a great place to stay beside the exquisite phenomena of the physical world with varieties of plants and bird chirping before sun rise.. Wild cute dogs can be heard barking with the synchronise melody of the winds. At night, its a place where star gazers would set up perfect camping spot.\n\nFor new comers, is best to stay during the weekends where there are plenty of rooms. No regrets staying here for vacation. Will definitely visit this place again the year after.",

From the artistic renditions of white plaster peeling off the walls and ceilings to the fresh nightly aroma of defecation that waft the resort at night, Gedong is a feast for the senses. The open-air restaurant comes alive with their groundbreaking integrated petting zoo experience, allowing you to pet wild dogs, cats and boars whilst you enjoy your meal of exotic delicacies - the cuboidal shaped poultry products being a favourite among guests and a must-try for anyone visiting. With such great accomodation it's no surprise then that most lodgers choose to stay on for 22 months.",

Meals are also provided and the menu is updated regularly (the pork cubes are to die for). Physical training is also free and you get to be exposed to a variety of training regimes at different locations including Singapore's finest forests.\n\n10/10 would recommend. I still pay a visit once a year.",
