      "text": "Ordered for delivery and beef burger looks like the fake ones you get at pasar malam. I understand perhaps that’s why it’s that price point, but I’m also not expecting this and would very much prefer to have paid slightly more for a single decent beef patty. The fish and chips are good though but both the wedges and the fries were underwhelming. Wedges tasted dry and has a weird colour to it. The star is the pan fried mushrooms which are nicely seasoned and fresh. The mushroom soup also looks like instant mix and just adding some mushrooms into them. Probably wouldn’t order again.",

That ah soh damn attitude! kept telling him she's busy! When I reached there, I told her the order no last 4D, she kept asking me to re-order and told me she's busy! Since so busy then don't take order via WA lah! Common sense leh... if I re-order, isn't it there will be duplicate order?!!! From a happy mood looking forward to their food, now become no mood to eat! KNS!",
