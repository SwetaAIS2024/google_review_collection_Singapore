Miss MoMo,5,"wanted some dessert after lunch & found this 豆花 taufufa beancurd place on google maps. a little tricky finding this place as it's located inside a taiwanese cafe that appears to be selling bubble tea. but we're oh-so-glad we found it!

the taufufa beancurd is silky & smooth.. you just can't get enough of it. we had the 三圆豆花（three ball taufufa），the toppings were yummy too! but the star is still their 豆花 😋

portions were pretty generous too! one bowl is enough to be shared between 2 pax. would definitely be back to try out other options! 👍🏼",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100218291666102379906/reviews
Xiaozhou Q,3,"The food is mediocre. It was a quiet place on a Friday afternoon, with no other guests when I arrived. The beancurd lacked fragrance, and the soya bean milk didn’t taste good. I won’t be visiting again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102110182448660537337/reviews
Wendy Lim (limlcwendy),3,The ingredients are rather little compared to some similar ones in JB. The service staff is quiet & nice but don’t greet customers. Table is too huge so got to sit side by side if you’re sharing…,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112929038248072233320/reviews
kyan wong,1,Both soymilk & bean curd taste weird & bitter even though we consumed them within half an hour after takeaway. Taste like leftover foods. We just throw them away into dustbin after a few sips. Couldn't take the risk with CNY around the corner. What a waste of money & food.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110879531012990849129/reviews
Irwin L,5,"The best taufufa I've tasted in JB, it's light and airy. Cozy environment with board games available to pass time with friends and family. Have visited this place multiple times and the taste has always stayed consistent and never misses. Highly recommended",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106457475811623097895/reviews
