Ning L,5,"I have been ordering the influencer tray, YTF platter and Kueh platter for many of my family gatherings and they were always the family favourite. Nothing left at the end of the day. Their stuff are handmade and very fresh even after delivery. Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102190805860757455688/reviews
Alicia Ho,5,"Famous for their handmade fishball, fishcake and other finger food, you can be assured that you'll get the freshest and bounciest fish based products from them.

The Kueh Platter is one of my favourites from the wide array of food I tried. The Soon Kueh was mouth watering, where the translucent thin, chewy skin contrasted well with the fillings within. Glutinous Rice was fragrant with a generous amount of peanuts thrown in for a better bite! My family members and I were fighting for the last mouth! Pan fry the Yam Cake for a crispier texture and to enhance the aroma overall üòã

The Otah was my favourite from the previous time I tried it and now I think I love their You Tiao more hahaha, I can't decide! Chewy and bouncy, I love the texture of it but the amount of oil and fried food I'm having is making my waistline cry. üòÇ

Kudos to them for continuing this trade from their late dad, which requires one to wake up in the wee hours of the morning to begin the prep work.

Do show them your support and help them out during this tough period! üí™üèª",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106651880558893608822/reviews
H√£pP≈∏,5,"Glad they do island wide delivery and only for a minimal $10 charge. Order was on time and the yong tau fu was delivered fresh. All we had to do was to heat up again in airfryer when ready to consume. Especially liked the yam ball thingy and the fried dumplings, generous fillings. The sauce that came with it is very good too.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100738228560182078848/reviews
Stella Chen,4,"Been ordering their food for quite a few times, through groupbuy and even direct. My top favourite will be the Chilli Fishcake because it is just so good and juicy. Actually their fishballs are juicy too. I can eat them like a meal. The next will be Rempah Udang, though a little expensive for 4 pieces but I can't help but wanting to order everytime. The fillings in fragrance and savoury. The rest of the items I get will usually be their fried wantans, sotong balls and Yong Tau Foo platter. All were good. I like that they will have a Whatsapp msg to tell you what can be kept and what's not. Following the instruction to get the best taste out of their food. The delivery also a little pricey but once awhile is fine. I buy a lot at one go.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102237360605613196776/reviews
