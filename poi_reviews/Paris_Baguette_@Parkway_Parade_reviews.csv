MH Tham,5,"Had breakfast here multiple times, especially on rainy Sunday mornings.

True to Paris Baguetteâ€™s style, ordering is fuss-free, the food quality remains consistent, and portions are well-balanced, satisfying without feeling heavy.

My favourite is the salmon cream cheese croissant, which has just the right amount of cream cheese to complement the salmon without being overpowering cheesy.

Seating is limited, but on weekend mornings, there is no crowd, making it a peaceful spot. Its open-air location within the mall is a plus, keeping it away from the oil-heavy aromas of Ya Kun and Fun Toast.

A great place for a relaxing breakfast on weekends.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112376174358198242550/reviews

Erik,5,"Cosy little coffee bar that is tucked away in the corner if you need to take a break from shopping. Great croissants and pastries, friendly staff, just not so many seats. But perhaps thatâ€™s a good thing.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113644982937765663950/reviews
Eva Leong,5,"Paris Baguette just opened here in Parkway Parade which is very convenient for me cos Iâ€™m always passing by here hehe.

They have an opening promo of 5 breads for $10 which is a very good deal. My mum and I love their chewy mochi cheese sticks which is part of their $10 deal so weâ€™ve been coming almost daily buying them ðŸ˜‰

Friendly staff at the outlet and they patiently explained the different breads to me.

Special mention to Vincent who is the Assistant Manager there. Thanks for taking the time to assist us",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113662588129193573506/reviews
U E,1,"One person at cash register. Another empty. That cashier allowed someone to cut queue right before my turn. Like in front of my eyes and wasnâ€™t subtle. When confronted, he said, I thought you were with the other person when obviously that OTHER PERSON has long gone. What kind of observation is that?????

Oh yes, No wifi. Asked to connect to mallâ€™s wifi but zero signal. Situated right at the entrance where the external heat can enter. Worst outlet.

Came here only because STARBUCKS CLOSED DOWN ðŸ˜­ will not come back to parkway anymore.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102593804228439814849/reviews
