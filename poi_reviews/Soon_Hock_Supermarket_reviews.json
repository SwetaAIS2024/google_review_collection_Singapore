While scanning customer items, saw him digging deep into his ear with his finger and then proceed to touch customers items, in the process transferring his gross ear wax onto customer items, it was the grossest thing I've seen a cashier doing in my life. I decided not to make any purchase and decided to exit the store.",

Female staff priorities stacking the cigarettes than serving customers. When she feels like providing customer service, she will say nicely to wait a second and serves you promptly. Otherwise she doesnâ€™t care and make you wait even though they are aware of your presence. Now that they provide Shopee collection point, things goes to another level. They just point to the phone and make you key in your own pin and then you wait while she prioritises stacking the cigarettes. Hopefully they stop being arrogant and ignorant.",
