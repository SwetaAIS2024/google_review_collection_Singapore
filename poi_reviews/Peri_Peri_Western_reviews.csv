Taurus Goh,1,"Came here for supper. 2 staff working with very bad attitude. Ordered my food at 1150pm, checked for my order 10mins later and the staff replied with an annoyed tone ‚Äúyou also know spring chicken need 10mins what, go back sit down I will press the bell‚Äù. This totally destroyed my dining experience. Food came and it‚Äôs all very bland, fries are double fried. I can‚Äôt decide what‚Äôs worse, the staff or the food‚Ä¶ Tampines outlet buck up pls.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109019111479752045082/reviews
Kusa,1,"I ordered Grilled Chicken & Pork for $13.90, which I already consider rather expensive considering it's a coffee shop, but to only have 4 onion rings as a side? That's just absolutely abysmal, no need to come here anymore thank you :]",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102507267597264606440/reviews

Gaurav Sharma,1,Mac and cheese could use more salt. And more cheese. Food is so so and super low effort. Maybe owners could do better by putting more effort into flavour rather than the artwork of their menu. Not worth.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101745381002048510677/reviews
Zon,3,"üç¥Black pepper char grilled chicken chop (2 free side dishes - I chose Mac & cheese and fries
üíµ $8.50

Disappointed in the presentation and taste of the dish. The only good thing worth commenting was the black pepper gravy - it was peppery (as expected) that's all.

Was unimpressed when I saw the dish. The fries looks so bland. It tasted soggy with a hint of saltiness. The Mac & Cheese looks like it was popped into the oven and made on a whim. The cheese sauce that came with it was so diluted I couldn't even figure what it tasted like. The chicken chop tasted mediocre at best and it was sooo thin (judge by seeing the images). However, I felt that it was grilled sufficiently.

Maybe the chef had a bad day, or only this dish was sub-par, I wouldn't know. But I wouldn't eat here again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102533773384381773636/reviews
