Benedict Correya,5,"A beautiful and peaceful place of worship with a very welcoming atmosphere. The architecture is unique and eye-catching, with a design that feels both grand and welcoming. Inside, the calm and serene atmosphere creates a perfect setting for prayer, reflection, or simply spending a quiet moment.

The community here is very warm and inviting. Whether you are a regular parishioner or a first-time visitor, you are greeted with kindness and made to feel at home.

Blessed Sacrament Church is not just a place of worship, but also a place where you can feel a deep sense of peace, connection, and belonging. It‚Äôs a wonderful spot for anyone looking to attend Mass or simply appreciate beautiful sacred architecture.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113292377967743781974/reviews

jimmy lee,5,A beautiful Catholic Church that is finally reopened after being closed for 2 years due to restoration works. The Church is conveniently located just 2 bus stops away from Commonwealth mrt station. I love the beautiful and unique design of the building's architecture. The Church hall is also quite large with plenty of seats to support a large congregation.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110518855728692358654/reviews
Astraeus Brigham,5,"A catholic church with very avant-garde exterior design. It is located along Queensway, facing Commonwealth Drive, right next to a Hindu temple(Sri Muneeswarar Temple) which is very interesting. This church was built in 1958 after the development of the new suburb Queenstown and the current fancy fancy exterior design was completed in the late 1970s, which was rumored to increase its popularity for fundraising at its early years. In 2005, the Urban Redevelopment Authority granted the church conservation status. One of its most distinguishing features is its iconic blue roof, constructed in folds to resemble the shape of a tent.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102982344275567995798/reviews
