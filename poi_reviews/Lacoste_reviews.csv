L LIM,5,"Outstanding customer service shone through at every level - from trainees to supervisor/manager. Helpful guidance during product selection eliminated my doubts. What lingered wasn't just the retail experience, but the warmth and kindness of the staff.""",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113236475817045291603/reviews
Nithin M M,1,Poor customer service. I am a tourist & visited shop this morning and tried to get attention of staff multiple times and they kept ignoring me and my family. This is one of my favorite brands and it is disappointing to get treated in such manner. I hope they see this review and try to improve service without judging customers walking in to their business.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108444973173525670893/reviews
Carl Häggström,1,"Bought the shoe in the middle above the sales sign. Turns out the pair is not part of the Sale they are having so I asked if he store manager if they should consider having a separate shelf for the sales item and not put something that is not on sale 17 centimetre from the sign. He said that that’s not how it works. I paid full price but it would have been great if he agreed and said they would consider this moving forward. Quite misleading and will not return to this shop. Have bought Lacoste sneakers for the last 10 years but maybe I need to change brand. I wanted them to dispose of my old shoes but he said there is a trash can outside the store. I left them at the counter and walked out. Any recommendations on other brands, anyone?",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110714980589273265193/reviews

Tri sh,1,Today 22jul2023 around 245pm brought my 6mths old Lacoste dress to Lacoste vivocity outlet  for repair as the zip hem tore off. This sales lady (near mid age) was so defensive. Said the store don't do repair and I might as well look for a seamstress on my own. The way she put it is so rude and defensive. Even refused to hear me out. It is clearly a quality issue and I am appalled that Lacoste do not have after sale service. Bad customer service and extremely bad sales person attitude!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114548375914581993035/reviews
