Imran Shafie,5,"A very unassuming neighbourhood mall with a 24-hour Giant supermarket, a 24-hour Anytime Fitness gym, some fast food chains (McDonald‚Äôs is 24 hours), retail stores and a kopitiam.

Famous internationally for the ‚Äúhow dare you call me a prostitute‚Äù meme (originally from local PSA show Crimewatch) by Saint Hoax where the two main characters ask to ‚Äúsettle tomorrow, 4pm at Pioneer Mall‚Äù and that is where the Black Spider and Scorpion gangs fight it out over a girl.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108970825290386253415/reviews

Soo Hin Yeoh,3,"Other than a well stocked Giant Supermarket on L3 and 4, this mall offers nothing else. It has a McD on the Ground Floor and Anytime Fitness on L3.

Guess it fulfills the needs of Jurong West residents but definitely not a destination.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115725392210756907778/reviews
