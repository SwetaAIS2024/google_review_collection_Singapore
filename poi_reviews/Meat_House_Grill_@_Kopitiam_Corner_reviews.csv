Tricia Wi,1,"I visited this shop on 3rd Feb around 7pm. I bought some salmon and ordered takeaway chili. When I got home and started eating, the chili tasted off, so I checked the expiry date and found it was still valid until 28th Jan 2025. I have a weak stomach, and unfortunately, I ended up with a stomach ache after eating. The food was just okay—nothing special. I also had to wait around 5 minutes in front of the store before anyone even acknowledged me. Definitely not the best experience. Wouldn’t recommend this place based on my visit.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102731025134823299402/reviews
"my penis is unbelievably small , however",1,"I recently ordered the aglio olio with prawns, and it was a huge disappointment. The dish was completely tasteless, except for an overwhelming and unnecessary taste of cheese, which has no place in a proper aglio olio. The pasta itself was so dry it felt like it had been sitting out for hours before serving, making it nearly impossible to eat.

The prawns were the worst part—far from fresh, they had a strong fishy taste that ruined any chance of enjoying the dish. It felt like no effort was made to properly season or prepare the ingredients. Overall, this was one of the most disappointing meals I’ve had, and I would not recommend it to anyone.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103739306759358845380/reviews

Eileen Teo,1,"When I was there to order the budget meal, I was informed by the staff that the meal portion was reduced by half since it s a budget meal and was told to order something else more expensive. As this budget meal program was meant to be helping people, this act was not acceptable. If the store doesn t wants to provide cheaper options of food, it should be removed from the budget meal list and not using for marketing purposes. I also noticed that this store don t sell budget meals sometimes, the option will be removed from time to time.

The staff were also very rude. Don’t bother to try. Food so so only.

They rather sit there and talk among themselves rather than serving you.

Avoid at all costs.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116844916478870334190/reviews
Nur Iman Rostam,4,"If Permata Singapore is the place for good Malay homecooked fine dining, then Chef Mel Dean's Meat House Grill at Kopitiam Corner of Clementi Avenue 6's Block 209B is a casual eating hotspot that anyone can come for to try out something that isn't as always grandeur and different from usual Malay cuisine.

I am talking about Western food. Here, you can find kinds of pasta to steaks and as all things Western food goes. Their Fish Pasta is a fantastic choice if looking for alternatives and it is very well-priced considering that the owner is a well-known chef. Overall, a great meal in a typical Kopitiam Corner which is a rare find in modern Sjngapore dining scene.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110287485091231667131/reviews
