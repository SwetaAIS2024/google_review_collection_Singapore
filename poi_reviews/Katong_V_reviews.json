NTUC FairPrice Finest supermarket is a huge plus. Eateries and other stores available in this cosy but modern centre situated beside a hotel.",

      "text": "Superb hotel! The staffs are so kind and accommodating. The room is massive.  Our bedroom comes with stove, fridge, washer and dryer. They have free nespresso machine and pods if you need your coffee first thing in the morning. It’s located next to the mall and small hawker center, so your food will come with plenty of price point. Under our hotel is a super market so you will have everything you need. It’s my first time in SEasia so I don’t know much but Singapore is super humid so if we don’t turn on our AC, our floor feels like sweat, and the rooms feels muggy. So blast the AC and it should be fine. The lobby of the hotel smells wonderful, the room lobby not so much. Our room has two balconies, the view was okay. We have a standing shower and bathtub with all the a amenities you would need in it. I would recommend this hotel/ if something seems off, just contact front desk and they will resolve it/",

Restaurant expensive, didn't eat there.  Booked 6 months ago and advised we needed early check in and would only be staying 9 hours during the day.  Response was prompt,  would see what they could do to accommodate our request.  Room was ready at 9am , but we had to pay an extra 118 singapore dollars for early check in which was not advised earlier.   That was disappointing.",
