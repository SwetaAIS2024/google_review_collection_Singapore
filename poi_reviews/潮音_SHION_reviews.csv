You K,4,"This cozy little spot is hidden away in the far depths of Orchard Plaza’s first floor. I walked right past it the first time, but I’m glad I turned back.

Inside, the seating is all counter-style, arranged around the open kitchen. It’s a snug setup, with two staff members running the show: a Japanese chef and his friendly assistant.
The assistant’s warm demeanor helps ease any hesitation you might feel stepping in, though getting his attention for a drink refill was a slight challenge despite only one other party being there.

The chef’s passion for sake is evident—his English-language book on the subject was a fascinating touch.
Speaking of sake, the variety on offer was delightful! Being able to try different kinds by the glass (or rather, the ochoko) was much appreciated.
My one wish? If they could serve lemon sour in big mugs, that would be the cherry on top.

We went for the omakase course, though they also offer à la carte options.
The food? Classic Japanese, no frills, no flashy plating—just honest-to-goodness, traditional flavors.
Portions are on the smaller side, and while everything tasted great, I found myself missing some carbs.
Sure, they served ozoni, but I was left longing for a proper rice or noodle dish to round things out.

A couple of quirks worth mentioning: like many small restaurants, there’s no in-house restroom, and the nearest one is a bit of a trek. For a place serving alcohol, this isn’t ideal.

That said, the potential here is sky-high.
The restaurant is still in its early days, and I’m excited to see how it evolves.
With a bit of polish, this could easily become a go-to spot for sake lovers and fans of authentic Japanese flavors.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114290941081043664370/reviews
