"Rakchanok Autthasri, Ella",1,You call this one thai basil pork rice? Sweet basil mostly use for green curry. If you donâ€™t know how to cook thai food please sell other things not thai food. Donâ€™t misuse THAI word. First and last time.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118146713819222359740/reviews

Hula,3,"First try for this stall.  Ordered seafood tom yum clear soup with rice set at $8.  Honestly ingredients is fresh but soup base cannot make it. First taste was sweet, then followed by extreme sourness with spicy, that's awful. Very hard to swallow. The soup base ruined this whole meal.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114361584359870118360/reviews

Amanda Shim,5,"Regretted not taking a photo but WOW the honey chicken rice is damn good! Itâ€™s so hard to find such standards in thai restaurants these days. The sauce was just right, chicken was extremely crispy and fresh! Iâ€™ve eaten many honey chicken dishes from famous eateries in SG and have not found one which was as crispy as this. Kudos to the chef and staff! They were a friendly trio ðŸ˜Š will be back again with photos!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100495412947859851279/reviews
