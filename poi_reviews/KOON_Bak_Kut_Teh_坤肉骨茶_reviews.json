No English -- perhaps it would be nice to hire someone who can speak in English since it took awhile for the staff to understand what i was asking\n2. Vegetable with less green -- i ordered the Seasonal Vegetables in Oyster Sauce. But when the food came, it is totally different from the image in the menu. I received 90% stem and 10% greens üòÖ\n3.  Bah Kut Teh -- perfect blend. The flavour is just enough and not so strong like the one from Song Fa.\n4.  Peanuts -- i loved it.\n5.  Ambiance -- it's cozy and good view of the street while enjoying dinner",

      "text": "1. The PRC lady is like a one leg kick. She has to be the cashier , server, everything that's frontline. She speaks no English.\n2. I wanted to order the set meal for 2 pax but she told me that the drinks can't be changed from cold to hot drinks which was ridiculous. Not everyone drinks cold drinks.\n3. I ordered the drinks wrongly and I was served with cold drinks instead. When I asked her to help change to hot drinks, she said I can't change. In the end, I needed to remove the ice cubes from the drinks by myself. Her service and attitude sucks.\n4. Vegetable with less green -- i ordered the Seasonal Vegetables in Oyster Sauce. But when the food came, it was totally different from the image in the menu. I received so much more stems and lesser greens.\n5. Bah Kut Teh -- perfect blend. The flavour is just nice.",

The vegetable dishes are fresh and just the right mix.  The hot plum tea is very nice I like it. Disappointed me is no pork liver soup which is one of my favourites. Will be back.",

Not sure whats up with the recent one star reviews. Seating is ample here and the service was decent. Loved their pork ribs and braised pork belly rice! The Iced Ginger Tea was good as well.",
