Apple Oh,5,"I got myself some @kangkangnoodles to cook for my family this weekend! 😁✌🏻

I ❤️ that these noodles are preservative-free and that there are so many recipes that can be made with my chosen pick of Hokkien Flat Noodles. There are also wholegrain options for more health conscious people 👍🏻

Perfect for any noodle meals! 😍",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115392024963210729673/reviews
