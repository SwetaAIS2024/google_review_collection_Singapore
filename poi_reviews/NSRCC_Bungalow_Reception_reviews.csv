Tienhock Cheng,2,"Recently I booked 3 nights on one of the chalet. Everything were quite normal, but I don't like the check out system. I was not there to check out and instruct my daughter to do it. Supposed that the bill should go to my account, but was told to pay before can do so. Why can't the club charge to my member account. Lucky a friend was there to pay. Otherwise they can't check out.
why can't the club ask if charges goes to member account during booking? Or pay in advance before check in.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104688961230137640881/reviews
Hiang Ar,4,"The Bungalow Chalet offers a cozy and charming retreat, perfect for those seeking a blend of comfort and nature. The chalets are typically well-equipped, featuring essential amenities such as kitchen, microwave, plates, water jug, utensils, pot and kettle. A notable downside is the lack of on-site food options. Guests have to travel far for a meal or have to prepare a lot of groceries for BBQ. It can be quite a hassle.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101185220797498251612/reviews

Joyce Ong,3,"First time staying at No. 21.

1. Wear n tear.
A) Ceiling paint peeling.
B) Aircon leaking. Called the housekeeping and their tech immediately attended to it. Thank you.
2. Cushions that smells
3. Utensils not cleaned. Got stains.
4. Staircase got hair/dust. Housekeeping not properly done.
5. Near the bbq - theres hole on e floor. Children may trip and fall.

But I love the spacious unit and the quiet location. Most probably wont book this unit again.

Hope the mgmt will do something abt it and give the guests a pleasant stay! Thank you.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112403364679588575398/reviews
