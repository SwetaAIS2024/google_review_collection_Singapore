Tatiana Sarapulova,5,"Our son has been going to Little Lions for over a year, and we are very happy with the school. The principal, teachers, and all the staff are kind, caring, and always ready to help. They do everything to make sure the children feel comfortable with food, nap time, and learning.
When our son started, he hardly spoke any English. Now he can speak freely and express his thoughts. We are really proud of his progress and thankful for the support he got at school.
We also love that Little Lions often organizes fun and interesting activities like outdoor walks every day, water play, sand play, celebrations, trips, art workshops, and small shows. Every day is exciting for the kids.
Thank you to the whole team for your great work and care!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109974190455394265434/reviews
Lydia Haviar,5,"Are you looking for a preschool that offers a loving environment and encourages empathy in children? Look no further than Little Lions! Since our daughter started attending, we have seen nothing but positive results, including her language and communication skills development. And the community of children at Little Lions has been incredibly welcoming and supportive. We love that she is gaining both academic and practical life skills through the many learning experiences provided. We feel happy and grateful to be part of the Little Lions family.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110962449412799962193/reviews
Peter Tawn,5,"Excellent preschool! Our son attended Little Lions between March 2022 and August 2023. This was the first pre-school whereby our son looked forward to going each morning. The staff are genuine teachers, nurturers and carers. The only reason for leaving Little Lions was to prepare our son for Primary school. Thank you Ms Katelyn, Ms Chloe and rest of the staff at Little Lions!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106752742426253615108/reviews
Michael Watson,5,"Our now 4 year old has absolutely loved being at Little Lions. We are a British/American family who have been here for 6 years.

Our youngest boy was born here in SG and first enjoyed coming here aged 1-2 when the pre-school was under different ownership as ‘My Prep Montessori’ - we were a little worried about the change because he was so happy there… but he has thrived at Little Lions and has been so happy there.

We regularly thank his teachers for creating such a warm, caring, and fun environment. We have loved his enthusiasm for learning, for crafts, for being kind and showing respect, and for the creative camps and little projects they have introduced. He has made good little friends there, and the whole experience has been lovely. We would happily recommend this pre-school!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312142687238242140/reviews
