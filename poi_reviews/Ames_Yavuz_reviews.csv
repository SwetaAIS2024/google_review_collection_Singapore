C,4,"Ames Yavuz Art Gallery, located in the serene and historically rich Gillman Barracks, is a space that brings together diverse cultural perspectives with a strong international focus. The gallery's mission is to challenge, inspire, and spark meaningful discourse through its robust curatorial practices. Currently, the gallery is showcasing Black Box 黑匣, a thought-provoking group exhibition featuring works by 12 Chinese artists. The exhibition explores themes of ""imprisoned bodies"" and ""boundaries of space,"" offering deep, reflective insights. While the quality of the art is exceptional, the gallery sees surprisingly few visitors, allowing for an intimate and uninterrupted viewing experience.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
JC C.,1,"Went on a Saturday at 4:45pm. Gallery was closed. I called the number on the door. Lady first indicated “they were not sure when they would come back”, then indicated 5:30pm after insisting.
We really wanted to see a particular painting from the artist as seen a few weeks earlier at Art Basel HK.
5:40pm we knock. After a minute they open and said they were cleaning after a client visit, and asked for another 10 minutes of wait. That’s more than an hour in total, in the heat of May (they didn’t accept for us to wait inside). We knocked another few minutes after, no reaction.
10 minutes after, the door opens, we get inside, visit, not a single word from any staff.
I was quite interested in this artist but the experience was more than underwhelming.
Piece of advice, call before you drive all the way to the barracks to make sure you don’t date an hour of wait.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107774734917218505607/reviews
