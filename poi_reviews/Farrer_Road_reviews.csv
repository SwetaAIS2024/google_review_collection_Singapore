Drew,5,"Clean MRT on the Circle Line with a large funky paint in the middle. Gives the entire station a cool vibe. Otherwise, the station platform does feel a little claustrophobic.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101284562920569774106/reviews

Dina Alabastro,2,"It’s only my second day in the city and the metro is already rubbing on me the wrong way. The ticket vending machines are not user friendly. Cash lane is only one tvm which has a long line. The ticket office machine isn’t helpful at all. They don’t give notes change. I was forced to buy at nearby store items to get change for small bill to use for tvm. Coming from a station master background, I am giving their customer service two star only. Trains are clean and reliable.  Stations have sufficient signages so you won’t get lost. Only missing human touch hence low on customer service.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115351593729519089107/reviews

Tayson Tay,4,"Wow, this station kinda blows me away! With one of the entrances being surrounded by trees and buildings, it is like an easily missed place. However, there are adequate food options in Farrer Road.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104411331065902255890/reviews
