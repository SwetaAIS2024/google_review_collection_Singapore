Nancy Kurniawan,5,"Been going to Picosure for hyperpigmentation, like the treatment n can see the result of firmer, clearer, cleaner skin 1-2 weeks later n the result can last for around 3 months before the next treatment.
Would recommend this treatment for anyone looking for firmer ,lifting effect as well as pigmentation.
Both Doctors Yeo n Chung are very professional,  they are not pushy with any treatments  instead they will patiently explain to you about the treatment recommended n leave you to decide.
I like their service and very nice clean modern clinic.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116177794770294445127/reviews

Mary Daly-hill,5,"I have been seeing Dr Isabelle for about 11 years. Her and her whole team are fantastic. Not only are they very professional, they are also warm and caring.
Dr. Isabelle has a magic touch . I constantly get compliments on my skin.  I‚Äôve never had a disappointing t/t with her. I trust her üíØ
My husband and kids use all her products.
My daughter sees  Dr.chung . Due to an accident she has a scar on her chin. She is now nearly 20 but stated t/t at least 4 years ago. It‚Äôs involved salmon DNA  infections and laser . Her scar looks great now .
I highly recommend this wonderful group of women.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117832101908232541396/reviews
Alix T,5,"Dr Yeoh is wonderful. I have encountered bad facial therapists in my younger days which caused me skin sensitivities and left some imperfections on my otherwise clear and healthy complexion. Yet thanks much to Dr Yeoh who helped me rebuild a healthier skin. It is really important to engage a full fledged professional and experienced aesthetic doctor like Dr Yeoh, who really wants you to have good healthy skin! She has saved my complexion on several occasions when I had bad acne and on the verge of scarring. Moreover, IYAC‚Äôs skincare products and facial therapies are effective and very comfortable on the skin. Oh, and Dr Yeoh is really gorgeous, elegant and attentive, you just feel so at ease with her as your doctor. ü§©",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111202512555417131083/reviews
Qun Qian,5,"A close friend of mine has been a loyal client of IYAC for over 10 years, and her skin always looks stunning. Impressed by her results, she recommended Dr. Yeoh to me, and
I‚Äôve been seeing her for almost three years now. What I love most about Dr. Yeoh is her honest and personalized approach‚Äîshe only recommends treatments that truly suit my needs, never pushing unnecessary products or procedures. On top of that, her exceptional skills are worth highlighting. After every session, I leave feeling rejuvenated and noticeably more youthful.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115566352982258411593/reviews
