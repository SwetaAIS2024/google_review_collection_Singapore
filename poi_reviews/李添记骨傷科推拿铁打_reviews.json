I was hesitate to go there as I know the waiting time is usually quite long. But it’s worthy.",

But Leong cautioned the root cause of habit needs to be watched.\n\nOverall treatment cost was $48 by cash payment which was reasonable as treatment was applied thru the ankle, knee to back.....with alot of medical plaster attached.\n\nPs: understood needed to call in to get number for treatment. Walk in subjected to crowd and available.",

Otherwise you may make an appointment in person and take a number from them. They don’t take any appointment over a phone call.\n\nI felt better after few hours waiting and seeing the physician. Be prepared for a long wait though if you plan to visit them in weekends.",
