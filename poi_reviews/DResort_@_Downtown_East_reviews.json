      "text": "Celebrated my daughter birthday at D’resort. Finding the hotel lobby is difficult if you arrive the resort via public transport. It is a long walk from downtown east and there is no clear signage on how you can get to the main lobby. It’s very inconvenient and the shortest path require you to cut through the carpark. What make it worse is you might need to walk another long path to the room if you room happened to be at thr furthest area from the lobby (park view rooms).\nThe room is very spacious, the bed is comfortable. There is a fridge where you can store all the bbq food and drinks, so this is really good for us as we are having bbq. The bbq pit is just right outside the room, so it’s very convenient for us to run between the bbq and the room.\nThe room and bathroom is new and well maintained. The only downside for the stay is that there is only ONE chair in the room. I think they should have at least a few so that people can sit and chit chat.\n\nRefer to the attached photo for the resort room numbers",

Nearby park and cycle rental very good.  Slides were closed onTuesday so did not use this .  Shopping centre and closeness to eateries / supermarkets and shuttle is a mature help to the experience . Good for airport stopovers",
