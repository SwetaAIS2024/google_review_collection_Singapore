Rachel Lee,4,"Have always loved Keong Saik, and was thrilled to find out they opened a branch near work! Exquistely crafted local flavours so brilliantly combined and created into new things with new textures. I am in awe. So of course i had to bring my young nephews to try. Definitely a place to enjoy from young to old.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111701172499580628303/reviews
Drift King,5,V nice cafe. Local and authentic selling also frothed lattes and the likes. Pastries are imaginative and a pretty wide variety. Pricing is also reasonable unlike another chain further down the road. Took a photos of the cakes and not the pastries so take a surprise trip down!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107097552708320713061/reviews
Darren Sim,4,"A charming café that blends Western style with local flavors, offering a unique breakfast experience. The rose cheesecake was rich and delicately floral, while the sourdough with curry dip delivered a bold, comforting taste of familiar spices. The latte, made from Singaporean kopi, was smooth, robust, and aromatic. While the curry is pre-portioned from a central kitchen, extra sauce is available for an additional fee. The cozy ambiance adds to the charm, though weekends can get lively with families and kids around. Still, it’s a lovely spot to enjoy a thoughtful fusion of flavors.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110664130938344492493/reviews
Deyna Chia,5,"Great coffee made by Barrista Kelvin. Food was unique and tasty.

Really nice outlet. Retro feel. Tables wide apart enough for private chats.
