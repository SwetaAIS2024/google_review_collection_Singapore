JM V,4,"Late review: After grabbing desserts at Annabella Patisserie, my wife and I found Pezzo Pizza at Jurong Point Mall to complete our New Yearâ€™s Eve dinner.

The pizza options looked amazing, so we picked a few slices with different flavors. Each slice was loaded with toppings, and the crust was the perfect mix of soft and crispy.

It was a great addition to our celebration meal, and we loved the taste and quality. Definitely a spot to check out if youâ€™re craving pizza at Jurong Point!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113607140413131397124/reviews
EF 521,3,ordered 6 slices of pizzas & a chicken lasagna... pizzas were fine as per usual. but the lasagna were too salty. is it normal? meant to be that salty? i have to add abit of hot water and re-steam to reduce the saltiness... a hassle. pls improve on the lasagna sauce. if it is meant to be this way i'm afraid no kids are recommended to consume the lasagna. it is really overpowering the whole dish.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114020809355828382108/reviews
Yvonne Luk,5,"I tried durian pizza; it mixed with cheese so well, not too sweet and just slightly salty. I ordered pepperoni and veggie, which both tasted incredible that better than I except.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110195378609736957311/reviews
Divyanshu Mahajan,5,Itâ€™s a Sunday tradition and Pezzo is our weekly pick. We requested for removal of mushroom and addition of veges and they were delivered on it as promised. Will eat again next Sunday ðŸ¤£ This is also one of the only places that offers pizza by the slice so thatâ€™s a plus and the slice is filling.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110651958606620480842/reviews
Jeremy Lew,1,Bought pezzo for dinner via grab at jurong point and this was the standard I got. I did not request for extra crispy. I just threw away the entire pizza and ordered pizza hut instead.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105990888892796063297/reviews
