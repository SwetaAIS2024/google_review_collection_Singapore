At its price point, the value of food and quality of ingredients are extremely hard to beat.\n\nThe Pork Noodles ($7) are amazing.\n\nPork Sandwich/Bahn Mi ($6) is a simple affair but generous in meat portion. Definitely still moist and flavourful.\n\nIâ€™ll be back for more.",

But I find the beef acceptable. No beefy taste and I can chew down and swallow a huge chunk without feeling nauseous.\n\nSoup base on the sweeter side for me, otherwise will highly recommend if you like minty and light tasting soup.",

The pho and bahn mi were also packed with meat and justified the slightly higher police point for coffeeshop fare. Lots of other Vietnamese dishes on the menu to try next!",

Always faced with very bad attitude from both the younger and older female vietnamese ladies. Only the Chinese guy working there is polite. No choice as this is the only vietnamese place in the area to satisfy cravings.\n\nToday was the last straw. Faced with the usual bad attitude and was charged $10 for the above meal which was prepared in 30secs.\n\nMost vietnamese people I've met have been so friendly and warm. Quite sad that these people come to Singapore for a better life and instead start to cheat and abuse Singaporeans.\n\nWill stop patronizing this stall from now on.",
