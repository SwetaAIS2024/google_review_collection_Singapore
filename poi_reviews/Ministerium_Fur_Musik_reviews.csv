Over the 11 years of piano lessons with her, she opened up my musical universe. I explored many different genres of music with her, such as classical, jazz, ragtime and movie soundtracks. I always looked forward to attending my weekly lessons with her because there was always something new and enjoyable to learn. I am truly grateful that I had her as my teacher.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114059730891040597770/reviews
