      "text": "Not impressed. Ordered and paid for Bountiful set for 15 people. No follow up or email notification after 2 days. I've to call and ask them if they're coming on the date of order. Ordered at 12pm, the office told me they'll come at 1130am-1230pm set up. Day itself finally someone call me at 1135 saying he's on the way. By the time he set up was 1240pm. Food quality was poor. Lots of rice but other than that, everything else doesn't look appetizing or nice. More like coffeeshop pick and choose rice dishes. Spent SGD 700, I could have order from Putien spent SGD 400 with lots of really nice food. By 430pm, still no one came to clear, I've to call the driver and he told me he's coming only at 620pm. I've to tell him to please come by 5pm as we're all out of the house by then. Will never order from Makan Mate. Poor quality food that doesn't justify the price.",
