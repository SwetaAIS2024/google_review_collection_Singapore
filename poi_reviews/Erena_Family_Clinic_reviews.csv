Lilo Lilo,5,"This clinic I discovered by accident yesterday when I went for flu jab. I like Dr Grace straight away. She speaks very clearly and factually.

This is her own clinic and she started operating 8 months ago, taking over from previous doctor who had been there 27 years.

Very good doctor and I'm so glad the clinic is also inside my company GP panel. Definitely worth walking a little distance compared to the Clinic next door who simply treats the work as a job, nothing more.

If you would like to have a good family doctor that you and your family can trust, Dr Grace is certainly someone you should consider.

Ladies at reception are polite, efficient and professional too. Grumpy ones certainly make you even more sick when you are already feeling so sick.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106892382696368743708/reviews

Pauline T,3,"Got enrolled here recently for Healthier Sg with my elderly mother. Clinic assistants were absolutely helpful. Doctor was patient to check on our medical history. Also checked with doctor on the FAR completion for my mother, but she said this can only be done by someone trained to be an assessor, which she wasn't. So I had to check with another doctor to do it, and he expressed surprise that a GP would not be able to perform the FA. Not sure who is right.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101043219483968715332/reviews
calvin wong,5,Did my annual health screening at this clinic and was surprised to be told that I could do it without any prior fasting which was super convenient. Also very comprehensive tests for the premium package that I did. It even included ECG! Doctor Grace was very patient and thorough in explaining the results and areas that I need to look out for to improve my medical results. Thanks again to the team at Erena Family Clinic.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116136220962450418965/reviews
