Flo Yeow,5,"This bus stop is honestly a little awkwardly located. It's quite important because it brings you to Somerset 313 and Orchard Takashimaya / Paragon. But, there's also no sheltered walkway, so if it rains, you're pretty much done. That said, it's clean and well, many people drop and board here for said reasons above.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
