I call the doctor, he says his receptionist is off today and didn't check his calendar to see we had an appointment.  He was in surgery but apparently could leave it and make it back to the office in a while.\n\nI ended up leaving.  If something simple like a schedule can be botched, I don't want to imagine what could happen to my body.",
