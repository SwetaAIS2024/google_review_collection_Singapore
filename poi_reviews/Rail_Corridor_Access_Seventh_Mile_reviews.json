      "text": "Exploring part of the Bukit Timah Rail Corridor from King Albert Park to Rail Mall. We met at King Albert Park mrt stn exit A. Started our walk towards Truss Bridge. Under and near the bridge, we saw a directional sign to former Bukit Timah Railway station. Part of the railway track was kept and construction was underway to preserve the former station. We saw lots of joggers, cyclists and walkers along the way. After visiting this part, we detoured back and followed the Woodlands directional sign which brought us onto Truss bridge. The path is easy to trek on with lots of local floral and fauna. There are exit points to Bukit Timah Plaza, Bukit Timah Hill Station, etc. We reached another Truss Bridge, end point exit to Rail Mall at Hillview. Construction works are on-going from this point. Hence, it is blocked. Completion and opening will be after mid 2024 (according to the information posted).",
