Shan Leong,4,"I like the Char Siew and Roast pork, as for the duck will give it a pass. But overall food and service was good. Can try. I will sure come back again.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113138367268114769094/reviews
CY N,5,"Ordered Food Panda delivery. First try.

Pricey (small meat portions, lotsa rice) but worth a try for taste. Giving five stars for taste and texture.

Excellent roasted duck and roasted pork. Boiled chicken good.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106662487549851334379/reviews
Hello Bye,1,"Ordered three combination rice. Requested for duck breast but it seems the message is not passed to the one cutting. Requested again and the guy that’s cutting say he already cut other parts and claimed that I didn’t say from the start. Attitude problem. Changed for me but gave me a few tiny thin pieces of duck breast. $7.60.

Food is ok but attitude and portion sucks",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104549850735237095257/reviews
Moweyy,1,"Ordered Set A which is steamed chicken with braised tofu, egg, bean sprouts. Requested for roasted but the butcher ignored it. Bean sprouts were completely uncooked, and as a result had a very strong earthy smell to it. Chicken had barely any skin on it and was dry. Butcher had a rude attitude too, order at your own risk",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112383570862624587107/reviews
