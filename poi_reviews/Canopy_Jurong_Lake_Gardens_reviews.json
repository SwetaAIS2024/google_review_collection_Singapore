      "text": "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nThis restaurant offers a wonderful blend of ambience and great food! The decor is stunning, with warm wooden accents and unique birdcage-style lighting that gives the space a cosy yet elegant feel. The greenery indoors adds a refreshing touch, making it a perfect spot to unwind.\n\nThe food and drinks were delightful. I had a cup of tea, and it was served beautifully in a rustic ceramic set. The attention to detail in both presentation and taste stood out. The service was also excellent—friendly staff and prompt service improved the experience.\n\nThis place is a must-visit if you’re looking for a stylish yet relaxing dining spot with good food and a warm atmosphere. Highly recommended!",

From the moment I walked in, the staff made me feel genuinely welcome with their warm greetings and friendly smiles. Their attentiveness was exceptional—they were knowledgeable about the menu, offered great recommendations, and checked in regularly without being intrusive. The service was fast, yet never felt rushed, allowing for a relaxed and enjoyable meal. On top of that, the food was fantastic, with fresh ingredients and beautifully plated dishes. I’ll definitely be coming back!",

The fish and chips were yummy, the flesh of the fish is not dry or had the strong fishy smell. Crab aglio olio and carbonara was tasty. The burger was cooked to perfection too.",

      "text": "Dropped by on a public holiday for brunch! They had a free welcome lemon tea for oddle members which was nice and strong but a little too sweet.\n\nHad their breakfast platter, which was kinda mid but not bad for the price $20. Though the menu said sourdough, the toast was just normal white bread/baguette. Kind of disappointing. Scrambled egg is abit dry and some bits was over done.\n\nThe star of the dish was the  sausage, the hint of spice was just right and pork was fragrant. I also liked the pumpkin wedges sweet and nicely roasted. my long black was alright, not good but not bad.\n\nWhat makes the place worth the visit would be the pretty lake gardens around it and the vibe is naturey and calming. Good music and nice place to just chill out with friends.",
