Aglio Olio and chicken is superb, I can literally eat the pasta by itself and the chicken last and it will still taste good.\n\n1st time ordering definitely will order again!\nDon't just read reviews and give it a miss, try first then only you rate.",

This Soilder Chicken western foods stall has been operated few years. Being quite popular and good business since opened.\n\nTheir price range was quite high, mostly above $10. Fortunately, their dishes was quite flavourful and tasty. More on heavy seasoning and with distinct taste.\n\nWe tried their lambchop, 4 pieces of lamb racks, very well cooked, medium rare to medium cooked. Side dishes come with French fries and cooslow. Priced at $12.90. Slight pricy and small portion.\n\nOverall, still a good western foods with decent quality. Worth visit for first timer.",
