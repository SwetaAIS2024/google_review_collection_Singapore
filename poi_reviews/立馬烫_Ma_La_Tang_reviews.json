Wow i didnt expect such a large bowl of pearl-grain rice and the soup was brimming with the food!\nValue for money indeed!\nWill come again to try the Collagen soup base next üòã",

      "text": "This is sooooo amazing. Seller is super generous, I ordered $7 chicken set meal (not by weigh kind, can't chose ingredients ), portion alot, variety of ingredients given ok too. (my Pic look like alot green veg, but inside alot chicken slices and diff type non meat ingredient) N it's delicious. The instant noodle (set can chose noodle or rice) also very tasty, mala taste lu wei. I'm really hook.\n\nI drink the soup even though I'm on diet. (I so far did not almost finish other places mala soup). This Mala soup is drinkable kind and not over salty (some other China ones over salty or super duper oily). I even use my son pizza crust to dip the soup as shown in pictureü§£\n\nI've eaten those China mala tang diff outlet, always eat diff China food. I did ask young stall helper guy what's in the set B4 purchase, he doesn't sound like China. No matter China or sg seller, this definitely suits me, and definitely 100% will go back again. This stall really thumbs up.",

      "text": "Went down a few times at weekday evenings. No queue at the shop. You can eother choose the sets on the menu or pick your own choice of ingredients in the display fridge and pay by weight picked. After which you will have to choose the soup base and spicy level if you chose mala.\n\nWe chose our own ingredients and went with Mala Collagen soup base since that is their the name of the shop. The price was around $12 for what we picked. Rice can be added (forgot the price) on request. A wireless pager will be given to inform when the food is ready.\n\nFood is cooked on the spot and ready within minutes. The portion of soup was generous and covered the ingredients.\n\nThe collagen and mala combination went well with the other ingredients and perfect when poured onto the rice.\n\nHighly recommended during the recent cold weather.\n\nA hidden gem with great price value and short queue.",
