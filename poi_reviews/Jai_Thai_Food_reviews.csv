T WP,4,"AuthenticThai food in this area, try it, and the portion can share~ Generally, the dishes I bought below are shared among 2 pax, which is pretty filling and recommends it!

>> Pineapple Fried Rice ($5.50)
I can eat pineapple bits, prawn, egg, mixed vege, and pork floss. Honestly, it is a nice amount of ingredients as I do have a bad experience of having pineapple fried rice with pathetic pineapple bits only. Moreover, this was shared between 2 pax.

>> Tom Yum Soup ($6.50)
Good portion of seafood, which personally I felt worth the price, do try it! The herbs used are not stingy at all~ Aroy~",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116063738673256691463/reviews

Wei Tan,4,"2nd time with the stall and it continues to impress me - authentically tasty food, generous portions at affordable prices. This was the first time I had Thai olive fried rice in a hawker centre and it was really good. Would certainly recommend this to friends looking for accessible, good Thai food. No issues with the auntie on both occasions.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113727367121706943852/reviews
Yoco Wong,5,"Have been going to this stall for years, love their Pad Thai & Tom Yum soup. Taste is authentic, portion is generous and good quality for the price paid. The lady taking order is never rude, and she always remembers I donâ€™t want chili powder for my Pad Thai even after months of not eating there!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116971938724101987458/reviews
