Nunki Ang,4,"I went to this place after I took my blood test and collect my medicine with hubby. Our family favorite from this place was chicken pie. Everyone love it! But today, hubby took big breakfast which delicious for him. Meanwhile I took chicken pie as usual & their new launched product, chicken ham quiche tart, which in my opinion & taste is not suitable. For me, too sweet. I do prefer their chocolate tart. I love their kopi o kosong but for kopi, its ordinary. The service of staffs in this branch were superb, fast, friendly & patience with me. The atmosphere was OK, nothing particular. It's self service, including return your tray.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115049581451574514827/reviews
Jc Foo,2,"Mediocre food and drinks. The brewer, though lacking social grace, is quite serious and dedicated to his work and took pride of his station. Observed his fast speed, efficiency and attention to cleanliness. Something i would give credit to, especially an elderly. I wouldn't expect refinement in such eateries. As long as you can look past that, this spot is still alright for quick-bites instead of walking across to other buildings.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115896580386240513862/reviews
Peter Rock Steady,3,Only food outlet in Novena Hospital on the first floor. Aram Masak Merah is average and too salty for my taste. Protein Bowl is not bad.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112735098010851642789/reviews

Wilson Quek,1,"I usually patronize the City Square outlet and have always had a good experience there. However, I visited a different outlet recently and was quite disappointed. The uncle who made the drinks really brought down the standard and quality compared to what I'm used to. He was also loud and rude, and I could tell that many other patrons were equally annoyed by his behavior. This experience has definitely affected my impression of the brand.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110628048778481861182/reviews
