T WP,4,"Waffle with Wild Strawberry

It's newly open and I'm loving it, great fluff waffle with thick creamy ice cream. I've been eating gelare at different locations, glad to see it open at NTU. Will visit it again for their waffle and ice cream.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116063738673256691463/reviews
