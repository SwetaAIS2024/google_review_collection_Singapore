      "text": "If you are visiting Singapore Botanic Gardens by MRT, why not drop by to Farrer Road MRT Station which is just a train stop away? Just a 5 mins walk from the train station lies this unassuming dim sum stall tucked inside Empress Market.\n\nThe tricky thing about visiting this food centre is that many of the stalls either close very early or don’t even open often. If you want to sample other dishes as well, my best bet is to come during the breakfast or early lunch hours.\n\nGiven that the eateries here in Singapore have a knack with naming their stalls with stars, my attention was caught by this interesting stall name whilst roaming the food centre.\n\nThis place offers a wide variety of dim sum which come with wallet-friendly prices. I ordered the homemade Siew Mai and Fan Choy, both which tasted deliciously good.\n\nThis is by far the best budget dim sum place I had eaten in Singapore. I will return again.",

      "text": "Seems #dimsum places have a knack for star in their names. But this #dimsum stall Imo lives up to its name. Give it 7 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nCame here early for their porridge, handmade bao and dim sum. Ordered both types of porridge, minced meat and century egg and silver fish and century egg (very popular and sells out early). Very fragrant, smooth with generous ingredients. $3.50 each.\n\nThey have 4 different special flavours of siew mai and we got a plate of each. Century egg siew mai, beancurd roll siew mai, scallop siew mai and mushroom siew mai. For $2.50 each plate, each siew mai is bigger than the usual you get outside, with generous well marinated fillings.\n\n大包 @$2 and char siew bao @$1.10 are also very good. Hand cooked fillings were generous and very tasty.\n\nFriendly owners. Unfortunately their ccf sold out. Will be back again for their ccf and other dim sum.",

      "text": "The dim sum items are ok. But i think the owner of the stall ( the husband)  is either being forgetful or not being honest. My husband bought an item , gave a $50 bill but the stall owner insisted it was a $5 bill and refused to give the correct amount of change. I was the one who put the $50 bill in his wallet so I know in this instance the wrong is with the stall owner. So guys be careful when you give a big bill to the stall owner.",
