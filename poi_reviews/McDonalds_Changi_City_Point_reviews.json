      "text": "I am writing this letter to express my utmost disappointment and frustration with the abysmal experience I endured at the McDonald's outlet at Changi City Point on January 12, 2025, at approximately 9:10 PM. Calling it \"fast food\" would be an insult to the very concept of speed and customer service.\n\nUpon placing my order, I was left waiting for an excruciating 40 minutes for what should have been a straightforward, quick service. After what felt like an eternity, I approached the counter to politely inquire about the delay, only to be met with dismissiveness from the so-called manager, a young woman with brown hair. Her curt \"just wait\" response reeked of apathy and incompetence.\n\nThe ordeal didn’t end there. My mother, who was suffering from a throbbing headache, had to step into the restaurant to escalate the issue—an act that should never have been necessary. However, instead of providing assistance or showing any semblance of empathy, your staff compounded the situation by displaying the same snobbish, dismissive attitude toward her.\n\nTo add insult to injury, when my mother asked about our order, we discovered that it had vanished from the system! How does this even happen? The staff had to rely on my phone to verify the order, and when it was finally served, the team demonstrated their sheer incompetence yet again by forgetting my drink. If I hadn’t reminded them, I would have left without what I paid for—completing the disaster trifecta.\n\nThis experience was an absolute disgrace to your brand. McDonald’s is synonymous with efficiency, consistency, and customer service—none of which was remotely evident during this debacle. Your staff’s ineptitude and blatant disregard for customer satisfaction left me questioning if this outlet is even worthy of bearing the McDonald’s name.\n\nI am appalled that my mother and I were forced to endure such mistreatment and inefficiency. If this is the standard of service McDonald's deems acceptable, then perhaps it is time to reevaluate your operations and retrain your staff—starting with that manager, whose attitude was as stale as week-old fries.\n\nThis was not just an inconvenience—it was an insult. I demand a formal apology and assurance that corrective measures will be taken to ensure no other customer is subjected to this level of incompetence and disrespect. Failing that, I will not hesitate to share this experience widely, and trust me, I will make sure everyone knows what to expect from McDonald’s Changi City Point—an utter waste of time and money.\n\nYou owe your customers better. Start proving it.",

Maybe want to cater to all age groups, but you know la, we Singaporeans cannot tahan scorching sun, but we can definitely handle spicy well. The more spicy sambal the better. We become stronger after 58 years through herbs & spices #31Jul2023\n\nHello Uncle McDonald's @mcdsg! Wah, I tried the 2023 remake of your Nasi Lemak Burger, and it's not bad, ah! But you know la, we Singaporeans love our spice, so can consider adding more kick to the sambal sauce, ah? Not spicy enough leh! Don't worry, we can handle the spice, but scorching sun, aiyo, we cannot tahan lah! So, the more spicy sambal, the better, you know? After all, we've become stronger over 58 years through all those herbs and spices, right? So, boleh tambah sikit spice in the sambal sauce for all of us to enjoy, ah?
