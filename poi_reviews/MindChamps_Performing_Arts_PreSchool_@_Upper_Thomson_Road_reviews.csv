Shan,5,"Mindchamps @ Tagore has been one of the best decisions I made for my son. While scouting around for a preschool that could accommodate my son's food allergies, MC@Tagore was the best choice and both principal and teachers were so warm, welcoming and formed a high-spirited team. The academic excellence that the school upholds and experiences that the school provides the children with is nothing short of exceptional. Rigour is infused seamlessly into the curriculum! Highly recommend this outlet of Mindchamps where everyone feels like family!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101792034338050935262/reviews

Beyond the Mindchamps brand, curriculum and infrastructure, it is the people that have made the difference.

Myron Pang,5,"My family and I really enjoyed the Family Sports Day organised by the teachers! Although it was only from 9am - 11.30am but there were many activities that both parents and kids could participate in!

Can tell that the school and teachers really put a lot of thought and effort in planning this event for the parents and kids!

Thank you!! ☺️",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111204019427768172927/reviews
