      "text": "We tried Finnwood for the first time because it was at the children’s playground at GBTB. Very surprised the food was delicious! We had the four cheese pizza (really good!! If you love blue cheese, you will love this), chicken thigh burger (the fries were freshly fried so its deliciously crispy, and the chicken thigh was so tender and moist), and the spaghetti bolognese (wasn’t salty and super sweet - so we felt it was okay giving to our toddler and she loved it). We really enjoyed ourselves after a morning of water play. The atmosphere is relaxed and chill. We will definitely return here next time we come by the playground!",
