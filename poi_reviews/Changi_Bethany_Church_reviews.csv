Union Foodpanda,1,"Changi Bethany Church offers a welcoming environment for worship, with a pleasant ambiance and nice architecture. However, during a recent visit for a food delivery, there was a disappointing encounter with some of the worshipers. Despite politely announcing my presence as a food delivery rider, I was ignored, which was quite disheartening.

Furthermore, when the issue arose regarding cutlery not being provided due to the customer not checking the appropriate box when ordering, the response from the church's representative was condescending and sarcastic. This lack of empathy and understanding detracted from an otherwise positive experience.

It's essential for all members of a community, including religious institutions, to treat everyone with respect and courtesy, regardless of their role or profession. Hopefully, Changi Bethany Church can address these issues to ensure a more inclusive and welcoming atmosphere for all visitors in the future.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103759240464878972564/reviews
