JC L,3,"Came with friends for an early weekend dinner, not much of a crowd. Quaint little shop tucked away from the crowd. Unfortunately, the food was very average for the price. The grilled sticks can be skipped in our opinion, nothing special for the price. The beef rice bowl however was decent though a bit on the saltier side with an overpowering black pepper taste (works if you like black pepper).",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111522302134421651292/reviews
Jonathan Goh,4,"Here to celebrate Christmas 2024.
Seating is a small and the place was packed.

The atmosphere is unique and very Japanese.

Tried a variety of food here. The bara chiraishi is good. The sashimi and maki are great too.  The buta buns were served hot and I enjoyed the herbal like taste.

I would skip the skewers if I return though. Didn‚Äôt really get the freshly chargrilled taste I was hoping for. The tiramisu is also a miss as it was very watery.

Overall, spent $201 for the table of food for 5 people.

Service is alright.

Would return for the dons and maki.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110102844324205858222/reviews

Yi Ling,4,"Came here on a Sunday evening for dinner, and food came rather quickly. Price point wise is pretty affordable contrary to other izakayas.

üíß Water is no complimentary.

The skewers came pretty quickly too and we would recommend the mentaiko chicken skewers.

Also ordered a good variety of pastas and the soft shell chilli crab donburi. Portion size was just right for an average eater. Ambience is rather quiet, but I like that 1 small pint was $5.80++ and makes a good gathering spot for dinner.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115707001285123682601/reviews
