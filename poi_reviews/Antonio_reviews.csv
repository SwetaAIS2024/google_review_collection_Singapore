Zheng Kai,5,"âœ…Reasonably priced.
âœ… Big portions for a $6.50 chicken chop.
âœ… Free mayo upon request.

ðŸ’¯ A rare find in 2024, where chicken chop prices in coffeeshops & sadly hawker stalls too are reaching $8-9.

Tasty marinated meat to warrant 4 stars.

Returned here for the 2nd time within the week!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116500114374322213772/reviews

Jun,3,Good promotion during national day. Portion is gd but the fish is orange breaded and not the normal batter. Mushed potato has a nice mushroom sauce. They have mustard sauce for you to put in the plate as well.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107886663772698444350/reviews
Dolma Choe,2,"Ordered the ribeye steak at 15.90 and was asked what level of doneness my preferred steak to be.

I asked for medium rare because that's my go-to. Was asked if I was sure, and I confirmed it.

The item I ended up getting was straight up gamey and rubbery with a slimey feel as I chew.

The freshness of the steak is very clearly not there, which I don't expect since I'm ordering steak at a coffeeshop, but this makes the hygiene of the area questionable to me.

Their sides were alright. I like this place for their pasta and other items, but placing an order for a steak was regrettable.

I ended up taking one bite and throwing everything away. It's inedible.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110926914784319597109/reviews
