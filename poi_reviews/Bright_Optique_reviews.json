      "text": "Not too honest merchant although they didn't lie about it, they simply not telling you the truth about their products & services. Thought that I had a good deal but after the lenses are fixed, they will tell you all the watch-out on such progressive lenses after it has been done & SOLD. If you still insisted going for the product there, make sure you understand the progressive lenses quality range and so forth, most of the optical shop merchant don't usually shared much about why the price range and progressive lenses quality or the various types from cheap cheap ones to most expensive ones which can be many many times the price of the cheap progressive lenses. Please read up some info on progressive lenses and you will know why some optical shops sell them really cheap and when the lenses are ready and you put them on, you will realise that both your eyeballs will go \"shoot bird\" when you need to do reading and you totally cannot wear those spectacles while walking or driving, you will break your back and your eyes. Please check check check and check again. Always remember the shop never lies to you, but they also never tell you the truth. So don't be fooled by sweet talk and good customer service, sometimes these can be deceiving. Please make your own good judgement,. Please remember, if you looking for not so expensive progressive lenses, please ensure you choose spectacles with much smaller frames and with nose studs to adjust the distance between the frame and your face. This is very important if you have chosen the cheapest progressive lenses. Do let me know if you find my feedback useful.",
