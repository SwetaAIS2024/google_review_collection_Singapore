      "text": "I think most people including myself would have eaten countless times of bbq stingray here at East Coast Lagoon Food Village. What about bbq Cod fish? This is my first time eating this after watching the video by Ali Eats. It is indeed amazing like what was shared in the video. The bbq Cod steak is crispy on the outside and super soft and yet firm, and moist on the inside. What is amazing is there is not even the slightest hint of fishiness. It is really enjoyable down to the last bite. I ordered a sambal kang kong (I asked to have it less spicy) to go with the fish. It is the best kang kong in my memory. Usually the kang kong is just spicy but this one has that hint of sweetness and lemongrass aroma. The food here is worth a try to find out for yourself.\n\nUpdate: I have been back here numerous times and in this latest visit, I had their chilli crab and bitter gourd with eggs. Both dishes are executed so perfectly.",

      "text": "A thick slab of stingray with flavourful sambal. While pricier than most of the other shops which start at $12/15/18 in tiers, this only has a single size at $18. They seem to prepare this en-masse at peak hours however â€“ when I ordered, I was given one immediately which wasn't piping hot, indicating it was prepared a while prior. While I appreciate the consideration for speed, I also value hot food! The stingray was great nevertheless, but it would surely have been much better fresh off the grill.",
