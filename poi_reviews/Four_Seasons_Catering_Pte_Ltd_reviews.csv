Beatrice Wong,4,"Had the chance to host my baby's 1yo party with catering from Four Seasons and it was a pleasant experience. Adeline was prompt in her responses and was very friendly throughout.

The salmon was a little cold and drinks portion could be improved so I shared these feedback with Adeline and it was taken in good faith. Generally the food was good and my guests were satisfied.
Good experience thus far!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116453790079153621707/reviews
Tan Jie Ling,5,"Adel assisted with my order ensuring it arrived on time. Food was delicious, and wiped out. I chose Four Seasons because their food looks appetising from their photos, was very presentable - which did not disappoint me on actual day. Very please with this order and will definitely order from them again for other events/celebrations",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101382607054754780175/reviews

Tarence Chin,5,"I found their food through a Google search and was impressed by how delicious it looked and how reasonable the prices were. I ordered for 45 people, and they managed the food portions well—unlike some caterers who give more vegetables and less meat. I received great feedback from my relatives and friends about the tasty food, especially the Nyonya kueh, which was not too sweet. The rendang chicken and grilled salmon were also excellent.

Lastly, I would like to thank their customer service representative, Adel. She was kind and helpful in making my housewarming event a success. Will order again for future events.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101896054602103985849/reviews
Amelia Ramlee,5,"I was looking for buffet catering for a home birthday celebration and came across Four Season’s Celebratory packages. I got in touch with Adel and she was quick with her replies even though they were outside the business hours.

The packages was amazing. It came with a simple but classy decoration and the menu available was extensive and what we chose was delicious! Our guests sang praise for the tastiness and selection of dishes. There was even a Halal cetificate presented for ease of mind.

We are very thankful for the service provided by Adel and the Four Seasons team. We will definitely recommend and engage Four Season again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114719330670784499257/reviews
