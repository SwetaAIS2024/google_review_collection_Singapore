Fish and Chips and Chicken Chop sets are good value for money. Big portion which is good, however it is not outstanding in taste but acceptable. Recommended for meals with friends and family.",

      "text": "Hanis Café & Bakery, located at Eastpoint Mall in Simei, Singapore, is a halal-certified eatery offering a diverse menu that caters to various tastes.  ￼The café provides a selection of Western set meals, pasta dishes, local favorites, and Hainanese specialties such as Chicken Curry and Chicken Stew.  ￼\n\nGenerous portions, making it a suitable spot for casual dining. For instance, the breakfast set with scrambled eggs are nice, complemented by friendly service. Food taste is average. We tried Fish and Chips, chicken fried rice which is our most favourite from Hanis. Other items on menu are average in taste. I feel price have increased significantly at Hanis.\n\nHanis Bakery at Eastpoint Mall has a variety of baked goods cakes pastries and puffs. While some menu items are average, the overall dining experience is positive.",

My hubby's mushroom sauce for chicken chop definitely doesn't taste like mushroom sauce.",

As the chairs can be moved easily and be placed with pram or wheel chairs of course near entrance. Variety of choices and economically,  price friendly. Ordered beef stew with generous 4 chunks of tendered beef and tender here is you can easily cut the meat by pressing a spoon on top. Even some briyani beef isn't this tender.",
