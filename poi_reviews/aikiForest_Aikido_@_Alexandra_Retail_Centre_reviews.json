Teacher Marina and her fellow teacher have been guiding my children in transitioning from affiliated preschool where they experienced their first lesson to moving to Alexandra branch after graduated. Small class ratio so everyone can learn from the best. Would highly recommend to parents who are interested in sending their children for Aikido",
