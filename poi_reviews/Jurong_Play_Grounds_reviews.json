Situated just opposite IMM building & near Ng Teng Fong Hospital. it is very convenient to take public transport. If driving, the carpark is quite small but can always park at IMM when full.",

My children like to go and see when they have markets but dunno why these few months don't have..  Good to see more families and children around.. also brighter at night, feel safer when walking home from IMM",
