Chloe Tan,5,"Used Eatigo and it was a good deal (for the mains), though our other sides (drinks + kufi) ended up costing almost as much as the mains 😂

Ordered the very typical butter chicken and palak paneer, mutton biryanis and naan basket. Ordered pani purri also and mango lassi. Everything tasted as it should though somehow I feel like there’s an additional herb/spice they put in the biryani that I’m not a huge fan of.

Atmosphere was very quiet though, besides one other table, it was just us. Place is bit stuffy too air con wise but nonetheless, wouldn’t mind coming back with Eatigo.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101523126753728406369/reviews
Fatema HS,3,"Very average place to dine out..The ambience is quite okay..They need to work on the cleanliness of the place..The service was quick though. We had butter chicken-2.5/5, chilling chicken-4/5, chicken Achari -3/5.. Rogan Josh- 3.5/5(didn't like the quality of mutton). The naans we good...",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113870925852700827790/reviews
Minhal Hassan,5,"Food was tasty and spicy ( as the name suggested). We ordered hot and sour soup, black pepper chicken, chicken tikka biryani, french fries, plain naan, cheese naan, lime soda and lime aloevera soda. All the food was delicious and portion size were reasonable. We were also served complimentary papadums. Service was a bit slow and we were served extra papadums and red ribena drink too. Keep up the good work 😊👍👏",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105353298106433302728/reviews
EK Koh,5,"Had Mutton & Chicken Vindoloo.
The curry was great and portion is good enough to share for 3 pax.

Palak paneer could be improved.
But overall had a great dinner here.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106391592816745461461/reviews
