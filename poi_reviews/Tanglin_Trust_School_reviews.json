Makes me wonder how the school educates their students and if they really deserves the trust given by parents and guardians.",

      "text": "Omg! The staff of the school sucks and feels so entitled! It's all over the internet! Anyhow press emergency button of the smrt train , never use brain to let the whole group of 15-20 alright at various exits , instead taking own sweet time to alight at a single door, üò±, when the smrt door closed, have the audacity to press emergency button thinking that it's customer service! So what if the child's father is separated from the child, the staff is incompetent to take care of the child, bring the remaining people to alight at the next stop to return back to the lakeside station. This action reflects on the school badly, school might even receive a fine from SMRT for wrongly using their emergency button causing inconvenience to public. Cannot imagine how the staff can teach the children in this schoo when their staff cannot even think straight . Choose schools wisely",
