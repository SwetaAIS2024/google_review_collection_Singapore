Wallace was incredibly responsive and friendly, making sure all my questions were answered and that I felt confident before confirming the rental. The vehicle was in great condition—clean, well-maintained, and exactly as described.\n\nWhat really stood out was Wallace's attention to detail and genuine care for his customers. I wouldn’t hesitate to rent from him again and highly recommend his service to anyone looking for a reliable and pleasant car rental experience.\n\nThanks again, Wallace! Will definitely be back!",

There can be no poorer service and the company's unethical practice of withholding rental deposits for many months really is not encouraging customers to ever return.",
