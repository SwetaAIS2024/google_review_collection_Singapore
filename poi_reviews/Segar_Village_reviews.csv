Mamat Insanis,1,"I put my things on the table Infront of the stall and order food from other stall to dine in but 1 of the staff purposely sit there when I went to order food..as if purposely showing that the table belongs to the stall for them to sit when it doesn't belong to them..I understand that when there's no customer, staff prefer to sit at the table Infront of the stall as it's near as I work in a stall too but if there customer who wants to sit there, it should be given priority to customer... This is unacceptable and very rude...the staff in the one I showed in the picture

Nasrisya Hani Ahmad Lutfi,3,"I would wish the service was better, and that the waitress was more attentive to us. They had no other customer so we could've gotten better service. Informing us the night's price for the seafood, since the price is per kg and changes every day. Food was not so special, just that the crab was big and filled us up really well. Total came up to be $196 for 2 pieces of 800g of crab ($136), soup, sambal kangkong $8, 6 pieces of mantou, 2 bowls of plain white rice ... one canned drink, jasmine chinese tea and coffee.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113554365284169308359/reviews
Co Ong,5,"Super fresh and yummy seafood. Never a seafood person but seriously I'm sold ! Love the Thai fish  which was very appetising and the prawn paste chicken is so crispy. Salted egg yolk sotong is nice, so is the butter prawn. Chili crab needless to say ! And sour sop drink which I rarely see anywhere serving üòç Will be back for more seafoooood üíì",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108279315545543944657/reviews
Ezee Sharil,5,"Delicious local Singaporean favourite Zichar dishes!. Affordable and a lot of choices so you can keep coming back to try different dishes and combination of dishes. Perfect for dine in as there are other stalls here so you can mix and match different cuisines.

Most of all they are a Muslim-Owned Establishment. They are Halal!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103925746266505310436/reviews
Wayne Koh,5,"Another hidden gem  in the Eastern part of Singapore. We ordered the Hokkien Mee, 3egg+spinach soup, grilled sotong. All the dishes are delicious and homemade style, not overly oily/ salty. The must-try dish is the grilled sotong. It's not listed on the menu, you need to ask for it. The sambal chilli served with the grilled sotong elevates the slightly charred taste to another level.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113949799122977019750/reviews
