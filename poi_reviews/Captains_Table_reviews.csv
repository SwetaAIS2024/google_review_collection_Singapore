Melvin J.,5,"Captain's Table is a great place to eat! We had the deep-fried crispy chicken ($20), stir-fried green string beans with XO sauce ($18), sweet and sour pork ($24), and homemade tofu (around $19). The food was really tasty, and the green string beans were the best—highly recommended! We went for dinner and enjoyed a beautiful sunset view. Great food, lovely atmosphere, and worth a visit!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110204106470894976302/reviews

Teck Chye Yeo,5,"I've never tried this place before. Drove over during lunch to take photos at the Marina, and chanced upon it upstairs.
First off, I love sweet and sour pork. I almost never eat anything Chinese outside without this dish, so here I was alone, so what better than this and white rice for lunch?
I told the nice lady manager to make mine crispy, to which she replied, theirs is excellently crisp, and anymore crispy would make it dry and hard. Good suggestion, and I went along with it.

The sweet and sour pork here is hands down, one of the best I've eaten on the island. Globular crispy bits coat every meat morsel, and with each bite, this gives way to juicy, tender meat underneath! Even with the pork pieces fully covered with their delectably tangy and sweet sauce, the meat remained crisp to every bite, all the way to the end of the meal too!

I'm impressed, with the food and the very attentive service. The lady manager even came back to me after I got my meal if the dish met my crispy expectations, and I gave her a big smile, a yes and a thumbs up!

Recently, my wife and I celebrated our 30th Wedding Anniversary there and coupled with a fiery sunset out the window, it was food for the eyes as well as our tummies!

Well! Burp! It was good, and I'm full! It wasn't cheap, but as Dad would always say, 'If it's Good, it ain't cheap, and if it's cheap, it ain't good'. I guess that held true here today:)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105156983866258826466/reviews
