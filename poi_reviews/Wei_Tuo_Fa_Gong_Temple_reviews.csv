Ayush Basu,4,"The Wei Tuo Fa Gong temple is in the vicinity of Bukit Puaka and approximately 2km from the Pulau Ubin jetty. It houses shrines dedicated to several Buddhas (it appears to be a Tibetan school of Buddhism) and also Hindu deities. A chief character here is the Kshitigarbha Boddhisatva, known for his vow to not achieve enlightenment until all living beings are rescued from hell.

This place has a tranquil and rustic appeal.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111959044965723437057/reviews
