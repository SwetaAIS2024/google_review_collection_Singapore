Super friendly doctor and it’s always comforting to get treated by him, knowing that there’s a high chance that it will be cured.\n\nWe only trust him the most around Jurong. Highly recommend to come. It’s not about the cost. It’s about your health and getting it treated. He’s very experienced.",

Before him i been to 3 other clinic for my illness but most of them just listen to my symptoms and address accordingly. However Dr Chew really check for my condition and advice me on how to heal fast.He also encourage me to be positive to aid in the healing. The price was a bit steep but if I can recover I have no complains.",

But doctor wasnt in till 945.\n\n3) I have been here before for my husband's hand infection and it dint get better but we paid almost $200.\n\nDont bother going to them. When someone is sick, we dont ask to be sick. To be so rude about it, its not needed. The receptionist is suppose to be more understanding. No one wants to pay 100s over and still be treated as such.\n\nA no go for me and my family ❌",
