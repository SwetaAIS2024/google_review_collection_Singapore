      "text": "The \"O\" Level Biology Topical Ten Year series was sold out at my son's bookshop and he needed it urgently for his term 2 test revision. I contacted SL Publisher by chat in the evening and was given the assurance that they could deliver the book to me by the next day. Not only was the staff friendly and efficient, they kept their promise and delivered the book the next day by noon, and at a discount off retail price with a free revision notes book! I am pleasantly surprised with the great customer service as SL is more of a publisher than a book e-retailer. I am truly grateful for the speedy delivery - thank you Shing Lee :)",

      "text": "I would like to special thanks SL Publishers team who had help me to allocate the sold out O Level Maths (Yearly) 2013-2022 and expedite the delivery to me yesterday.  Someone had recommended me to get this book and two more Sc books for O level revision.  Consider this is a very last minute purchase as O level exam already started, so i trying my best to grab these books for my daughters on Tue late night.  SL Publishers staff even don't mind to chat online with me when i can't find that book and promise me, he/she will check for me on the next day. Wed early morning 7am plus i got the message that they manage to allocate the book for me. As i told them i need it urgently, they did a special arrangement to get their inhouse deliveryman to deliver the books to me on wed afternoon.\nI am really appreciate for this special help.  As they are not a e-commerce seller, so i am really impress by their fast and prompt responds and delivery.  Good Job, SL Publishers. Keep it Up. Thank you very much.",

Even worse, the answers given do not have any steps attached, and once you are stuck with a problem, you can never learn from your mistakes. Do yourselves a favour and purchase a textbook of a different brand",
