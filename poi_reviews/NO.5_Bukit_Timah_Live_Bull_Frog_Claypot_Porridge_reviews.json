Despite ordering total of 10 frogs with 2 pot or porridge for a family with two little girls, she was pushing us very hard to order additional veg dish despite our rejection. She even told us she need to meet her target to sell veg dishes to customers....\nCome on.. even if you like to make more sales, you must also consider if your customers are able to finish the food right?",
