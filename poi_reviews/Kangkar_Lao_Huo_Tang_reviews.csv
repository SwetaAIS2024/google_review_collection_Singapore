Jacob TAN,4,"Bought a container of pig stomach with ginkgo nut soup for $6.60. The pig stomach is boiled long enough for it to be soft and tender. Soup is flavourful with nice peppery taste. Has also a tinge of herbal taste. Not much ginkgo nuts in the soup.
Service is quick.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
Mark Ong,3,"Hit and misses for their soup . Overall a decent soup shop. Try their signature and not exotic variety to be on the safe side. Lotus roots soup is authentic . Soup pack a punch of favour. Pig tail soup on the other hand was generous in the portion of meat but lacks favour, a little watered down. Try their pumpkin rice , very decent mouthful of goodness.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117348003086836979353/reviews

Emmanu Elle,2,Boss of this kangkar mall lao huo tang is nice and humble. Hope the boss take note of this found a cockroach in my oyster sauce vegetables. Really ruined my appetite today. Your team need to be trained again in food hygiene. Soup tasted inconsistent. Hope can be improved. Will still patronize again as this is my favourite stall. Hope improvement can be made.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103497194549480287940/reviews
