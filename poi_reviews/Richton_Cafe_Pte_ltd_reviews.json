      "text": "Richton Caf√© is a hidden gem conveniently located below an HDB block in Pasir Ris, making it a great spot for a quick and satisfying lunch fix. The caf√© offers an impressive variety of affordable and reasonably priced dishes, catering to different cravings. Whether you‚Äôre in the mood for Mee Goreng, Chicken Cutlet Rice, Hongkong Mee, Hor Fun, Mui Fun, Popcorn Chicken, Yong Tau Foo, Fried Bee Hoon, or Kway Teow, there‚Äôs always something to choose from.\n\nOne of the highlights of this caf√© is its indoor air-conditioned dining area, which provides a comfortable escape from the heat. However, seating is quite limited, especially during weekday lunch hours, so it‚Äôs best to come early or be prepared for a short wait. Despite the crowd, the service is efficient, and orders are usually prepared quite fast, making it a convenient option for those on a tight schedule.\n\nA standout for me is their sambal chili‚Äîflavorful with just the right amount of spice, enhancing many of their dishes perfectly. It‚Äôs the kind of place that serves no-frills, hearty meals, ideal for a casual and fuss-free lunch.\n\nIf you‚Äôre in the Pasir Ris area and looking for a budget-friendly, tasty, and quick meal, Richton Caf√© is definitely worth a visit!\n\n*However do note that there is no toilet üöæ there but there is hand-wash basin at the side.",

Dining tables were limited, abt 7 tables, but theres an atmosphere of neighbourly friendliness as most of the customers seem to be residents from the surrounding flats who seem familiar with d aunties serving here.\n\nWe tried their Hokkien Mee & Seafood Horfun, and wow, its delicious and the serving is Generous too! Took a while for me to finish mine! See foto attached.\n\nWe would definitely come back again to try their nasi lemak! Thankfully a friendly neighbourhood cafe serving good food with affordable prices! üëçü§óüí™üôè",

Worst part is when I asked for more chili after waiting so long the guy just gave me the worst look ever as if I‚Äôm asking for a lot. Just rude! Been coming here to eat and breakfast over the years but service is something needs to be worked on. Coming to work with a god damn smile isn‚Äôt too hard to be honest\n\nOn a positive note. Their economic noodles is one of the best",
