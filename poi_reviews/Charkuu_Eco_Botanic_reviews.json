      "text": "I tried the Strawberry Mochi drink here, it‚Äôs so good! The strawberry yogurt part is creamy and just the right amount of sweet, that‚Äôs super refreshing. But the best part? The mochi! Those little chewy pieces mixed in make every sip fun and satisfying. It‚Äôs like a dessert and a drink in one, and the combo just works.\nThey‚Äôve got these cool camping chairs and tables outside, so you can just kick back, relax, and enjoy your drink like you‚Äôre on a mini getaway. Super chill spot for hanging out , 10/10 would recommend!",

Tried the Jasmine Coffee, Ceylon Black Milk Tea, snow ice, and black sesame walnut dessert. Everything was well-balanced and not overly sweet. A great place to unwind after a meal. Will definitely return to try more!",

This is the best place to go!\n\nMy favourite roasted oolong milk tea bingsu in JB.\n\nBest part is the bingsu last for very long in room temperature. Usually ordered bingsu in other stores have to finish it in a short period of time. At this shop you can slowly enjoy it and chilling with your loved one.\n\nStrongly recommended bingsu!",
