I bought the tickets online for the time slot and it's highly recommended to buy them early as they get booked days in advance, especially for peak hours. The SkyPark is brilliant and offers fantastic views over the bay area of the city and the sea. There are places where you can also have a drink which you can also include in the ticket.\n\nThere was a delay in getting in due to bad weather mid-afternoon which is acceptable and the queues were long but managed properly at ground level so I managed to get in within 30mins, so kudos to ground level staff for managing this. However on the way back to the lifts, it was complete chaos with group visitors queue jumping and disregarding everyone who were observing a queue. None of the staff intervened in bringing order which was poor.\n\nOverall a good experience but might benefit solo visitors if group visitors can be put in to a separate queue."", 'languageCode': 'en'}","{'text': ""I visited the SkyPark at Marina Bay Sands yesterday and it was good.
