There were dried rice and hair balls on the carpet. Bathrooms need hard scrubbing to remove the molds on the crevices. Not worthy for the price.",

When I went and complained the reception person didn't even apologize but gave me another key. When I opened the room a woman walked out and the management said she was a staff but didn't look like it. Other than a stellar location I will not encourage anyone to stay here. There are other brands such as value and hotel 81 which are 3 stars but great value for money.",
