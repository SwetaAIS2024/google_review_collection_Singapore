Daniel Bok,4,Came here to purchase a present for our friend’s baby. The staff were very friendly in helping us find a good toy present. I would say you could find a range of products for children between 1-10 years old (older kids might be too digitalized to be interested).,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114835379352368094009/reviews

Elodie L.,5,I would like to share a very positive review. The Better Toy Store reacted amazingly well to a problem with a toy we bought from them for Christmas. They answer our concerns within minutes and arranged for pick up of the damaged toy and delivery of a new one at our home the day right after Christmas. Excellent selection of toys there and fantastic customer service staff !,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117096027154135634088/reviews
