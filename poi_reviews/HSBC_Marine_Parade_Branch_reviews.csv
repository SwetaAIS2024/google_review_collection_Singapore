Andrew Foo,1,"Extremely slow service. On a weekday afternoon, only 2 service staff on counter duty. Took almost an hour to complete my transaction, which is to close my accounts, including waiting time. This is despite being on premier banking queue.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115222696615969519686/reviews
Badrun Zulkafri,5,Went to hsbc parkway parade and The people that i encountered was so friendly and polite. Was served by Staff Ella and she was professional and friendly too. Settled my issues in a few hours. The staff at the front desk was so professional in helping me to get my queue number online and explaining the steps without looking at any phone. So competent. I had a great experience todayüëçüèª‚≠êÔ∏è,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100170374600980620033/reviews
Alan Koh,5,"I had one of the worst experiences with HSBC earlier when I went down to the Plaza Singapura branch, only to find it closed. The branch manager didn‚Äôt even bother to update their Google Maps listing, resulting in a wasted trip.

Frustrated, I headed to the Marine Parade branch to complete my transaction. There, I was assisted by Flynn from counter services. I could tell she was extremely overwhelmed, as the queue was growing rapidly, with an average wait time of over 30 minutes. Only two counters were open due to lunch hour and ongoing renovations.

Despite being visibly swamped, Flynn maintained her composure. She greeted me and every customer with a warm smile and processed each transaction as efficiently as possible. Her professionalism, patience, and dedication to customer service stood out to me. Even under pressure, she remained courteous and attentive, ensuring that every customer received the best possible service.

It‚Äôs rare to come across frontline staff who uphold such a high standard of service despite challenging circumstances. I truly appreciate her efforts and believe that employees like her deserve recognition. HSBC should take note and ensure that staff like Flynn are supported adequately to continue delivering excellent service.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113014723209430392166/reviews
Chen Mdm,1,"Counter service closes way too early at 3:30pm. So ridiculous and inconvenient! Queue system like many reviewers here -- is painfully slow. No wonder they are losing customers. And the Bank itself doesn't appear busy as not many customers but the staff are forever rushing and glued to their HP or PC.

You get much better service and efficiency at other banks like OCBC or RHB located in the same building.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113041661994132178703/reviews
