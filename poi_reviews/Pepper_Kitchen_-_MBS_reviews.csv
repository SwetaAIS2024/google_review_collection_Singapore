Cheong Loong,4,"This outlet is one of my favourite as the food cooked is one of the best. The hotplate serving the dish is usually pipping hot, which cooks the meat well.  The portion is generally good in size for a filling meal. For beef, one can add on the portion one desires n pay for it. Served with 2 side dishes, the menu combination is a delight.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112459856645138785571/reviews
jayjaytruviews,4,"Great food found in Marina Bay Sand’s Pepper Kirchen, Singapore! The rice is cooked perfectly and their food is quite mouth watering as it sizzles on the hot plate.

They serve a wide range of hot plate dishes - all freshly prepared in front of you! The line can get long but it moves fast and you won’t be waiting too long.

They are generous with their portions and their side condiments and sauces complements their dishes very well!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107406779507889233689/reviews

OMG the best steak

I ordered the limited time raw rib eye steak cut(160g) with two extra eggs. I also asked for side of raw sliced beef. Served raw, cooking on a super hot sizzling iron plate with scoop of mashed potato, previously “frozen” corn kernels, the meat was perfectly seared on one side and you are supposed to flip meat and let it cook to your liking.  The best cut of meat melted deliciously in my mouth.
The rib eye steak 5/5 had a bit of flavorful butter on it it was one of the best steaks in my life
The regular sliced beef was only ok. 3.5/5
Mashed potato was creamy and nice 4/5
Corn was standard 3/5 nothing special good enough
Eggs were done well crispy underside sunny side up 5/5

It came with a bowl of rice on side.
I didn’t care for the two side sauces(soy garlic and sweet brown) 1/5) don’t spoil you beautiful meat with these below par sauces.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105345469072974394760/reviews

Logan Chiam,4,Tasty And Affordable!  I love that meals are served on a sizzling hot plate.  Their meats are tender and portion is good enough for the price you ar paying.  Sides are tasty too!  I like their mashed potato and sweet corn.  Waiting for your order could take a bit of time and for some reason you have to queue while waiting for your order.  Maybe they can use a buzzer system like what most food courts do.  Service is what you’d expect on a food court in Singapore.  This court is filled with tourists although there’s a ton of seats it can be a struggle to find one.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107382594263605332876/reviews
