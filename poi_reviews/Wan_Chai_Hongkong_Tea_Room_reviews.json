      "text": "I came after 3pm and craving for wanton noodle. I pop into the Wanchai Hong Kong tearoom. Ordered 1 dry noodle and 1 soup noodle. The broth is naturally sweet but not flavourful. The dark colour broth can be deceivingly looking appetising. Noodle is springy and cooked al dente, and wanton is plump with a piece of medium-sized whole prawn, lack juiciness though. Both dry and soupversions ares equally savoury enough. There is  no need for further condiments except some preserved green cut chillies. The coffee is good, but the yuan yang a bit diluted to our taste. The kaya toast is average, not toasty enough, and bread is chewy. Overall, the food could have served even warmer/hotter to uplift the diner appetite. There are many food choices in IMM. You may want to browse through before deciding if you want to try at this tearoom.",

Their chicken wings are tasty when served hot.\n\nGot the HK Milk Tea and Yuan Yang. Yuan Yang is better suited for breakfast hours if you‚Äôre caffeine sensitive üòÖ Milk tea was nice. Bolo bun went nicely with the drinks.\n\nTried their fried rice, it‚Äôs filling but too salty for my liking. The fried rice comes with ABC soup.\n\nThe mango pomelo dessert was not bad.

Ingredients were fresh, hor fun not too salty! Everything for this dish was just right I LOVED IT. The chef deserves a raise! I had to order one without meat, and was pleasantly surprised to see that more vegetables were added without me asking.

This three-piece har cheong gai [a.k.a. prawn paste chicken] are very yummy! üòã\nThey are fried perfectly with an ultra-crispy texture; and give an intense, distinct fragrant and flavour when I sink my teeth into the chunky wings.
