She only started making the drink when my food was cooked, was unapologetic, and caused me to be late. Then I found out it's 0 sugar although I asked for my usual less-sweet. It didn't even have the usual sticker on it. Can tell she didn't care what was ordered and just winged it. This staff is not doing her work properly, will avoid store if she's on duty.",

But I was informed the grape series will only be back end April. Then what is the point of selling the voucher? Just to earn money but your customers do not get what they purchased the voucher for. End up I gotta drink some random milk tea. I think it is wrong for a business to sell Shopee vouchers for a drink that is OOS for a month. By the time the drink is back in stock, the Shopee voucher would have already expired.",
