MNG,5,"A new outpost to its sibling stall on the other side of Bukit Batok with its offerings being almost similar.

The nasi was fragrant of coconut milk, which was almost lemak (rich).

Omelette was customary while its chicken wing was crisp and fresh.

The signature sambal was slightly sweet and piquant which complemented the dish.

Almost no queue compared to the other stall which can be unbearable during peak period.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews
Peach Mint,5,"Affordable and tasty nasi lemak to get in the west area. The sambal chilli was so so good ,the rice is just yummy.My whole family loves the nasi lemak here.
There is one in bukit batok west block 413 ,where u cant even ask for additional chilli or chicken eventhough u would pay for it. Same shop name (not sure if both is the same owner) but different area. Bukit batok 217 was a great one , but the bukit batok 413 was not that good.
Overall, the rice , the sambal.. all taste really well..The staff was also friendly too .",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112428196440653463189/reviews
