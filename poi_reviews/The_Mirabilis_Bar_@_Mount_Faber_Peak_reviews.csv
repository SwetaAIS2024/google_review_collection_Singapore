Bing Xuan Ho,5,"Glad to find this bar newly opened in Apr 2025. To visit the bar, you would have to go through the Dusk restaurant.

It is the best bar for me in Singapore.

Love talking to Anton. He enthusiastically introduces the cocktails you order before AND after it is served. Since he is the one that came up with the recipes, he can tell you all about the stories behind them.

The cocktails were made with passion. I wouldn't say they are fancy, but no doubt they are legit, not overly sweetened or diluted, just they way you would have made it for yourself.

Cocktail is around $20 per glass, which is also significantly lower than other in the town. Being open air could be a drawback to some, but it is perfect for me.

100% will visit again. Hope we all can support such a passionately run bar in Singapore.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106843166756572594425/reviews

Kavan Lio,5,"Very friendly staff and the cocktail is divine!

The luscious purple Mirabilis cocktail brings a blossoming bouquet of lavender to the palate at every sip!

Its Espino is a delicious blend of Brass Lion‚Äôs hawthorn gin and exquisite vermouths!  Rich, with a tint of the hawthorn flavour!  Have a beautiful finish with its cherry on the side.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100687793376915797767/reviews
Lui Grace,5,"World Class Cocktail Festival at The Mirabilis Bar ‚Äì @gorneff‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat If‚Äù Series

Stepping into The Mirabilis Bar for the World Class Cocktail Festival felt like entering an alternate universe of imagination and mastery.

Anton‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhat If‚Äù menu dares to ask bold questions ‚Äî and answers them with drinks that are as balanced as they are inventive.

Here are the first three that truly captured the spirit of the challenge:

1. Tailored & Fashioned
What if... Old Fashioned was created in London?
A fusion of Old Fashioned and Martini ‚Äî elegant, composed, and gin-forward. Tanqueray No. Ten shines, with grapefruit syrup and rosemary bitters enhancing its citrus and herbals. A clean, classy sip for both Martini lovers and Old Fashioned purists.

2. Don Sazerac
What if... Louisiana was a Mexican State?
Smoky, complex, and captivating. Don Julio Reposado meets smoked agave nectar, vanilla bitters, and anise salt, crowned with ‚ÄúNew Orleans Air‚Äù ‚Äî a Sazerac in foam form. Bold and delicious. My top pick of the night.

3. The Dove
What if... Scots Celebrated the Day of the Dead?
A Paloma twist that transforms Johnnie Walker Black Label. With triple citrus cordial, peated tea soda, and a grapefruit salt rim ‚Äî it‚Äôs vibrant, layered, and turns skeptics into believers.

Each cocktail was a chapter ‚Äî reimagined and artfully refined. Hats off to Anton for a cohesive and clever menu.¬π",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107735494311771600311/reviews
Tina Ho,5,"Location of Mirabilis means you will get lovely views of the sunset while enjoying unique cocktails. Anton passionately explained the inspiration of the bar and the cocktails he created. David (one of the servers) was very friendly and spent some time chatting with us. It‚Äôs a girls night out for me but it is definitely a romantic venue you can bring your dates üòç oh and I found out that if you make a reservation for a weekday, you get a complimentary cable car ride up to Mount Faber from Harbourfront Centre! So cool!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116670053240655293073/reviews
