RUI TONG LIM,5,"I had a pleasant dental cleaning experience with Dr. Sean Lee recently. As someone who has always been apprehensive about dental visits due to a fear of pain, I was especially relieved by the professional care I received.

Dr. Sean Lee was incredibly understanding of my concerns. He explained each step clearly and made sure I was comfortable throughout. I was impressed by his gentle approach, which made the entire experience far less stressful than I anticipated. The use of numbing agents ensured I didnâ€™t feel any pain, which was a major relief.

I highly recommend Dr. Sean Lee for anyone who shares similar anxieties.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112269817954031932314/reviews
Xiaomei Tan,2,"Two weeks ago, I went to Raffles Dental to get a replacement for my retainer and picked it up a week later. However, the retainer never fit properly. The orthodontist who helped me put it on didnâ€™t give me any time to check the fit or test it by biting down.

After wearing it for two nights, I realized it was uncomfortable and not fitting right, so I called back to ask for help. Unfortunately, Raffles Dental informed me that I would be charged againâ€”as if I were a new patient. Disappointed, I ended up contacting my original orthodontist in California and asked them to ship me a new set instead.

The cost at Raffles Dental wasn't cheap. I paid S$500 for the retainer, which included consumables and two visits.
In the end, I see that S$500 as expensive tuition for a hard lesson learned.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106219380496967829964/reviews

Ivan Tan,2,"Good dentists but experience really spoilt by very poor customer service. Appointment at 8.30am but no one is at the counter. Previously, I had problems changing an appointment as no one was picking up the phone. I later found out that the staff put the phones on silent. ðŸ™„",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110612261223822694355/reviews
