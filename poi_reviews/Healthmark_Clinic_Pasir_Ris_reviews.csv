Linda Chan,1,"I am extremely disappointed with the clinic's lack of communication regarding their holiday hours. Despite the website stating that they are open, the clinic is actually closed from December 14th to 28th. As a result, I was unable to deposit specimens as needed.

I find it irresponsible that the clinic did not update their website to reflect their holiday hours, causing inconvenience to patients like myself. I hope that the clinic will take steps to improve their communication and avoid similar situations in the future.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101928971241851748161/reviews
J Gee,5,"Our family go-to doctor despite us residing at Punggol. Dr Wong is friendly and very thorough in diagnosis. Clinic staffs are also friendly and courteous. We like the appointment system which guarantees a slot, but it’s important to note that due to the physician’s thorough consultations backlogs may inevitably occur at times. We appreciate his professionalism and opt to exercise patience. Walk-ins or those expecting on-time consultations at exact appointment time may experience disappointment.

Highly recommend.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113414094696509317750/reviews
Lecia Lim,1,"The appointment booking system would be more effective if it adhered to scheduled times. Despite arriving five minutes early for my appointment, I was informed that there were still five people ahead of me. Unfortunately, I ended up waiting 1h past my scheduled time to see the doctor. Implementing an online waiting time tracker would greatly improve the situation, allowing patients to check how many people are ahead of them before arriving at the clinic. This would help manage crowd flow and reduce wait times for patients.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106062126364720878794/reviews
Sheila Lee,1,"Went to the place at 9am. Receptionist told me that it’s fully booked? There’s only like 2 people inside waiting and 2 people outside waiting. I tried calling them a few times before heading there but there’s no answer. I told her that my baby is Covid positive as they have swab for children ( not many clinics has swabs for children age 0-6 years old) Receptionist brushed me off and say everyone here is Covid leh.. waste of my time. Took my time to travel and get there. don’t bother walking in, since they can’t accept walk in patients.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112076981384532680467/reviews
