Huai Yang Lim,3,Food quality has dropped together with portion size over the years. Drink cup size also became smaller and very diluted. But overall prize still on the more affordable side. I guess you can say value for money.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108598774904863520186/reviews
C,4,"Fusion Spoon is a casual self-service restaurant in Singapore that feels like a high-end food court, offering a wide variety of local and international dishes in a bright, relaxed setting. The space is especially pleasant, with lots of natural light from its glass façade and a comfortable, unhurried vibe — and it wasn’t crowded during my visit.

I had the Nasi Lemak Chicken Burger from the Chef Mel Dean collaboration menu, which was interesting and enjoyable, though the fries were fairly average. Do note that this isn’t food court pricing — my meal came in at over $20. Still, for the setting and variety, I’d rate it a solid 4 out of 5.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
Han Yu Tan,4,"I got the chicken ham baked rice and it’s really good. It comes in a nice pan, quite filling portion size. The rice is separated well, not too dry, with some tomato sauce giving it a slight sourness. The veggies and ham provides a good variety of flavours, the cheese is very well baked, some having a crust while not burnt. Overall very decent food, just that it is slightly bland, but very simple and quite affordable.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110231907823839530082/reviews
BABY GERM,1,"I’m sorry, but I have to give this place a one-star rating.

I ordered the Nasi Lemak with deep-fried chicken ($8.80) and the Aglio Olio with turkey bacon and mushroom ($8.50). Unfortunately, the experience was disappointing.

The Nasi Lemak rice was dry, and the fried chicken portion was small and underwhelming. The only redeeming elements were the cucumber slice and ikan bilis.

As for the Aglio Olio, it was also dry, with a small portion size that didn’t justify the price.

Overall, it’s definitely not worth the trip for these dishes.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112868994757778796482/reviews
Vittoria,3,"Food taste is bland. All self services, from order, collection to plate return. Good to have air conditioning after hot sun bath.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102722992549421780935/reviews
