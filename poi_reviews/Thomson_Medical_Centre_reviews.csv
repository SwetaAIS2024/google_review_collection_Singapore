Nicholas Ang,5,"Very informative hospital tour where they brought us to the rooms and explained in depth the entire delivery process including admission. Grace was very patient with answering all questions and she was experienced and well-equipped. Very nice polite lady who shares her experiences with us.

Would be nice if we could also see into the nursery where the babies are",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116722485326341025982/reviews
Edmund Lim,5,"Thankful for attending Thomson Medical Centre Maternity Hospital Tour outside of their group tour timings, as liaised with Sister Angie.

Jacelyn Phang,5,Great hospital tour by Grace. Shared a lot of helpful information. The tour took more than 75 mins but was advertised as a 45 mins tour. So mummies need to cater more time if you are going for this.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109192125347334480085/reviews
Timothy Wong,5,"We had such a great experience with Sister Angie during our hospital tour at Thomson Medical. From the moment we met her, she was incredibly warm, kind, and reassuringâ€”exactly the kind of person youâ€™d hope to meet during this stage of the journey.

She took the time to walk us through everything clearly, patiently answered all our questions, and even shared thoughtful tips that showed how much she truly cares. You can tell she genuinely loves what she does, and that made all the difference.

We left feeling so much more prepared and at peace, and a big part of that is thanks to Sister Angie. She really went above and beyond, and weâ€™re so grateful for her!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105979680492403178426/reviews
Lim Kenny,5,"Nurse Angie gives a very detailed explanation on the whole package and process.
Grateful for her years of experience to even share outside textbook knowledge.
She is also willing to extend her help at all times when ever we need help.
We learnt a lot and enjoy her tour.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105600253700219705463/reviews
