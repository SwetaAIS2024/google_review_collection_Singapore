Skye Cai,4,"Simple dishes such as fried rice, goreng and fried mee available.
The Tom yum taste okay, with the seafood.
Inside has small octopus, mussels and prawns. Reasonable for the price.
The fried rice is okay with the omelette on top. Omelette is a little oily, but not for the rice.
The milk tea even less sugar but also super sweet.
Servicing speed quite slow.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
