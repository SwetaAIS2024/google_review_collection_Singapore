Samuel Lam,5,"The best Bak Chor Mee at Bukit Timah- Farrer area and some say one of the best in our little red dot!

The boss cooks with passion and is ever so generous in his portions.

CW T,5,Delicious bowl of fishball noodles. The noodles were cooked to the perfect texture and did not have any alkaline taste.
