And a 7 minute walk to the Chinatown train station.\nThe room amongst 12 people isn't the biggest, or roomiest but livable. This place is really just so you can have a roof over your head at night, but beds are sturdy and comfy!\nNot much socializing or anything to do at this hostel.",

Anyway, there are tables and chairs for guests to chill despite it's quite a small hostel.",
