Daniel Wong,4,"The Southern chicken burger was delicious. The chicken was tender and juicy. The cheese burger was not as good, the beef patty although juicy was lacking in beefy flavour. I like the coleslaw which you can choose as a side together with a drink for $3 more.
Prices are reasonable but burgers are quite small. There's no GST and service charge. Best of all there's a 25% discount if you use Grab Pay.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115145949078497107987/reviews
Kayven,5,"Cozy family operated restaurant with wonderful Korean chicken.

Food: 10/10 üçó
- I ordered a Gangnam burger for $8.90, and added cheese fries and a drink for an extra $4. The total came out to $13.10 (+20 cents for takeaway). The chicken in the burger was extremely tender and juicy, which complimented the soy garlic sauce very well. You can tell that the cheese sauce for the fries is not your usual nacho cheese type of thing, you don‚Äôt taste that artificial flavour but rather something that had quality, don‚Äôt know how to explain it lol you gotta try it for yourself üòπ. Always came by occasionally to buy some chicken and I would highly recommend the soy garlic sauce and honey butter sauce if you are planning to buy some Korean chicken.

Service: 10/10 üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- The staff at the counter and in the kitchen greeted me immediately when I turned to enter the shop and I could see a smile all the way behind his mask. He was very patient and there was such a warmth he carried. He also offered to help pack my drink even though it was meant to be self service.

Ambience: 9/10 üå≥
- Your usual cafe spot, quite a lot of seating despite the small space. Very nice wooden flooring and tables and nice red retro metal stools. Very pleasant warm lighting as well, perfect environment to just relax and chill with friends and family

Overall: 10/10
- Highly recommend this spot for some good food at some affordable prices!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106786175078854997780/reviews

Jon Lau,5,"The Wagyu Burger was yummy. The patty was succulent and the bread nicely crisp. Fresh lettuce. I loved it. Ordered a set which had a choice of mash potatoes, fries, etc. I chose coleslaw. And topped up for a flat white. Got a 6pcs wings too and was well deeper fried. I enjoyed this too. Overall an enjoyable meal and would come back!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101664665401377179413/reviews

Order from the counter. Free seating.
Self serve to collect your food.
Food is on the average. Burger patty was juicy. Bun wasn‚Äôt impressive. Coffee was on the bitter side, quite smooth.
Price is average, reasonable, especially the coffee.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105804445185126817371/reviews
