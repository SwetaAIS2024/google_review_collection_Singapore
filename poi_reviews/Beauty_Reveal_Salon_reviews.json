My mum went to cut hair and the man cutting her hair gave remarks on why her hair was very long and whether she had no money to cut. I mean???? My mum loves having long hair. She came there to snip 2 inches off. Such rude remarks were passed because he probably found it a hassle to cut long hair. Then he should have asked his colleagues to cut. Such a mediocre cut as well. Please refrain from going here. If it’s troublesome providing proper service.I think he Shouldn’t be working there in the first place.",

However, the lady (did not get her name. A chinese lady with highlighted, shoulder-length hair) handled my child patiently and professionally. She managed to coax and quickly and safely get my child's hair done. Great service by her! Thank you!",
