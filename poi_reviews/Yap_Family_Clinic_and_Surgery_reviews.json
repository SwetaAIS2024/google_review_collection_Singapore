      "text": "Consulted Doctor Yap for renewal of my driver's license checkup at age 65. He is highly recommended. No qualms and soft spoken but humanistic doctor. The charges is cheapest in town at $18 for this type of checks.\nEvening crowd quite ok, but good to go early and queue. Opens at 645pm except Wednesday, Friday and Saturday and Public holiday night is close.\nAsked the Nurse at duty, very friendly and kind with very good service as I checked how to get to mayflower mrt and she guided me. She even call me to check if I managed to find the station.\nI believe not many clinics in Singapore provide this wonderful warmth human service.",

I came all the way from macpherson and it was really urgent i needed just the itchy whole body injection but was turned down. I came down yesterday too, clinic was closed. All staff and docter rushing to go home, no mercy for patients. Really disappointed.",
