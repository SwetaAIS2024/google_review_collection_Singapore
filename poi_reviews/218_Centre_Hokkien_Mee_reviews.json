      "text": "Kitty and I were cycling around Punggol, looking for a good dinner spot when we stumbled upon this coffee shop we'd never visited before.  We decided to give 218 Centre Hokkien Mee a try, and it was a truly unique experience.  The coffee shop itself had a classic Singaporean hawker centre vibe - bustling, lively, and full of energy.\n\nThe stall is run by a Chinese auntie and uncle, along with two Indian guys.  The auntie takes orders, and the uncle prepares the food, with the Indian guys doing the actual cooking.  It was fascinating to see this mix of cultures working together to create a traditional Singaporean dish.  However, after the meal, Kitty and I found ourselves wondering if this unique combination somehow affected the taste of the Hokkien Mee.\n\nThe auntie was incredibly friendly and provided great service.  They have a system where they give you a chip that buzzes when your food is ready.  It was a clever way to manage the flow of orders.  However, the Hokkien Mee itself was a bit of a disappointment.  Both Kitty and I found it to be quite bland and lacking in flavor.  We were hoping for a more intense wok hei and a bolder taste, but it just didn't deliver.  The prawns were fresh, but the Hokkien Mee itself lacked the characteristic flavor.  It felt like something was missing, the essence of \"Hokkien Mee\" itself.  We had to use lime and chili to try to cover up the blandness, but even the chili was a bit of a disappointment.\n\nWe also tried the fried oyster egg, but it wasn't as good as we expected.  The oyster starch wasn't flavorful, and the egg itself wasn't as flavorful.  The chili wasn't as satisfying either.  The oysters themselves seemed fresh, but they left a strong, lingering fishy aftertaste.\n\nReading other Google reviews, we noticed a common thread. Many reviewers have mentioned a decline in the quality of the food in recent months.  It seems like the Hokkien Mee, once a popular dish, has lost some of its charm.\n\nOverall, it was a very unique experience, but the food itself didn't quite live up to our expectations.  The unique staff combination and the efficient service were interesting, but the lack of flavor in the Hokkien Mee and the fried oysters egg made the experience a little disappointing.",

The pork lard was fragrant but became soft because I bought takeaway. Fortunately, the carrot cake did not disappoint. It is delicious and not too greasy, there is fragrance from the chai por and had enough salt.",
