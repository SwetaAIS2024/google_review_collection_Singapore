阿宝,5,"Saw my daughter’s friend had a new hair cut & asked where she did it, she recommended me to contact Sky of Tresses Pasir Ris.

Hair cut had to be done by appointment only.

The fresh look is great & the cost is very reasonable!  Now I know why my daughter’s friend always recommends this!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews
Marvin Tan,5,"Very good Salon and has been going back for years. My hair stylist is Xiao Li and she has been cutting my hair for years and I am very satisfied after each visit every single time.

Decided to write this review after a negative experience in a certain hair salon at White Sands. Very blessed to find this salon and always looking forward to visit again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108289324455896934717/reviews
Eileen Kwek,5,"Xiaoli is my family's favourite hair stylist.  Despite moving out of pasir ris, I still go back to her for my regular hair fix.  She cuts, perms and color to beautify you.  I tried a few hairstylists in shopping malls but she is still the best!  You need to call to book her time as she is popular with her customers.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103192680693118592937/reviews
Thatcher Lor,1,"WORST SALON THAT RUIN MY HAIR!!!!!!!
The first time I came, i make an in store appointment and the lady told me to wait 30 mins for my turn. I came back 30 mins after, another person came in and asked for hair colouring. The lady saw I was back and she kept entertaining the person who is asking for the colour. I just sat there and wait for her to inform me that i need to wait a while more. 15 mins later, she didnt even approach me to have the courtesy to ask if i am okay to wait, i stood up and leave bc my friends are waiting for me, the lady asked “ are you in a hurry?” So effing rude.

Second time around, i wanted to give this shop another try bc of the good rating. I only wanted to get my fringe trimmed, the same lady was entertaining  other customers, she asked a guy who was sitting outside to cut my fringe. I communicated what I wanted and the guy i think wasnt trained well for hair cut literally ruined my hair!!!!! He was using bluetooth earphone when cutting my hair. I had to went to another salon to salvage my hair but too bad the damage couldnt be done.

ALL AND ALL DONT EVER COME HERE!!!!!!!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105142499847394913495/reviews
