      "text": "We tried a 18 hole at this golf course on a Saturday morning. As we only have two golfers we have to take a caddy. Ana our caddy is very pleasant and knowledgeable about the course and she is very experienced which makes our game more enjoyable. However she‚Äôs the only good part of the game. Firstly the clubhouse is very very run down. There is a foul smell at the very rundown reception and pro shop. The check in counter lady was not very welcoming. The toilet and changing room also have weird smell which makes me sick. When I opened the locker I couldn‚Äôt even put my bag in properly as the little shelf in the locker is almost broken. Shoes are not allowed in but the floor doesn‚Äôt seem clean either inside. There are peeling paint and moisture stains all over the ceiling and wall. Next the course itself is very hilly, grass was alright it need some maintenance. But the course is not really spectacular there is no feature hole or highlights. Just a very plain course to be honest. Buddy is very old and poorly maintained and we were not even given water. We bought some beers at the cafe and they kindly give us a box of ice saying it‚Äôs free ice. However they only accept cash or touch n go payment. No credit card payment so luckily we had some cash. We paid RM700 plus for game for two with a caddy. Won‚Äôt come back again unfortunately. Giving it a rating of 3 as the caddy does make a difference.",

      "text": "Senibong Golf Course is easily accessible and challenging in its own way! Hole 1 proved tricky for me, and I unfortunately lost  balls to those big drains every time. Despite that, I enjoyed playing this laid-back course.\n\nThe layout is simple abit hilly  but the greens are rather forgiving, and holes aren't too long making it perfect for a relaxing round . I ended up playing  3 weeks in a row.\n\nBeing just a round the corner from  2nd link, Tuas is a huge plus.\n\nOverall, Senibong is a great choice for those seeking a low-key golfing experience without too much fuss but get so much in value!!!\n\nSome complained about clubhouse run down but I feel it's alright decent. For what it's worth üëç",

      "text": "If it‚Äôs your first at this club, it‚Äôs good to have a caddy. The course is rather hilly, so it‚Äôs good to have them advise you accordingly. Otherwise it‚Äôs a pretty manageable course for beginners.\n\nJust a downside, they seem to have an issue with drainage as mud kind of common throughout the course. I fat a stroke with my wedge and I ended up ‚Äúslicing‚Äù a nice slab of mud off the ground like butter.\n\nHonestly forest city is way better in terms of playability and challenge. But if you factoring the cost, I wouldn‚Äôt mind coming back to Senibong. And Senibong is beginner friendly. That said, season player may not like it.",
