teng siang,5,"Peach almond tart is so delicious.
The aroma of this pastry shop can be detected from afar once step into the basement. Price wise abit on the steep side but worth once a while. Will come back try their other tarts.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113498227365501698344/reviews
