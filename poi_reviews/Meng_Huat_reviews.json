      "text": "First time eating at this foodcourt cause itâ€™s rather unpopulated and the stalls are rather few compared to the one above.\n\nWalked past the economic rice store and decided to try it after seeing the never ending customers and variety of dishes(will take pic next time)\n\nAlso they offer brown rice!! Which i rarely see in mixed veg rice stores.\n\nAnyways, the price is insanely cheap, I got:\nBrown rice(less) + tofu with meat on top + bean sprouts with tofu + pumpkin + steamed egg + sweet and sour pork with ah-zha + beancurd skin + hairy gourd = $8.60!!\n\nI was damn surprised when I heard the price, and the portion they give is pretty huge. Would certainly patronise the store again.\n\nTake note: they only accept cash!!",
