It is located across ponggol park and next to the park connector.\n\nThis coffee shop has many stalls offering a huge variety of food and cuisine. Mostly reasonably but not cheaply priced.\n\nIt can get very very busy most of the time and it can be difficult to get a seat.\n\nThe crowd can get a bit rowdy especially with those who drink or when the groups of folks who came in after their cycling or exercising sessions. All very safe yet have a good vibe.\n\nGood place for supper. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "Very good fish soup. But customers must be careful, if you’re allergic to prawns, they add in dried shrimps by default. Need to ask to exclude. I was quite shocked when I first ate it. But otherwise, all good! Fish is fresh! Wouldn’t say there’s a lot of fish, I always add $3 for more fish. Quality > Quantity!\n\nIf you dine in, and are feeling broke, you can’t save 50 cents even if you don’t want the rice! It’s a set! The uncle told me.\n\nHopefully you’re rich and abundant when eating this delicious fish soup!",
