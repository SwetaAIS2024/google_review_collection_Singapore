Vidyesh Warnekar,5,"I had a great journey with WellNest Re. I have been following Reshma‚Äôs diet and nutrition plan for last couple of months and have to say that I am extremely happy with the results.
Having previously tried intermittent fasting myself, I used to feel extremely hungry during the fasting period. But with the diet plan and tips prepared by Reshma,  I didn‚Äôt get those hungry pangs and was able to hit my goal much faster than anticipated.
Thanks Reshma for your support.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116439042600032035487/reviews
