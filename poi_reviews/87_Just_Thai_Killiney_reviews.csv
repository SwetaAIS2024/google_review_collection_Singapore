Teck Boon,5,A few brunches around Singapore and the food standards are generally quite consistent. Staff here are friendly and helpful. Sitting space can get a bit limited and if you have to sit outside during lunch it can get quite warm. Best to come slightly early or maybe after the rush hours.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105978834231481267643/reviews
George Kooi,5,"This is a well-recommended joint by many who persuaded me. Anyway, it is a family outing here.

We got recommended some items from the menu (good for 4) :

- Tom Yum Seafood Red Soup $9
- Stir Fried Prawn with Thai Yellow Curry Poudar $15
- Deep Fried Century Egg with Basil Pork $11.9
- Thai style Pork Knuckle $15
- Deep Fried Grouper n Mango Solad $29
- Claypot Tang Hoon Prawns $15
- Deep Fried Garlic Chicken $9

We ordered a mix of the common items and items we have not tried before.

For items like Deep Fried Century Egg with Basil Pork (new to us), it’s like 2 dishes in one.  Similarly with the crispy but not dry Grouper and sour but not overly spicy Mango salad, it’s also like 2 dishes of Fish and Somtam. All of us really enjoyed the Grouper and Mango Salad.

The stir-fried prawns with yellow curry powder has an eggy base which goes well with rice.

The Pork Knuckle came up very tender which my dad loved the easy bite and flavours.

Their Tom Yum soup is a must have. Our red soup version was quite creamy.

These guys have been around for a while starting with their first outlet in Pasir Panjang (moved to Holland Village) and overheard that they could be expanding to cope with the demands.

Expect great service as well.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106492118759990606649/reviews
A B,4,"V Good food in a very cause atmosphere. Extensive menu
If vegetarian, make sure you ask them to not use fish sauce - taste of it was predominant in the curry.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110960725765749160870/reviews
Jo,4,Tom yam is delicious. Pineapple rice is not fantastic. Sweet and sour chicken is crispy and delicious. Green curry not bad.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102029749998314918878/reviews
Deming,4,Ordered the pork boat noodles (soup). The broth was tasty and hearty. We enjoyed the food and it was not too expensive considering we were in the orchard area. Free drink for registering their free membership. The staff were friendly and prompt too.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104497591180122525539/reviews
