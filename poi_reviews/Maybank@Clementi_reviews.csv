Philip Chew,5,I came to Clementi Br instead of Jurong East branch to request for a change of Passbook and to get a cashier order served by Mr Wong J J. He shows great efficiency and knowledgeable in his work. Process done within a short period of time. Strongly complimented and recommended for The Star Award of the branch.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114630537971524317329/reviews
Hanifah Nabila Wismadi,4,"I came here to open islamic savings account, the staff was patient and helpful. In the middle of the process I needed to leave the bank for an urgent matter, and they waited for me even though I came back exactly at the time when they were supposed to close the bank. When I arrived back, my account and debit card was ready (i thought the process would take more than a week), and the staff explained to me nicely to complete the process and use the online banking app.

I gave it a 4-star because initially it seemed to be a bit challenging for student pass holders, especially when your current address does not match with your student pass address. But thankfully, the process can still be continued, and my account can finally be opened on the same day (so relieved because I only had one day left to give details of my account to my institution).",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108700728737007846971/reviews
Geralyn Tay,1,Incredibly inefficient. Have been waiting for 45mins and still not my turn yet. Customers have to go to the branch to close their accounts. Doing so via the app will incur a $10 fee. Closing accounts in other banks took me 1min via the app. Tons of people at this Maybank branch waiting for their queue with only one officer attending?! If only I could take a picture of the current situation.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112257918616073039306/reviews
Pei Leng Tho,1,"Took me more than 1 hour to open a fixed deposit joint account. This lady - Personal Finance Executive served me 3.10pm and I left the bank 4.10pm. Had to raise my voice at her for scrolling up and down on her laptop and not knowing how to open an account. No apology given. She even had the cheek to ask “are you guys in a rush?”. Spent more time collecting our income and employment data even when we only wanted to place a time deposit. Not to do an investment.
She has a long way to learn to be customer centric !",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101656671966574461587/reviews
lee Jiawen,1,"I’m went to Maybank Clementi branch to do fixes deposit just now 15/February/2025 (Sat) . One of your staffs ( ladies in short hair and wear spectacles) attitude was very badly and impatient . I’m one of your regular customer (came to do fixes deposit) but if still in this badly and impatient attitude , I will consider to other bank to do fixed deposit . Hope that management can look through the review and improve your customer service . Give our customer good experience. Thank you .",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110105339883768496004/reviews
