AI HOON GOH,5,"Came across Director Emily through a friend’s family member wake. She is so compassionate that I remember her when I need the service. Her team is filled with excellent members. All of them are as nice and helpful, just like her. Special mentioned about uncle Koh, who gives me the fatherly figure of guiding us every step with great patience. This is an industry whereby u must have the compassionate heart to deal with your clients. And I want to recommend that Hiap Hin is one company that put customer’s feelings first over anything. Thank you so much and I wish the team well in everything they are dealing with.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101894886772731654086/reviews
