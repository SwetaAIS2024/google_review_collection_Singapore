I went a few times only for knee injuries treatments and have seen big improvements! Had sore neck due to tension and sore neck was treated right away in a session. Worth every visits. Would revisit again. Thank you Kanji Physical!",

Amazing. May be hard to book the time slot as many are seeing him. I am grateful that the pain and tension in my back caused by my long-standing scoliosis has clearly decreased. Due to the coronavirus, it may be a challenge to make reservations as treatment times are limited.",
