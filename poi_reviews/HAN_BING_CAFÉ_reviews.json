      "text": "Was looking for food near Botanics Gardenâ€¦ chanced upon this Korean restaurant thatâ€™s situated in Serene Centre. Was drawn by its deco and the wide array of Korean food. Decided to give it a try~\n\nFrom the outside it looks small but when youâ€™re inside its very cozy and home-like :) loved the ambience and the waitress was super bubblyâ€” forgot to get her name but I think sheâ€™s the chef too.\n\nWe ordered a Classic Army Stew (normal spicy) and a Crispy Korean Pancake as sides. Was very pleased with the taste and the generous servings.\n\nThe army stew was rich with kimchi soup and ingredients while the crispy pancake batter and chives were just an absolute treat for the palate!\n\nItâ€™s a big portion for 2 pax and by the time we finished our meal we had no space for desserts already ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤¤ no regrets tho, will come again for the bingsu! :3",

Various portion sizes to chooses from for some of the dishes, especially for bingsu, to fit different appetite capacity.  Friendly and attentive service staff. Do note place is small and limited seatings, so may have to wait if it is crowded.\n\nWould love to come back here again.",
