Wesley Wong,5,"I had the pleasure of enjoying both the breakfast and lunch buffets at this restaurant, and I must say, the experience was fantastic. The variety of food options is impressive, catering to different tastes and preferences. One of the standout highlights is the Thai food counter, which offers an authentic selection of dishes, from classic Pad Thai to various types of flavorful Thai noodle soups. The menu changes daily, ensuring a fresh and diverse dining experience each time you visit.

Beyond the food, the restaurant’s ambiance is equally noteworthy. The interior is designed with plenty of greenery, creating a refreshing and relaxing atmosphere. A large glass window provides a beautiful view of the swimming pool and the adjacent golf course, enhancing the overall dining experience. Whether you’re enjoying a leisurely breakfast or a hearty lunch, the combination of delicious food and a scenic setting makes for a memorable meal.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107433449088212182977/reviews
Ryan Chew,3,"Received a very unprofessional first impression but was later informed by other staff members that the said person was of ""special needs"" so I didn't kick up a fuss further. Restaurant was very warm due to the glasshouse decor and it's effect. Food wise, it was very run of the mills except the star dish of the day which was steamed halibut. It was so succulent and melt in the mouth, I even use it to garnish on my laksa. The Thai pandan leave fried chicken was well fried and retaining its juiciness. I would also like to try the Chinese prawn ball but at 130pm the serving dish was already empty and there was still no replenishing when I left the restaurant at 220pm.For dessert, the Thai milk tea shooter stood out as well for its taste and texture.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117598885708884203580/reviews
P Lim,5,"This is our second time here. I appreciate that they offer a wide variety of meat, seafood dishes, and desserts.

We did enjoy our meals, but sometimes it’s the little things that matter. Aside from the manager, the waitstaff seemed to lack energy and enthusiasm - something I noticed during both visits.

On our first visit, they didn’t even have crab clipping scissors for the snow crabs. After some searching, they handed me a crab cracker, which isn’t really suitable for snow crabs. This time around, the scissors were kept in a drawer, and I had to ask for them. It’s odd that such essentials aren’t readily available for diners. No finger bowls, no extra napkins - overall, service felt a bit lacklustre.

Don’t get me wrong - I still enjoy dining here, and I’ll definitely be back for a third time!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101263776907216625108/reviews
L T,4,"Tried out the buffet seafood dinner and I guess the main draw for many is the lobster. The chef was kept real busy dishing out one batch after another as a line was forming just to get the lobster tail. The one I got was slightly undercooked. There were many international cuisines to choose from - Thai, Local, Japanese, Indian, etc. The Thai dishes were quite disappointing. Wished they had on the spot stir fry Pad Thai or Thai friend Rice. The best cuisine turned out to be Indian. The restaurant had good sound insulation and was not noisy even when it was crowded. There is even a roving live band to entertain the crowd. One drawback is the insufficient cooling despite positioning coolers throughout the restaurant.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112021794976187105345/reviews
Lawrence Wee,4,"Came here for Sunday brunch to celebrate the end of school term. The buffet spread was good. It has seafood, Chinese, Western, Japanese, and Thai cooked food. There is also a wide variety of cakes and desserts. Juices, coffee, and tea included.

Suggest making the reservation via Eatigo for a discount.

This restaurant is located within a golf resort and not that accessible by public transport. Especially with ongoing construction nearby. You could take the hotel shuttle bus from Changi Expo or Jewel. Do google for the bus schedule. I would suggest going there via private hire transport or taxi.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106780661952254628889/reviews
