Very wasteful and damaging to the environment. Will not be eating here again until the management stops this unnecessary use of plastic.",

He made a new bowl, but it ended up looking like the below.\n\nThe photo below shows a \"dry\" noodle. I could barely taste the sauce with the amount of liquid swirling inside.",

      "text": "I would give this place zero stars if I could. I came here with my husband and 1 year old daughter and sat at a table that had 4 seats. This old cleaning lady told me (rudely) to go over to the table for 2 seats since we only had 2 people. I pointed at my daughter in response and told her that we had 3 people and that table is way too squeezy for us especially with a toddler that grabs everything in sight. She disregarded me and said that my daughter isn‚Äôt counted since she isn‚Äôt eating. We simply walked off, not wanting to make a scene and she said something equivalent to ‚Äúgood riddance‚Äù. I‚Äôm honestly appalled at this. I‚Äôm not expecting 5 star service but this level of rudeness and discrimination for a family with a young child is completely unacceptable at any establishment.\n\nWe used to frequent this place and yes we know this cleaning lady has an attitude but this is the last straw. Will NEVER return unless they completely revamp their service staff/model.",
