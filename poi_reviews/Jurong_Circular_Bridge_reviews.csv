C,4,"The Jurong Circular Bridge is a well-designed, wide bridge that earns a solid 4 out of 5 in my book. It’s a key link in the area, connecting Pandan Gardens with the International Business Park, Ulu Pandan Park Connector, and Faber Heights.

What makes it stand out is how cyclist-friendly it is — the width gives plenty of space for both pedestrians and bikes, making it a smooth, safe crossing. Whether you’re commuting or out for a leisure ride, it’s a practical and pleasant part of the network. A great piece of infrastructure that really enhances connectivity in the West.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews

Azad Rahim,5,Revisited this old childhood haunt recently. Lots of changes. The old rail bridge and tracks are gone. It's now well lit and accessible to everyone. It's peaceful at night save for the occasional runner or cyclist and the drone of traffic from the highway.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112808839387970258293/reviews
