Jerry Tang,4,"Food was ok, but service was prompt, too prompt until they served all the dishes at one go. The table can't fit the dishes, and true enough, one of the drinks was toppled due to the squeezing of the dishes on the table and drenched one of us. They need to learn how to pace the food and serve.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115888625563267924954/reviews
IVY MU,4,"We have been here for few times but food was so so..
We found 2 dishes were outstanding during our visit on 2nd week of February 2025.
We recommend the coffee pork ribs and assam fish head.
Coffee pork ribs, it was well done for the tender meat and coffee taste.
A must try dish, although price expensive for the assam fish head and worth for the waiting time because of the sauce and served piping hot under the warmer rack, not too spicy and sourish taste, both just right for our liking.
We almost finish all the gravy. ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106022162798383449296/reviews

anlinna lim,5,"Very cosy and family feel restaurant. It seems like the restaurant has many regulars.  It is our first time here.

I like how generous the food portion is. coffee pork rib is super nice, should have ordered more for 3A1C. Sour spicy soup is nice too too our liking.  Veg portion is huge. Sum lor horfan is yummy with many fish slices. Desserts is packed with ingredients! Overall very good experience.  Well bring my extended family and friends there.

Great find!

Sandra Tan,5,"A fantastic spot for gathering with friends and family. The food is delicious, the ambience is pleasant, and the service staff are excellent.

I highly recommend their coffee pork ribs, cereal prawns, and yam paste dessert.

It's always crowded on weekends, so it's better to make reservations in advance.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104503160872412162765/reviews
