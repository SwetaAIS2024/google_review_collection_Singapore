Basil Chua,5,"It's been 40 glorious years since I last set foot in this humble and graceful church, and oh, how time flies! While the physical architecture may have undergone changes over the years, the spirit that captivated my younger self remain as vibrant as ever.

Vincent (The Cow),5,"A very nice and homey chapel like church that is fully air conditioned and has comfortable pews with knee pads for kneeling.

Honestly I could relax and fall asleep in peace here and didn't feel any burning sensations.
