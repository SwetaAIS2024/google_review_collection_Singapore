Ismail Didih,1,"This is not a safe place to be. The counsellors are unprofessional and they get emotional towards their patients. I have seen in front of my eyes during circle time, how one guy was attacked by the Counsellor herself, and encouraged others to do the same.

Be careful on what you sign when you enrol. Read the fine print coz they can use whatever you share to the therapist, against you.

I would expect by paying such a premium, youâ€™ll have better trained people working there. Better be safe and look elsewhere.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101176661414696794802/reviews
