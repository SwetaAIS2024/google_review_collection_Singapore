      "text": "Icon health screening clinic is one of the best I have come across. Dr Lau is especially warm and meticulous and does her best for the welfare of her patients. She is professional and follows up closely on issues impacting her patients. She gives good advice on the checks most appropriate for her patients all these years I have been seeing her.\nUnder her exemplary leadership, the staff at Icon are most friendly and caring. Special shout out also to Lisa who did my mammogram and ultrasound scans as she was detailed and explained every step clearly to allay any concerns. It has made my health screening experiences most pleasant. Thank you Dr Lau, Lisa and staff at Icon! God bless you richly!",

      "text": "I got the free mammogram through AIA and shortlisted Icon Health screening from the list of panels. I trusted my instinctÂ this shall be the clinic I wish to stay put with. I am alwaysÂ comfortable with a female doctor and my visit to the clinic and seeing Dr Lau. She is such an elegantÂ lady, a very patient and gentle doctor I have ever met. I was never rushed during my appointment and Dr Lau took the time to understand my family history. Blood drawing is painless and thanks to the professionalism of the nurse. As soon as my blood was drawn, breakfast was served to me in aÂ niceÂ cozy place. Having breakfast after fasting in such a nice environment does not make you feel like you are in a clinic. They have such a nice team especiallyÂ Melaine! Melaine is so helpful and every call with her makeÂ you feel so good speaking to her. I know I will feel very comfortable with them so I took the Deluxe plus package at Icon health screening. As soon as I completed my screening, I signed up another package for my husband so we can come together for our annual health screening. Everyone is so nice there,Â experience toÂ believe yourself. Thank you ladies for your amazing hospitality.",

      "text": "I finally found a health screening centre that I am happy to stick with. ðŸ¤— The waiting area is very pleasant with rather good views of the area and comfortable furniture. Appreciate the professionalism demonstrated by all the staff from receptionist, clinical assistant, sonographer and doctor in charge they are all amazing. The price of the screening packages is a little on the higher side but quite reasonable in my opinion and it includes a follow up review once the test results are out. Kudos to the team for being so accommodating to my picky taste buds as they had arranged plain croissants for me, it really made my day and btw they were crazy delicious after a long fast and four tubes of blood drawn ðŸ¤£ the nurse was also very skillful in drawing blood, well done and see you next year!",

They are a great team of medical providers and the whole health screening process went like clockwork. Can really see that they work as a team. I have been going for my annual health screening with Icon since 2021, and I would recommend Icon to anyone who wants a value-for-money package with great service and professionalism.",

The waiting area had posh and comfortable furnishing. And the best part was the chicken sandwich freshly prepared and served to you after you are done. Would definitely be back every year.",
