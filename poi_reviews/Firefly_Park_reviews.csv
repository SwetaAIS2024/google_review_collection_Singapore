Seah Jia Hui,3,"Name is a little misleading as nothing here is about firefly unless the graffiti. Many kids playing basketball. Minus 2 stars due to inaccessible designs. Many knee level walls built in the estate to prevent global access to the park. Only through a small walk way as entrance. As such, I have to jump down the short wall which may break my knees. Imagine elderly. Built in a new estate.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109933240025657790273/reviews

General Twilight,5,"There is a large playground in this park, with an elderly exercise area and a basketball court. This is a good place for the residents to exercise and have fun and that this park has facilities for all age group to enjoy. However, there is no toilet in the park so you need to go to the nearby food court for toilet. Overall a good park and I have fun here enjoying the scenery and playing at the basketball court with my friends.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114314523990529053400/reviews
