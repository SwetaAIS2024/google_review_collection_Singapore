General Twilight,5,"It a decent bike rental store in East coast park, providing us with bicycles to use as we cycle along the park. It is a decent shop and is located near the beach. The rates are affordable for most people. Great service by the staff here.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114314523990529053400/reviews
Emmanuelle Loye,1,"[DONT RENT HERE] One of the shop with monopoly that does not bother about providing clean, secure bikes and courteous service.
Today as often i pointed to the really old and rusty state of the “bmx” bike for my kid. Was ignored. Only for the chain to break later on. Waited 30 minutes for a replacement (out of 2 hours rental). And replaced by a bike in an even worse state whereby the chain was not oiled enough and was gripping. Of course, nobody cared about any feedback.

Much rather go to the cycling shop on the other side of the ECP. Just a few minutes difference to access the park - much better service and secure bikes.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106334396161729753213/reviews
C S,5,"Rates are not bad. If there are any defects they will willingly to do one to one exchange, they allowed me to try the different bikes and also advised on what kind of bike to take. Just too bad it’s not open 24h. If I want to do night cycling, have to come earlier. Other shops are 24h but much further away.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100949760937596920244/reviews

Char Char,1,"Visited on 21/12 morning and attended by a tall Indian guy. Extremely rude service. Expects customer to understand his fast and unclear accent.

rental extremely costly for poor maintained bikes.

NEVER RETURN TO THIS SHOP- Avoid at all cost.

P.S Saw another bike shop after the cable ski and their bikes were newer and better maintained.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103366407899422095263/reviews
