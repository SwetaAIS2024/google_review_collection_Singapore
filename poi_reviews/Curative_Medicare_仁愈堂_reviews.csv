Wilfred Cher,5,"A legitimate TCM clinic with registered doctor and therapists!

Even the front desk lady is trained and able to judge my medical condition, followed by proper treatment by an experienced therapist. I was there for a knee injury after my holiday overseas. After physical examination, treatment was extended to my back, which was diagnosed as related. I am able to walk properly with minimum pain at my knee and felt much better. Treatment process is careful and different from many other TCM which exerts stronger forces which causes pain.

Clinic ambiance is soothing and good for treatment. I actually slept after a little while into treatment. Price is reasonable and all staff is friendly and helpful.

Do make appointment if anyone wants to visit as the bookings are normally full.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105587561225216599070/reviews
Mindy Cher,5,"I was seeing Dr Lee for skin issues at her previous clinic which the Chinese medicine prescribed had really improved the conditions.
Knowing that they moved here and also have tuina services I tried and it really eased up the soreness in my lower back and improved my posture. I’ve been coming back weekly.
Everyone there was friendly and patient in explaining my conditions.
The location is convenient and highly recommend for people looking for TCM treatment.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110929092867442758936/reviews
