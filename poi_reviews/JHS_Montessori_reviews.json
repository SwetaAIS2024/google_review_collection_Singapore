      "text": "My boy just loves going to JHS Montessori everyday. And comes home to tell me how much he enjoyed his day and learnt a lot at school.\n\nAs he is born in January and was very much ahead of his peers. The previous school couldn’t provide a good environment for him to learn. As JHS is montessori based, his learning will be paced according to his abilities.\n\nPersonally, I love the environment of the school as it’s very serene and peaceful. The principal and teachers are very passionate about their work. And the principal shared with me that the teachers have been with them for many years.The place is very clean, well sanitised and bright. As we are still going through the pandemic, I feel at ease whenever I drop off my child in the morning.\n\nFrankly, I am certain that my child is in good hands.\n\nI contemplated for several months before joining JHS Montessori as it was a distance away from my place. In fact, I considered over 30 schools before joining JHS Montessori.  I also visited several schools nearby, nothing came close to JHS Montessori. On hindsight, I regretted not joining earlier.",

      "text": "Really happy to have found JHS Montessori for our little one. Principal Nicole and her dedicated staff are well seasoned and highly experienced in taking care of your child. They are not like other schools where your child is just part of a group. They provide each and every child their full attention and love.\n\nOur little one enjoys his time at school and has developed so much. It is such a joy to see his development from day to day. We can safely send him to school without worry and are sure that he will be well taken care of. We highly recommend that you consider JHS Montessori for your child.",

      "text": "An excellent montessori school to be in!  The principle Ms Nicole is a passionate veteran of the preschool education and teachers are extremely experienced, patient and caring. They genuinely cares for the kids well being and also creates a school culture that nurtures them with postive life values. Big brand names are great but if you are looking beyond structured curriculum and a school that builds the character of young kids, JHS is worth your consideration!\n\nWe are very fortunate to have all our 3 kids with JHS. My 2 elder ones are already in primary school with the younger one still with JHS. The school has a well rounded curriculum that prepares kids for the primary school with external enrichment programs like science discovery, speech and drama embedded in part of the curriculum. Thus even without signing up for extra enrichment classes outside, the kids are well prepared for their transition into the local primary schools, not needing us to worry much on their adaptability.",

      "text": "Definitely a school worth considering as its really difficult to find Kindergartens these days. Most are childcare. Especially if also looking for Montessori. My kid has just started primary school and looking at the syllabus, JHS definitely prepares the kids well so we won’t have a problem in lower primary. We’ve sent our kid to true Montessori before and a concern was the transition to traditional primary school. But JHS manages that very well with balance of Montessori teaching while incorporating the required structure present in traditional schools. Children teacher ratio is perfect and low teacher turnover, strong leadership team. Kudos!",

      "text": "JHS is truly a place that I highly recommend as all our 4 kids have been with JHS, which now only the littlest is there as the elder ones have moved on to Secondary & Primary school stage.\n\nThe principal, Ms Nicole, and all the teachers are extremely dedicated to make sure the kids are well taken care of and at the same time allow them to learn at their own pace.\n\nTo add on, with my child's specific dietary requirement due to her severe food allergies, the school had really put in extra efforts to make sure that she was kept away from any scenarios which would risk her condition and JHS had also accommodated for her food very well too. I have never been more at ease with her being in JHS, despite her starting at about 2+ years old, as the teachers all know what and how to react should the worst case happen! Kudos to that Ms. Nicole and team.\n\nLastly JHS to me is a school with heart and love. Principal and teachers there teach with passion and they treat each and every child equally and make them feel right at home. I have never regretted my decision to stick with JHS for all my kids.",
