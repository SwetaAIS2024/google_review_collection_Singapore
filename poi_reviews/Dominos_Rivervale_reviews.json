      "text": "Was trying to order from their app in the store for some promotional items. Something might be simple for them they just ignored! Well happened to be free since there.. managed to place the order..\nDon't have to wait long, around 10+ mins.. and it's started to rain heavily..  What a experience with the staff inside... Can see them talking.. walking around but can't ask help with on app order..\n\nServices getting very lousy..\n\nFood, taste acceptable but ingredients seem to be cutting down until I don't see much except for the cheese..\n\n18/12/24 Update;\nTrying to feedback to Dominos pizza, and the verdict is \"waste of time\".. ask me to check on their reply yesterday.. Where?\nFirst time I delete an account because of the time wasted to feedback to a company. Hoping that they can improve but.... I don't think I would patronise them again..\n\nSee the review, number don't lies!\n\nUsed to be my favourite pizza place in the past.. but now.. totally disappointed.",

Other 19 times line was busy.\n\nLive tracker shows \"rate your order\" but my pizza is not even here? Called in again and the line is still occupied. Horrible experience and service.\n\nUpdate: pizza arrived at 8.15pm and the pizza is already cold. Instructions to remove onions from pizza is not even followed.\n\nWill not order again.",

Order at your own risk. No point opting for self collection as the self collect is as bad as its delivery. Just look at the Amt of ppl waiting for their pre-ordered self pick up.",

Their pizza tracking thing was never updated (even after delivery) and the delivery person did not ring the doorbell and just left the order at my gate. Found 2 cold pizzas with thick chewy crusts and not much/uneven toppings.\n\nUpdate: Sent a message to Domino's 2 days ago via their Feedback site. Yet to hear back from them.",
