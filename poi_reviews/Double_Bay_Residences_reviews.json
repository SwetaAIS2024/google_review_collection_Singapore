      "text": "This is feedback for the security agency. Not sure how it is for the residents. But definitely not a good experience for visitors.\n\nThe guard post is fully Aircon which can be justified as it is hot in Singapore. Unfortunately some of the security officers are just really lazy. They will take at least 5 to 10 seconds to respond to any visitor at the window because they are engrossed in their phone or dozing/stoning.\n\nIf you are a repeat visitor and you pass your nric, they will almost always appear stunned or a bit annoyed at being disturbed.then you have to repeat your visit at least 3 times.\n\nI really don't know how security officers of such quality can help ensure safety in the condo if there were to be any form of danger. The level of alertness is so low..\n\nOne such officer is Miguel. No one is manning the window. He was in a bit of daze seated at least 5m away. When called by the lady manning the barrier, he then moved to the window. His tone of voice can also be improved.\n\nAlmost all the officers here behave in similar fashion for my four visits so far. The only exception is the lady manning the barrier. She is alert and friendly. She should be an example to the rest.",
