Karen Lau,5,"Bought pizzas from Pizza Hut Keat Hong branch. Though a small outlet, the place is very clean and comfortable.The pizzas are very tasty, with lots of ingredients. The staff who served me were very friendly, helpful and patient, especially Jack and Zul.  I will definitely come back to this Pizza Hut branch to get my pizzas again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116844815888551325422/reviews

Daniel Wong,3,"Preparation is adequately on time but you really need to be aggressive to be heard.

I stood there for 15 minutes waiting and had to remind the cashier a second time to check my order.

Well, my order was there the whole time, ready for me to pick up. I wasted 15 minutes standing there like like a statue.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115370922675617298409/reviews
Nash M,1,"This is the most ridiculous thing EVER!
Ordered at 6pm. Tracking doesn't even show anything until 8pm that it's being made. Customer service line is forever on hold! Tracking showed delivering at 9pm. Showed the vehicle moving then it was supposedly delivered at 9.10pm but NOTHING arrived! What the heck is going on! Absolutely BULLSHIT!!! Is this how things are done? Are you scamming people? Do something or have the guts to contact us to explain! I paid $85 for no delivery?",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104507274357864435643/reviews
