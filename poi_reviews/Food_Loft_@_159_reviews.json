      "text": "Good Charsiew, roast pork and roast duck. They have just started their business few weeks back and I do hope I have tried their roasts much earlier haiz.\n\nTheir CharSiew is one of the better ones I have tried so far. Sweet, juicy and fragrant. Tenderness is just nice. DI WANG ROASTED DELIGHT although has just started here not long ago, I suspected the boss has already accumulated plenty of roasting experience. Regulars here already singing praises to his roast skills.\nAlso try their Roast pork. It's crispy and have the right mix of fat and lean meat into that piece of ooomamee roast sia.\nI have yet to try the roast Dang Gui Duck. Nontheless I believe it will taste good. Why did I say that? Cos by the look of it oozing those  duck drum stick juices is already salivating for me.... wait, wait!!! My mom says she couldn't finish her duck drum stick hahaha... Yum yum, the roast duck drum stick is Wah Lau Eh sweet and tender, juiciness is definitely more than passing grade and up.\nWhite rice is fluffy and fragrant. Must go with the sauce ok? Don't miss it. Only thing I haven't try is it's oil rice (rice cooked in chicken stock) as the boss says it is sold out. Looks like I have come back again for it. Give it a try guys and gals, good food need to be mentioned and shared. Bin appetite!",
