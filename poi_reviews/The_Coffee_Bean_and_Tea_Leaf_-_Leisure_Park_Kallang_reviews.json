      "text": "Had a mixed experience. While the manager's service was commendable and they were very helpful, the rest of the staff seemed unmotivated and inattentive. Several times, I found myself waiting at the cashier for someone to take my order, but the staff ignored me. This significantly detracted from the overall experience. It's unfortunate because the store has potential, but the staff's attitude needs improvement.\n\nFood was good tasty.",

      "text": "This coffee bean was amazing, in its drinks, service, and atmosphere. It was cozy and well-lit, which made it very comfortable to drink and chill there. I ordered the new ice-blended choco Oreo crunch, which was made super fast as well. It tasted very tasty and had a good balance of sweetness of the chocolate and Oreo. I would recommend it to any Oreo lover, or anyone looking to try a new sweet delight. One thing though, the price was a little steep for a regular sized drink ($8~). Other than that it‚Äôs a great place for drinks and other small foods.",

      "text": "Visited the place on 25 Aug (Sun). The young Chinese boy in the store was busy clearing the trays left over by customers. He signal to me to give him a minute while doing so. He quickly cleared and not forgetting his hygiene, he washes his hand before coming back to attend to my orders. He is super efficient. He even remembered my regular order despite not visiting for a few weeks. Customers started pouring in slowly & he handles them efficiently. Without stopping at all, he still wipes the tables clean in the midst of all these. Hope Coffeebean mgt can put up a sticker on every table to remind customers to clear their own tray to ease the staff workload. I‚Äôm very impressed with this young gentleman on duty that day. Pls keep up the good work. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª",

      "text": "Have been patronising this branch almost every weekend for more than 2 years as my kid is having her enrichment class at Leisure park. One of the better cafe in Leisure park in terms of cleanliness and ambience (bright and spacious). Purpose of this comment will be a message to the person in charge of CBTL‚Äôs breakfast menu. Your current breakfast offering is no better than a fast food restaurant. I get more food by dissecting a subway sub. The quality and portion is getting from bad to worse over the years. With the recent price increase to the menu, I am expecting more from CBTL for a breakfast platter worth 16.20 (attached pic, both set cost 16.20). Suggest you could add another piece of ham or one more slice of bread or some baked beans to make it a more hearty meal. That would make customer less shortchanged too. Please bring back the hash browns to your breakfast platter, the canned fruits bites sucks.",
