Lavi Shiffman,4,"Imbiah Lookout Station is the middle station of the Singapore Cable Car on Sentosa island.  Nice views and many attractions are nearby.   At the Imbiah Lookout Station there is also a bus stop for Sentosa line A (which is free).  Using this bus, which acts as a ""hop on hop off"" service, you can visit many of the island's highlights.  Line A also connects to Line B, which is also free, and will give you an opportunity to visit other parts of the island.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111153691460234113747/reviews

Abhishek Shenoy,5,"The monorail is a free and convenient way to move around in Sentosa island! We took the monorail from Imbiah station to go the beach which is just one stop away. The train runs frequently, around 2-3 mins each so not much of crowding at the platforms, except if there are large groups of tourists boarding the train at once.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117298738392289722822/reviews
