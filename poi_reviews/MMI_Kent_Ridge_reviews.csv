ShiJie 12311,5,"Navigation: Look for MMI (Military Medical Institute), and the sign ""DSO"". If you use google maps, just follow the road it suggests. Then when u enter, it's at level 5

Came here to visit Physio for lower back strain that affected me for 6 months.
✅️Security was good, just let the uncle know you are here for appointment and show Singpass
✅️Lift was unique, you press your floor and the lift comes pre-programmed. Most odd thing I've ever experienced
✅️Counter staff was friendly, literally two guys enjoying life.

I met Darren who is very friendly and understanding of my problem and needs, he is patient and explains what needs to be done to improve my back problem, by doing more stretches everyday. He demonstrates different ways and stretches I could do and that is very helpful.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109091097226241688016/reviews

Bhuvan Shankar Anand,1,"Worst service. I'm a NSF in SAF and I got the contact Nunber 64857401 from my MO in Kranchi Camp for physio referral. When I called, they said the physio Number is 64857431. And when I called 64857431, no body is even answering my call. Then when my parents went to see in the hospital, there they are telling physio slots are already full as there are lot of people in SAF who are there for physio treatment. I understand that the slots are full and there are no enough physios. But, why can't they atleast pick up the call when I've been calling them multiple times ?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104198950148890708807/reviews
