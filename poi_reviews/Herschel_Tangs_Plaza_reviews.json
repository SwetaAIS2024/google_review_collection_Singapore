As for dining,  love the buffet from breakfast,  lunch high tea to dinner. Especially on Thursday with free flow of house wine. After mid-night if you are hungry,  Crossroad Cafe is the best restaurant for all. With wide variety of dishes and drinks. Love their welcome bread served before meals. Best bread ever tasted.",

And of course lots of cosmetic brands to choose from.\n\nI was also impressed with the Kids Department.\n\nAs for the Household Department, it  has always been famous at Tangs.\n\nYou will be able to admire all the beautiful merchandise even if you are only window shopping. Enjoy!",
