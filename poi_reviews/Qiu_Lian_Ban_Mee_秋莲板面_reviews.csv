Dr. V (Dr Ghib),1,"tried the dry minced pork noodles, priced at $7.20 SGD with an additional $1.20 SGD for extra small fish. The dish had a sweet flavor profile, which was a departure from the more savory noodles I’m accustomed to enjoying in Bedok. Unfortunately, the taste was noticeably enhanced with MSG, detracting from the natural flavors I was looking forward to. While the presentation was appealing, the use of MSG and the additional charge for a small amount of fish made the meal less satisfying overall, both in terms of taste and value.
