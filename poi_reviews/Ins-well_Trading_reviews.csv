lil dree,2,"went back to the store 2 years later as i really loved the engraving done for my keychain back in 2021 and it was exquisite. iâ€™m not sure what went wrong but the engraving done for mine today was mediocre to say the least. really trusted this store but todayâ€™s work did not match up to 2021â€™s standard and even had a price increment from $8 to $10 (understandable in todayâ€™s economy so i do not blame them) however, i really do love the one done in 2021 and hope that one day when i return it would be as pretty as that one! i also understand that engraving services isnâ€™t easy so i still appreciate this new piece a lot, though will not be giving this as a gift anymore.ðŸ˜Š",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113184002862309584672/reviews
