Martin Curtis,3,"We were somewhat worried by what we would find after reading the reviews. But for what we paid it was certainly better than we expected and better than we had paid more for elsewhere. It was clean enough and large space. Everything worked (except one power point). Included kitchenette, bathroom and separate bedroom. Aircon. Fridge. Cooking and TV. Yes TV was basic viewing only but we did not book room just to watch TV. Food Courts locally. Bathroom was clean and functional. Just needs a lick of paint. Touch up repairs and a good scrub down. Good enough for sure.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107781857675040183621/reviews
John Robert,1,"Wifi doesn't connect properly. Bed and pillows smell bad. Basic local TV channels. Basically it's a self service place. Honestly, you could just put up in a hotel for the same price or lesser in that area.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115685515938920332419/reviews

C and R,1,"I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The place was nowhere near what it looks like in the photos. It was dirty, cockroaches, smelly.
The extra mattresses were very short, not long enough for anyone taller than 5 feet!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106418613470121764010/reviews
