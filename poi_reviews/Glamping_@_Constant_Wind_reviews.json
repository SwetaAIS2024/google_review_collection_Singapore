It's come with a portable air conditioning unit and standing fan. Good enough to cool the tent after sunset. The campsite is sitted in exclusive corner nearby Constant Wind sailing club. Shower room and toilets are exclusive for glamping guests only. Although the air mattresses are not the most comfortable to sleep in , remember this is a camping ðŸ˜„, not hotel.\n\nThanks to the crew for adding small touches of decoration for the Christmasy mood.",
