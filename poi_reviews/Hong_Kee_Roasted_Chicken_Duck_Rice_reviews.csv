Sean Goh,4,"Chance upon this stall selling roast meat in a coffeeshop at sims drive. Initially came to this area to try other food but stall was closed upon reaching. Walked around and found this roast meat joint at the coffeeshop. Realised that they are in the same coffeeshop as the very popular stall selling laksa.  From their display, they sell a variety of items such as roast duck, charsiew, roast pork and chicken rice as well.

Had the combination of roast duck and charsiew (SGD$5) and it comes with a bowl of soup. Both the charsiew and the roast duck wasnâ€™t dry nor tough and was flavorful. Portion considered quite generous.

Seems like a popular stall, noticed many people takeaway from their shop. Overall, food was decent and would recommend.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
Kean Tan,4,"Not bad roasted meat. $4 for roasted pork and $4.50 for duck. The gravy is the more watery type, rather than gooey which I don't appreciate as much. Will return to try the other cuts of meat if I'm in the area",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107130207042104268698/reviews
Juran Max,5,"People who enjoyed this stall's food might like to know that they have moved to the 45 Brewcoffee coffeeshop at the other end of the same block. If I am not wrong, they are closed on Tuesday.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114965692742046609333/reviews
C,3,"Was in the area, but not many stalls open in the evening. The chicken meat is really quite tender, even the chicken breast is soft. The roast meat and char siew is a bit too salty. The rice is too soggy and not fragrant at all.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115032798890691535385/reviews
