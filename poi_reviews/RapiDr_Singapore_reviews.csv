S T,2,"Used twice. 1st consultation with Dr Bob in Aug24 was all good. Not for my 2nd time with Dr Xing C.Y today. Cannot see him from the video call, don't think it is technical issue, i think he purposely don't show face, can only see grey screen . Arrogant way of talking too. U will feel worse by meeting this kind of doctor especially when u are already not feeling well. Do not wish to post this on Google but there is no way for me to share my review or feedback in app.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111083777629675681618/reviews

Michael Chiew,5,"Great initiative for our medical needs!

My experiences visiting physical clinics have never been great, especially given our system of proving sickness through medical certificates. Sacrificing almost half of my resting time to queue for both a consultation and medication seems very inefficient.

With this ‚Äòteleconsultation‚Äô practice, I‚Äôm now able to prioritize more rest during my days of illness as it is very convenient, extremely efficient, and fast, to say the least. I probably save a few hours each time. Thank you so much!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109077745021522804426/reviews
