Surely patients are unwell and won‚Äôt want to come early to wait. Why aren‚Äôt considerations been given to patients?\nAlso with the day‚Äôs appointments that are full, why isn‚Äôt there any form of communication, like showing it online?\nEu Ren Sang needs to be more customer focus and think about how it should compete in this TCM market.",
