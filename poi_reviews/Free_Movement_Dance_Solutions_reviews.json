      "text": "It was a wonderful and stress-free experience engaging Free Movement Sewing for my daughterâ€™s first romantic tutu! The team was responsive and even had YouTube video to help us take accurate measurements.\n\nThe end result of the tutu has exceeded our expectations. Not only does the tutu turned out gorgeous, the material used is also very comfortable! Not only that, they were efficient and delivered the tutu earlier than expected! The fitting at the studio also went smoothly. Sandra was really friendly and took time to walk us through the things to take note.\n\nOnce again, thank you Sandra for the amazing tutu!",
