Michael Ong,2,"Choice of food were great but

1) typical hot beverages pricing is too high. This will likely be the first coffee shop that have their hot beverages breaking the $2 per cup barrier.

2) they have a pet üêÄ running around the outlet.. usually in the morning when it's less crowded.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105906997969114072362/reviews
