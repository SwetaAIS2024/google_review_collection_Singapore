GoAheadGroupFan,5,"On Friday 7 February 2025, I had roasted chicken rice with egg and crispy beancurd for my lunch at the Kopitiam Corner food court in Yew Tee Square next to Yew Tee MRT station, and I liked this meal as the roasted chicken rice with egg and crispy beancurd tasted very delicious. Overall, the service provided to me was very good and I would love to try these other chicken rice dishes from this outlet in the future.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105877449322822053371/reviews
