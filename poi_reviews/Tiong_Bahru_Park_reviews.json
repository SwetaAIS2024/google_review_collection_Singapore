There's also sand in the park and kids love to play in the sand and built sand castles! Surely one of the most fun parks for kids around. There are also two flying foxes set up and my first time seeing this in a playground! There are also other playground set up for toddlers as well as an exercise park for the elderly. Extremely impressed by this park set up. A 'must' visit for kids!!! And it's free too.",
