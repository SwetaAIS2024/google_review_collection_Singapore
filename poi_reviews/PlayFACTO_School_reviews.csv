Nurwahidah Wahid,5,"My girl went to playfacto jurong for the past 3 years. Activities are well prepared. The centre is clean. Teachers always share feedback on children and their development. The food is good. School holidays are the best as they plan a lot of interesting activities for the children. My girl is sad, leaving playfacto as she is in the upper primary and no longer needs to be in student care. Playfacto is a student care centre that I would recommend all parents ðŸ˜€",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112684847326768288372/reviews
