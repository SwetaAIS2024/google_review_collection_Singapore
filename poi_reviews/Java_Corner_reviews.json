Used to be in an old coffeeshop along Margaret drive next to Queenstown library before moving to this location. Best eaten in the morning when they are freshly prepared, especially the small curry puff.  Reasonable pricing and generous portion for $3.50 for most dishes. Food is still good and service is prompt.  Only problem is the limited parking and seatings in the coffeeshop.",
