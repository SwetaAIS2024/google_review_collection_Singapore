Faith Koh,5,"The art lessons here in Peiper are really unique and different. It lets child explores various textures, materials and techniques to create 3D art pieces, instead 2D drawings only.

The art lessons here allows child to explore, really create and craft.

Also, lessons together with storytelling are conducted in chinese by the lead teacher / founder and  who is a local Singaporean.

My child looks forward to the art lessons every week without fail.

Highly recommended!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117364772659768071236/reviews

A Tan,5,"My girl has been attending Peiper Arts School for several months now, and always look forward to class every week! The art pieces taught are incredibly imaginative and unique, allowing students to express themselves freely.

The school also emphasizes on sustainability and will incorporate recycled materials into their art projects. Additionally, teachers engage in story telling to make the art process interesting and interactive.

We are glad to have found Peiper where teachers are patient, encouraging and passionate about art.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115873972920299187032/reviews
