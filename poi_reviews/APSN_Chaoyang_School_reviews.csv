Sean,1,Teacher and School Principal did not care about the students and no patience to students. Trying to make fun of students and force the students to leave the school. This is school for mild intellectual disability (MID) but yet the Teachers and School Principal fail to show extra care to the students that needs help. Worst school ever.. the teacher should review herself and resign from the school. Not worth even for 1 star but need to rate 1 star to post.. pls think twice to choose this school.. you will definitely regret for your kid to enroll.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110925199479304699749/reviews
