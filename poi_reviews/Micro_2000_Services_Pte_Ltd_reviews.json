      "text": "I have recently renewed my fibre broadband contract and went to +Serv (a member of Micro2000 Group) to collect the new router on 19 Mar 2018 only to be disappointed that it was closed for stocktaking.\n\nWhen I reached there, there was already a small group of Singtel customers arguing with +Serv staff who stubbornly refused to serve us. They were pointing fingers at Singtel for the communication breakdown.\n\nBoth Singtel and +Serv should share the blame as there were no prior communication which impacted customers about the stocktaking.\n\nTheir arrogance and contempt for Singtel customers are unacceptable! While they are blaming each other, as customers, we are still waiting for an appropriate service recovery!",
