Skyler Tan,4,"I love this school its the best because the people here are very nice and friendly. It is important to have good and hardworking students around you so they encourage you to be a better student. I am inspired by others to do better. This school is very good, but the only thing thats bad about the school is the toilets. Some can be bad, some can be good but most of them donâ€™t have toilet paper. Foodwise, it is very good. The teachers are also very kind and push you to be a better student and person. Also I really like the polo tee and pe attire it makes me look very sigma. (Cool) CCA choices are not that much, but the CCAs are very good and fun. Although some teachers are bad, most are great. The DM is very strict, but its just because he cares for the students. Overall I think TKSS (Tanjong Katong Secondary School) is a very great school. I can see how Lawrence Wong became Prime Minister.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110503547699907064244/reviews
