Vanessa Small,5,Creative and amazing beers right in the middle of some amazing hawker stalls. As I've said in many reviews about drinking in SG I'd rather pay for good beer than regular beer and these beers really hit the spot. The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable as well. A hidden gem in SG. Highly recommend.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107374311413868428116/reviews
Ryan Atwill,5,"Beautiful craft beers, in an easy going hawker center. 12 taps of their own Ren Min beers as well as a good can fridge.

Highly recommend a visit to support a small local brewery!

Easy going lager, beautiful hazy.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116674668092699101694/reviews
Michael Geoffrey,3,"Cool concept, pricey craft beer. You cant try anything on tap so just gotta trust your gut with the purchase. Had a beer recommended by another customer sipping on his beer.

Horrible service, as in the person behind the counter with the buzz cut simply doesn’t wanna be there. Pictured is a can I bought to takeaway, when asked “which one would you recommend for me to take home?”, he answered “dont know, never tried & obviously i wont try”. Lol ok bud.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115826623587872143959/reviews
Blake Cronyn,5,"Great micro-brewery drink spot inside of Maxwell’s. Great beers on tap including their own and guest brewers. The $17 pint is a little high, but the experience is worth it and the beer tastes great. Tons of food options in Maxwell’s to pair your beers with.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103976262501546427886/reviews
lontongstroong,5,"Quite nice craft beer place in strategic part of the downtown. Always come back whenever I have free time roaming or just simply orienteering in the area. Offers locally-produced/brewed and imported (mostly American) craft beers alike, which are a bit on the high side (common problem among craft beer places in SG). IPAs, lagers, and fruit beers (like citrus and berry beers) are a bit overrepresented in the roster.

Lots of great nibbles to be paired with the beers, particularly fritters, popiah, oyster omelette, and radish omelette (chay tow kway).",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews
