Lonesome Boss,5,"I appreciate The Body Shop's strong commitment to cruelty-free practices. Their transparency on this issue is refreshing, and it ensures their products are ethically sourced and never tested on animals.

In addition to their ethical approach, I've always had positive experiences with the staffs. There's no hard selling. They're friendly, knowledgeable about the products, and happy to answer questions about what works best for different skin types or how to use specific products.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113993294785867614530/reviews
