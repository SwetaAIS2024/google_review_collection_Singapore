It has been five years, and it is still like this. I also found that other customers are a little disappointed. I don't know why the stall owner doesn't make some improvements? !\n\n22 Sept 23‚Äô\n\nSame as before, there is still no PayNow QR Code printed for customers to scan and pay online. The waiter even said rudely: The boss didn't print it for me!",
