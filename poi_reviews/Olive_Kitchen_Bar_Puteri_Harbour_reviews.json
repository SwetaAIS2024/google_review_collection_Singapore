The music was not too loud, we were probably louder. ðŸ˜… Food was fantastic! I highly recommend the chicken masala pizza. The lamb pizza wasn't as good as the chicken Pizza. The Kilkenny pint was nice as well. Dessert brownie was rich and sweet. I hope to visit again in the future. Keep up the great work.",

His calm, friendly demeanor and warm service really stood out and made us feel right at home.\n\nThank you for such a lovely experience â€” weâ€™ll definitely be coming back!",
