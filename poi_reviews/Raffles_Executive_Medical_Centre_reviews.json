I asked her to check again and then she realized her mistake and proceeded to help me. If you don’t ask them to check their mistakes they will waste your time. A doctor later entered an incorrect weight into an important application and I only happened to double check. Not sure what’s wrong with everyone here.",

Somehow today was a bit quick. But then I forgot to collect or doc forgot to provide me with the medical Certificate. So to fix this, I have been calling every number given to me. Its  more then an hour. And its frustrating to have no response.",
