      "text": "The Geylang Lorong ‚Äú19‚Äù Frog Porridge\n\n‚ÄúThe only recommended Michelin Frog Porridge in Singapore‚Äù\n\nFrog porridge may sound unusual to some, but it's a dish I appreciate, especially since many of us in Thailand enjoy frog, even if we don't prepare it in the Singaporean way. For those who haven't tried it, it might seem intimidating at first, but I assure you, it's far tastier than you might expect, and you'll find it hard to stop eating once you start. The spicy version, in particular, pairs wonderfully with the smooth, plain rice porridge, and the sauce is simply fantastic. The texture of frog meat is similar to chicken, but it's even better because it's lean and naturally sticky, containing no fat at all. This dish is a must-have for me whenever I'm in Singapore, and I consider this particular spot to be the best among the popular places.\n\nOther menus on this meal are:\n- Sambal Kang Kong\n- Minced Meat Fried Tofu",

Whilst the meat is really fresh, the sauce is really also much too sweet.

Clearly, the competition for Geylang frog porridge is intense. This place seems to attract more locals, and even late at night, there‚Äôs a long queue outside. The portions here are generous and very reasonably priced. Salted egg yolk crab was only $50 per crab, and the frog porridge deal was $18 for two frogs with one free. Honestly, I regret spending $96 on chili crab and $9 per frog at another place before discovering this gem.",
