Jean Asaytuno,5,"I always look forward to the Saturday class cos I am excited to learn new techniques from Christina. I admire her patience to teach, most especially I am not so good with the crafts side (binding, tying, wrapping).  Also, I am glad that I enroled to the Hand Bouquets Intermediate Level as Christina has lots of talents / experience to share. I can see that made some improvements from Basic and grateful for it. Thanks again Christina.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102505537726871075392/reviews
Mag Zhou,5,"After learning the guidelines in floral arrangement & with hands on practice, I am now more confident in doing floral arrangement by myself. I'm very happy with the trainer as she taught the current floral arrangement style. The flowers she used blended very well with the colour scheme. The final arrangement is very pleasing to the eye. My friends also like the arrangements.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105375983471044924111/reviews

Siew Wei Chin,5,"I have recently completed the basic and intermediate Flower Design course. The program was well organized, professional and gave me the hands-on experience.
The classes were small enough to get one on one feedback on each design. I especially like the hands-on experience which developed confidence in each specific style.
The instructor Christina is a very talented floral designer but also patient with beginner students like me. She always gives the students just the right mix of encouragement and honest critical assessment for further improvement.
I wanted to express my sincere appreciation for teaching and everything. So now I enjoy designing flowers for myself, family and our temple!
I highly recommend the Creativeworkz flower design course.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116123087446531127160/reviews
