Devin Tai,5,"one of the only few stalls that still open for business at 4pm on tuesday, fresh ingredients",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113874302526634426422/reviews
Jason Boh,5,"I am reluctant to share this review, because itâ€™s so good I hope thereâ€™s no queue thatâ€™s going to form over time. This place is low profile but the fish is absolutely very fresh, thick with a hinge of sweetness and the fish taste doesnâ€™t linger in your mouth after meal. Their seafood fish soup is good especially if youâ€™re a fan of fish roe and if they have it available as it only brings in limited amount of fish roe daily I heard.

My father who is a foodie brought me here and I crave for it sometimes that I come back myself often. ðŸ˜‚

You wonâ€™t need to stand and queue for a long time unlike some other fish soups. This is definitely a must come for if I ever crave for fish soup.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111615819197417174789/reviews
GIO Tan,5,The original yummy fresh batang fish soup stall already changed ownership although the name of the stall remains the same. Price increased and quality cannot compare to the previous stall. So sad as this was our regular stall.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101845441933938107829/reviews
