The trail is amazing - helps get away from the urban Singapore to get a feel for nature. All trails around the central green area including this are definitely recommended.",

The Prunus Trail is about 2km, but can be combined with other trails to be longer. I go here often to start my hikes.",

People are strolling along, while some are having a jog. If we observe carefully, sightings of monkey, tortoise, squirrel, birds, and even wild boars are possible. It is a good trail to spend for an hour so strolling in nature. The Prunus Trail leads to Petai Trail after 1km plus from entrance of the trail.",
