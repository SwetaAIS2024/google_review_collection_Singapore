      "text": "Usually wouldnt write a review but i must say the service that Dr Soh provided were excellent. Went to this clinic for my ear problem which the normal GP clinic diagnose as middle ear infection few months back.Decided to consult Dr Soh found by my parents and after reading good reviews about this clinic, decided to give it a try. Dr Soh had a different opinion and gave out the diagnose as ETD as my hearing has been softer and i just recovered from common cold. Dr Soh is a really nice and passionate doctor who really knows his stuff well. He explained the process while clearing up my ear wax and assured that my ear will get better soon. Queries from whatsapp were answered .",

      "text": "I never seen a doctor so enthusiastic and eager to see me get well. I felt Dr Soh really love what he’s doing.\n\nI have flaky skin in my ears and eye lids for a year. It keeps recurring and it was frustrating for me.\n\nSo during my visits to Dr Soh, my issues were mostly cleared up within 2 visits.\n\nWhat also impresses me is that I find Dr Soh putting in effort and care when he was cleaning the inner canal of my ears.\n\nIn the past, I had experienced doctors who treat me like some specimen on an operating table and do their job professionally. Nothing wrong with that, but I felt Dr Soh went beyond that and put in more care with me, and probably all his other patients as well.",

      "text": "Dr Soh is truly an exceptional doctor! I recently had the pleasure of being under his care for a cyst removal procedure on my neck which required surgery and stitches. What sets Dr Soh apart from other GPs is his unique ability to provide both medical care and surgical expertise.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed by his outstanding expertise, professionalism, confidence and compassion. From the initial consultation to the post-operative follow-up, Dr Soh took the time to explain everything clearly, answering all my questions and alleviating any concerns I had. His bedside manner is warm, reassuring and immediately put me at ease.\n\nThe charges were also clearly communicated to me before the surgery and I found them to be fair and reasonable.\n\nI'd also like to extend my gratitude to the receptionist (unfortunately, I didn't catch her name) who provided exceptional assistance to Dr Soh during the procedure despite being pregnant. The teamwork between Dr Soh and his assistant was seamless and I appreciate their collaborative approach to my care.\n\nI highly recommend Dr Soh and his team to anyone seeking medical attention, especially those requiring surgical care. Their dedication to delivering top-notch patient care is genuine and I feel fortunate to have had them by my side during this experience.\n\nThank you Dr Soh and congratulations on opening your own clinic! You're an asset to the medical community!",

However, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the clinic was incredibly well-equipped. Instead of a long process, my issue was diagnosed and treated on the spot, all within 10 minutes! The efficiency and level of care were outstanding - highly recommended!",

After trying multiple doctors with no lasting results, Dr. Soh’s treatment brought significant and lasting relief within just a few months. Since then, he has become our trusted family doctor. His holistic and effective approach to treatment has helped us through various health issues over the years. We’re truly grateful for his care and expertise.",
