      "text": "My first attempt to visit this clinic despite my place nearby has three clinics. I had diarrhoea, suffered severe stomach plains consistently and I waited for 1.5 hours due to 10 patients in-front of me. I was treated by Dr Ben Lim. Though he looked young, I was amazed by his patience, medical knowledge and meticulously thoroughly checked my stomach. Asked relevant questions that I had overlooked to provide them during registration, as he could tell I was in pains. After 2 days meditation, I am getting better. In addition, I would like to appraise the admin staff who picked calls less than 2 mins, willing to help me when needs arises. Thank you so much!",

      "text": "Brought my helper here for her 6ME check-up. When we arrived, we were told there were 11 patients ahead of us. The nurse at the counter helped take her blood test, height, and weight, which was efficient. However, we ended up waiting for over an hour just to see the doctor. The actual consultation lasted barely a minute—the doctor simply asked if she had any questions and that was it. The long wait time for such a brief interaction was disappointing. Unfortunately, we won’t be returning here due to the inefficiency.",

My personal favorite is Dr Tommie who always went above and beyond to listen, understand, assess and advice include all the way to post recovery! As a surgeon, he also treated one of my wound well. Consultation was thorough, even though longer than usual but I think most patients willing to wait, that’s why at times the clinic super long queue. Nurses are friendly and helpful too!",

The first time my infant was attended by Dr Tommie Choo who was very caring and treated my infant very well.  I came back for follow up and Dr Ang (Locum) gave very good advice about my infant's other conditions. I must say this clinic is exceptional as all the doctors are very professional, knowledgeable and caring. Even the receptionists followed up on my infant's condition. Keep up the good work!",
