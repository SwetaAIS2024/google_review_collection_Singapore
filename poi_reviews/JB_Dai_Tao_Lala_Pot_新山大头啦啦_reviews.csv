AENJUN CHU,5,"My family and I truly enjoyed our dining experience here. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, and the food was absolutely delicious. We were served by Miss Loo, who was incredibly polite and helpful — she recommended several dishes that we ended up loving. Excellent service all around. We’ll definitely be returning!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110091515391909863694/reviews
Michelle Ong,5,Always had a great experience dining here. Was served by waitress Loo for the last 2 times. Her service is really impeccable and always serve with a smile. All other staffs are equally good and friendly and always attentive to every table. You’ll always feel welcome coming here. Had lala steamboat and it tasted truly amazing. It’s a must try! Thanks for the great food and even greater service!,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116353693867958847382/reviews
Julius Tan,3,"Soup is just ok, nothing worth writing about. The lala pot feels more like a gimmick than good food. Anyhow, Macau has lala pots many years ago before JB did, all they did was to copy the concept and this House of Seafood copied from the Johor Bahru copycats lol. Honestly would rather eat their crabs, more worth it.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113038098593710664705/reviews
Candice Tan,5,"The lala pot is savory. Clams clean, no sand.We also order a mee goreng and satay on the side. The noodles is super delicious. Service is excellent! Even though just order lala pot they came to change the plates for us. Will come back to try the crabs and seafood.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100078775839091241440/reviews
Mark Loon,5,"Every table gets their own bottle of huatiao. Do what you want with it. We emptied it by the end of the meal. Hotpot by the seaside. What could go wrong? Not the food but it was a windless night.
We took advantage of the 20% grabpay offer.
This is part of House of Seafood so … not saying anything. We were billed the wrong table when we checked out. Good thing wifey checked the bill or we would be paying for our next table.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104166419725237581956/reviews
