The lady bartender was attentive and friendly. ‚óè When I requested her to customise my Cafe Latte with more milk, she acceded to my request happily. üåø Before we left, she asked my hubby if the coffees were okay. üôèüèª The Cafe Lattes were rich and creamy, thank you bartender for the kind hospitality:)\n\nüü™  I flipped through the Club 5 Menu and saw it has an extensive and diverse range of bar snacks.\n\nüüß The live band at Club 5 was amazing, and the lead vocalist exceeded my expectations.‚ñ™Ô∏é When I requested 'Too Sweet' by Hozier, they happily obliged, and the performance was awesome. ‚óè The intimate setting and acoustic instrumentation added to the charm of the evening.\n\nüåøüîµ Our first visit to Club 5 was a pleasant and happy one. The combination of great coffee and excellent service made for a memorable evening.\n\nüñ§Dated 1st May 2025 / Thurs",

The decor/ playlist is a bit curious, kind of like a mixed bag, but all in all a reliable spot.",

      "text": "I struggled to like this place. The hotel lobby ambience is quite good after the renovation and the Club 5 has also been renovated during COVID and was just recently launched. I like the Club 5 decor as it reminds me a bygone era but renewed with a lot of taste of classic modern.\n\nThe bar looks good, but on closer look they don't carry a lot of good spirits, just the typical ones. Then there is this big Negroni sign by Campari that just ruins the mood in my opinion, understand it's a sponsorship still it ruins the decor I feel.\n\nThe drink menu needs to be redone, I get a bit confused as I was first served a menu then later they told me it's the old menu. The paper is crumpled, a lot of pen marks and also stapled together at the back that just makes it super cheap + the font is super small even for my eyes plus the dark environment makes it harder to read (imagine for older people). Then they serve me the flight of cocktails and things are looking better. The flight menu of cocktails is definitely better. I guess I'll give it a second shot next time.\n\nThe music and the ambiance on the other hand I feel clash. The DJ is young and I feel is playing music that doesn't gel well with the decor, plus the disco lights is way too Saturday Night fever than just having a good classic old dancing floor that I heard this place is trying to reminisce.\n\nSo overall it's a mixed feelings for me.",
