HatSoup,4,"Pretty good halal food place in Rail Mall, open for breakfast till supper. Food is great, drinks like the frappe are of good quality too

However, price can be quite expensive for even something like pasta and a frappe (roughly 18 dollars)",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114254915608219641779/reviews
Ming Hui,5,One of my fav coffee bean outlets in Singapore. It's a nice chill place after walking along the green corridor. Coffee is alright. This outlet has also been recently renovated too. Will be back !,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108198322351045531056/reviews
Viva La Vida,3,"Looking at the reviews, it seemed like a recurring problem of slow service. The young lady who served me yesterday was friendly, helpful and I could see that she's trying her best to juggle everything from taking and preparing the orders to attending to everyone's requests like a one man show. Couldn't fault her, in fact I think she's doing a great job. This outlet is understaffed, it's too overwhelming for the workers and too long a wait for the patrons.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101978204761063024043/reviews
