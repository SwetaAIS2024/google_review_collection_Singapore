Ho Robert,5,"This station has a historical landmark: Masjid Malabar Mosque; Hotel Boss is located at this station. The Rochor River next to the hotel is now as beautiful as a riverside garden! There are dining rooms and food courts on the hotel floor, and there are many famous local delicacies. I often take the bus to come here specifically to look for delicious food.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105753813256061140265/reviews
