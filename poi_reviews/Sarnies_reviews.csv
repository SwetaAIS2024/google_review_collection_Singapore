Tan. W,3,"Haven’t been back in a while, and it’s still just as crowded — always a good sign! I customised my own breakfast and absolutely loved the combo I put together. Portions were generous and definitely satisfying.

The Flat White, however, was a bit of a letdown for me. Not quite a fan of the beans they used this time.

As for the breakfast ingredients, the spinach was a standout, and the egg was done just right, though at $6, it’s definitely on the pricey side for a single add-on.

After a few bites, the overall flavour leaned a little salty across all ingredients, but it was still really tasty and enjoyable.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103022836553318535151/reviews

Benjamin Hiah,4,"“Grilled mushrooms” weren’t really grilled so that was slightly disappointing. They tasted and seemed more boiled and very gently pan fried for a while.

Aside from that, the rest of the food was nice and staff were really nice, kind and gave good recommendation too! Thank you for the meal.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106814474317271057709/reviews
