      "text": "I was at Bt Timah Plaza on Tuesday 8 April and was served by a lady named Vivienne .\nI approached her for assistance to book online as I cldnt find the items I wanted .  Vivienne has nicely assisted to pick up the items I wanted.  Told her that I will pay for delivery to hv these items sent to my home  as they were too heavy for me to carry home being an elderly person . To my surprised vivienne offered to send these items without any charge on her way home.  I was certainly taken aback for her kindness and willingness to help which is beyond her call of duties .\nI sincerely appreciate her help but felt bad on my part for imposing on her .\nTo this - she certainly deserved to be complimented and applauded by her services rendered .  Thank you so so much Vienne . Your kindness will always be remembered.",
