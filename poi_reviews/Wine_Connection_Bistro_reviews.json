      "text": "Had a fantastic dining experience at Wine Connection. Every dish we ordered was flavorful and well-prepared. The lamb rack was perfectly cooked and tender, while the BBQ pork ribs were fall-off-the-bone delicious with a great smoky glaze. We also really enjoyed the gambas ‚Äîjuicy and full of garlic flavour‚Äîand the shrimp risoni salad, which was light, fresh, and a great complement to the richer dishes. The service was attentive and friendly, and the atmosphere was relaxed but stylish. Definitely a great spot for a casual yet satisfying meal with a good wine selection to match. Will strongly recommend! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòã",

      "text": "The steaks were good. However two were undercooked. They were supposed to be medium well but came more to a medium as compared to the steaks we have elsewhere. There were no oozing blood but the meat was quite reddish. The lamb cutlets were huge but half were fats. Fries were great. My friend enjoyed the ambience too. Service is good too! Staff were polite. Manager Raj was kind too.",

      "text": "I have ate here a few times and the food standard has been consistent. The service is good too. Weekday deals are good as their lunch set is $16.90++ with a soup, main and a drink. I aways come for the dessert set which is $9.90++. It comes with a dessert and a drink of your choice. The apple crumble is the best! It has nicely cooked apples topped with yummy buttery crumbly crumbles and a scoop of vanilla ice cream! So good! The restaurant here is also a nice place to have lunch, get some work done or just chill and hang out!",
