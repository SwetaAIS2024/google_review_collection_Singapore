      "text": "People love bubble tea but I love a good flat white. I came to pick up muffins from another stall and stopped by here for a quick break. I wasnâ€™t expecting the flat white to be that good! Creamy and full bodied! The coffee wasnâ€™t too acidic and it had a nice roasted flavor. I was shocked at the size of the cup I got for the price I paid! Would definitely be back!\n\nAlso I got sparkling tea on a whim for my brother and he loved it! We thought it would be gimmicky but now we wish we could get more sparkling tea! It was lightly sweetened, just enough to complement the tea.",

The one that I tried was a little flat and the glass was not chilled. At $12-$17 per 500ml, the price was also not very attractive for such a normal experience at a hawker centre.\n\nThe owner was friendly so Iâ€™ll definitely return to try the other drinks.",

      "text": "Thereâ€™s no shortage of good food in this area and with this stall here I think itâ€™s safe to say that thereâ€™s no shortage of good drinks too ðŸ˜† Best mocha Iâ€™ve had in ages - the sweetness is subtle, the coffee is aromatic and the milk doesnâ€™t overpower the other flavours at all. I also like that the coffees here are offered in small sizes. As for the sparkling tea, itâ€™s refreshing and the flavour is very unique. Donâ€™t expect soda water levels of carbonation itâ€™s more of a subtle mouthfeel kinda thing.\n\nThe boss runs a one man show and his effort shines through when you watch him crafting the drinks. Be prepared to wait a bit if thereâ€™s a queue.",
