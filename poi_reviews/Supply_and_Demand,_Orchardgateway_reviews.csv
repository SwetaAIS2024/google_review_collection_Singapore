Timothy Lim,4,"Went for dinner with friends. Food was decent for the price, nothing to shout about. Atmosphere was nice and lively, live music was also a plus.

Overall, service was normal with the dishes we ordered coming out rather quickly upon ordering. Nice place to chill on a Saturday evening.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103773064420955939275/reviews
Nic Tay,4,"Been coming over here for the üçï and pasta.

A great place for a group of people to share the variety of food. Their Risotto ü•ò is nice too :)

Today, we shared a BIG Morning after Pizza and loved the thin crust.

The lunch menu is not too bad! Recommend for üë´ too :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103485093872007184061/reviews
YT,4,"Visited this place for a quick lunch with a friend. The staff were friendly, and the atmosphere was really pleasant, making it a comfortable spot to relax. The pasta was rich and flavorful, though it was a bit on the dry side. The pizza, however, was great and definitely stood out. Overall, a solid dining experience!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116335289933602715039/reviews
Yustinus Albert,5,"Supply & Demand is a fantastic spot! The food imo is delicious, with an Italian-Western influence. The ambiance is fantastic, and the live music creates a perfect atmosphere.

They also offer a good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.

I really recommend this place if u just want to chill out or hang out with ur friends + tasting the delicious foods",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112291600353723208725/reviews
Jovan Soh,5,"Surprising Find! Awesome vibes & Italian food!

If you are feeling bougie (fancy), one of my top recommendation!

Pizza - Half Smoked Salmon / Half Morning After
Smoked Salmon was okay, but morning after was awesome! The egg yolk just makes the pizza feel a lot more creamy.

The flatbread with Brie Cheese was surprising... One of the staff recommended it. The flatbread has a strong garlicky and herby taste. The brie was super creamy and matched perfectly with the honey almond! Perfect combination of sweet and savoury!

Ended the meal with their Tiramisu, although it was slightly pricey, it was worth it!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106114209861351714576/reviews
