Good food overall but definitely not worth SGD490. A few of the dishes were just very ordinary dishes where you can find at most Chinese restaurants. The restaurant is located inside of the shopping mall. Maybe it was full of customers that day, the whole place was too warm and that made it less enjoyable for us.",
