      "text": "It’s rare to find a yoga studio in Singapore that treats yoga as more than just a workout, but this place does exactly that. My experience here has been truly transformative, especially with the yin and yang yoga classes.\nPracticing these styles has deepened my understanding of my body, teaching me how to balance effort and ease while connecting with my own limits and potential.\nHighly recommend to anyone who’s looking to experience the deeper benefits of yoga practice.",

The instructors Mdm Khoo, Gina and Clarice are attentive to the students especially to beginners in assisting to adjust postures according to individual body condition. I always feel refreshed and relaxed after each yoga session at Living Yoga especially after a long day working in the office. Highly recommended.",
