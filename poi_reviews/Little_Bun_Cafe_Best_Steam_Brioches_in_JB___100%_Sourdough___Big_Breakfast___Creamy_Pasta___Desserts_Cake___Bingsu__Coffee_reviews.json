They will steam the brioche bread in front of you but my expectation was higher for the price in term of taste. The waitress/cashier was really bubbly and helpful. Overall not bad, the prices are on the high sides, but if you like the environment can just order drinks/brioche to enjoy the environment, free water available on every table.",

      "text": "If you have been to Mil toast house in Korea or in Bangkok, this minimalist cafe reminds me of it with its interior and aesthetics. Was quite surprised to see that the cafe was crowded at 11am when I visited on a weekday. üòÆ\n\nDecided to try their recommended steamed brioche bun which comes two sauces of your choice - I chose cream butter and honey kaya. Taste wise, I think it‚Äôs was a bit disappointing in terms of the kaya that they gave. It was a bit watery, I couldn‚Äôt really taste the fragrance of the kaya? The steam bun was soft and fluffy, though I think it didn‚Äôt have the ‚Äòwow‚Äô factor? Maybe should have ordered the ham and cheese bun instead üòÖ\n\nThe truffle mushroom pasta on the other hand was impressive though. The flavour was rich and most importantly you can taste the truffle. Their coffee was not bad. ‚òïÔ∏è\nI could taste the caramel in my coffee which is great, because sometimes the flavour isn‚Äôt quite exactly there. The tiramisu coffee was yummy too. Overall, the food wasn‚Äôt so bad. If you‚Äôre planning to come here, do try and come early to get a seat as the cafe isn‚Äôt very big as well üëçüèº",

I will surely come back soon to try their pastas! üòç\n\nAtmosphere:\nIt is great for relaxing, and their coffee cup is adorable. Music is also very chill.\n\nCheesecake:\nNot too sweet, very soft, crumbly and decadent.\n\nCoffee:\nFinally found a coffee place near me that doesn't have any burnt taste and less acidic.\n\nService:\nThe staff here are wonderful, sweet and very professional ü´∂\n\nAdditional remarks:\nWiFi is provided üòÅ",
