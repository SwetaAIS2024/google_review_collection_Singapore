Ju J,4,"Juicy big Wonton üëçüèªFresh
Noodles taste good with the sauce
Good portion for the price
If CharSiew can be slice thinner will taste better because they use lean meat thus too thick make it tough to eat",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106278867864241364210/reviews
Chunwen Huang,4,"Came by for breakfast, this stall has one of the longest queue. Pay with FairPrice app for 10% discount!

Ordered the wanton noodle with shrimp dumpling soup. Shrimp dumplings and Wanton have a good bite & water chestnut added texture. Noodle texture is chewy,
sauce is flavourful enough to cover the ghee taste of noodles. Charsiew was average though, so this is truly a place to get your wanton/ dumpling fix!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101636541114526759357/reviews
WT Wong,4,"Probably the best wanton noodle in Yew Tee. I ordered extra wantons and shrimp dumplings with spinach green noodle which is quite uncommon in most wanton noodle stalls.
Wanton and dumplings were fresh and skin were smooth but not dry. Was bit disappointed with the noodle as I can taste hint of ""kee"" instead of spinach. This is probably their source of noodle supply is not good.
Overall, I am very satisfied with the meal!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116204037022034321113/reviews
Joshua Chew,5,"Bought the budget meal set which only cost $3! Specifically this meal is not subjected to Kopitiam Discount since it is already so cheap. This meal is also the healthier choice meal, so you get a QR code which you can scan in Healthy 365 and earn points. Service was good as the staff cooked quickly and I received my food about 3-5min after I ordered despite the long queue. The food portion is just right and the ingredients are fresh. The staff are friendly and enthusiastic too. Really a hidden gem if you crave Char Siew Hor Fun/ Wanton Noodles.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100928805220966571942/reviews
