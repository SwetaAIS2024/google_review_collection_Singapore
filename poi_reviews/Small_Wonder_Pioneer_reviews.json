      "text": "I am truly beyond grateful for everything Small Wonder Pioneer Preschool has done for my family. Both my daughters, one in K2 and one in N1, have blossomed so beautifully under the care and guidance of the amazing teachers here.\nEvery teacher is so dedicated, patient, and full of heart. It is clear how much love and effort they pour into teaching, caring for, and nurturing each child every day. From daily lessons to special events like performances, they always go the extra mile to make every moment meaningful.\nSeeing my girls so happy and excited to go to school every day is the best reassurance any parent could ask for. They would even share stories about their day during the car ride home or while getting ready for bed, and those moments are truly precious to me.\nI am so thankful I chose Small Wonder Pioneer. It is more than just a preschool. It is a second home filled with warmth, care, and encouragement.\nThank you from the bottom of our hearts for creating such a wonderful environment for our children to learn, grow, and shine.",

      "text": "As I recalled back, it is quite hard to choose Small Wonder Pioneer which is quite far from our home. No vacancy in other  centres. Little reviews can be found during our time when we want to enrol our daughter for Playgroup. Nevertheless, we entrust our daughter's well-being to the teachers & Principal.\n\nParents are often kept informed of the curriculum, health of our children and activities in & out of school via the app which is easy to access. Teachers are very helpful, caring & make the effort to communicate with parents. Applause to the teachers & Principal at Small Wonder Pioneer for their dedication & patience üëèüéâ",
