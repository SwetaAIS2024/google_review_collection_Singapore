      "text": "The coffee shop has various stalls, from Cai Png (mixed vegetable rice), tze char, Japanese Fusion mee pok, and some others.\n\nI tried the dish from the Japanese Fusion mee pok (Li Yuan) stall. The mee pok was cooked to a good doneness, and their miso-based sauce gave the dish a unique savouriness, and their chilli gave the dish a bit of a kick. The toppings were very generous - with abalone, meatballs, fishball, minced meat, and the Japanese-style chashu, along with some lard. The soup is also very tasty.",

Price still okay.. just that had an unpleasant experience last Friday as the old uncle collected away my plate when I was drinking my oolong tea, he simply assume that my plate with about two small spoon of food left is unwanted. Too late even to stop him…😐",

My order 2 meat 2 veggie for $3.70. Generous with the scooping!",

My partner and I buy them very regularly (at least thrice a week) because they’re so darn good. The dough is chewy and the salted egg yolk in it has the perfect consistency and taste > it OOZES out! The uncle actually went to Hong Kong to learn how to make dimsum. Do support uncle if you’re ever there!",
