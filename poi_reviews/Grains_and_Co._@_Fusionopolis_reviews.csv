James Ng,5,"Very positive first experience buying from this place. I'm not exactly a grains bowl kind of guy, but boy, this place really does it very well in terms of value pricing, portion and taste of food. Though I recall that prices have went up for the Mini, hope the Gain and Regular will remain the same as a major selling point of this eatery is their price to value ratio! Selection of ingredients are excellent with a wide range of variety. Enjoyed my first bowl with them very much!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116254632820670119784/reviews
