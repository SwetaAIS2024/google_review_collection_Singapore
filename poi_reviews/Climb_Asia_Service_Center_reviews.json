      "text": "Climb Asia has a physical store called Crank Factory that's up on the 2nd level of Focus One Building.\n\nInitially when I entered, I thought I went to the wrong place as it looks much small compared to the photos shown on Google map.\n\nAfter checking with the people who worked in other stores at Focus one, I confirmed that it's the correct place.\n\nYou have to enter into the office area to let them know you are looking to try their climbing shoes and other equipments.\n\nThey have a very friendly staff to help you get the size of the shoes and harness you want. He also has knowledge of whether the shoe is considered too big for you or not.\n\nDo give a call to them before going down to check if they have your shoe size. Just nice when I visit them, they ran out of my shoe size.\n\nOverall, I had a pleasant experience with them.",
