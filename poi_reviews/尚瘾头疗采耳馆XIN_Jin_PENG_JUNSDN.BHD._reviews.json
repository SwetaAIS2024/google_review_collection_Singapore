      "text": "At 8:30 PM, I googled for an ear cleaning treatment shop and found that this shop was the only one nearby that was open while the others were closed. I WhatsApped the shop‚Äôs number and sent a video of my earwax blockage, showing the blocked passage inside my ear canal. The earwax had hardened, and my attempts to clear it were futile and quite painful.\n\nJunjun told me that a trained professional was needed to remove it and advised me to come over. I arrived at the shop at 9 PM and was welcomed with a hot cup of Chinese tea while I waited. After 10 minutes, I changed my mind and decided to see a doctor instead. However, Junjun was very determined and assured me that she could clear the hardened earwax at a good price. I agreed.\n\nIt was the right decision, she was very gentle, making me feel comfortable and kept asking me if I was ok eventhough I could not speak chinese. She did an excellent job‚ÄîI finally regained my hearing in my left ear! She was a savior, incredibly patient, and highly professional. After that visit, I felt that even if I had gone to a doctor, they might not have been able to remove the earwax as gently and fast as Junjun did. I was truly grateful, and only God can repay her kindness.\n\nHere is the before-and-after video of the earwax removal, along with a picture of the extracted earwax‚Äîit was as big as a small popcorn!\n\nThank you Junjun, highly recommended. Job well done!",
