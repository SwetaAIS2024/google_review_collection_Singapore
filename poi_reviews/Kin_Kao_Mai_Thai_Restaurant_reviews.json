      "text": "Great ambience with warm lighting that mimics Thailand‚Äôs street dining scene. Food was flavourful and of decent portion! My favourite dish was the pork trotter which was especially tender and delicious. Pad Thai, chicken wings with thai herbs, and seafood tom yum were other very solid choices. Friendly service and relaxed vibes make this a great spot for casual dining. Will definitely be back for an affordable and emjoyable meal with my friends and family !",

The prawn cakes were generously sized with plenty of springy prawns, though I found them a bit oily‚Äîbut that‚Äôs just me being picky! The fried seafood mama noodles were packed with seafood, the tom yum soup had a lovely tang and came with huge prawns. The pork jowl was grilled to smoky tenderness, and the steamed lime seabass was incredibly fresh and appetizing. Overall, I truly enjoyed my meal here!",

I had the seafood tom yam, prawn cake, grilled squid, seafood glass noodle, and steamed sea bass. All of the dishes were very flavorful and well-presented.\n\nOne thing that I really appreciated about Kin Kao Mai Thai Restaurant is that their food is not overly sweet, which is common in Thai cuisine. This made their dishes more enjoyable for me.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience at Kin Kao Mai Thai Restaurant.",
