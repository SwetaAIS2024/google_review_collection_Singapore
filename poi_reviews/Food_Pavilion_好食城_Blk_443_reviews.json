They just started their soft launch since yesterday, and the official grand opening will be on May 1st. They are now operating 24 hours as well, which is super convenient!\nLooking forward to visiting again!",

I frequent this place at least twice a week and have never been disappointed with the quality of the food. The new BCM stall is good as well!! However, on a couple of occasions when I was dining alone, I did encounter some uncomfortable interactions with strangers trying to strike up conversations. Despite this occasional inconvenience, I still highly recommend 443 Coffee Shop for its great food and cozy atmosphere.",

I only didn’t really like the noodles as it was initially a bit tough, but after soaking in the noodle for some time, it becomes more chewy. Personally i prefer thinner noodles, but that’s my preference.",
