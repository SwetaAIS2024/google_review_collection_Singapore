I went for the $7 one for more fish and they were really generous with the portions. Soup broth was delicious, very flavorful but rice serving could be a little more!\n\nService was also really fast, and I noticed many old returning customers, which says a lot. Definitely coming back again!",

It is simply fried egg omelette with the oysters covered inside. The omelette egg is properly fried and taste homecooked. The oysters are fresh and nice. Will try the fish soup the next time when I'm there.",
