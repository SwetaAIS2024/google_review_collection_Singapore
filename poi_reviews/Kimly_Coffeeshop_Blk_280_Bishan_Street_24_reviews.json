The fried chicken was crispy and paired perfectly with the sauce, which was delicious. The spinach with three eggs, however, was a bit too soupy for my taste.\n\nService was great! The three ladies taking my order were very patient and attentive.",

Less than 10 pieces and small pieces.  $15 plus $0.70 rice. In fact i ordered another type of rice, but I think the staff just repeated what she has to say of getting customers to order, and dun really listen to what we order. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ Will NOT recommend it to come as it's Really expensive.",
