Not someone who will often try German food but this was a pleasant experience. I enjoyed everything that is to offer and everything was seasoned so well! I‚Äôm not a mash potatoes person but the potatoes from the chicken cutlet meal was great\n\nOverall a nice place to have a good lunch, and would love to see what is there to offer for other platters in the future",

I'm not too impressed with their non-beer beverage, but hey you're here for a different reason. Staff is prompt even during busy periods! I'll definitely be back if I need some bloody protein again",

So the family decided to have Mother's Day dinner there.\nThere are indoor and outdoor areas.\n\nWe ordered Brotzeit signature platter, 2 pints of beers and 2 bottles of cider.\nThe platter is enough for 4 - 6 pax.\n\nThe pork ribs was tender. The pork knuckle skin is crispy.\nThe side dishes made the meats more complete.\nMy family really enjoyed the food. The stomachs were totally \"satisfied\".\n\nNote: do make advance reservation if you want indoor seats.",
