Stella Soon,4,"The food is amazing! I would also have given 5 stars for atmosphere if there was aircon indoor seating. I mean, it felt kind of like being in some other country, sitting at the sidewalk to eat, but the heat got to me. Still, my family enjoyed our brunch.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110320888176328545673/reviews
Justin Lee,5,"I’ve visited two man bagel house multiple times, but the Novena outlet was the first. As usual, the bagels didn’t disappoint. Both the bagels and ingredients were fresh and cooked to perfection. I ordered a set which comes with onion rings and ice white. The onion rings were disappointing. Unlike their other outlets which seem to use fresh onions, the ones served here seemed full of batter instead.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107374628830921760349/reviews
Touristmouse,5,"I wasn't a bagel fan, but I decided to give this eatery a try after seeing the raving reviews. I ordered the Cheddar Jalapeno bagel ($4) with added cream cheese ($2.50). I took my order to go and only ate it a few hours later. Even so, the bagel was still delicious without reheating. The bagel, topped with cheddar, paired perfectly with the mildly spiced jalapeno and cream cheese within. I will come back for this if I'm in the area again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110409011587721664076/reviews
Janet Chin,3,"Ordered a James Brown with sesame bagel ($19)
The brisket was quite fatty for my standard and would prefer a more balance ratio of fat and meat. But the fats kept the brisket moist and juicy oh well.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110080547192156819266/reviews
Jasper Lee,5,"This place is a vibe man. Great place to people watch in Novena while enjoying a crisp, chewy bagel with a variety of toppings and sipping on freshly brewed coffee.

There are a number of toppings you can add to your bagel, as well as multiple bagel sandwiches, which come with pre-set toppings. The bagel itself also comes in 5 variants, which leads to a huge number of combinations.

Overall, it's a really cool place to come and enjoy a bagel. It's definitely worth a try!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103804782109611232649/reviews
