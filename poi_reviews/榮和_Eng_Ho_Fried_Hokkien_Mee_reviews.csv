Jason Soh,3,"Long waiting time, the hokkien mee is decent but I personally find that there are too much bee hoon to mee ratio. Lastly, i find the noodle a bit too wet but it's just personal preference as I find the stock not thick enough. Lastly, i queued for around 40mins, don't think it's worth such a long wait. If it's around 15mins then I am more willing to come again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113133934501923551074/reviews
David Yeo,4,"After some quick research, I found one of the more famous HKM stalls in Ang Mo Kio which I havent tried.

Came at 830pm on a weekday and the waiting time was 15-20min. I noticed it's one of the most frequented stalls here at this time of the day.

Can taste the old school flavor in its broth, not as intense or savory like the new HKM entrants, but definitely a bit of nostalgia you can taste in every bite. Their rendition does not come with pork lard nor pork slices, but the prawns are succulent. Pic shows $6 plate.

Do note Eng Ho requires only cash payment and their ingredients include tau gey, not sure if you can opt out, but for me, I am partial to the sprout so I never asked. I also appreciate that they use the Q buzzer system so you don't have to stand in line.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110172442432868180876/reviews
Lee Joonmin,3,"The Hokkien Mee was underwhelming—missing the distinct wok hei that makes the dish shine. The flavors were quite bland, and the chili lacked the punch you’d expect. It’s decent, but not worth making a special trip to Teck Ghee for it.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105182720697493057327/reviews
chu xuan,3,"Long wait for dinner, about 1 hour.

Wet kind of hokkien mee. wok hey was okok, taste was soso only, nothing special. IDK why it has such good reviews.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114900991350615107188/reviews
Zhao Yun,5,"As a hokkien Mee lover, this is definitely 1 of the best hokkien mee you can find in Singapore.

Dabaoed a large packet home, it has a traditional taste to it. Not too wet and yet the noodles were soaked with the prawn broth nicely with wok hey. Adding lime to it makes it even more appealing. The sua lo prawns were super fresh.

Will definitely visit again.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110317978941407718600/reviews
