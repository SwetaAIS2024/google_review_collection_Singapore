      "text": "24-hr heartland prata place which is pretty popular among the locals. Sometimes go there to grab a prata supper in the weekend. The roti prata is always freshly made, warm, and crispy, served with some kind of South Indian acidic fish curry. The other meals are also generally good, for instance, the chicken kuzhambu (curry) comes with a flavorful and pretty thick gravy. Surprised they also served chilled Shams, which is a non-alcoholic malt beverage from Iran, which means this rare stuff is imported twice from Iran to Malaysia, and later across the causeway to Singapore.\n\nThe place is airy, with a lot of ceiling fans and some tables located in semi-outdoor setting.",

I been to this restaurant a few times just because it’s just directly below my house and it’s convenient and food is good.\n\nHowever, out of all the times I came, I always have an issue, which is regarding to their service. Sometimes when I am at the cashier wanting to order, the service staff can take his own sweet time before coming to take my order. And everytime when I placed an order, definitely need to wait for at least half an hour even when the restaurant is not crowded. There are times where other customers who are Indian place an order after me, their food arrived but mine still not ready. Don’t bother visiting unless u have a lot of time to spare or unless u are Indian.",

They get messy between taking orders in person, taking delivery order, giving out orders... just messy.",
