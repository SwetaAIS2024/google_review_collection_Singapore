Would be so much better if they close much later.\nThere was quite a good crowd as well but based on my checks, they are only open till late on Fri n Sat.",

Among the many bars, restaurants, and bistros in the Cuppage area, this one stands out for its impressive wine selection.\n\nWhat's even better is that they offer these wines at reasonable prices. The service is also top-notch, especially the store manager who provided a fantastic wine recommendation and ensured our glasses were always full.\n\nWe enjoyed a bottle of Saint-Julien red wine for a very reasonable SGD 85, taxes included.",
