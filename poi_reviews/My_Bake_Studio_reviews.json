After ate, leave a black stain on lips. The stain still there even after washed or wiped with wet tissue. Kids were so freak out.\nHope you will take note on the colouring being used.",

Didnt taste like a vanilla cake at all, more like a banana cake. Moreover, it was pretty bland and not sweet. Delivery was late and no one bothered to inform us till I messaged the number. Disappointing experience and the cake was $180.",
