Fraulein Moreno,5,"I am giving this souvenir shop a 5 ðŸŒŸ because of its exceptional and superb customer service and acceptance of credit cards which is rare in Chinatown.
This shop carries an array of rare, one of a kind souvenir that can be a takeaway for a memento of your trip. They have Bruce Lee figurines ( a bit pricey for me) collector's items such as Marvel characters, funko pop and bobble head style as well. They also have some pop art style frames, the usual fridge magnets, postcards etc
Its merchandise are a feast for the eyes and a sense of happiness overwhelms you when browsing their products. I found a cute groot planter and a joker art frame that I bought as a souvenir for my children. I would go back again with more funds if given the chance. Give this shop a try and you won't regret it.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104619225137084969985/reviews
