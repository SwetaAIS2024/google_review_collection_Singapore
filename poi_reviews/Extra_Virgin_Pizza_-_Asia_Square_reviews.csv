Kar. P.,3,"Saw the good reviews and came to try on a weekday night. We didnâ€™t make any reservations and got seated at the outdoor. It was breezy and it was quite relaxing with the soft music. The two of us ordered one pizza, one truffle fries, and one fried calamari. I liked the truffle fries a lot but the pizza and especially the calamari were a bit salty for my taste. Overall the location is convenient and the food was not too bad , but would be much better if they were less salty.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110359293819628026788/reviews

Kunal Jadhav,4,"Nice business lunch place.

Pizza and base were both awesome but yes bit salty. I like spicy salami other was on sweeter side. Drinks okay nothing special about it.

Will go again when I have cheat meal time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114297070955035131775/reviews
RCSC,5,"True to its name, they do well for their pizzas. The dough is superb - soft and doughy. Toppings are flavourful too. Giving 5 stars for pizza.

Pasta and sides were just okay but can order as add ons!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101381356185028377091/reviews
Daniel Ling,5,"Saturday Lunch on breezy day. So atmosphere is good. Not too hot.

Food is good. Prefer white cream. Spicy Mami.
Rocket Ham seems to be 3 different dishes or at least 2. Rocket salad + ham and pizza separately.

On 26th Apr early lunch, there is only 1 lady waitress and her service is good.

Attentive to us and observant.

Remember to compliment her.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111100796407836663086/reviews
