      "text": "Dr Ong is a very patient and caring doctor. He sincerely likes children and you can see his kindness when he interacts with them.\n\nThere are some nasty reviews about him seeing kids near the carpark entrance which are unreasonable. This practice is basically segregation of those w flu-like symptoms vs those who are healthy and there for vax or check ups. Reasonable and practical. My kid, while not down w Covid, saw the doctor at e carpark. I can understand why and am fine w that. This would give parents with young babies there for vax a peace of mind. I’ve ever been to a paed where the doctor only sees sick children after 12pm; again practice of segregation but in a poorer form. That, I thought was unreasonable as kids who are sick can’t wait that long to be treated. You have kids too. Think about it.",

He’s wonderful, and my children love talking to him. The nurse is lovely, and even during the pandemic, when my child had COVID or flu-like symptoms, Dr. Ong was willing to see us in the car park. I really appreciate his hands-on approach, and he doesn’t mind walking in and out of the clinic to help.",

Although the cost may be higher, the peace of mind we get from his attentive and expert care is invaluable. Highly recommend Dr. Ong for any parent seeking a caring and reliable doctor.",
