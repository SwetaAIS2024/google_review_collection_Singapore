Harshi Samarasekera,5,"This is the 3rd Harry‚Äôs places we‚Äôve tried and no matter the venue, they‚Äôre always great. Great food as always and extraordinary service as always. Very pleasant team, very helpful and kind. I have to say, though it‚Äôs a bar, it‚Äôs also pregnant friendly, even their food choices. We got the photo after finishing half of it, because we were hungry.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111927793993788530173/reviews
Jerry Ong,5,"Food is nice; I highly recommend the fish and chips! They are meaty and fresh.

The staff are very friendly. We made some jokes and chatted with them, and the smiles never left their faces!

We used Eatigo and got 50% off during non-peak hours. It's really worth it for the atmosphere, good service, and food! We will come back and recommend it to other friends!",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110336654627948992336/reviews
