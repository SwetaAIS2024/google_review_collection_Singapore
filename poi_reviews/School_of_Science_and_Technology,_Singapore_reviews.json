      "text": "Improve the approach to students. Its ruining the school considering the fact it has a good reputation. Also, please change the way of how you accept students throught dsa. Almost failed my science pt and failed my math pt.\nSuggestions for new dsa test : check their responsibility. Send a teacher to their primary school and watch them. This allows the teacher to assess the student, and they will know if they're a suitable candidate.\nTeachers also needs to take matters in their own hands if a student reports a student for not doing their pt. I do know we, as teenagers, are expected to be more responsible and settle it out on ourselves. Despite communication, from my point of view, it was proper communication,  they still wouldn't do their work. Please improve on this. Thanks teachers and staff of sst.",
