I somehow strolled to mount faber park and He met me at this church, with a piano I found inside I worshipped Him, as well as uh a prayer book that really spoke to me when I flipped it open, so thanks! But uh I think you left the fan on upstairs, I can‚Äôt switch it off because the door is locked. Hope it doesn‚Äôt waste too much energy. Once again, thank you for this wonderful building God used to speak to me!",
