Joseph Tan,4,"Just visited Fat Po at Punggol's Tebing Lane and was impressed by the cozy bistro-style ambience with views of greenery through their large windows. The menu offers an exciting fusion of Asian and Western flavors that's surprisingly affordable, with most dishes between $8-20.

Their Japanese-inspired tamagoyaki was the highlight of my meal - perfectly fluffy with a delicate sweetness that kept me coming back for more. The baked oysters with cheese were indulgent and fresh, making for a delicious starter.

Unfortunately, the satay skewers didn't justify their price point - a bit dry and lacking the rich marinade I was hoping for. The steak was decent but nothing memorable, just your standard bistro fare.

What makes Fat Po special is their creative fusion dishes like their signature Hokkien Vongole and Moonlight Hor Fun with its distinct wok hei aroma. The restaurant gets busy on weekends, so I'd recommend visiting on weekdays for a more relaxed experience.

Will definitely return to try their popular Mapo Tofu Fries and Bolo Burger that other diners seem to love!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113204146437648205487/reviews
S Foo,3,"Service was good as the wait staff was observant and anticipated the needs. We were a group of 2 seniors and 2 young adults. The lady wait staff served us with 2 glasses of warm water and 2 glasses of cold water without us indicating. No charge for water.

Outdoor and indoor seating available.

We ordered :
-Moonlit Horfun ($14.80++). This was a hit as it had good wok hei without being excessively oily. A must order.

-Honey Chicken($14.80++) served with coleslaw and fries. Chicken was tender and moist.

-Hokkien Vongole($18.80++) was a wet soupy version of fried hokkien mee where the flavour of clams was strongly evident. Overall this highly popular dish did not wow any of us. We also felt that the dish was over priced for the handful of clams and small portion of noodles.

-Sambal Fish served with waterfall seaweed and warm vegetables ($14.80++). Super disappointed that fish used was dory as the meat lacked bite and was tasteless. The sambal was too salty. Liked the waterfall seaweed which was very thin strips of fried potatoes sprinkled with seaweed powder.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103252058657576066792/reviews
G,4,"the persistent houseflies were the highlight for the 1st 30% of our time here.
spent quite abit of time trying to swat away the houseflies / flies .
don't like the idea of any fly landing on any part of our food.
thankfully the houseflies stopped bothering us, maybe they found more attractive pastures .

the chai poh egg and pork = tasted bland to me , but imo , was good for kid .
not too salty , not over-oily  , good-sized portion .

curry dish was not too spicy .
imo , won't work for those who like spicy stuff .

enoki bacon skewers = abit too salty .
but nice crispy .

the wait staff were very friendly , even though it was full-house .

parking = we came early for dinner , so it was quite easy to get a parking lot .
when we left , the carpark was full.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113115281677147026399/reviews

We ordered the Classic Lok Lok Set and two Honey Chicken Chop sets.  It turned out that Kitty had accidentally ordered three sets, but luckily, kitty and i were able to share the extra set

The Classic Lok Lok Set was acceptable, with a variety of flavors and textures. The Honey Chicken Chop was a true highlight. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the noodles were delicious.  Both Kitty and I thought the food was above average for a casual restaurant.
