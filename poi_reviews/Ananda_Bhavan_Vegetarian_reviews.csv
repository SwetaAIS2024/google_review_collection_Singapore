Raj Arcot,3,"This south india food place is in the Changi Business Park area. Very close to MRT station, Park Avenue Hotel.

The south combo tastes good. Idly, sambar and vada all tasted good.

The service team is average. A combination of self-service and delivery to the table. One needs to place an order at the counter. A person will deliver the food to the table but not things like coffee, water, cutlery etc. They gave me tea even after explicitly asking for coffee at the counter. Lack of attention by the counter staff.

The price is good. The breakfast combo is economical.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107568948833790153417/reviews
Muthukumar Arumugam,2,"Service is going down day by day. We group of 4 went for Tamil New Year special lunch. The cashier never informed us about the shortfall of certain dishes as it was over already but charged us fully, when asked no proper response and equated the same with some other dishes. Even hot water was required to be paid when requested for. Pathetic service",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111670453667785556836/reviews
Bhaskar Singapore,4,"One of the best Best Vegetarian food in Singapore

One of the restaurant opens early in the morning. Food is hygiene and healthy.

One good and opportunity is they provide plenty of Chutney and Sambar, some are wasting. They can ask and provide or keep a small volumes at each table to avoid food.

Staff are excellent they are humble and courteous.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118414779972405165627/reviews
Dhar Xan,5,"We are staying near Changi Airport however this is the only pure vegetarian restaurant I found.   The dosas we had were really nice, a lifesaver for vegetarians.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108312820494030179984/reviews
S T,4,"Good and nice vegetarian food.

I am not sure but some of the counter/ serving staff ( the ones in uniform) seems a bit reluctant or tired of their jobs. Noticed this on couple of my visits. Seems they are exhausted. Believe either good rest (if that doesn’t happen) or training to serve with a simple smile would be helpful. Don’t get me wrong, there are few staff who are eager to help and serve.( My observation- the ones who are not in the regular uniform are better, but am not sure what’s at play here. They might either be part timer staff or upper management .)

Albeit that -good place to have nice vegetarian food in SG.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108037952401381362731/reviews
