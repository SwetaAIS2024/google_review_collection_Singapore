Gabriel Leanowl,5,"I have been eating ee mian more often this week.
The zi char stall at Chin Bee F&B at Blk 143 Teck Whye Lane sells one of the best ee mian in the west

The noodles are thinner than user. Most importantly, the dish is less salty than many stalls and does not give me a weird aftertaste. It's a thriving place to have zi char dinner with friends and family. On a side note, a friend told me i can even ask for less salt in my ee mian",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115379225965110220611/reviews

Ordered coffee toast and eggs set meal, to my surprise; was told they don’t have toasted bread, only eggs & beverages order separately!

Their signs board has “ Not available “ for toast bread.

We were so disappointed about their “ not available “ services,",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104017026296774707444/reviews
