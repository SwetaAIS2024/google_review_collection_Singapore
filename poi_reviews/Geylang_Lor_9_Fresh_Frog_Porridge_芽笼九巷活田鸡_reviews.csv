Chui Mun,5,"When you’re in Geylang, trying frog porridge is a must — it seems to be the most recommended dish in the area. I arrived around 7pm expecting a queue, but luckily there were still a few seats available.

I had never tried frog porridge before and couldn’t quite imagine how it would taste, but it completely exceeded my expectations! The frog meat was incredibly tender and bouncy while the porridge was so smooth and soft. you could almost eat it without using teeth, haha!

We also ordered cockles and grilled fish, which were both fresh and full of flavor. The dishes came out quite fast too, so there was no long wait.

Overall the experience was satisfying from start to finish. 👍🏻",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106158793393150400745/reviews
Takahiro Koyama,3,"Geylang Lor 9 Frog Porridge (芽笼九巷活田鸡) has been serving up its famous frog dishes since 1995, and it’s won tons of awards like The GreenBook Best Food Awards and Singapore Brands Awards. Open daily from 11:00 AM to 4:00 AM, it’s super convenient—just a heads up, it gets really busy at night and into the late hours.

The menu has all kinds of frog dishes like frog porridge, claypot frog, and fried frog, plus seafood, chicken, and veggie options too. You can choose portions for 1, 2, or 3 people for the porridge and claypot frog, so it’s fun to order different spice levels and share with friends.

Dry Chili Frog (宮保田鸡)
This one’s spicy! It’s frog cooked in a sweet soy-based sauce packed with dried chilies. If you’re not big on heat, go for the Ginger Spring Onion version instead. The frog meat includes legs, shoulders, and more—tastes kind of like a cross between cod and chicken. The thighs are especially juicy and flavorful!

Ginger Fried Frog (蒜片炸田鸡)
This dish has chopped frog pieces lightly battered and fried until crispy. Each bite is crunchy on the outside and tender inside, with a simple salt seasoning. Don’t forget to dip it in chili sauce—so good!

Wendy Nya,5,"MUST ORDER fried Oyster omelette is too good to be missed! Authentic dish.
Clay pot frog is cooked just right at 2 for $20 is worth it! The porridge is another MUST shout out - $2 for such a big bowl... Ok enough said. Don't miss it if you are in Geylang!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105732498462310032980/reviews
Loh Ricky,5,"My favourite restaurant for frog porridge, super shiok when you mix the gongbao sauce with the porridge. Best 😙😙😙...
The cockles are also super yummy, but too bad this round freshness is not there as I got a few bad cockles.
However, I will still give a 5 stars overall... 🤭🤭
Coz all the dishes still suit my taste buds...",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105538701864779732018/reviews
Cooper,3,"Staying in Geylang, I discovered frog porridge is a local specialty, with countless shops offering various frog dishes. I decided to try the famous Kung Pao Frog with porridge which is highly recommended on social media. The plain porridge is lightly seasoned with ginger, pairing perfectly with the tender and flavorful Kung Pao Frog. It was quite enjoyable! 🥰 The owner also suggested trying the Singapore-style grilled fish, but I felt the seasoning was a bit overwhelming. Then just noticed other places offering promotions like 3 frogs for $18, making this spot feel a bit overpriced 🙁",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102217468384629834626/reviews
