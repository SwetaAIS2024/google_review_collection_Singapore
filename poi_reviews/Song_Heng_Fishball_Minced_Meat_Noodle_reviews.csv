Ron Ng,4,"Came by for breakfast, joined the queue patiently. Ordered $5, mee kia dry with chilli. Ordered came with fishballs, minced meat, lean meat, sliced fish cake, baby romaine and XXL size pork lard.
Noodle is well cooked, springy. Their dry version is doused with vinegar, mixed with their chilli making it a savoury, sour and spicy combination of goodness. Fishball and fishcake is more on the firm springy side. The bowl of soup has plently of minced meat which is well seasoned, however i do not taste similar on the lean meat slices. There is also a good portion of veggies. I am never a fan of pork lard, but was attracted by the size and amount added in the bowl. Did I finished all, yes! The lady boss is always so warm and friendly!!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102898821791109530498/reviews
Mark Koh,5,"Bought a $5.00 version.
Generous amount of noodles and ingredients. Noodles are well cooked and goes very well with vinegar and chilli. Fish balls are smooth and bouncy. Other ingredients are fresh and tasty.
Will be back again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104379740216436886242/reviews
Li Xin,4,"This fishball noodles are really worth the wait even though the queue was at least 40mins long! I guess auntie take the time My partner ordered kway teow dry with fish ball ($5) while I ordered mee tai mak soup($5)! Seeing the picture, this is the amount of ingredients auntie gave us for its price! Tons of fishball, minced meat and fishcak and even the veggies. Will try it in dry version with chilli the next time I'm here :) but you gotta be patient for it, maybe come early before 9am!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100948782185718478694/reviews

Jerald Lim,5,"Loved the chilli, vinegary, lard mix for the meepok. Noodles portion easily the biggest in Singapore, small eaters should probably ask for less noodles.

Aunties were smiley and friendly even though there is a perpetual queue.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101913444524439383194/reviews
