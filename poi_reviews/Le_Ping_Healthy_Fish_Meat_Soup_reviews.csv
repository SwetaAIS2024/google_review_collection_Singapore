Alvin C,5,"Outstanding... this stall has become my favourite fish soup stall in Singapore. Taste is good and food is fresh. I simply ‚ù§Ô∏è the fish soup with milk. The owner is friendly and accommodating. I happened to see one review below, saying that this stall is his favourite but only gave 3 üåü... I simply don't understand... definitely deserve a 5...",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102181790026215103000/reviews
Leonard Lim,5,"For $5, good value for money with generous big chunks of tasty and fresh fried fish meat. The tender bitter gourd gives the delicious fish soup a nice kick and of course good healthy dietary fibre. The fragrant slightly sweet fried bean curd skin soaks up the flavorful stock and bursts with layers of flavor in the mouth. Definitely recommended for fried fish soup lovers.

The Teban Gardens hawker center is well ventilated and clean and HDB gantry carpark is plentiful.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101173751535810787329/reviews
CCS,3,"Just as most stalls in Block 37 Teban Gardens, Le Ping serves up very affordable dishes of the years gone by.

Since moving here 5 years ago, this is one of my favourite stalls whenever I felt the craving for a taste of yesteryear. Especially after a period of deep-fried foods.

You can't miss the stall. Just look for the longest queue. Operated by a ""family"" crew,"" orders were promptly prepared and served with few words.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
