mark chua,2,"Doctors, social workers are very patient, professional and caring. However the whole setting can be stained by rude and impatient counter staff Jeanne Ng. It's not the first time having encountered her rudeness. No sign of hospitality and making parents put off by her impatient and uncaring attitude.
