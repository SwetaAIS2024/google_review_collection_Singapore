The service is awful with a rude, Chinese lady that shouts orders and forgot to give me my siew mai.\nWhen I asked, she said she had given 4 siew mai to someone and acted like I was lying. However once I saw the siew mai I wished it had gone to someone else! Just look at the colour and form.\nMy Mee Siam was tasteless and watered down with a layer of oil on top. Laksa and Mee Soto were edible.\nThe two fans on the wall are badly positioned and do nothing for the people sitting at the tables. Surely we can do better!",

How can nurses be entrusted with the students' health if they can't work with external stakeholders to ensure the students' basic safety?\n\nPoorly trained staff, a lack of SOP and accountability in the School Health Service, Youth Preventive Services Division. Utterly disappointing.",
