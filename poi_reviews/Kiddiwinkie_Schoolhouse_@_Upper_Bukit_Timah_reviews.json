      "text": "Both of our children have attended Kiddiwinkie Schoolhouse @ UBT, and we couldn’t be happier with the experience they’ve had there. From the very beginning, we were impressed by the professional care provided by the staff and the nurturing environment they create for the children. It’s clear that the team at Kiddiwinkie is dedicated to fostering a safe, supportive, and engaging atmosphere where children can thrive. Ms Radi is a legend there!!!\n\nOne of the most important factors for us as parents is the quality of teaching, and Kiddiwinkie Schoolhouse has consistently delivered in this area. The teachers are not only knowledgeable and skilled but also genuinely passionate about early childhood education. They have played a pivotal role in enhancing the physical, emotional, and social development of our children. Through carefully planned activities and a well-rounded curriculum, the school ensures that each child is given the opportunity to grow and develop at their own pace.\n\nWe’ve noticed significant improvements in our children’s confidence, social skills, and emotional resilience since they started at Kiddiwinkie. The teachers go above and beyond to tailor their approach to meet the individual needs of each child, helping them to overcome challenges and celebrate their achievements. This personalized attention has made a huge difference in our children’s development.\n\nIn addition to the excellent teaching, the school also emphasizes the importance of a well-rounded experience. From creative arts and physical activities to social interactions and emotional learning, Kiddiwinkie provides a holistic education that prepares children for the next steps in their educational journey.\n\nThe communication between the school and parents is also commendable. We are regularly updated on our children’s progress and any upcoming events or activities, which helps us stay involved in their learning journey. The staff is always approachable and willing to discuss any concerns or questions we may have, further reinforcing our confidence in the care and education our children are receiving.\n\nIn summary, Kiddiwinkie Schoolhouse @ UBT has been an excellent choice for our family. The professional care, consistent teaching quality, and commitment to fostering all aspects of a child’s development have greatly benefited our children. We highly recommend Kiddiwinkie to any parents looking for a nurturing and high-quality early childhood education for their little ones.",

      "text": "Communications between school and parent can be better. For example, the principal was shifted to the new Mountbatten branch since April 2024 and this was not announced to the parents till August 2024. Why is a new centre opened without a stipulated principal?\n\nTeacher turnover is high (has been for 2-3 years) and most recently, the school, for 2 months, has not hired a new teacher to replace one who left. This is especially worrying when it affects k1 and k2 kids. The kids’ wellbeing are affected as a result as existing teachers are overstretched.\n\nOur feedback is always not taken seriously, and the good reviews you see here are a result of the organisation asking for parents to post as a gesture for teachers’ day.",

It is so hard to leave your kids in the care of strangers for so many hours a day (esp for infants) but the Kiddiwinkie Teachers are so warm and experienced, they made us feel assured. The kids really enjoyed school. My kids had issues with allergies and sometimes friendship problems and the teachers took great pains to sort those out and made sure our kids have the best possible care.",

Subsequently, we recommended two other friends after they had not so good experiences at other schools.\n\nLove the teachers and the environment! Very loving and caring; it's obvious that they care about the well-being of each individual student, which is the most important thing as a parent.",
