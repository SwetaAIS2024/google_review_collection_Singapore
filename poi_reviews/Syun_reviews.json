The portion size is suited for smaller appetites, but the flavors fell a bit short.\n\nWe were seated near the hotel kitchen, which led to a lot of foot traffic.\n\nHowever, the service staff were fantastic. Very detailed in explaining each dish and attentive throughout the meal.",

Definitely would like to come back here.\n\nI gave it a 2 star in atmosphere because the lighting felt abit strange. I couldn’t take good pics to match the amazing taste. Anyway will add this to my list of restaurants that deserve a second visit!",
