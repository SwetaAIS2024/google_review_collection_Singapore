Joven Chiew,5,"One of the best Vietnamese dishes in this area. Fresh ingredients at a great value, very tasty without the MSG flavor. The lady boss speaks good Mandarin and is willing to explain and make recommendations. The location is windy, and the view is excellent.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106280097886709879429/reviews
