Amanda Suzuki,5,"Been with the community for one year now and the staff members have been kind, patient and transparent in communication. Students are seen happy at school and have positive relationships with their peers and teachers. Would definitely recommend families who appreciate diversity, positive learning environment and tight-knit community.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102568917541096789432/reviews
Maria F,4,"Had mostly good teachers for 4 years but sadly most leave within a school year.
The principal also changes every year.
Ms Lucy at reception has been the anchor for us during the 4 years. Always warm and kind to all the kids.

Nice kids and a truly international environment.
Cozy small campus. It does lack some facilities as the kids grow but certainly they make the most of the resources.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117557601136091887361/reviews

Wendy A,5,Brought my aunt and my niece on the school tour before but unfortunately she too young. We came back recently to walk in as we were in the area and was super thankful to the Marketing girl Sofia who was able to accommodate us and gave us a full and insightful tour! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113876752614834461454/reviews
V. Leh,1,"Breaking enviroment for Kids which are not mainstream.

Our kid was healthy and happy in each school before. Now we need a psychologist for trying to repair. Our child shows issues in learning, but nothing was a professinal school can¬¥t handle.

This school is not appropriate to adress kids with special needs (sensory issues, problems to focus).

Even when they try, they do not have the capacity or experience to adress this kids properly.

The only they do is sending this kids home (on a almost daily base) when they don¬¥t know what to do. And give the child the feeling of being ""wrong"".

Even the attitude torwards this kids is contraproductive and destroys any self esteem.

At the end even the OT¬¥s and psychologist we asked gave the advise to leave this school to save the kids mental health. Everyone was shocked how Invictus treated this kind of children.

By sure this school will fight this comment instead of bringing effort to improve their skills and reflect their knowledge.

I would rather homeschool my child than sending it there. Happy to have found a great new school already.

All the other negative reviews hit the point. If you can effort them, choose another school.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111343076614621865113/reviews
