Sze Tan,5,"My son attended Rainbow Cove from N1 to K1. Teachers are great! They clearly care about the children, and would proactively share their observations+snippets of my child’s day during drop off/pickup, which is much appreciated. They also have pretty good enrichment classes for art, Chinese speech, sports-ball. Photo updates are also provided regularly. My son grew so much with Rainbow Cove, and we will always be grateful!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111596340453326265289/reviews

Felicia,5,"My daughter attended Playgroup at Rainbow Cove for about a year. The school is like a close-knit family. The teachers are nurturing and they know each and every student in the school. Lots of interesting programmes and activities are included in the curriculum, and the school has over the past year upgraded / refreshed various facilities such as the outdoor play area.

The teachers would always proactively give feedback / share snippets of my daughter’s day in school when we picked her up, e.g. whether she ate / slept well, interesting things she said or did. My daughter went through a period of transition when our secondborn first came home. Her teacher observed that she was behaving strangely and initiated a call with my husband and I to share her observations and discussed how we could help her. Such genuine care and concern for a student is hard to come by, and we very much appreciated what she did.

It has been 2 months since my daughter left the school (we needed to enrol her in a school closer to our home) but she still tells us that she wants to return to Rainbow Cove. She has made some of her first best friends here and has learnt so much during her time at Rainbow Cove. We are grateful to the school for providing such a supportive learning environment and would like to thank the teachers/principal for being so accommodating and caring!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113182756022594277603/reviews
