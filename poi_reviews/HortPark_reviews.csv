C,4,"As part of the Southern Ridges, HortPark is a beautifully maintained gardening hub, perfect for nature lovers, walkers, and anyone seeking a peaceful escape. As part of the Southern Ridges. It features well-landscaped gardens and a tranquil atmosphere that many visitors appreciate.

One of the highlights for me is the Silver Garden, where striking white and silver plants create a uniquely serene and picturesque setting. Love taking peaceful walks from Kent Ridge Park to HortPark and back—a refreshing route that’s perfect for light exercise. The well-paved trails, lush greenery, and quiet surroundings make it an ideal place to unwind, especially in the morning or evening.

Highly recommended for nature walks, garden enthusiasts, and anyone exploring the Southern Ridges!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews

Gayan Chathuranga,4,"HortPark is a beautiful and serene park that’s perfect for a relaxing day outdoors. The lush greenery, well-maintained gardens, and peaceful atmosphere make it a great escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.
