      "text": "Condo service is just worse! Every month there is issue, horrible property management who makes it not nice to live. It can take months to repair the lift in block (A) whenever it is broken down.\n\nSecurity doors to my building block (A) are broken in the open position for months so anyone could walk in. The lift security key does not function easily to access any floor, It seems like every month one more thing is broken. The common area from level 4 up to the rooftop lack of maintenance.\n\nAnother thing, each time it rains heavily there is leakage in my living room and my bedrooms, it's really annoying cos the owner has no interest in fixing it.\n\nI will aabsolutely not renew my lease and it is because of this horrible management and the owner of my unit",
