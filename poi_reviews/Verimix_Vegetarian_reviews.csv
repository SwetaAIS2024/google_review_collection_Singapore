Kai,5,"My family and I are not vegetarians but we like the wide variety of plant based proteins and  fresh veggies to chose from. My kids like the scrambled egg, the corn and broccoli which are ordinary dishes but cooked in a way that are surprisingly nice . We also tried the curry monkey head mushroom , the shimeji mushroom and fried cauliflower which are nice too . The oliver rice and glass noodles are good and the Za Er are very crispy even after packing home .  A new type of vegetarian shop concept that has vegetarian dishes cooked in non-traditional way and cater to both vegetarian and non vegetarian diners .

The staffs are friendly as they will explain the kind of dishes they have.

Did some search and found out this is the 4th outlet for Verimix .
Will want to go back and try the other dishes .",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116242151897187367734/reviews
J. Yang,5,"As a long-time patron of their Timbre outlet in one-north, I am very glad that they have opened a new store close to my estate. Now, I can eat their food more often and do not have to wait in their long queues during the lunch crowd at TimbreüòÑ.

The variety of healthy, vegetarian food options here are impressive, and the staff are super friendly and polite. As someone who doesn't usually eat vegetarian food, I really recommend the food here to anyone of any age and diet. My go-to-order is the pasta base with sweet and sour protein balls, carrots, broccoli and best of all, freshly fried cauliflowerüòã, for around $5 only!

I find this place to be a really welcomed addition to the LeQuest mall, as it offers something different from the array of popular fast food chains here. Will continue to support and hopefully they can open more stalls around SG!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103658195793692409703/reviews

Fiona Lee,5,"Such a lovely affordable lunch.

Chose olive rice with curry lion mane mushrooms, broccoli, scrambled eggs and cheese pumpkin. Loved every single dish. Portion of dishes considered above normal.
