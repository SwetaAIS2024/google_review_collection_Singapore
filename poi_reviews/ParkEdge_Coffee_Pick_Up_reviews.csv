Lorelai D,5,"So excited to find a coffee place that is a home based business, love the iced latte here, so reasonably priced especially the ice lemon tea. Unexpected but got 2 pieces of cookies to go with the drinks, love the buttery cookies that reminded me of Jennyâ€™s cookies from HK for some reason.

I was running late to pick up the order and they helped me to store in the fridge too ðŸ«¶

Definitely a hidden gem! Will come back for more!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110563036404967613068/reviews

Bryan Chua,5,"This is my first time purchasing from them. The iced latte smells just as good as it tastes rich, smooth, and seriously comforting. The owners are friendly!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114983306365609532418/reviews
Leon K,5,"Love a good cup of Joe? Say no more! Found this (very well) hidden gem while looking for good coffee in the neighborhood. Ordered an iced latte that tasted really good, besting what you might often find from so-called 'specialty' cafes that charge higher. Definitely won me over and will be sure to drop by again next time I'm in the neighborhood.
TL;DR If you're a coffee connoisseur, try their coffee. You won't regret it.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117228001902109760653/reviews
