      "text": "Tried their Beef Horfun. Weird that many items on the menu has been crossed out.\n\nGood:\n- Big portion. It literally feels heavy. Lots of beef and vege.\n- considerable amount of wok hey\n\nCons:\n- wok hey is only on the beef and vege, which I saw it’s the first item he put in\n\n- the hor fun that is added in later has no wok hey. It’s not even evenly mixed.\n\n- bad choice of dark soy sauce. Doesn’t has the slight sweet hint that is required for this dish.\n\n- slightly more expensive than your usual zi char\n\nOverall average and acceptable.",

      "text": "Tried one of their signature Super Sesame oil Chicken Rice @$6.90. The dish is precooked but the chef will heat it in the wok for you. For this dish - could not expect the wok hei in fried rice but we like the fragrance of sesame, much like how mum used to cook - eat it cold or hot, equally delicious.\n\nNote that they only have take away - there is no seating place to enjoy your food. Hence, great if you are planning to bring something nice home without breaking the bank.",

      "text": "Always buy their dry beef horfun, one of the best, or close to the best I had. Tend to be fried with more egg than the average Zi char store. Abit more ex (compared to normal zhichar) but I think Northshore plaza rental is ex and many stores around seem more ex too. Also their portion is abit larger than most wok hey stores. I think it's worth the price.\n\nI think they never increase price for some time alr compared to most hawker or coffeeshops. Now they also trying to have some cheaper items or promo but I havnt try before cuz every time will buy the dry beef horfun.  I'll be sad if one day it's gone.",
