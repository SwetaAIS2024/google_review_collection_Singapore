Ate the chicken rice with steamed kampong chicken and fried chicken and found it surprisingly good! The meat was tender, and the sauce enhanced the flavour. Soup was a great pairing as well! It's a little out of the way, but it also means there isn't much of a crowd. Good price!\n\nPhoto was taken in the middle of the meal.",
