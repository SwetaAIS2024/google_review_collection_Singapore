Ella Shinni,5,"I recently visited Mama Panda Kitchen and was instantly drawn to the panda pao-it looks absolutely adorable and tastes just as good! I highly recommend everyone to give it a try.

Pei,4,"The tandoori biryani set was a generous portion with tender chicken, though the rice was overly spicy for my taste. The sweet and sour fish was merely average.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107008951870777106419/reviews
logaraj raji,5,"I had a great experience thanks to Rahool! He was professional, friendly, and went out of his way to assist me. Itâ€™s rare to find staff who genuinely care about customer satisfaction, but Rahool definitely stands out. Highly recommend his service!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117987343555853244227/reviews
T0m2y Ch00,3,"The latest food menu is not worth eating. The fish and chip is not fresh(flaky and powdery texture) and exterior is soggy. The dan dan noodles taste salty and the soup also taste like Myojo Abalone instant noodles, basically using the chicken cube. The mapo tofu rice, no mala and spicy taste, no crisp in the mock meat.

There is still one nice and recommended food - Herbal Chicken Mian Xian, the soup is authentic, the mian Xian also quite Q. Thumbs up for this dish.

Overall, the old menu still better than the new one.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102727811964660447690/reviews
Dru Lu,3,The food is not great but the panda themed items are quite cute. The panda bao is basically fried chicken inside bao. The red bean panda bao is a bit hit with kids. This is basically the only restaurant option inside the park. The wonton ramen is quite bad.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115927493800245457440/reviews
