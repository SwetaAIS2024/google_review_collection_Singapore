The dan dan noodles taste salty and the soup also taste like Myojo Abalone instant noodles, basically using the chicken cube. The mapo tofu rice, no mala and spicy taste, no crisp in the mock meat.\n\nThere is still one nice and recommended food - Herbal Chicken Mian Xian, the soup is authentic, the mian Xian also quite Q. Thumbs up for this dish.\n\nOverall, the old menu still better than the new one.",
