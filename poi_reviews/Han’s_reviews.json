      "text": "Han's at Suntec pleasantly surprised me, especially on Valentine's Day, as it wasn't as crowded as expected. What stood out was their transparent pricing policy â€“ the displayed prices are all-inclusive, with no additional service charges. This made the dining experience even more enjoyable.\n\nI opted for the dory fish set and fish & chips, both of which were cooked to perfection and left me thoroughly satisfied. The ambiance is cozy and inviting, making it a great spot for a relaxed meal or catch-up with friends. I'll definitely be returning to explore more of their menu!",

      "text": "Me and my colleague ordered the April promo Hainanese pork chop separately and we were both asked what Hainanese pork chop. Seems like the promo and regular menu item have different standards? This is what I received in the end (photo). Taste dry, tough and tasteless and lacking much resemblance to regular Hainanese pork chop. Very disappointing.",

Frozen taste and the roasting is more like steamed chicken heated up in oven. ðŸ˜‚ 20 dollars for a half awful tasting spring chicken.\n\nThe alio olio spaghetti is also tasteless. The standard has dropped badly\n\nWe waited for half and hour for our lunch cos there's only 3 person working during lunch time.\n\nIf Han's management is reading this, you better get your kitchen and manpower sorted. You're going to loose a lot of customers.",

I was a little stunned by her rudeness. I am not using your takeaway boxes so why should I be charged? You should refund me the charge not WAIVE it. I was still silent and puzzled over the unfair and impolite treatment. The manager walked over and instructed her to return me the amount in cash. She unwillingly did so and said now we have a shortfall (in cash balance). Ridiculous service.",

These were distinctly perceptible to touch, although not easily visible. The same crusty feel, indicative of mediocre cleaning, was also present on the edge of the plates our food was served in.The other Hans branches have a higher level of cleanliness. Quite distasteful.",
