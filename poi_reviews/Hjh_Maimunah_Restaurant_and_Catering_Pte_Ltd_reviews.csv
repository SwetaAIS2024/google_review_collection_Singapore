kei kei,5,"Absolutely love the nasi padang here! The beef rendang, kalio chicken and jackfruit curry were out of this world! The sambal is amazing with the food. The food is best eaten here as compared to their outlets at food court which were already really good! Would definitely come back here again!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114422160204156130158/reviews
Lovely Cameraman,5,"Avoid weekends. PERIOD. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£
.
So decide to not go JB but have breakfast at my own country. Had enough of prata and curry. Throat felt like swallowing Malay-oriented food.
.
Iâ€™m very particular when it comes to breakfast. Has to taste right. Then suddenly craved for the Ayam Goreng Kicap of Hajah Maimunah. So, off we go to their Geylang branch on a weekday. (Best branch. No kidding)
.
Came with another person but we ate meals for three. ðŸ«£ðŸ¤£
.
Let the pic do the talking. I donâ€™t each veggies but the Pucuk Ubi gravy is always a must.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114888323272768689180/reviews
M. Avicenna Naradipa,4,"Amazing food for the price! My favorites are: yellow curry chicken, rendang, paru (beef lungs), and orek tempe.

The place can get very crowded during weekends and a few large groups will also book the upper seats. Consider getting here early or with someone to get some seats beforehand.

Meals in the picture costs about S$10. Better to request less sweet for the drinks.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108496617590210380886/reviews
double you.,4,"An enjoyable to have a nice place of malay cuisine.
I still feel there is a gap to reach Indonesian/ nasi padang authenticity level (speaking as someone living in Indonesia for 18 years!).",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108727712984626934623/reviews
Aerosmith 09,3,"I ordered takeaway of the following: Half rice, sayur lodeh, ikan bilis and a sotong.

The restaurant was quite crowded as I went on a Sunday at lunchtime.

I was very disappointed in the food. The sotong was a generous piece but unfortunately extremely overcooked and rubbery. I had to use a knife to saw through it.

The vegetables in the sayur lodeh were undercooked and hard.

I may return but I definitely will not get sotong again.

$12.60 for this meal though, is a waste of my money.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115116173651150473045/reviews
