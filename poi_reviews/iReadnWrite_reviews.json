He started off on quite an uneventful note, but as the months (and terms) passed, I noticed he developed an interest in writing. He loved expressing his quirky ideas, reflective of his child-like world perhaps, through writing stories. IReadnWrite provided that avenue for him to learn, improve and express himself that way.",

He enjoys going to class and interacting with the teachers and his peers alike. Best of all he has becoming more confident in learning the English language. Thank you teachers!
