      "text": "Been using this Goodwill ambulance for the last 4 visits for my father‚Äôs medical appts and the services were okay but most of the time the pick-up to the appts were always late and we have to call to remind them on booking.  However, today the services were the worst. Our advance booking for pick up at 7am and requested for a stretcher as it is a day surgery appt at 7.30 am in Tan Tock Seng Hospital. However, They came late with no stretcher at 7.20 am. They mentioned that Goodwill admin staff gave them wrong information on booking. We managed to leave only at 7.30am . So we arrived late for our day surgery at 7.50am. And the return trip booking when we called - they wanted us to wait 3 hrs .. why ?? They are busy for the day:( No more goodwill for our future appts .",
