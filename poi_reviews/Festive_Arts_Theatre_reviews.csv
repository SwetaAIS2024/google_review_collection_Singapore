웬케빈,5,"Festive Arts Theatre in Tampines is a cozy local cinema! With one show per period, it's perfect for a chill movie night. Box office opens 30 mins before each show, and tickets are sold on the day. Decent sound, comfy seats with cup holders, clean venue, and discounts for seniors and students - what more could you ask for?",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107458777477246149283/reviews

han,5,"Love this cinema, the tickets are very affordable if you have a tampines hub passion card. Even comes with a small packet of salted caramel popcorn, all for the price of $6. Saw people bringing in food like KFC and encik tan as well. Went on a Thursday night and it was not crowded. Definitely would go again",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101693125472281129687/reviews

Venga,5,Screens current movies. Value for money definitely especially when discounted with Passion Card. Better to choose middle row seats as the theatre also functions as an Arts theatre. Easier to walk through the library. Great experience.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113781590849568480267/reviews
