      "text": "I was instantly captivated by the name \"Makan Melaka Loves U\" and decided to give it a shot. This establishment primarily specializes in serving Cendol and Asam Pedas Melaka, appeared to be both flavorful and vibrant. My choice for the day was the Claypot Asam Pedas Chicken.\n\nWhen I placed my order, the person taking it was friendly and explained that the Asam Pedas came as a set, with a choice of fish, chicken, or sotong (squid), along with rice.\n\nThe meal arrived with blueish rice, complemented by a salted half-egg, a cucumber slice, a cherry tomato, and some salad vegetables. The blueish rice was undeniably charming, although it lacked the distinct fragrance characteristic like Nasi Lemak do.\nThe Chicken Asam Pedas was served piping hot in a claypot, and it was still bubbling when I received it. The dish featured tender chicken pieces prepared in a thick and slightly oily gravy, accompanied by ladyfingers and another slice of tomato. It was bursting with flavor, although it leaned towards the saltier side and had a touch of greasiness. With the blueish rice, the saltiness was somewhat tempered, making it quite acceptable.\nIn conclusion, my dining experience at Makan Melaka Loves U was genuinely pleasant. Thank you Makan Melaka Love U",

Ordered the half roast chicken, the oyster omelette and the chicken skin. Hmm well let's just say i have never seen such a tiny chicken for $7.90, and the thinnest and oiliness of the omelette. The chicken skin was alright.",

      "text": "Giving a shoutout for this halal kopitiam with some very visually stimulating decor! Looks almost like an upscale foodcourt. Food wise, it was definitely value for money compared to other zhng-ed up coffee shops. Came for the interesting looking orh luak and was not disappointed though also not impressed. Egg was done more like a crispy version of nasi lemak-style omelette but would say it’s just something different. The chicken meatball soup from mee bagus is generous in portion and sedap! Chendol is within expectations from the cendol melaka chain.\n\nOverall am very pleasantly surprised by its friendly price points — one of those rare moments eating out these days when I didn’t feel like I’m being ripped off by inflation.",
