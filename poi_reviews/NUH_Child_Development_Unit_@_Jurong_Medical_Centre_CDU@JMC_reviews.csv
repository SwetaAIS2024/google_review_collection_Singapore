Dr3w-Road,1,"I am writing to share feedback about a recent experience at your clinic with Dr. Mulay Kalyani Vijaykumar. While I understand that dealing with young, uncooperative children can be challenging, I was disappointed by the unprofessional behavior displayed during the consultation.

Sarcastic Remarks: Dr. Mulay made inappropriate and sarcastic comments in front of me as a parent, which was both unprofessional and disheartening.
Inaccurate Diagnosis: The diagnosis given appeared to be made without thorough consideration and was later confirmed to be incorrect. This led to unnecessary stress and wasted time seeking additional medical opinions.

I believe that healthcare professionals should approach patients and their families with empathy and professionalism, regardless of the challenges presented. I am sharing this feedback in the hope that it helps improve the quality of care provided to other patients in the future.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113800730315714424696/reviews
