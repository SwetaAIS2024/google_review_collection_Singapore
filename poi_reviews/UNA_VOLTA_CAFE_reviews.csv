hebe,5,"This cafe is a hidden gem!! Its location is tucked away from the highway (means there are fewer people and cars‚Äîa plus for plenty of parking.
Still definitely worth a visit thoüòã The food is actually surprisingly good, and the prices are quite reasonable too.

It‚Äôs certainly not your typical aesthetic caf√© with mediocre food.üëçüèªüëçüèª",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101735701832543564460/reviews
jayden,4,"Hidden cafe in medini area, it's a white theme cafe setting with the floor and walls, ceilings being pure white. The place is cosy with classical piano music in the background. The place is also clean and drinks are above average. The lemon tea is not too sweet which is good for a healthier choice.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews

PS Lee,5,"Visited on Sun morning.  Looks like a new and quiet area with not many shops around,so parking is not a problem at all.  Ambience, food, price is superb, especially price wise. Free flow of traditional biscuits and sweets are offered definitely will excite kids. Onwer could be a book lower where a lot good books are available for leisure reading, definitely a perfect place to read, restand relax",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102765942757549655515/reviews
