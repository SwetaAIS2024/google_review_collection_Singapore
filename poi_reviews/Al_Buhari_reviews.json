      "text": "My current favorite indian muslim breakfast stall in the immediate vicinity. Decent Roti Prata with choices  of accompanying chicken or fish curry dip. Decent Thosai as well served with two types of Cutneys and Sambar (dhal based curry). Decent Puri and Vadai sets with accompanying Sambar as well.  They are generous with the amount of respective curries or chutneys for takeaway orders. Prices are reasonable compared to the other two similar food stalls in the immediate neighborhood.\nUpdated 24 September 2024. Ordered the  Mee Goreng (Takeaway) this evening and was disappointed with the overall flavour and composition of this dish. Being a frequent patron of this stall, guess I'll just stick to their breakfast menu items which are quite decent.",
