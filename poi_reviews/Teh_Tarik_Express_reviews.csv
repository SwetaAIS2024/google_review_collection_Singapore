Lobo Ranco,5,"It was after dinner that I felt the desire to quench my thirst. I spotted a stall that offers Ginger tea without sugar and was eager to order it.

Alas, the selection was finished for the day and a young angelic looking Ah Bang handed me a tea instead. Having sensed my disappointment, he gave me a pair of complimentary Dough Fritters to complement my tea.

Wow, talk about generosity & service... This is what F&B experience is all about. Highly recommendable & appreciated ðŸ˜Ž",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111557787002390839776/reviews
YY Foo,5,Freshly prepared delicious snacks such as lekor and putu piring at reasonable prices! I've not bought puffs from Old Chang Kee ever since this store is up. They also open early so it's been my go-to breakfast place for many months now. Highly recommended.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116721276855449207159/reviews

Thomas Yang,1,"Skimping on the plastic is one thing, but the plastic for the cups should at least hold the liquids purchased. I got a cold kopi O less sugar and brought it with me on public transport. It was an ice cold product and the entire bottom of the cup broke through.

If youâ€™re going to skimp on costs for the plastic bag, at least give us a cup that holds the drink purchased.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109724557561685862305/reviews
NZ Yo,1,"Just left in frustration, Teh Tarek Express can keep my $3.50 and stuff it up theirs. I did like their Banana Cheese Waffles, had it several times, I enjoyed it, though the service by the woman was always terribly slow. Just now, after waiting and waiting for it, it turned out she had spread chocolate on my banana cheese waffle and had the nerve to tell me she always put a bit of chocolate on waffle orders! I am allergic to chocolates. Have some consideration Teh Tarek staff, don't deviate from what your menu says and what customers expect.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115966461843914521139/reviews
