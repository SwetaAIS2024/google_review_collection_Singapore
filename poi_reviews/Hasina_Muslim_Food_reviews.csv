Sufyan Mikhail Putra,5,Great authentic food at a great price! Will come by often from the east to have my weekly fix. Will always have the chicken rice. Chicken is tasty and juicy. Chilli is not too spicy but does the job. Many other dishes to try. One of the best Halal options in Taman Jurong. A must have!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110024092524044532825/reviews
Mabel Lim,5,"Highly recommend! If you're seeing this, it's a sign to go and check them out. The vendors are such nice and friendly people. (: They give fairly big portions for whatever you order so you can eat until you shiok. It's may be simple looking but it's so delicious and at this price point, super worth it.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110781984368188980392/reviews
