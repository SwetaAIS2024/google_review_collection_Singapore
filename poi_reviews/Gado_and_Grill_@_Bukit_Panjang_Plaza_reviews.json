I love indomie and I think the Satay Gado Mie was the best thing ever, it used to have this chonky satay chicken with the indomie (You can see it from a review from 6 months ago). This year the meat was reduced severely by half to 2 sticks of regular satay ü•≤ was there a change in ownership? Is this from the GST increase? I have no idea but I don't think I can patronize this store as regularly as I once did. Major downer.",

Chilli packs a punch. Fried chicken has very subtle tumeric taste, overall abit bland. Also they can have more gravy on the white rice.",

Vomiting for 2 days, stomach unwell for 3 days. Even had high fever on the first day of food poisoning lol. Spent $100+ on visiting the doctor. Terrible experience. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre serving food from previous days or your kitchen is unhygienic. But something is definitely wrong. Please check because you‚Äôre playing with people‚Äôs lives. This is unethical. Will NEVER eat here ever again and strongly suggest people DO NOT EAT FROM THIS PLACE!!\n\nUNCLEAN FOOD DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!!!!!!",
