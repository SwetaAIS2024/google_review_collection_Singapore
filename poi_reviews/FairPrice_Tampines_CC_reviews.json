      "text": "I‚Äôm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because I generally like this FairPrice. It‚Äôs not overly crowded, and the choices are sufficient. However, my experience today was disappointing due to one staff member at the roasted section.\n\nThe $6.99 promotion for three flavors‚ÄîOriginal, Sesame, and Black Pepper‚Äîwas not clearly displayed above the chicken. Instead, the pricing was placed on another side of the brochure. To add to the confusion, there was also a BBQ chicken placed above the three-flavored chicken, making it unclear which one was actually $6.99.\n\nWhen I asked the staff for clarification, he seemed frustrated when I didn‚Äôt understand the first time. If answering such questions is frustrating for him, did he ever provide feedback to FairPrice? Or does FairPrice choose to ignore these issues?\n\nThis is the first time I‚Äôve encountered a rude staff member here, and it really spoiled my experience. I hope FairPrice improves its signage.",
