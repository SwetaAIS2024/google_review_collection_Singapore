Agnes Agnes,5,"Had the best dim sum feast at Dim Sum Express with the fam today! Super impressed by how fresh and delicious everything was, especially at just $1.50 per plate! Even got a free plate when we ordered 10! The kids can’t get enough of the prawn chee cheong fan, siew mai, har gao, and char siew pau, while my mom is living for the chicken feet & pork ribs. So happy we can enjoy all these tasty treats without breaking the bank! We’re definitely making this a weekly tradition!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114174517296972338938/reviews
John,1,"First came to this stall about 5 or more years ago. Visited over a dozen times. But today it's really disappointing.

Ordered 11 items, only received 10, realised it only when I got home.

1 of the service staff was impatient and aggressive, wanted me to leave when there were 8 or so items only, but was told there were more items by another colleague. Or else I would only have 8 instead of 10 items.

Quality was shockingly bad from my previous experiences. All of them are worse than saizeriya quality except for yam cake and the Zhu Chang Feng.

Extremely disappointed.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111974117677082218074/reviews
SZ Lim,4,"No frills dim sum shop. Very fast and efficient service. I tried the Shao mai, custard bao, fried yam, and Har gao. The steamed ones were not bad for 1.50. It is true that they are not on par with restaurant grade dim sum. But at this price point, honestly it is definitely worth more than it's price.

Thank the bosses for having such a wonderful shop over here. Support.

Would have given 5 stars but I only give 5 stars for restaurants with something really special. I will definitely return.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114108831723577323443/reviews
LEQ,3,"Went at 6am on a Saturday, it was very peaceful and quiet. Food was average, but acceptable for $1.5 a dish. Service was very quick. Steamed pork was sour, probably not the freshest.

Would still visit for a quick, adorable, early dimsum fix.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103371193392617884211/reviews
