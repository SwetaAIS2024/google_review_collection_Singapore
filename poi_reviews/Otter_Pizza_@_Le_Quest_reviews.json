      "text": "This was my first time trying pizza from this brand. I ordered a cheese pizza, which, based on the menu photo, is supposed to have spinach on top. However, the pizza I received did not include any spinach. When I asked the staff about this, the initial response was dismissive, with one staff member simply saying, 'That's just how it is.' I received the same answer when asked again. Upon asking a senior staff member, I was informed that the spinach they received that day was spoiled, so it could not be used.\n\nWhile I understand the situation with the spinach, it would have been courteous and professional to inform me beforehand, allowing me to choose an alternative topping or even a different item. The lack of communication and the indifferent attitude of some staff members left me feeling disappointed and undervalued as a customer. Clearer communication and better customer service would greatly enhance the experience.",
