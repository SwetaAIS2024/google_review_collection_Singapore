I find the price reasonable, based on the quality and quantity. The place was clean and comfortable. The service was great, too. Do note that they close at 2:30 p.m., but the last order is at 2 p.m.",

      "text": "Worth the a visit! Chillax location on a Saturday morning without noisy patrons. Easy parking within ATP itself. Add on a walk at Hort Park (side gate has direct access to ATP).\n\nWarm and friendly service. Reasonable prices compared to other sando places which charge high $20s. Here the sandwiches are net prices and mostly under $17.\n\nWe had:\n1. Beef brisket - flavorful, enjoyed it lots\n2. Hoki fish - fish was over fried to a hard crisp. It was just ok\n3. Spam-O - thick slab of spam and hash brown. Can’t go wrong with this combo\n4. Flat white, Cappuccino - good cuppas\n\nBreakfast sandos +$3 for a sizeable portion of tater tots.\n\nWill absolutely return again for a chill, tasty and value meal.",

Not a fan of the shredded cabbage though, just felt kinda rough to the mouth ??? And each cabbage keep falling out which was annoying, minus 0.5 points for demure eating experience — rating: 3.5/5. ⁣\n⁣\n🥚𝐓𝐫𝐮𝐟𝐟𝐥𝐞 𝐓𝐚𝐦𝐚𝐠𝐨𝐲𝐚𝐤𝐢 ($12.80): Part of their all-day breakfast selection — tamagoyaki, truffle sauce, egg salad, coral lettuce. The tamago was perfect in terms of thickness, fluffiness and bite 🤍 However it was too sweet and got jelak even though I only had a half. Could have toned down on the sugar as the bread itself was already sweet — rating: 2.5/5. ⁣",
