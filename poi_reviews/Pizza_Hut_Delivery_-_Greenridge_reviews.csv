K,5,"Food
- As usual, it is best to eat freshly made pizza right away and not delivered. Love the pizza at pizza hut, has more toppings and cheese than other brands. Order 2 regular (cheaper in 2s) for 4 pax (2A2C).

Service
- Lady on duty is very friendly and patient.

Atmosphere
- Clean, small, but cozy.

Worth to revisit again?

Hi Sam,5,"A quick process from ordering to collection, of course have to wait for the pizza which i can go around the mall to run errands first.
Staffs are friendly.

One thing about the atmosphere inside, I know pizzahut known for their stuffed pizza.
its bit stuffy and warm. The ac is not felt to have a comfortable dining in experience.

Anyway, you cant go wrong with pizzahut!.
Cheers to that.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104471885153236434908/reviews

Anne,5,"Food was good! Hot, perfectly cheesy, and satisfying. Service was great too, especially since it was close to closing time I was worried that I would be imposing, but Emman was extremely accommodating and provided excellent service.
