      "text": "Extremely disappointing food and service. They were catering an event at our school and were totally unprepared for the number of people attending. We queued for 40 min with 6 people in front of us to order 4 beef and chicken ‚Äústeak burgers‚Äù. The food is inedible, $35 straight in the bin. Boiled beef meat of questionable origin in a soggy bun, chicken slightly better, all tasted absolutely disgusting. And this was meant to cater a children and parents event. Staff were super unfriendly, service couldn‚Äôt be slower if they tried and every single order was packed in a separate plastic bag we didn‚Äôt ask for. So disappointed with hungry kids that we still need to feed somewhere.",

      "text": "The quality of the coffee has plummeted. They seem to have stopped serving specialty coffee, at least not in the form of a flat white, which was more a long black with a thick layer of foam. Even during the circuit breaker, they‚Äôd served good coffee with chocolaty/nutty flavoured beans from Liberty. Then, the steak and cheese grilled sandwich tasted nice though there was room for the portion of ingredients to be more substantial.",
