Adequate ceiling fans to keep ventilation flowing amidst the humid weather. Stall owner and service staff are all friendly. SGQR is accepted across all stalls.",

      "text": "Excellent quality prawn mee here from ËÄÅ‰∏âËôæÈù¢ will always try to stop over to eat this whenever I happen to pass by this area..The drinks ladies also very nice and hardworking going around taking drinks order-- great for 1 person very hard to jus walk away from the table just to buy drinks esp when rushin for time and nobody to help look after the food and bag esp against the birds flying around waiting to steal food from our plates once u walk away from it and the birds may just land on your food or peck on it which happened to me before in Jurong East (horrible full of birds) I had a horrible experience I had to throw away the entire bowl of duck noodles. Overall pleasant friendly ambience and nice food. Havent tried other food but will try if have a chance. Nice design for the coffee cup‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèº",
