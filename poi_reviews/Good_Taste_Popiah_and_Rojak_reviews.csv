Dom Wee,2,Long queue. Many orders. So I tried and I don't know what the fuss is about.  I had both chili and non spicy it was not nice. Also had the pancake which was like eating bread. He was skillful in wrapping though.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100816623631168791184/reviews

Tony Ng,4,"This stall is at one corner of the coffee shop (beside drink stall). Run by friendly old couple but nowadays is usually the uncle manning the stall alone. Love their Popiah and Min Jiang Kueh. Will usually buy from him when dropby to tapao wanton mee.

Although food taste not the best but the friendly uncle will make you go back again.
