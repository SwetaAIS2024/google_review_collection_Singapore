I saw with my eyes egg shell was added foc without removing.\n\nTaste is ok, but thats because i had it freshly made out if the pan immediately. It will be very elastic if its left out a while, curry was overly salty but manageable.\n\nPricing logical 1.80sgd for egg",

      "text": "Tucked away in the corner of this coffeeshop one can easily miss this stall. The nice smiley tall chap who attended to me asked if I was vegetarian. When I said I wasn't, he gave me fish curry. I asked for my favourite coconut chutney. Service was pretty fast and when I collected my paper thosai ($2.50), he said \"Ready already\" with a grin.\nHonestly, parts of my paper thosai was a little soft  but I didn't mind. It was also abit oily than usual. BUT the coconut chutney was not tangy but full of fried onion flavour and tasted SO good. Dhal curry was also good. I am not a fan of fish curry but it was not bad. I had to return to the stall after my meal and commend him on the chutney. He was apologetic and said \"Sat Sun alot of people\" so almost finishing and going to close and didn't make another batch. Gave him feedback and said paper thosai abit oily. He thought for a while and told me \"Sister, next time tell me I try to make it nice for you\". That really warmed me up. Actually I had already eaten horfun and HK mee from the zi char  stall but just had to try my paper thosai.  Worth trying.",
