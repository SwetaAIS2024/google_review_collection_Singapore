Yong,1,This is the worst Sushi Express Iâ€™ve ever been to! There were barely any new dishes coming out on the belt. There was no refill for the ginger or wasabi at all! The wasabi container was filled with trash â€” even shrimp shells â€” and it stayed that way for over half an hour. It was still there the whole time. Absolutely disgusting!,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102199896355733099547/reviews
Billy Lim,5,"Went to Sushi Express at IMM for dinner, the queue was long but the staff will try their best to slot you in.

Sushi choice is quite limited as compared to other sushi shops. But relatively affordable range.

Overall it's a good place for sushi if you are craving it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109558301923399742564/reviews
