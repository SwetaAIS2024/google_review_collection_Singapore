Abigail Foo,4,"I am a bit unsatisfied by the serving time from Mawar Thai Stall. It was slow simply because i requested for my pineapple egg fried rice to have no chilli and to replace the prawn with chicken (i am allergic to shellfish), so i think the cooks got confused by my requests.

But the food itself was actually really good. The rice was flavourful and fragrant. The egg yolk melts in my mouth and the juicy pineapple is packed with a burst of sweet and sour. However, the chicken tastes too ‚Äúchickeny,‚Äù if that makes sense.

Ong ong lai is also very clean compared to most hawker centres i have visited.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116354546691691247708/reviews

Simon Y,4,"This is one unique coffeeshop that does not have the usual suspects of Chicken Rice/HK Roasts/Noodle stalls. Instead they have assembled a cluster of international cusines - Vietnam stall, Thai stalls(x2), China stall(Mala), Western Japan fusion etc.....

Pretty vabrient and busy during lunch hours.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110316451866688483932/reviews

Kelvin Lim,5,"Nicely renovated. Offers a cosy and clean experience for me and family.

This coffeeshop offers more variety of cuisine. (Western, Viet, Malay, Chinese, Thai etc.)

One of my favorite dinner spots now with friends and family. Highly recommended for weekend gatherings as there is ample parking available. üòÄ",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103264536510361135552/reviews
