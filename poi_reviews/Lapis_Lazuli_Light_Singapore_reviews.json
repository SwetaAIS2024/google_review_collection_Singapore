Includes various supplements (highly recommended if you're looking for real stuff eg. vitamin eg. D, K , supplements for bone, eyes etc... ),  vegetables, nuts, daily provisions (food and non-food) are available here.\nI love their natto miso, and vitamin C from S. America forest which is unlike those commercial ones readily available containing artificial ingredients.  It may cost more but in the end healthier for our body & no hidden costs.\nAnother hidden gem is their most knowledgeable staff ! Happy shopping...",
