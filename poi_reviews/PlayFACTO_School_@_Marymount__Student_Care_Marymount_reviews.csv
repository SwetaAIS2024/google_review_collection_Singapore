Carrie Lim,5,"When my son was in P1, I decided to enrol him at Playfacto instead of the after-school care in his school despite the relatively higher fees. 4 years on and I have not regret this decision. The environment is good, and the teachers dedicated, they truly care for the kids. Other than academic, the center also constantly arrange many activities to engage the students.  Most importantly, my son loves Playfacto. It is like his 2nd home.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108992621883748781697/reviews
Eleen Seah,5,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

We have been extremely pleased with the care and attention our son has received at PlayFACTO's Marymount outlet. The staff genuinely prioritize the wellbeing of each child, creating a nurturing and supportive environment. Our son not only completes his homework consistently but also receives assistance with his spelling and other schoolwork. The dedication and commitment of the team have made a significant positive impact on our son's learning and overall development. We highly recommend PlayFACTO Marymount to any parent seeking quality after-school care.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117437613098543313750/reviews
Rachel Yeo,5,Third year for my boy in this after school care. Shout out to Teacher Mag for her dedication and care. My boy comes home with all his work done and spelling all learnt. After school hours before bed time are dedicated to family time and conversations without having to check on my boy's work. Keep it up!!,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107143932267873383941/reviews
Thomas Aw,5,"My daughter has been with the centre since its opening in 2021 and I have to compliment the centre director and my daughter’s teacher for taking good care of my daughter for her after school care. My daughter settled in very quickly in its rather cozy environment and she is happy to be there. The teacher is also dedicated to ensuring my daughter’s homework, if any, is done. All in all, my experience with the Marymount centre has been positive and I would most certainly recommend it.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114515498460868321539/reviews
GungNir C.,5,"The difference between this branch and others are the teachers and centre managers involved. Everyone is committed to building a great environment for your children to grow up in. Our girl looks forward to going to Playfacto after school every day, even during the school holidays she will not miss the chance to go there. No regrets joining this branch!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104557524261886505819/reviews
