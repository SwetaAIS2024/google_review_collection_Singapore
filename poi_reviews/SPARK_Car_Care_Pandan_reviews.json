He immediately attended to me in understanding my car’s problem.\nWhile the car is in the workshop, Sheik came forward to enlighten me on how to follow up and have my car engine running smoothly.\nMy overall experience has been awesome.  I highly commend Sheik’s professionalism and helpfulness.",

Thankfully Mr Sheik and a nice sister Madam who was manning the customer service counter were able to take my car in still. They were very polite andd explained to me what steps were to be taken and my options. The problem was fixed within 2hrs of me waiting there and the cost was very affordable too. Mr Sheik was extremely helpful and kind as he also advised me on what to look out for after the servicing. Overall it was a pleasant experience. It would really be great if coffee and tea (and biscuits) are served as there are no F&B options around at all.",
