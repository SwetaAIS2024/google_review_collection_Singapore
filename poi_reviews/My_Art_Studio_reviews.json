There is a good variety of workshops and both of them are able to understand the description in the brochure and choose the workshops they are interested in. During the workshop, they also enjoy the process of creating their own masterpiece and have joy in explaining how they crafted the items. Thank you for organizing new workshops every holiday!",

She makes sure my masterpiece was done up nicely as she helped with touching it up to make it look so much nicer. Because of her, I want to take up more lessons, so I'm looking forward to more affordable short lessons if there are in the future :)",
