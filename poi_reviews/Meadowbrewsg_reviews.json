Plenty of other option if you prefer non coffee.\nMy go to coffee spot if I want a quick fix of caffeine.\n\nDownside is the lack of air-conditioning so it gets abit warm during hot days.",

Their single origin with medium roast coffee is good to try! The owner is friendly and always open for coffee suggestions! His concept is to go for a chillax coffee place! Moreover you can get 1 free cup after purchasing 10 cups from him!",
