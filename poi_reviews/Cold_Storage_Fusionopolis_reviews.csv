Teng Ren,1,"This store has turned from ok to bad and now to worse. The downward slope is more evident in recent months. The products is bad, you can’t find some upper scale products yet the prices keep high or even increased significantly. What’s even worse is it sold expired products. For example in the picture (taken on 25 Mar, 2025) it was selling product expired on 20 Mar, 2025. And the products were soaked in suspicious water leaking from the fridge. The store changed layout with no sense or taste. Many products are on the shelf without price tags. Eggs of different brands with similar packages are mixed on the same shelf making it difficult for consumers to choose. Staff are rude and lack of training (or received training on how to offend customers?) eg. When I was self checking out, one of the employees closely stood by me and watched me, and grabbed my receipt to check even without asking! I was astonished by this type of behaviour and realised she was not trying to assist but as a police watching a crime and catch a thief. Please go somewhere else for shopping!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114973464438875493339/reviews
Gie,1,"Brought the honey roast chicken at Cold Storage @ One North today and was sold a spoilt old chicken. The meat have an awesome had already turned sour.

Daniel Bok,5,"5 star service. Was looking for celery and carrots and could only find the organic options. The service staff, Geok, volunteered and helped me find exactly the non-organic versions I was looking for and this was when I was already on my way and paying. Loved her enthusiasm and service level!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114835379352368094009/reviews
