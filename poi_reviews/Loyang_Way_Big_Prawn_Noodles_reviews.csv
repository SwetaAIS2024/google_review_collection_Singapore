D Yew,5,"Situated in one corner of a canteen in an area essentially dominated by factories and offices. Develops a queue each day at lunch, so I like to beat the crowd by coming early around 11.00.

I'll admit that this is one of the few prawn noodle stalls where I always order the large portion of their dry prawn noodles (with soup on the side). After all,  I don't make the trek all the way out here often so why not just get my fill of its lovely flavor. They already provide ample pork lard with the noodles but I often request for a little more.  So far, they've been obliging.

They stir up that big pot of soup first before ladling it into your soup bowl. I think that makes a difference because it suspends all the little bits of goodies at the bottom of the pot which find their way into your bowl. It's a hearty soup with a deep, rich taste of the prawn stock. Adding a couple spoons full of this soup to your dry noodles before eating it just adds that extra oomph to your noodles.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115202752123298046466/reviews
Ryan Tay,5,"Loyang Big Prawn Noodles is hands down the best prawn mee I’ve ever had. The soup is next-level — rich, full-bodied, and bursting with that deep umami sweetness only a well-prepared prawn broth can deliver. It’s the kind of soup you’ll find yourself finishing to the last drop.

The prawns? Insanely fresh. You can taste the quality with every bite — juicy, firm, and naturally sweet. They don’t skimp on portion either, and the size of the prawns lives up to the name. Every element on the plate is just done right.

If you’re a prawn mee lover, this place is a must-try. Worth the drive, the queue — everything.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112868278324788507888/reviews
Choon T,5,"Located within a food court in an industrial area in Loyang. Despite being quite ulu, you can expect a queue during lunchtime.

The prawns were fresh and the broth was umami! And you can go back for a 2nd helping of the soup.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114720035040328969753/reviews
Roy Lee,5,"Probably ranks right up there for all the prawn noodles that I have tried in SG. Good portion, good taste, good price. Downside is that it caters to the industrial crowd timings, so if you try to avoid the lunch crowds in order to secure parking, you'll find most other stalls closed.
Most importantly, I have to add: I get none of that greasy taste that you often find in other noodle stalls that also cook the yellow noodles in soup. Really good handling and prep.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110276448961627744277/reviews
A T (Ah Tiong),4,"The prawn noodles has a rich, flavorful broth with a nice seafood taste. The prawns are fresh and big, and the noodles soak up all that goodness. You get some crispy shallots for extra texture.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116088554117264979395/reviews
