Shirley Chua,5,"We were glad to have prestige family clinic in our neighbourhood that is within mins walk from our place. My mum was old and not mobile so we requested Dr Chiew to do a house visit to help take alook at my mum's condition. He obliged on the house call and was very patient in examining my mum. He even followed up with my mum's condition by whatapps. Really appreciate his care and concern.

Another visit to the clinic was made by my helper as she has a deep cut accidentally. Dr Lim said he was fm KK emergency department so he is very familiar with accidental cuts and wound He assured that my helper did not hurt her tendon with the cut.

Really glad that we have experienced and  competent doctors in our neighbourhood.  As the clinic is still quite new in the neighbourhood, we do not need to wait for long Qs and it is really time saving. Greatly recommend!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108886081134715474640/reviews
