syed Ibrahim Yusoff,3,Ordered mutton and babat. 0.90 cents per stick. The babat and the muttom werr not enough cooked to perfection. They still rubbery taste. The mutton were more than fat than meat. The peanut sauce is moderate. Well maybe the owner was rushing today as there were much crowded.  Burning up the satay faster than usual.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110405930017936179870/reviews

Yi Kang Ng,5,I ate the mee rebus today and it was very nice. When asked whether to add satay peanut sauce to it I was puzzled at first but boy was it a great addition! Makes the whole dish so special and second to none. Wish i had a second serving if im not already a fattie.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108619597284500748522/reviews
Joanna Lee,5,"Decided to try the satay here after seeing Uncle grilling and fanning the satay. We just ate satay from another queuing stall but that one was sweet and with coloring so definitely not to my liking. The beef satay here was meaty, nicely marinated infused with lemongrass and grilled with the smokiness from the charcoal. Very sedap! ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹Must try the mutton satay next time as it was sold out.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103918594608782940156/reviews
Terence Tan,5,"One of the best satay in Bedok FC.

Today makan gado gado. Shiok, the peanut sauce is so sedap. The ketupat is not those lontong type, it's the betul betul ketupat. Good quantity for a plate of gado gado got $4.

For satay, my favorite meat is mutton! Do try it when u r here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107525131369857002446/reviews
