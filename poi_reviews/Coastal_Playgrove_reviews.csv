General Twilight,5,"Great view of the city from the top of the slide tower. It is great for children to play as there are 2 slides and small pools around it for children to play in. Inside the tower, there are also ropes structures for children and adult to climb to the top. It is a great get away from the city life. Great playground.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114314523990529053400/reviews

Richard Toh,3,"Great playground especially the net areas...however, this is also the worst slides we have tried..slides made of stainless steel (which is good), but too much friction and caused abrasions when rub against our skin..just be prepared to be stuck halfway..suggest NParks to think of ways to smoothen the slides..",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108074668437384371146/reviews

clare isabel,5,"Great open air water playground if you don't mind some fallen leaves and a couple of ants (this is not a place for those who are very particular about sanitizing everything!). The water is at different depths suitable for different abilities of crawlers and walkers. My kid had loads of fun splashing about! Gets crowded on weekends, much better on weekdays.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118415632979033048048/reviews
