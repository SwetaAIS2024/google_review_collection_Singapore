HC Lum,4,"Visited this outlet on a Sunday, lucky it‚Äôs not busy. All looks very good, but ended with Quarter Leg $9.90 nett. The quarter leg is huge, almost half of the ceramic plate served. I like them as they are serving the nasi lemak in ceramic big plate. Nowadays not all dine in have proper plating for serving as most wanted convenient using plastic. This is my plus point to this place. Chicken is fried to crispy crunch from the outside and well marinated from the inside and juicy. The sambal chili is good with both fragrance coconut milk rice and the fried chicken. It will be 5 stars if they have their egg sunny side up. üòç Definitely worth a trip there to eat.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107295031316336799609/reviews
KKT,5,"Nice fragrant fried chicken.
Fish fillet is also nice.
Mee Soto soup is flavourful.
Teh with pandan leave is ok, but lacks tea intensity.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399770588752359508/reviews
Mohamed Haniffa,2,"Was hungry, so dropped by this place on my way to MRT station. There are self ordering kiosks outside. After making an order, made my way in. Greeted the staff but got no reply. Sad.
After abt 10mins, collected my meal. Honestly, my meal looked identical to that of Encik Tan food but abit more money value to it.üòú. Food was okok. Teh drink was decent. The return tray shelfs was crowded. Had to move a cup to return my tray. A decent size floor plan. Can cater abt 40pax. Don't think i would return back sadly.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106001901776455159598/reviews
Tia2105,5,"Dear management, on Saturday 8 Feb, we dined in at the cafe at 9am  and noticed that your Malay lady staff was handling all orders (walk-in & delivery platforms) alone.

Of course most orders arrived & cleared late but the walk in customers understood her situation and patiently waited until our orders were ready. The staff was trying her best to clear all orders as fast as she could and we could even hear she explaining to the delivery riders ""I am alone. I am trying to cope with all orders"".

I feel the management needs to look into this matter and be kind and supportive to your staff. It was only close to 10am when 2 more staff arrived to assist.

Food wise, they tasted very good.
We ‚ù§Ô∏è  the nasi lemak and sambal, sambal ikan bilis toast & mi rebus.

So management,  you know your cafe has very good reviews. Please do not jeopardize it.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115351746848971577023/reviews
fearrow,5,"After hearing glowing reviews about Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang Signature restaurant from a friend, we decided to visit for lunch.

Upon our visit, I opted for the flavorful Nasi Lemak Ayam Goreng Berempah, while my wife ordered the mouthwatering Indo Mie with Grilled Chicken topped with Taliwang sauce. To our surprise, the restaurant also included bergedil and tempeh as complimentary sides, which added an extra touch of generosity to our meal.

Both dishes were absolutely delicious, and my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. In fact, she even suggested that we bring along our parents for our next visit, as she is confident they would love the experience just as much as we did.

Overall, our visit to Nasi Lemak Ayam Taliwang Signature was truly delightful, and we are looking forward to returning soon with our family.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114871863174076338408/reviews
