Although it is relatively academically poor, the teachers here truly has a passion and deeply care for the students. This school is a mix of fun filled activites and discipline.This school is really strict and stern.However,the school also has really fun activities planned and all the activities are innovative and useful.The sec 1 orientation is made super fun and helpful that i gained quite a lot of friends from it.The maintainence is asko very good the water cooler was broken but unlike my primary school,they fixed it within 1 week!Overall highly reccommend to study here if u want to make some great friends,supportive teachers and awsome memories",

Strict with discipline, if anything go wrong just find Ms Rebecca (music teacher) not recommended for those who stay far unless you want to wake up earlier ( strict with attendance) Sec 1 orientation is very fun, teacher nice, school layout not that bad. I personally hate that weird shaped staircase tho. Hope you will join OPSS.",
