Yen Lee,5,"Got the mutton biryani for takeaway ($8) and the serving size is good for 2 persons. It comes with pickles, 1 boiled egg, potato masala and a generous serving of tenderly cooked mutton. I'm almost sad that I didn't start eating from this store earlier.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107950494790116132485/reviews

chicken,5,"I'm personally a regular here. The mutton briyani priced at 8 dollars really never disappoints me as the portion size is enough for 2 meals. The owner and the staff are also extremely welcoming. By far around the Boon Keng area, the Best Briyani is this place right here, both in terms of price and taste,",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108575428594706169487/reviews
Victor Marz,5,"We shared some very tasty Chicken Murtabak, Prata, Chicken Curry Sauce, and Maggi Goreng. DonBaasha is great value for money with good food portion sizes for a fair price. All ingredients tasted very fresh. We also had a very good coconut here. I will be back for more, that is for sure.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106253152987149044626/reviews
James Rai,5,"Always open (even during cny), more affordable than the other bigger roti prata places, and fast service. Gets slightly crowded on the weekends so you might wait a little, and you might need to repeat your order as they do forget sometimes - the real mama shop experience!

5 stars for the same guys running the joint all the time.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102255643266203384548/reviews
