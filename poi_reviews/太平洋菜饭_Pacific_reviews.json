Nothing spectacular about these dishes but from my own opinion, it is below average. I feel it is better off for me eating at the nearby hawker centre. The eating area is quite alright except for some flies flying around that irritated me while eating. Overall, I will not go back again as the prices are quite pricey. Above is just my humble opinion but it may differ depending on what food was selected.",

Was pretty shocked when the bill came up to be $6.30 for this meal. However, lady was very friendly and as the coffee shop is new, it‚Äôs a clean and nice environment to dine in. I did not find it tasty but it‚Äôs strictly my own personal taste bud.",
