      "text": "This Zhi Char Resturant has been in Toa Payoh Lor 7️⃣ Market for well over 20yrs. 📆 Moved once from one coffee shop to another but the consistency 💪 in the food 🍲 they have produced over the years is truly admirable 😎.\n\nStaff : Are mostly old 🧓🏻 timers who I now know by heart ❤️. They have been with them for ages. Friendly, patience and always ready to recommend a dish or two 💁🏼‍♀️.\n\nFood : They say in Singapore, 🇸🇬 “Good stuff, cannot bluff!” Really have Wok Hey in the fried food and always well marinated, well prepared and well cooked! I would recommend this few simple dish 1) Their Prawn 🦐 Ball, 2) The Cai Poh Tofu 🧈, 3) The Black Bean Beef 🥩Hor Fun and 4) Cereal Prawn 🍤 . These 4️⃣ dishes 🍜🧆🍲🍤 stands out the most for me. Unfortunately, I will honestly say their crab 🦀 is not up to the usual crab restaurants (will not mention other names) standards. And the crab are not Sri Lankan 🇱🇰 crabs so, I will not normally make it my first 🥇 choice to order crab here.\n\nOverall, an affordable and enjoyable 🙇‍♂️  eating out experience. Oh and they give free desserts 🍧!! Lol 🤣 so of course, we will be back 🔄!",

A good dish to go with rice.\n8 pax for about 120 is really a gd buy.",

      "text": "🥢🍚🟫  This Yi Jia Village Seafood Restaurant is one of the better zhi-char 煮炒 stalls here in Toa Payoh East area. The quality of the dishes here is pretty good.\n\n🟩 A good quality zhi-char stall should be able to churn out a varied array of dishes to order.  🔷️ I can tell you the zhi-char dishes here are great, and that's why the kopi-tiam ( coffee shop) here is also very lively.\n\n🟠 During festive occasions, like Chinese New Year or the Mid-Autumn Festival, this place is packed to the gills. That is testament to how good this zhi-char stall is.\n\n🟤 They do very good zhi-char classics here, but I like their Gu-Loh-Yuk alot. 🟧 Their Sweet & Sour Pork is succulent & juicy,  the batter coating is very crispy, and the entire dish is drenched in this sticky, tangy but flavourful sauce.\n\n🟫 The 2nd dish I love from them is = the Chye Poh Braised Tofu. 🥢 The entire slab of tofu is deep-fried first, then braised in this sweet-salty umami-filled soy sauce gravy and laden with tons of chye poh nibs.\n\n🔷️ The result is a scrumptious & savoury slab of soft, smooth & silky tofu topped with lots of chye poh ( preserved radish)\n\n✅️ Previously, they used to drench the braised tofu with minced meat or bak chor. But they changed the recipe recently, but it's still good.\n\n❇️ Service-wise, as with most kopitiam zhi-char stalls, the service staff here are efficient, swift and amiable. 😅 The atmosphere you get here is that of a bustling and boisterous ambience in a typical HDB coffeeshop zhi-char setting.",

Seating was cramped as it was raining. Some tables were set at the wet market. Probably come here another time when it’s not so crowded for another review.",
