YY,4,"Didn‚Äôt know that it was a full 5 üåü coffee stall when we tried it, but definitely saw a constant stream of diners come by for their drinks fix.

‚òïÔ∏è the coffee and tea was decent, nothing to complain about in terms of taste

üí∞ price point was a little confusing - saw that it was $1.60 on the menu but was charged $1.80 cos we were given plastic takeaway cups (they ran out of the normal glass ones)?

Unsure if that was the case but it wasn‚Äôt transparent pricing to us hence marking them down by a star.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews

MNG,5,"In recent years, many YTF stalls are buying off the shelf ingredients such as sausage and fishcake.

The ingredients offered are mainly handmade. Some of them I haven't seen in most stalls around.
Both types of fishcakes were of excellent quality. Each ingredient is $0.60 which is a steal.

The soup base is of soya bean and anchovy which is light and clean tasting.

Sides such as soya bean and spring onion are offered for one to add.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews
