Perhaps I caught her on the wrong day.\n\nNevertheless, the food is very good for a food court and I enjoyed the signature minced pork noodles.",

      "text": "This is my go-to for a filling bowl of classic mee pok tossed in vinegar, chili and soy sauce. The noodles are easy to eat - not too soft or chewy, and seasoning sauce is balanced without being overpowering or bland.\n\nThe $5.80 portion is generous and enough to fill a hungry tummy. The ingredients are also fresh and yummy - blanched pink pork liver, meatball, fishball, lean pork slices, and a bowl of soup completes the meal.",

      "text": "The prawn noodle dish was a culinary disappointment. The noodles were overcooked, resulting in a mushy texture that was far from appetizing. The prawns lacked freshness and tasted more like freezer burn than the ocean. The broth, touted as the star, was bland and lacked depth, leaving me yearning for flavor. Overall, a regrettable dining experience that failed to deliver on the promised satisfaction.",

Though it’s always long queue but it’s so entertaining to see how the beautiful lady boss taking orders, remember your orders and preparing your orders with cheerful smile. This attitude has already open up the appetite for the meal you are going to have.\n\nThe food wise I like to eat dish no.1 Bak Chok Mee soup, the soup is hot enough to warm the tummy to start my day. The liver is medium rare that immerse into the soup to make it taste better.\n\nChildren likes their fishball noodle and prawn beehoon soup. It’s children friendly.\n\nAs you can see from the photos, the stall kept clean and bright, these shows how hygienic this stall is.\n\nHighly recommended",
