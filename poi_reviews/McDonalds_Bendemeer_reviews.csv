Samuel Goh,5,"It has always been a good experience here, despite the number of people who patronise this joint.

I’ve always had no issues with my food whenever eating in. The only time we had missing drinks (which we checked and rectified on the spot) was when I mass-bought for 20 people for a takeaway.

Today, Jac kindly explained that the Table Number should be indicated for mobile orders instead of the Table Tent number.

This place is generally clean but can be really packed during meal hours.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100714548997023510355/reviews
Jan C,1,"Manager of this outlet needs to do more. It’s not the first time tt I encountered a mess when collecting my food but today’s experience was the absolute worst. My number was called for collection; went up; counter staff said order not ready, pls go wait; I waited; until my number completely disappeared from the screen. Turned out the coconut ice cream machine is down and NOBODY bothered to even check with us and tell us. They simply SKIPPED our order. Hello?? Also, who does chocolate cone like this??? If you can’t be bothered to work there then don’t.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106324235236820071717/reviews
Jackie L,1,Dont order or grabfood from here. Every morning always need wait 1 hour (excluding delivery time) because lack of hash brown or short staffed. If service so slow I go NTUC buy my own hash brown airfry still faster than this fast food,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105438973471348026210/reviews
Fatin Nabilah,1,"how do you even miss a the main meal? One wrap missing, called mcd hotline and deliveroo hotline could not help. Can only refund and waste our time waiting 1hr plus waiting for this meal when it’s just 0.3KM away. On top of that, only one of us gets to eat a whole meal. So is the other expected to reorder and wait another 1hr plus JUST for the wrap to come??",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116809093616502363498/reviews
ganesh soranam,3,"The screen which tells the order number does not work. I feel sorry for the staff for having to shout out the numbers. This is not the first time this has happened in this outlet. MacDonalds need to look into this for better welfare of their staff.      Moreover , the orders are sometimes missing items . This has to change… I think MacDonalds should look into this.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107932786884648430985/reviews
