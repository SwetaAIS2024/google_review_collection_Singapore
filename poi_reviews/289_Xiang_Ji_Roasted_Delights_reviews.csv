Kenneth Lee,5,"Really enjoyed their roasted pork, char siew and roasted chicken. Tasty, moist, crispy and generous portion. Chicken rice is flavourful, and well-cooked. Newly opened 7 months ago. Previously from coffee shop at Blk 289, behind former Yusof Isak Secondary School.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110877016815160457861/reviews
Danel Maderazo,5,I grew up eating at auntie’s place. I’m the little fat boy she always gives extra rice with when they are at 289 blk. They relocated and it’s 20 mins from my place. This was the first chicken rice i ate in Singapore and it has became my benchmark since then. The food is really worth the price. They are generous and i’ll continue to come here!!!!! ❤️,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101432381469146020801/reviews
