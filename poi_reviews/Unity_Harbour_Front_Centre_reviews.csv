Mastiana Hoque,1,"A really rude and terrible experience at Unity Pharmacy. The Unity is on the way as you go into Fair Price. I was walking in and taking a look at some of the Avene products on special. One staff member was helping another customer and they were discussing the products. The STAFF member pretty much pushed me aside and backed herself into me whilst serving this other customer. How incredibly RUDE! No apology and no consideration. I mentioned it to another staff member in the pharmacy who didn’t seem to care very much. Wow, great job unity nice to know how much you value your customers.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109501654260335183356/reviews

Kiagos Mohamed Faizal,5,"After my bad exoerience at Dawson I was a bit hesitated with Harboufront outlet. At that point of time there was a queue and only the pharmacist was there attending to a customer despite of attending to a customer she was polite enough to apologise and said I wull be attended to in a short while. Managed to get the item after the custimer was attended and coincidently the cashier came back. To me no issue. But what impressed me was the cashier too apologies for any delay, i said its ok . Wanted to use the eVoucher and was assisted by the cashier without any comment. Unlike the one at Dawson Place who was very rude. To the Pharmacist and Cashier at Harboufront, you are an asset to your organisation. Very good Service Excellece. Thank you",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107747836324064941926/reviews
