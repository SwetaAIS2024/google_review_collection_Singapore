Flo Yeow,3,"This is a decent spot for after-work drinks, but it's not without its flaws. While the overall experience was okay, the service was a letdown. We ordered a Sapporo beer tower and some spam fries, but unfortunately, the beer tasted sour. When we asked for a replacement or at least for the staff to taste it, they refused, which was disappointing.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Hao Tan,4,"A good place to chill out in the evening after work. Good selection of liquors and Beers. There also good amounts of foods on their menu. Had enjoyed their Thai foods and bar bites. Dinning in the open, its nice and windy. Perhaps the only distraction was the neon light at our table which make the area a little too dark.

CK C,4,"Nice place to have a drink or two as draft beers were only at $8-9++ a pint all day. Music selection was good but a little too loud. Very spacious and empty even on a Saturday evening. Food menu was limited as not everything was available and the Thai food stall was closed. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the Cajun Fried Chicken Wings, which were perfectly fried and juicy. Ordering was easy using the QR code. Service was OK.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews

The platters are huge, can be shared among friends munching while chatting. Drinks available in towers and buckets that suits different drinking crowds.
