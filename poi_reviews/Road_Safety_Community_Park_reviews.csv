Khairy Norady,4,"I have always felt this is a great initiative for young children to learn road safety. Also pleased that it remains open for public access at any time (except when there is a session of course). Hope the area can be maintained well.
Roller bladers/ skate scooters/ whoever rides plastic wheels have to be careful as some areas can be covered with moss and hence are slippery.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110364255559571063321/reviews

KiM BooN LeE,3,"Not really sure is this place still in operations but believe that it will bring back lot of memories for many people... During primary school time you will have a chance to be here acting as ""drivers"" ""riders"" ""pedestrians"" practicing Road Safety. You will be given a card, all you need to do is to go to the respective station, they have these mini petrol station/bus stops/ vicom etc etc with traffic lights and zebra crossing, to get a stamp without committing any traffic offences then you will passed off as a road safety users, cool rite?!?",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104527916285751902034/reviews
Runner Kao,5,"The last time I visited this place was during my primary school days, where we came here to learn about road safety.

I was happy that this place is still very well maintained and they had added a few nice things, like a mini replica of the shell station.

Children can learn the importance of road safety in this well simulated mini roads. There are road landmarks like traffic lights, zebra crossings and many more.

Once they had this knowledge, this will ensure their well being on the roads. When not in operations, it is open to the public for visit and use. ðŸ˜Š",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106055160577192220530/reviews
Alfred Chan,3,"It is a pitiful that the road safety park is lacking of maintenance. The setup still remains relevant for kids even without the good old days ""carts"". Parents can bring their children with their own carts to enjoy the park.

Hopefully the Park authority will consider to revamp this park for kids to enjoy. The Park has a great theme.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105368077778543235324/reviews
