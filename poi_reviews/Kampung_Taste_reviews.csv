Joshua Chew,4,The Economical Rice is priced above average compared to other stores near the vicinity. The food portion is decent. Most important the Aunty served food with a smile and had no problems at all. Not a bad place at all if you are hungry and want to stop and eat for awhile. The area is clean and not really dirty.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100928805220966571942/reviews
