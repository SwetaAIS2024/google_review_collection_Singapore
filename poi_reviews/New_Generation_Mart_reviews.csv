Tham Nguyen,5,"The shop have a good variety of products at a affordable price but the queue at the cashier is very long in the evening. Although there are 2 counters, there cashier is only manned by a young lady. The other counter is mostly closed although there is a older lady sitting behind the counter busy on her iPad.

I was in a rush the other day and asked the old lady if I could pay but she was engrossed watching something on her iPad and brushed me off. Hope the shop can do something about the queue situation to the otherwise pleasant shopping experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112193874717145517475/reviews

Adrian Toh,5,"I was pleasantly surprised that the shop was open the 4th day of CNY; saved me the trip to NTUC to stock up on drinks. It's an honest shop that didn't impose a CNY surchage, in the 'spirit' of CNY. The young cashier was cheery despite the lunch-time queue.  Their cigarettes are cheaper than the nearby Indian shop too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100478512838574584384/reviews
