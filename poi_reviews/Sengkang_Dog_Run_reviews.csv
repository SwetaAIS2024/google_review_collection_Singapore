Xandra Lim,4,"The ground is flat, big, wide, and is in rectangular shape. The only downside: no water point , you have to bring your own water bottle to keep your fur kid hydrate.

Overall, the ground condition and size is better than Dog Run @ Punggol Waterway Park",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101795569162274785748/reviews

Jeannie Ong,1,"Worst Dog Run. So unkempt - ANTS everywhere and grass uncut. No wonder no dogs here when we came. Dont bring your dogs here till NParks do something about this place. We will never come back again, ever!",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100885847937834726220/reviews
Ziggy Zag,5,"Dog park for medium and small dogs. There are a few large dogs, so smaller dog owners need to beware. Some are not friendly also.

Large field, quite clean, owners all pretty considerate and chill. There is also a dog friendly cafe nearby, but quite ex.

Nice place to go to on the weekends.

May get pretty muddy on rainy weather, but otherwise great place for dogs to play.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108214448887345624858/reviews
