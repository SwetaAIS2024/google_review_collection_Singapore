      "text": "This Loaded CheeseBurger Crispy Fries is supposed to be worth $11.50?? Even at $9.50 for an add-on deal, the portion is unbelievably small and had barely any of the meat toppings.\n\nDidnâ€™t get pictures of the pizzas but they were also messy and had very little toppings.\n\nWhen we got there to pick up our orders, one of the orders was missing and when we notified the staff of the missing order, they did admit that it was missing but did not propose any solutions or intention to fix the issue. Only after we asked them several times abt it, did the lady ask if we could wait 10min and told the kitchen staff to start preparing. It ended up taking less than 5min to come out and the lady was friendly during the interaction- I suppose they were busy and this is not questioning their attitude. But would say they could use more training in customer interaction.",

This is really unacceptableðŸ¤¬ðŸ¤¬ This is a $2.50 portion. Look at the menu pictures and look at what I got, this is misleading advertising. This is outrageous!!ðŸ¤¬",
