Wong Teck Jung,4,"I ordered lower quarter of roasted angelica duck. The herbal taste is on point. It has no smell, and the meat is not tough.

This food court is usually not crowded in the day time.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115500349786770672418/reviews
Darren Cheong,3,"Came here on Saturday..

Free parking during PH/Sunday... plenty of parking..

I ordered ""Sao Rou"" Rice $3.50sgd...

After makan, I wanna say its below my average standard... how to say.. ermm its like a budget saorou rice standard in my opinion.. my personal opinion only take note..

The sauce nothing special..

I hope they can improve or change the white rice quality/brand...

3stars were given based on portion, price and their chili very nice..

If price is ur factor and u just want to fill in ur tummy with some pork rice.. this is ur place..",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111136407063098297690/reviews
