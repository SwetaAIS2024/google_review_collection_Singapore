Juli Effendy,4,"We bought siomay: taste not so good (2/5), lotus pao (very small) around SGD 1  taste not bad and big meat pao (size not big as the name) SGD 2.5 taste nice (pao 4/5). A very old uncle made this so must be authentic.

The place is located at very old and crowded Hawker center in toa payoh",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112179605402780535380/reviews

Andrew Tka,1,Standards totally dropped for all types of  Paus… the siew mia is big but just meaty n tasteless .. the Kong Bak pau is made from mincd meat inside.

Leonard Chan,2,"Just bought some yesterday. Their 'kong bak' pao tastes very different from their usual standards. Unfortunately, not for the better. This is really sad. I hope they can bring back the original quality and taste.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111752895097295950530/reviews
Kev Oh,3,"Hope chef can make the ingredient inside the pau more juicy like Tg Rhu Pau or Jalan Besar 新山葉子楣手工包點 johore bahru ye zhi mei Pau. These 2 are my Top 2 in SG.

To be honest it is quite dry for both Mini Char Siew and Normal Meat Pau with egg. But Bun is soft.

To me Siew Mai quite good, just nice, not so salty and not so fatty/ soft. But not as firm like some Dim Sum resturant. So it is a good mixture and fats n meat

Kong Bak Pau is small and quite little meat. Mostly flour. To me personally I wouldnt mind paying more but must have more Kong Bak meat. 85% of it is Bun & 15% Kong Bak.

But lets continue to support local food. Hope uncle can take in our review seriously and make it more juicy for the Pau",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110238311634798313027/reviews
