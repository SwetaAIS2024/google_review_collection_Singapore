A marked improvement in service.

Been here since their opening but it seemed that it is heading a slippery slope.

Ordered a teh-o and it came so light there were not any taste or scent of tea.
When replaced, it was so thick that it looked like coffee. It tasted almost medicinal/ woody. Undrinkable.

2 sips and decided not to drink and paid for it.

As more people get to experience Poori, it is slowly gathering popularity akin to coin prata.

Using wheat flour, it is moulded and followed by deep frying till it is bloated.

Its taste and texture were light and airy. The potato and onion mix was creamy and with a hint of sweetness. A spicy mix was also provided for those who like some heat. These condiments may vary from each establishment.

S Elan,5,"The briyani rice was the absolute star, really really fantastic. Mutton was nice, the tandoor version was more tender than the non-tandoor. Horlicks is a classic, generous amount. Place is nice and clean with plenty of seating. The menu is quite extensive but we only had briyani. Prices are reasonable. We will return to try more things like the prata and goreng dishes.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103544649935674572451/reviews

Neshhy Nesh,1,"I placed my order at 9:33 PM for a simple dish—roti with egg and a sunny side up (roti John). It took 20 minutes to be prepared, which I initially understood. However, what’s frustrating is that customers who ordered after me—both for dine-in and takeaway—received their food before I did.

This isn’t the first time it’s happened either. It’s the second time I’ve experienced such poor queue management at your outlet. Please follow the basic principle of serving according to the order sequence. It’s not just fair; it’s expected.

I really hope this can be improved, because it’s getting frustrating.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110590806763058681516/reviews
