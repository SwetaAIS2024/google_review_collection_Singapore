esther alexis,5,"I had a fantastic experience at the Teka showroom today! We had the opportunity to try out their signature products, including the pizza and steak oven, and even made our own pizza. The standout feature was definitely the quality of their appliances, like the hood, hob, sink, steam oven, and microwave.

Patrick and Serene, the salespeople, were incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. They provided thorough explanations of each product's features, making it easy to understand their benefits. Overall, it was a fun and informative day—I highly recommend visiting the Teka showroom if you're looking for high-quality kitchen appliances!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118444880071155323895/reviews
Linda Maida - Koh,5,"Terry and Yew provided exceptional service! They were professional, patient, and demonstrated excellent product knowledge. Their thorough understanding of the Tekka Induction Cooker's parts and functions gave me complete confidence in their work.

After servicing my 8-year-old cooker, they assured me that it's in good working condition, saving me from potential costly repairs. Terry's advice on maintenance and troubleshooting was invaluable, and I appreciate his willingness to educate me on what to look out for in the future.

I'm extremely satisfied with their service, and I highly recommend Terry and Yew for their expertise and dedication. Five stars isn't enough – they're truly outstanding!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106748479698700828326/reviews
Benjamin N,1,"Refusal to honour warranty of switching the hob when there are pops and fire coming from the underside of the stove.

Replacing minor parts which didn’t solve the issue for more than 2 months. The ridiculous part of it is the maintenance telling me not to turn the knob to certain angles because it “confuses” the hob??

Absolutely no care of end users’ safety. Awaiting proper resolution before further legal recourse.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114797141096622294957/reviews
