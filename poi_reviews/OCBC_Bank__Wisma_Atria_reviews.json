Hopefully, he will follow through.\n\nLet’s see how this goes.",

I only needed Jane to help me reset my ATM PIN but she went on to help me with my various other enquiries, which led me to split my bank account to a new 360 salary account and apply a new credit card for minor online expenses. She also gave me a briefing tour of the branch and its various retail offerings. Thank you Jane for spending time with me and being a good ambassador for OCBC!",

Despite 4 people being ahead of me I was promptly attended to within 40 minutes.\nThe process was smooth and quite fast. Special mention to Ms. Kim who was very patient and explained to me the account features. She made the account opening process very simple for me and it took less than 30 minutes for me to have a new account ready.\nShe even went so far to assist me in activating the banking app. Although the One token could not activate due to an app glitch, but thats something I can overlook because of the exceptional customer service provided by Ms. Kim.",
