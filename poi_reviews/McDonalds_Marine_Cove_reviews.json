It’s right next to East Coast Park, so it’s a chill spot to enjoy your meal with a nice breeze. Breakfast was the usual McD's standard – fast, tasty, and satisfying. Great location for a pit stop before or after a beach stroll.",

Lots of active fitness people sitting outdoors while the less active ones take the interior seating. The food is typically Macdonald's, familiar and addictive. My go to Macdonald's whenever I need a french fries and burger fix.",
