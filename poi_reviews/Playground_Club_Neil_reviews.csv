Shawn Lehouillier,5,"A very fun place when I was there a few months ago. Great vibe, music and drinks.

Forbidden Tea,5,"Favorite gay bar in the street. The crowd is truly diverse, and our straight friends felt safe and love the place ! Epi has meticulously crafted cocktails and with good value too. The service is great, and staff are very friendly. The cute boys around are a pleasant sight, of course. We highly recommend this place to go for a lovely night out.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107787845570594415176/reviews
Kevin Lu,5,"A cozy, unpretentious bar tucked away on the 2nd floor of a quaint shophouse along Neil Road
===
FOOD: There is a selection of wine, beers and sake but as it is a cocktail bar, the stars of the show are the cocktails. You have the obvious classics like White Russian & Negroni, but you'll REALLY wanna to try their unique in-house concoctions.

With names like Juhua Gin & Tonic (Juhua means ""Chrysanthemum""), Nya Nya Butterfly G&T, and Milo Whiskey, these drinks combine poetic botanical inspirations with a tropical asian heritage (and a touch of sass, lol). The presentations are simple & unfussy, allowing the (generous!) substance of the drinks to speak for themselves.

SERVICE: The bartender & staff are sociable, friendly & professional; the owner himself mingles freely with the patrons too, and you get the sense that everyone is one big happy family.

ATMOSPHERE: There is a definite sense of ""everyone-knows-everyone"" camaraderie, and the place manages to be cozy without being cramped. The layout is deft enough to accomodate the crowd at its peak, during which it can get surprisingly dancey. This could give the impression that the place is bigger than it actually is...!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102832366381668809289/reviews
