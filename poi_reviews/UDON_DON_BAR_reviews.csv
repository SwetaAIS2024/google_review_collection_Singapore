Ong Zhi Yuan,5,"Dropped in for a quick bite, and the food was surprisingly good! Given its location and its student friendly prices, one tends to have lesser expectations on food quality. However, Udon Don Bar managed to defy said expectations with delicious Japanese noodles and rice bowls~

I had the Wafu spicy beef bowl, and it was an absolute flavor bomb. The beef was tender and bursting with rich, savory juices, perfectly complemented by the soft, fragrant rice. The spice added just the right amount of kick, elevating the dish to a delightful, piquant experience. Their chawanmushi was equally impressiveâ€”steamed to perfection, wonderfully seasoned, and packed with a deep umami that made every bite irresistible.

The restaurant itself is open and airy with plenty of seats, and the staff are friendly and helpful! Food is ordered through a kiosk or a QR code.

Highly recommended if you are in the area! 9/10~",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104417804420531473764/reviews
PD,3,"This menu looks really interesting, nice bright and clean place for fuss-free Japanese food. I ordered the spicy tartar chicken don ($8.9), and comes with free miso soup. The portion was very generous, but unfortunately, the spicy tartar was not that good. The sauce was too heavy and was not cohesive with the chicken. The spicy was spicy-pain kind that does not add in any additional flavour profile. After half a day, my mouth still has the onion aftertaste from the tartar sauce. However, I will still like to give the other menu items a try",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106426705285562616809/reviews
Dylan Li,4,"Decent udon spot for a change of pace from the canteens in UTown. I went there a few times last sem, and my go to was the spicy garlic beef udon. The portion size is a little small, the beef seems like frozen hotpot beef rolls, and the broth is thin, but it tastes pretty good.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115227455027475284936/reviews

Wei Jie,3,"The chicken katsu has a strange aftertaste. The tempura and soba tasted pretty good, especially the ebi and kakikage.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106656772769252841364/reviews
