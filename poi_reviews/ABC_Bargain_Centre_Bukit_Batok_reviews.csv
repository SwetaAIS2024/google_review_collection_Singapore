F A,1,"It’s the rudest cashier I ever met. Saw she literally shouted at small boy while he was paying …PLASTIC?… abt 3 times as the boy mother was not there. Is this a Singapore service nowadays. To the staff, if you not happy working, pls don’t spoilt the company reputation Don’t  throw your tantrum to the customers. You  don’t have to scare the little kid.. If this happened to my child, I would shout at her and make a scene.and demand for the apology. Shame to the company to have staff like that.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117546785167245391673/reviews
