Sean Goh,4,"Chanced upon this zhichar stall on a social media page and decided to checked them out. Apparently, they have a few outlets in Singapore and they happen to have one outlet in Tampines. Reached the place around 8pm, as there wasn‚Äôt much people at the coffeeshop. Finding a table was difficult. One of the staff came shortly to take my order.

Ordered 5 dishes, Spinach with trio egg in superior broth, stir fried baby kalian with garlic, oyster omelette, Salted egg squid as well as a garlic chicken. Food didn‚Äôt take long to be ready as the food was served shortly after we ordered. Food was actually not bad, all the dishes were quite good except for the salted egg squid. The dishes that I enjoyed the most had to be the omelette egg and the kalian.

Overall, enjoyed the food here and would definitely be back again. A pity that they closed pretty early. We noticed they started packing up at 9pm.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
