      "text": "I got their product catalog from my chinese partner and he introduce me to drop down and have a view. So I did.\n\nI contacted them, and there was a lady saying they are open on that day so I just went there with my partner to find out how's their products and services at the tampines industry.\n\nHowever, the main gate was closed], it is OK because maybe is that building not open main gate so not their fault. And after 30min i found another sub entry at the back and we manage to sneak in. And then, it was so so so hard to find their official office in that building, if anyone wants to go there, please take note on the 2M floor and 2nd floor is different. Anyway after all we finally able to find their store.\n\nAnd they are *CLOSE*..... Yes, The door is locked and we press alarm and called to the store but no one pick up the call this time.... So we no choice but to leave and then somehow it is raining outside. We ran around in the rain to get out and find the carpark.\n\nAfter we get in the car, we start to drive on the TPE back to office, they call in. And ask us why we use that door, they are door is on other side, and complain us we did use the alarm or call them. What they saying just make me comment less. And I would never get back there.\n\nWe were very sincere in wanting to look at this company's products, but the overall experience was really bad, and even though your company's products look good from online, I would never work with such service and attitude.",

We sent a few more emails within 1-2 weeks to remind them that we were still waiting for replies, but we never received a response.\n\nOverall, our experience with their online customer service was a complete waste of time. NOT RECOMMENDED!",
