      "text": "Friendly boss. Recommended us to start with more fatty, then go lean.\n\nThe Beef was good. The fat is spread out nicely. It's a Must Try.\n\nThe mutton was covered with instant noodle crumbs. Can try. It's not on the menu.\nThe meat was well prepared. No gammy smell. Meat was tender. After 2 portions of marble beef, the mutton feels lacking.\n\nTried the fried octopus. Nicely done, tender with a crispy coat.\n\nThe pork collar was good, too. Easy to start with.\n\nFor the oyster lovers, there's fresh oysters $12 for 6.\n\nIt's hidden in an industrial canteen. Open air seating. Suitable for BBQ.\n\nwent on Sunday evening, the place was almost empty. We almost thought they were closed.",

Had their A5 Wagyu Sirloin with their Karubi cooked on a charcoal grill (which was an excellent touch)\n\nThe owner took efforts to recommend  various cuts and portions. Operated by a couple, they keep quality meats affordable.\n\nWould recommend to pay a visit! Parking in front of the industrial food court but available for parking after 7pm or along the side of the road",
