      "text": "Went to their A&E and eventually had to go through surgery for Necrosis, was warded for 2 nights.\n\nTo be honest, their A&E waiting time is really long, but I observed that they are really lacking doctors on night shift in their A&E. The nurses and patient associates are friendly and helpful, just that it seemed they are really understaffed for the doctors. The A&E doctor on duty was really friendly and patient, but it seemed she was the only emergency doctor on duty to see the patients that night (or maybe there were 2 doctors on shift).\n\nI managed to get the op done the next day, the surgical team comes in the morning to assess the wound and the surgeon is experienced, knowledgeable, assuring, calm and well-mannered. The nurses in Ward 55 are very helpful, friendly, patient and experienced and called me up 2 days after my discharge to check up with me on my post op healing and provided further advisories on my queries.",

      "text": "Compliments for Exceptional Care at KTPH\n\nI would like to express my heartfelt appreciation for the exemplary care and professionalism at Cardio ward 65.\n\nThe staff in this ward truly stood out with their dedication and expertise. I would like to comment sister Kaili for her care and concern.\n\nHaving previously stayed in a single-bed A Ward at a private Hospital in Singapore.\nI must highlight that the standard of care at KTPH is on par, if not superior, to my experience there. The staff’s professionalism, attentiveness, and competence were outstanding.\n\nFurthermore, I was pleasantly surprised by the affordability of the medical services provided. Despite undergoing multiple procedures such as an MRI, CT scans, blood tests, and ECGs, my total bill, which included meals and accommodation, amounted to only $1,100—a fraction of the cost the other private hospital.\n\nThank you for exceeding my expectations and delivering such high-quality care at an accessible cost. KTPH has truly set a benchmark for exceptional patient care.",
