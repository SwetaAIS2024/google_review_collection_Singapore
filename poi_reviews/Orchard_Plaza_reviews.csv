Genevieve Amador,5,The number of malls and small shops are overwhelming in a good way. It feels like a so-many-shops-so-little-time/budget kinda thing. ðŸ˜… but happy to have been able to go around the areaâ€¦ happier even to see that they have a Jollibee store! ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­#represent,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115545978473536224717/reviews

Saifu Angto,3,It's a bit sad that this shopping complex is now very quiet - especially upstairs.  Lots of shops closed.  Ground floor stores are still mostly open with a few tailors and salons.  The new store Miss Saigon is upstairs with great Vietnamese food.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews

CK C,4,Old school shopping mall with lots of tailors at the ground floor. There is quite a number of small Japanese bars that look very interesting.
