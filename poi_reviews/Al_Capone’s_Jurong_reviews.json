The place is quite run down.\n\nService provided by staff isn't fantastic either, the indian lady staff kept trying to sell food items to customers - turned off! And her handling of food when serving customers lack professionalism as well.\n\nFood isn't tasty and not cheap, given the small portion.\n\nCarpark available on site at a fee, but limited though. Washroom available on site.",

Despite not being a standard offering, the drink was expertly crafted and tasted perfect. Kudos to the team for their excellent service and attention to detail!",

      "text": "I recently visited this place and had a mixed experience. On the positive side, the food was nice, we enjoyed it. However, the service left a lot to be desired. All the time we waited for so long to get our drinks, so when one person was drinking, the other one was waiting for so long to have their order. And even we reminded several times if that could be done faster it still took time with their bartender standing around talking. It's understandable when there are a lot of people, but when we only came we were only one there. Overall, I am not thinking to coming one more time to that exact location but maybe other locations, hoping other outlet service will be better.",

The spacious alfresco style restaurant is not overly crowded on a Friday evening so staff was quite attentive. Good place to chill out! There's an area in the restaurant that is pet friendly. Would patronise again!",

One very overwhelmed single waitress that made a few errors in our orders and we received our dishes one by one because as she explained there was just one person in the kitchen cooking. Not sure how the place is for dinner. It is quite large so hopefully with more staff üëçüèª",
