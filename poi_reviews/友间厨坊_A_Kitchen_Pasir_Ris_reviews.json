Generally the foods are tasty and nice.. as for pork trotter, it would be better for me if they are softer and easy to bite off. üòÜ Overall, I think it's more value for money than typical zichar.",

I also ordered the bbq stuff like the ËÇ•ËÇ†, but inside they wrapped it with Â§ßÈùíËë±, which not quite to my likeness.\n\nI sat inside and it‚Äôs hot, like, aircon not working. I‚Äôm not sure if its bcos its near to the kitchen. There are private rooms in there, so i can‚Äôt imagine sitting inside so hot.\n\nOverall, I quite like it and will be back to try other dishes. I think i‚Äôll sit outside open air to be safe.",
