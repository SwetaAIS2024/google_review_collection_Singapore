      "text": "First and foremost, Plantation Plaza is nowhere near Tengah Interchange, do not make this mistake!\n\nAfter waiting 6 months, we decided to venture down to check out Plantation Plaza. Even then, they are still not fully open. Thankfully, there are enough amenities to live by.\n\nBasement 1 is mostly functional, with a Giant supermarket, snacks, health products and DIY shops. R&B Tea (a rare sighting right now) is having a nice minty chocolate drink.\n\nThe access to the car park is here.\n\nPresently, there is a convenient homeware showroom at the atrium (or what you call the central area on the first floor) for new flat owners to furnish their BTOs.\n\nLevel two and three will mostly be a combination of F&B, retail and services. There is a link bridge to the Community Centre (closed at the moment) and another link bridge to MRT station (still in construction phase).\n\nKoufu sees the biggest crowd, with dining in and takeaway diners aplenty, who wishes to have their meal before heading home.\n\nThere is also an unmarked row of amenities leading outwards from level one. Look out for McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut, 7-Eleven, Daiso, Thai Food, Enrichment Centre. You can spot them on Google Maps.",
