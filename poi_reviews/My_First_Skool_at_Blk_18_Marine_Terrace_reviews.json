They are flexible, forward-thinking, and nonjudgemental. Everything is organised, they'll guide you from beginning. I can never thank them enough for what they have done! ‚ô•Ô∏èüí™ My girls have been bubbly, cheerful & loving, they even listen to instructions clearly, interact alot too ever since their progress here.\n\nThe principal is always there when needed, fast replies, clear details & instructions. The teachers & principal works together to monitor the kids closely & as a parent I've seen how much they care for the kids & always there for them, their patience & tolerance for the kids is excellent üíØ, with the care & trust that's been build together with the parents, principal & teachers!
