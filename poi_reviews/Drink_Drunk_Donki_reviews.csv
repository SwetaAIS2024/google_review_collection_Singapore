Freddy Hartono,5,"Good priced Kakubin Highball, you can grab Donki food as well and have it at the bar. Too crowded most of the time and difficult to get seats. Try the Yuzu highball, one of the best combination there.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101783531060660569899/reviews
Sherin,5,"What can I say? I'm most definitely a fan. Love that you can buy sashimi and onigiri from the store and bring it out to have together with good highballs. I frequent this Orchard Central (OC) outlet - think of it as the ""fastfood"" of jap food and drinks. I typically go for a standard Suntory highball at $8 happy hr price. I've been to the PLQ and Suntec bars but the drinks are just not the same. Definitely recommend this OC space",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114102433995427434390/reviews
Dru Lu,5,Great place for an inexpensive casual izakaya experience. You can grab dishes from don don donki which still have a decent selection even at the end of the night. The seating is quite limited but can make reservations. Aunties that work here are nice and arenâ€™t judgey of how many drinks you had ;),2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115927493800245457440/reviews
Lionel Wong,4,"Casual place for drinks in the mall. Offers a nice selection of Suntory mixers. Tried the Suntory Kakubin highball. It's good. Also tried the house Umeshu with soda. Not very nice.. Pretty weak. But yea, cos I ordered it mixed with soda, probably why. You can eat your Donki meals here, provided you order a drink per pax. Weekends a lil hard to get a seat here so recommended to go early, plus take advantage of the Happy Hour discount. Will definitely come here for a drink and meal again. Nice place to chill.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106065208953751619577/reviews
Alastor Neo,5,Nice air-conditioned place for chill drinks alone or with friends. Drink options are limited but sufficient. Directly opposite from Don Don Donki where you can buy food to consume with the drinks. Been a few times and the bartenders are all rather friendly.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105297051127546826488/reviews
