wang,1,"Terrible terrible service and flow!
Can I give 0 star?

Made the appointment for 11:30am on a workday and got here on time, after waiting for 1hr 40 mins I have just got myself registered!
With or without appointment doesn‚Äôt matter to them, you all going to be treated as walk ins.

Your appointment only guarantee you to see the doctor, doesn‚Äôt guarantee the time!

And call center told me I am able see my doctor today but reception says she is off today‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Will never come to this place anymore. Worst of the worst!

(BTW, I didn't get to see a doctor until 2pm that day, their afternoon shift started already...so it was a solid 2.5hrs of waiting)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102475537649512343527/reviews
Pratiwi Ng,5,"Very grateful for the staffs - Arnell at the X-Ray department and Shannon at the Occupational Health dept for being super understanding and kind with my situation where I had to carry my 2 year old with me for my medical check up. (Pardon me if I misspelled the names)

The clinic was super busy as the next day is the start of long weekend. But, the staffs were so kind and gracious. My child was crying as he didn‚Äôt want me to leave him for 30 seconds for X-Ray. Arnell came to my rescue by patiently checking on me if I‚Äôm ready while clearing his queue and Shannon offered help to care for my son. It was a bit of a situation for me today and I expected people to be nasty to me as I brought a toddler with me to a medical check-up. I‚Äôm just so grateful for the kindness and understanding shown.

Saw all the previous comments and I understand that the flow could be confusing but, with that amount of space and the crowd, the staffs were doing their best with their instructions üëçüèª",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114102201802845537674/reviews
erica megan,5,"Opens at 8.30am on Saturday, would advise to go as early as you can to avoid big crowds as walk-ins are common!

General medical check-up/ examination took me 1.5 hours to finish. Being realistic, that is already quite decent for a busy clinic, so I have no complaints! Just bring along a book or play your phone games to level up while waiting.

Chairs and music played in clinic made the wait comfortable. Free water dispenser available as well to quench thirst!

Staff were welcoming, friendly and professional!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104568713285090479510/reviews
Yen Roo,1,Worst clinic ever. Tried to make appointment through call but asked to just walk in. Walked in but can't have the checkup done as there are too many patients. Was asked to wait around 2-3 hours till the afternoon session where there are less patients. Have to come back another day to complete the xray test due to personal reasons. Then made to wait for another 1 hour as they conveniently forgot about me! They don't even give u a queue no. This clinic have terrible SOP and they really don't know how to handle incoming patients adminstrative matters properly. Don't ever visit if you have a choice.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109209683062887790359/reviews
Jimmie Lee,1,"The bad reviews here are spot on.  Waited over an hr on the phone to try to book an appointment.  1st 3 times (after 20 minutes each) the line went dead (almost as if someone picked up the phone and hung up right away...).  Finally got through after an hour of waiting.  To be told that the ""people who book reservations"" were not available and would call me back.  Where is the logic in that?  Moronic.  Let's see if they actually get back to me today.  I'm not optimistic.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115273323319743767528/reviews
