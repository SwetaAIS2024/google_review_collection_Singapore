Andrew Wang,3,"At Northshore Plaza II Basement 1. In fact facing Blk 420A HDB basement carpark as Northshore Plaza itself don't have its own parking. From upper level find the escalator right at the end (sea facing side) and the lift lobby is located beside it and take to B1. Choice of placement is bad, should have placed it at a more open area as Plaza 1&2 got ample open space. Sharing more photos so that others can find it easily.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113797193458966040430/reviews
