Ashley L,4,"Small little bubble tea shop tucked away in the corner of Tampines North. Has all the old school bubble tea flavours like Blue Coral and Oreo milkshake. Most of their customers are students from the schools nearby.

Friendly owners. Prices are pretty ok. $1.50 for a regular ice blended drink. Sells light snacks too",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104015589146237602824/reviews
