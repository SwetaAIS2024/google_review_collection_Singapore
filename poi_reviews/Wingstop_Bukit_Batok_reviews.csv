Justin,5,"I ordered the garlic Parmesan wings from Wingstop and I must say, they were absolutely phenomenal! The wings were perfectly cooked, juicy, and bursting with flavor. The garlic Parmesan seasoning was just right, not too overpowering but with a delicious, savory kick. The service was also excellent, with friendly and efficient staff. I highly recommend Wingstop for their top notch wings and great customer service.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117103872752688297867/reviews
Tiffany Boogaloo,4,"Ordered Wingstop from grab and it came within the hour- their flavours are pretty good and wingstop has boneless chicken wings for those who are lazy to eat it with the bone.

Flavours
Honey habanero - glaze was the right amount of sweet and spicy
Hickory bbq- glaze was Smokey full bodied and very flavourful
Lemon pepper - could taste a slight lemon flavour with the pepper in the fried wing, goes well with ranch sauce
Garlic parmesan - tastes great with the right amount of cheese and garlic with the fried wing, goes well with ranch sauce

We ordered the large ranch sauce and dipped everything in it!

Only sad thing is that their fries were soggy, they do need to work on their fry packaging as it comes in flimsy paper bags- maybe a little more sturdy packaging with holes to let the heat out to prevent the fries from being soggy would be better- hence my rating is not 5 stars but 4 stars for this !",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103546682351624755795/reviews

Nai LiHua,1,"absolutely horrible. waited 3 hours to get cold, sauceless chicken, and missing chicken. the kitchen didnt even bother to check if delivery riders took the correct order. got my order take by other drivers and rushed the next order. i thought wingstop was supposed to guarantee freshly fried chicken? why was my order delivered cold. very disappointing.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105264057904463589897/reviews
The Eating Shrimp,4,"got super influenced by tiktok wingstop mukbangs, and gave into my cravings 2 nights a row ü§™

I got the garlic parmesan, which I knew I liked already, and tried the lemon pepper which I liked equally as much! I also bought the mushroom fritters which were so good! I got 2 ranch servings this time instead of one and they were there was about 1/4 left with an 8 piece set + mushroom fritters. I learnt my lesson from the last round and got a can of Coke but 1 can is not enough to supplement the chicken you gotta get like 2 or just keep a big bottle at home for wingstop hunger pang emergencies‚Ä¶

(I ordered on Grab and airfried them to get them crispy again.)",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113289028711322653544/reviews
