      "text": "Giving this review impartially and from a neutral perspective (1 stars).\n\nFirst of all, here are the pointers I would like to feature here, hope this helps to any first timers out there looking for churches.\n\nReviewing many different churches, I have reviewed based on personal experiences in terms of practices, and how this would perceive by different people.\n\nAnd here are my pointers (like it or not, it's just a review):\n\n1) The church might be a 'shock' to certain people who aren't used to the idea of a charismatic church as those coming from traditional background would mistaken it as a 'rock concert' due to their conservative background. For these people, I would strongly suggest to reconsider for a different church.\n\n2) If you are for a strong community, then this church is for you, but if you are not comfortable with the idea of heavy shepherding, I would strongly suggest that you can reconsider for a different church with a different practices.\n\n3) For anyone above 60 years old, if you are \"young at heart\", this is for you. Otherwise, I would strongly caution that you might be startled and taken aback on the ratio of young and older adults within the congregation as it might be \"too loud\" for some of you.\n\n4) They do have a growing Chinese-speaking congregants (though still small) but at the moment they are ministered by translation ministry whereby every week the message is being translated from English to Mandarin so if your loved one does listen and speaks Mandarin and are young at heart, do invite them over!\n\n5) Their services is only held only on Saturdays (if you wonder why there are no services on Sundays).\n\n6) This church is an offshoot of Church of Singapore Bukit Timah since 2016 (from anyone who is been there long enough).\n\n7) Their kids service, Impact Kids, holds at Vision Exchange on every Saturday.\n\n8) If you have been to megachurches before, their church concept is strikingly similar, which might poses some to feel uncomfortable if you are from a traditional churches.\n\n9) Planetshaker Church Singapore has a similar congregation size as Impact Life Church, despite Planetshaker here is a Singapore campus shoot from Melbourne, Australia.\n\nOver all, I give it a 1 out of 5 stars, as this church is mainly consist of the millennium generation as the majority of the congregation, with the growing number of gen-Z, and a tiny number of congregants who are of gen-X and boomer generations.\n\nPhotos were taken last year. To each own opinions as if you prefer youthfulness then this church is for you.",
