      "text": "Vie Bistro deserves more mention but judging from the waiting time on a weekend, they are doing fine.\n\nI have been eating their western food for more than 10 years. My go to order is their spaghetti bolognese, one of my top 3 here in Singapore. The other two being Jack's Place and an NIE canteen stall (not sure if they are still around).\n\nWhen I'm feeling famished, I'd get the Chicken Chop Beef Bolognese combo, a top up from their standard Chicken Chop.\n\nVie Bistro had probably been through two major coffeeshop renovations already and there are always at the same spot. Lucky for us!",

The following sharing are based on our unbiased personal opinion and experience\n\nReturning late from work and the boys just finished their tuition lesson nearby so we decided to grab some food over at this coffeeshop since it's getting late.\n\nWe order 1 set of Steak and fish & Chip each. The steak was pretty normal for the price range. The fish & chip is considered decent. Not the wow type of taste but good enough to fill your stomach for a good night sleep.\n\nüì∑ Follow us for a gastronomic experience and discover the world finest in its purest form",

Sauce tastes weird (not mushroom, not pepper, not sure what flavour it‚Äôs supposed to be). ‚ÄúBlack pepper chicken‚Äù is black pepper sprinkled on top of the chicken, with the same base sauce instead of black pepper sauce I expected\n-Steak: passable as it‚Äôs freshly grilled, but they used the same weird sauce as the chicken chop\n-Both steak and chicken comes with fries and coleslaw, both of which tasted plain and boring; no other options for sides\n-Grilled snapper is probably my favourite but pricey for the small portion\n-Older lady owner is rude, always giving a condescending/arrogant expression while taking orders. The older guy owner is better\n\nMy meal yesterday will probably be my last, no reason to support or patronise again",
