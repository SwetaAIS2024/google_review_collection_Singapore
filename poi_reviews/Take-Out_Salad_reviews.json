Server was pouring the remaining chicken don't know whether he don't bother to top up as the portion is so little. Saw another person's protein portion infront of me was more. The only decent portion size is the soba maybe because its carbs? Taste is okay. Portion to price could be better.",

      "text": "I’ve been a loyal customer of this salad shop since they first opened six years ago, and they’ve truly redefined what a salad can be. Normally, I’m not a big fan of salads, but theirs are in a league of their own, especially with their signature peanut lime sauce. It’s so unique and flavorful—it takes the whole salad experience to a new level of deliciousness.\n\nDespite staying far from the shop, I never mind traveling the distance just to get my hands on their salads. They’re worth every mile! I often order in bulk for my colleagues at the office, and everyone loves it just as much as I do.\n\nIf you’re looking for a fresh, tasty, and satisfying meal, I can’t recommend this place enough. They’ve turned me into a salad lover, and I’m sure they’ll do the same for you!",
