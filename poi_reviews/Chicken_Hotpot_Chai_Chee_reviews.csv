Shermaine Wee,4,Good family package of $60 for 2 big chicken & fish or prawn pots + 4 drinks. The portion was too big for 2A2C. Kids who were trying this for first time could not get used to the taste. Do not like the type of Fish they use inside 酸菜汤 (feels like tasteless fish fillets) but overall good value of money.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113691956598760576787/reviews
Vikki Sim,5,"CHICKEN HOTPOT 鸡公煲
☆☆☆☆☆

Tender chicken served on the bone in a pot of famous soup. Choose from three levels of spiciness and add as many fresh vegetables and additional meats as you wish. And keep eating, the more you eat, the more flavourful the experience.

We choose the SMALL spicy.

This has to be one of the best tasting hotpot for me!
The soup is flavourful and you will never get enough with the numerous top up of the soup!
The soup goes so well with rice!
You can even finish a bowl of rice just with the soup!

We can also order ingredients to go with the Chicken Pot.
We ordered some quail eggs, spinach, enoki mushrooms.

FISH IN A POT 酸菜鱼
☆☆☆☆☆

Catch of the day (Snapper or Grouper) specially marinated and cut into fillet strips. Served in a simmered broth of preserved picked vegetables.

Generous servings of fish slices and the soup is as equally flavourful too!

Overall 4.8 / 5

3 to 3.5 - save the calories cos bo ho jiak
to 4 - can try if no queue cos ay sai lah
4 to 4.5 - highly recommended cos ho jiak
4.6 to 5 - Must Try cos jin ho jiak! Mai Tu Liao!

EK G,3,"Couple set @38 bucks more value for money. As many reviews pointed out, the portion of the ingredients e.g. chicken meat (quite bony) or prawns (4 pcs) are a bit less than desired - both small pots. They do have their regular customers I guess since they have survived here for many years. Service wise is very good.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114120082988171959955/reviews
Jialing Cai,3,"My spouse and I had 2 small hotpots - their signature chicken and the pig intestine hotpots. Ingredient is sufficient and shop is generous and prompt in topping up soup for both.

Tip#1: order one pot to share since unlimited soup top up. Then order ala cart ingredients to add on to the pot.

Tip#2: look out for discounts/ vouchers such as on eatigo platform. The shop also offers a couple set for $38 which is quite value.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118242540890986634279/reviews
PS Y,5,"Second time here, been missing the spicy chicken hotpot.

We ordered couple set $38 with chicken hotpot, fish hotpot, and two cold fruit punch drink. First time tried their fish hotpot, taste good too with salted Vege soup. Drink wise: Fruit punch juice and add on Korean yuzu sofa, both are refreshing for me.

Friendly staff attention to our request. Overall good dining experience.

The next visit maybe should try 1 medium hotpot with add on Vege for two pax.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100335517318993271411/reviews
