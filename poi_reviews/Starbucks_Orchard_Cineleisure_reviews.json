This is a quieter Starbucks at lunchtime, no queue at 12.30pm, so itâ€™s a relaxed atmosphere (maybe contributes to the good service lol). Best Starbucks to go to during lunch on a workday or get delivery from since thereâ€™s not many people.",

But if you want an actual normal staff interaction, try the 313 Starbucks lol the staff there are quite lovely.",
