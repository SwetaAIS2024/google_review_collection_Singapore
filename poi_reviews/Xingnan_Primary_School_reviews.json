Not to mention i was in a dance cca when i was p3 and the lady there that taught us literally changed $50 for leggings that brakes immediately(it's so obvious it's cheaply made, scamming students to raise your shitty ass school funds is genuinely such a pathetic thing to do, they also fatshammed aswell. Your school is really pathetic and i know I'm not the only one with experiences like this. I'm not sure what's going on in that school right now but im speaking from my experience",
