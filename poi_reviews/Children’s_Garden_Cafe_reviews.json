The man serving us at the register couldn't have been any less interested, most of the dishes advertised on the screens weren't available (only way to know what the one menu on the counter with white strips over some of the items - so seems they've been unavailable for some time). The kids meal was missing 2 of the items advertised. After 3 of my preferences weren't available I landed on the Katsu Burger, which was terrible (worst part was the tomato sauce/ketchup on it, pretty much the worst possible choice of sauce for what it was). The chips were good at least, however was only served about 9 of them with the meal. Definitely opportunistic pricing - this place obviously trades in their location serving the kids play area.",
