May want to ask for less spicy if your spicy level is low.\nTheir soup is tasty.\nVery economical pricing starting from $2.50.\nDefinitely worth eating.",

This stall is at Teban Gardens Food Center.\n\nNot the tastiest nor the biggest serving, it is cheap even though the prices have gone up by 50cents compared with one year ago. You get 4 fishballs ($3.00 portion) and some sliced fish cakes. There‚Äôs also minced pork in the noodles itself.",
