Errol Yeo,5,"Enrolling at SBC (Singapore Bible College) has been an exciting journey. The warm, inclusive atmosphere fosters a genuine sense of community, forming friendships beyond shared faith.
The lecturers deposit truth yet constantly challenge students to deepen their understanding of the Word of God.
This journey, while it has not ended, has enriched my faith and provided a lasting network of support. I highly recommend Singapore Bible College for those seeking a seminary study that will have an impactful journey in their faith.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118324297381609049576/reviews
