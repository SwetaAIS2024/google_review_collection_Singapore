Tania Webster,4,"Will return. Have stayed there twice. The team especially Maryam were so very attentive. Location excellent great hawker centre outside turn right about 30 meters take red walk way on your left has wine bar, coffee shop and great local selection of food.  Only minus is the cleanliness is not so good as before, lots of finger marks and evidence of previous people, they do turn around rooms quickly which is a bonus but could do with a deep clean regularly. Apart from that brilliant hotel especially for the value.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115195031415116065701/reviews
aira lapitan,5,"A must hotel to stay in! It was my mom's first time abroad and the Hotel Royal Queens definitely made it a great place to stay in for our 3 days, 2 nights. The staff were superbâ€” easy to communicate with and accomodating. Aside from the easy check in and check out, everything was clean and cozy. We requested a high and quiet room, which was provided. Our flight on the last day wasn't due until evening and they were so kind to keep our luggage in their storage so we can roam around freely. Breakfast buffet was also really good! So many choices, kept us full much of the day so we can visit more places. Kudos to the team! Will definitely come back here and recommend the hotel as well!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102698643854112527850/reviews
Jey Arul,5,"Hotel Royal Queens: A Fantastic Stay!
I had an absolutely amazing experience at Hotel Royal Queens. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, going above and beyond to ensure a comfortable stay. The location is unbeatable, with a plethora of amenities within easy walking distance. Being just a 5-minute walk from three different MRT stations made exploring the city a breeze! The rooms were clean, spacious, and the beds and pillows were exceptionally comfortable. I will definitely be returning to this hotel on my next trip to Singapore. Highly recommended!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111507031789756990461/reviews
