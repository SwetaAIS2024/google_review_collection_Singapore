Arunima Lal,2,"Wanted admission in Dimensions Kovan branch but had no vacancies. So went for a school tour at the new campus. Fee is attractive and have opening promotions.  But the school is too much digital. Don't have any writing board in classrooms, a big monitor only is there. Even the primary 1 class is having plain white wall. Not attractive to young kids.  Have  one indoor awa outdoor football/ basket ball court to play. Not enough play ground for young kids. Curriculum is interesting. Provide free AEIS coaching too. But School Ambiance is not there.Felt it like an IT training centre but school.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103025921355616403943/reviews
