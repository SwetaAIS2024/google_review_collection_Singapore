m,5,"This mall and the street in front of this mall were very interesting to me. I’m not familiar with Chinese culture but I enjoyed the atmosphere of this place and around the temple near here. If you are into crystals and spiritual stuff, jade accessories, you’ll find this place interesting too. Clothing shops are cheaper than bugis street. Also there are traditional Chinese food ingredients shops. I’m glad I found traditional Chinese culture here in Singapore.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105550892012784714702/reviews
