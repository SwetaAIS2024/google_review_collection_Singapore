Kelvin “Pilgrim”,5,"A faithful Chinese Church hard to find these days. Biblical God-centered sermons can always be expected when the pastor preaches each month plus warm reception. Go early to attend the 8:15am Worship Service as it is often full, else go for the later service at 10:30am. Highly recommended to any Chinese speaking visitors.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103642364296606812683/reviews
