Opened for 2 years but little known venue hidden among the bushes.\n\nState visit gifts from other countries are on display..Seasonal, these collections will be changed.\n\nNice to check it out if you are around de area.\n\nThere are photo opportunity spots with Istana restricted area rooms as backdrop.\n\nAt the end of your walk, you can also take home a state imprint (self pressed) bookmark. Love it!\nSpend about 20 minutes here.",

They even tell me about how the palace will open for public in every public holiday/national holiday, although i already know and just hear it to test their kindess and knowledge(please forgive me üòÅ).\n\nThey are kind and offer me to take photo in one spot that make a replica for one of the palace most famous spot (the one public can't enter because it just for other countries official guests), but im too embarrassed to take a photo there.\n\nOh i got a bookmark that stamped by national sign of Singapore's presidency emblem. And i was the one who stamp it from the stamp machine directly.\n\nWhat an amazing experience !\n\nThanks for the staff in there, really make my nerd soul happy and went insane inside üòÇü•≥üéâ.",
