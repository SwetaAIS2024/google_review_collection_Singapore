Paul Chan,4,"Good little neighborhood pizza place. Looks like most of the orders are for take out or delivery. There are a few small tasks for dine in. Pizza is freshly made so can take a few extra minutes. Crust is medium, not truly thin crust. Good selection of varieties. Open till pretty late at night for those late dinners too.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104085603801790709162/reviews
Sue G,4,"For those who like their pizza crust to be thin and crispy, this is definitely the place to go to. We ordered their Margherita and ham & cheese pizza. The order was done via foodpanda and it arrived fast. Both pizzas were still warm when received. Perfect for those who would like a snack for tea time. For the price paid, it was definitely a steal!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101395162337471098745/reviews

Alvin,4,"Ordered the ham and cheese pizza through FoodPanda (price was as per their website), taste-wise was good, just the food temperature was a bit cold although the delivery was quicker. But I’ll try to get the food in store next time to see if the temperature is right.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101499171850708098174/reviews
