Denis,3,"Don't sit near the tray return area.  Super noisy as shown in the video. I cannot eat in peace with all the loud music they play.... Totally Spoilt my dinner appetite.

If you're wondering why I didn't sit elsewhere, there was no space elsewhere for my family of 6 when we arrived 630pm.

The food is so so also.
Not too bad but no wow factor...

Don't think I'll come back again with my family.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107269275231105198912/reviews
igoto igoto,2,"Order Yu Kong Hor 月光河 from the store. They added too much starch and doesn’t taste nice at all. Choose other food instead.

Also ordered Ba Chor Mi 肉碎面。noodle is nice, but to salty. Can skip it too.
Try other food Instead.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116059277545863734065/reviews
Dominic,1,"The dim sum stall cannot be found on Google map, so I have to leave the review here. The lo mai kai is not fully cooked, with hard broken rice pieces within. The liu sha bao is dry and no lava flow. The you tiao chang fen is hard and not crispy, with used oil taste. External seating area full of insects and flies.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107199273323901734131/reviews
Ah Boy Like Ramen,3,Not a lot of options but decent enough. The space is very cramped and it’s quite stuffy. There are a few more obvious popular stalls like the Ipoh zichar shop. Had the signature wat tan hor and it’s pretty good.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105704665781349036529/reviews
Tan. W,3,"Nestled in a still-developing neighborhood, this small kopitiam is bustling at 5 pm on a weekend! Despite its compact layout and narrow seating, the place is packed.

The popular Ipoh tze char stall already has a line at 5 pm. Their Moonlight Hor Fun ($6.30) is silky and smooth, gliding down easily. The prawn paste chicken (small portion) offers nine pieces for $12.

We also tried the 三拼 from the roast duck stall, a reasonable choice at $15. The duck has a distinctive herbal flavor that stands out.

Another favorite here is the Yong Tau Fu, with a fast-moving queue. For $5, you can select five ingredients with rice or noodles, or six without. It’s very budget-friendly.

Overall, the food is decent but nothing extraordinary. Judging by the crowd, I suspect the kopitiam’s popularity might be due to its connection to celebrities.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103022836553318535151/reviews
