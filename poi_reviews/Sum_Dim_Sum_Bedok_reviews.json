Portion is good and fragrant and crispy.\nXLB is also quite good.\nThe char Siew rice roll is the one that irked me honestly.\nFor everything except the Bao, the portion size is just sad.\nEverything is made so small and the rice roll really took the cake. The picture shows how small it is. It’s so thin it can barely stack on each other and it’s practically transparent.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. The food is decent. It’s just the price portion ratio that needs work.",

Space is pretty limited but we were lucky to be allocated a corner table where the kids have more space to goof around while having lunch\n\nService was spontaneous and friendly.  Alas, we still feel they are understaffed although we can see the team doing their best\n\nFood wise, more hits than misses.  There are quite a few misses.  The Pandan Char Siew baked buns was a let down.\n\nOverall, experience was not bad.  Only last peeve was car park was expensive for this location - $4 plus for less than an hour!\n\nMight not be back again",

We were ushered to our table by a friendly male staff, and we didn't wait long for our food. Food was really nice, and not too expensive as well. Worth a visit if you are in the neighbourhood.",
