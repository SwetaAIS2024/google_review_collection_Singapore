Julius Tan,3,"Average tasting economic beehoon store. Beehoon is okay, nasi lemak rice is devoid of the taste of coconut milk, ikan billis not crispy and limp tasting, like itâ€™s lau hong. Fish fillet is freshly fried, mock goose is crispy, cabbage is okay.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113038098593710664705/reviews
Yifang Chen,5,"Yummy food with fair & transparent pricing. Food served is very fast and you don't have to wait too long despite the queue.
The beehoon & mee is not too oily like other places. Love the chicken wings, got old school taste.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113080954173598300988/reviews
El Alv,4,"generally good food and transparent price list.
there and all sorts of carbs: meesiam, beehoon, hokkien mee, nasi lemak. i tried most carbs here for the last 2 weeks, generally will recommend.

the curry and chilli are relatively spicy.

fried chickens are quite fresh, recommended.

the price is comparable to caiFan store there.

one thing i dont like is they are selling fishcake with filling as ngohHiang. i feel cheated. minus one star for this.

otherwise, generally recommended.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107609901703594470041/reviews
Jy !,5,"Chanced upon this new stall after grocery shopping at Sheng Shiong. Was quite impressed with the variety of staples and ingredients offered. Dabao a few packets home and all tasted good. Love the mee siam as it's a good balance of sour, spicy and savory. Worth a try if you're in the area, personally thinks that it is one of the best economical bee hoon stall in Punggol.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110492670955401488428/reviews
Esther Woo,5,"Air-conditioned area outbeat the humid weather outside. Ordered a plate of fried bee hoon, it was tasty. Not oily. Wide variety of ingredients to choose from. Love the zai er and fried chicken wings, so crispy. It was so good, we came back for lunch on the same day.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111599078639995743767/reviews
