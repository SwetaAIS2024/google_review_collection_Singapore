Akram M,5,This review is long overdue but well deserved. I suffered a nasty shoulder injury for over 2 months and saw another specialist with no improvements before seeing Dr Benjamin Seah. Dr Benjamin was very knowledgeable and took the time to explain my condition but more importantly his treatment worked and my condition started to improve within the next week or so eventually leading to a full recovery. üëçüèΩ,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118135943072455965321/reviews
