Potato Tan,4,"I just graduated from olgc a few days ago and now that i think about it my school is quite nice. Most of the teachers are nice and willing to help you. I made alot of friends and had a very good time there. Althought olgc is abit tiny and not alot of facilities. Its on a hill too so in the mornings when i go to sch, the closest bus stop is at the bottom of the hill soi have to climb to sch everyday which is really tiring. Im not sure about other schools but i think the fees for the school bus are very expensive so when your kid is like p4-6 u should consider letting her take bus or mrt home instead. The canteen has many stalls but only like 4 of them are open and now that the schools want us o be healthy there isnt much nice food there (noo offence to the stall aunties and uncles, they work very hard). The schools always have fun activities on childrens day and cny. Althought the blouse is rly uncomfortable, the pe shirt is comfy.  Olgc is affiliated to sjc which isnt that bad of a sch but its very far away from olgc so yes. You can considor sending your kid to olgc.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111870993806108281105/reviews
T S,2,"I have been taking bus 133 in the morning with this pair of Cantonese speaking CHIJ sisters who are always accompanied by their grandma most of the time. Sometimes it's their dad or mum. Their behavior on bus is unacceptable and disgusting. They would at times loudly converse in Cantonese while learning spelling, sing songs but most of the times, they would fight and quarrel. Today, the grandma started scolding the younger one about how untidy her school bag was and started checking the contents. The girl was unhappy and screamed loudly while attacking the elder sister and the elder sister fought back and the grandma scolded them loudly. I just feel that the basic way of behaving in public places should be taught to them although obviously it's not being taught at home. The peace in the bus had turned into chaos thanks to the CHIJ girls.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110068375171241758833/reviews
