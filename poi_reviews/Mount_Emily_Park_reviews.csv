Forest BK,5,"Situated up a hill away from the surrounding road traffic, the park is quiet and serene. Due to the park's relatively inaccessible location, it's users were mainly nearby residents. The many matured trees provide ample shade. The park have both a children's playground, an adult exercise corner and a dog run.
Mount Emily Park is an old park with a rich history. It was previously known as Bukit Rawa.
Right at the park entrance is an entrance shelter which has an old beautiful emblem on its concrete wall. The emblem is a coat of arms granted to the Municipal Commission by the College of Heralds in April 1948.
History has it that the shelter was the entrance to a former Mount Emily Swimming Pool.
Mount Emily used to have 2 Service Reserviors that were constructed in 1880. But by 1920, the reservior was rendered redundant as a new and bigger Fort Canning Service Reservior was being built replacing it. Mt Emily Service Reserviors were then converted into a swimming pool. But due to poor visitor ship the pool was closed down in 1981 and demolished. It was then turn into a park.

Dru Lu,4,"Well maintained park that requires a bit of a hike to get to. Decent playground for playing sand. Because it requires a bit of a hike and not very accessible to people outside of the neighbourhood, it is usually a fairly quiet park.

Recently theyâ€™ve planted more trees and added some park furnitures.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115927493800245457440/reviews

Vasu V,4,Small quaint park on the hillside. Good to laze around on a weekend evening. One of the entrances requires climbing of few flights of stairs. Ideal for a small run on an elevation. There's a small play area for kids.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102397494231795341201/reviews
