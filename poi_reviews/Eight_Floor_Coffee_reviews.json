Very easy to find and drinks are quality and affordable.\n\nHad the signature iced mocha and love it totally. Would highly recommend to come again. There are ample seats at the void deck to just chill with the drinks.",

You'll have to order online through their website for their Instagram, which has the same name as the place, but the drinks are pretty worth for the quality. I ordered the Mocha and the Match Yakult and both were great, though i should have upsized the matcha Yakult as my family preferred it over the mocha :) Would come again",
