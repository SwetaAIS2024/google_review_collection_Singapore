Alan Goh,3,"Overall dining experience is fair today.
And the eating house is not too crowded as it is a raining day.

Ordered roasted duck breast with burnt char siew rice and was a tad surprised with the price tag (SGD10) ; was expecting $7 ish …

The roasted duck breast meats came attached with the rib cage i.e., not boneless. Both the burnt char siew and the roasted duck meats are solid chunky sliced.

We like the sweet garnish vegetables provided ; helps to enhance the lunch !!

For the pricing point, we probably will come back in the distant further, maybe some years later.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108902004436138918931/reviews
SiFeRa,1,"Had an extremely utterly poor and traumatic experience with the old chinese lady boss/order taker/cashier. The food order was done wrongly despite we repeated our order twice, and hen we asked for a breakdown of the bill as there were a few of us, she just chucked a small notebook with handwritten amount of what we ordered but it was itemized in a way that only she could understand. She was rude and kept trying to convince us to order a whole chicken, when the food arrived, a few orders were wrong and had to be sent back, the taste of the chicken and roast pork was below average 3/10 but the dumplings were really yummy 8/10. stay away from this shop at all cost due to the poor customer service and experience.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105338876061295209940/reviews

Alvin Choo,5,"Came across this eating place with really traditional old school vibes and came down with my colleagues. We got their roast duck, char siew and roast pork to share, and I ordered a salted vegetable duck soup for myself.

I really liked the duck soup and it really showed me that it needs to be consumed hot. All the roast dishes were great too. I also really really liked the vibes of the place because it reminded me of my parents bringing me to such places when I was a kid.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
