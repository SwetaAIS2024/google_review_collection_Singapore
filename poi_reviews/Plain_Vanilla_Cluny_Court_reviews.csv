suzen,2,"Happened to passby as had been to their original outlet at Tiong Bahru. More bigger space than at this outlet, new to me. Tried their a cup of flat white & a slice of quiche salmon.

While awaiting, came across a group of ang mo. Look like they are the regulars at this outlet. Cos one of them claimed that this cafe serves the best coffee.

Apparently he always stuck at this outlet & never try on others. Did recommend to the whole group of them on other cafe. After trying at this outlet, the standard wasn't the same as their original outlet ðŸ˜·",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110813622133166743966/reviews
Magdalene,4,"I enjoy coming here for their tart and salad set ($17.99). This ham and gruyere tart was served warm and fragrant, and was delicious. Several of the salads are oily and loaded with carbs rather than veggies, but this particular one was refreshing. Do take note the space is small with 3 small tables indoors and 2 outdoors.

Tried the banana bread ($6.90) for the first time. They gently heated it up. It was thick, moist and not crumbly. Thereâ€™s a crunchy cinnamon streusel at the top which I found too sweet.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107907784704767460720/reviews
tse desiree,1,"There was a couple after me that was served first me, they ordered 3 drinks and their drinks were made first, made me wonder how come my drink took so long to make and itâ€™s not even my drink.

Itâ€™s really not the way to go, horrible service and itâ€™s on a CNY. Had to ask them clean table mess, and didnâ€™t even get latte art done properly. Didnâ€™t even ask if I was a member too, which they did for subsequent people.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100032911620550220451/reviews

Charmaine,5,"I am a repeat customer. The cupcakes are heavenly. The cake is moist while the topping is not too sweet, just nice! I'm obssessed with the salted caramel and cinnamon brown sugar cupcakes, the flavours hits the spot. I highly recommend these two. This is my new favourite cafe spot!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104209230532870331193/reviews
