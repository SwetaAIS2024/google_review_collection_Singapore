Afandi Samat,5,"Such a great location and value for food. Honestly, didn’t expect the bowl to be reasonably priced as well. The scallops were apparently something that was recently added and they did not disappoint! Given it’s location at a typical coffeeshop with the quality of food being presented, it’s definitely a gem.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110451686018423517840/reviews
Sagamihara,4,"I discovered this hidden gem through TikTok and had saved it on Google Maps until I could visit. The food and service were good, and my kids had a great time too. For 2 adults and 2 primary school kids, the bill came to around $49. Recommended!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111847206141992027807/reviews

Nicole Lim,5,Ordered their donburi for dinner. The meat is well marinated and tasted fantastic! Owners are very friendly and warm! Prices are highly affordable and won’t break the bank. Would definitely recommend it.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103290774237444496049/reviews
Xan Chua,5,"Wah finally some good food in the west! The donburi is a must try, very value for money and packs flavour! The beef aburi don at $6.50 is truly worth it! We also tried their bbq grill meat, beef is of very good quality, they serve USDA grade quality meat cuts. Heard the satay chicken and the meat sauce are all handmade, very yummy.
Will be back again!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112470309009548659866/reviews
