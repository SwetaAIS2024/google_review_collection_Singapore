Sasha Lovelle,5,"Great spot for affordable and delicious local dishes! The laksa was rich and flavorful, and the braised pork rice was packed with toppings. I also enjoyed the suan cai vermicelli soup, though I would’ve liked it a bit more sour. Their hot coffee and iced teh were both excellent, and the free hot drinks were a nice touch. Cozy and clean environment with friendly service—perfect for any time of the day!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101750721589012620675/reviews
