Rio Susanto,5,"Both of my kids are attending the Abacus class here, and they’ve been really enjoying it! Ms. Ng is their teacher, and she’s been absolutely wonderful. She’s very passionate, patient, and genuinely cares about helping the kids learn and improve. I’ve seen great progress in both my children since they started. Highly recommend this centre and especially Ms. Ng for anyone considering Abacus classes!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112938909824636810915/reviews
