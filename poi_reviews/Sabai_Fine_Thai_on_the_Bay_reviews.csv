Grace Ng,4,Overall the food was tasty and service was good. The duck curry gravy was delicious but wish they could let customer have the choice to replace duck with chicken. I dont't recall asking for a vegetarian version of pineapple rice which had too many pieces of carrots and pork floss for my liking (see photo). Wished they had prawns and cashew nuts in it and served in a pineapple.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103494993663494337347/reviews

Lionel Tan,4,"While this restaurant is at Collyer Quay it is a pity it does not have nice views. The egg dish is highly recommended. It is fluffy and goes well with the accompanying chilli. The red beef curry was also great and recommended. The other dishes like the fried fish, fried rice and desserts were average. As expected, the price is high for the location.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105174264645946437106/reviews
