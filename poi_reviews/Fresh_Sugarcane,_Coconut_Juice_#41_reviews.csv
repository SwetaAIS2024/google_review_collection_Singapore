J L,5,"Good sugarcane juice. Decent cup size and not too diluted (ie. the drink is a dark shade of green, not yellowish). Friendly service by the  aunty who prepped the drink too!

Note: the photo shows my beverage partially consumed. The cup was FULL when served. I was just very thirsty. LOL!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106870489915117453181/reviews
