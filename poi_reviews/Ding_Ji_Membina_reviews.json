      "text": "Terrible dining experience on a late Friday night. Ordered minced meat noodles with soup. Told the cashier that I didn't want the eggs a tad too late. The male cook shouted aggressively that he had already put the egg into the soup. He probably thinks the loudest shouts wins.\n\nI decided it was too energy sapping to reply so i accepted my noodles. But when I ate the noodles, there was no trace of ketchup in the noodles which I specifically told the cashier I wanted. She had obviously failed to relay my specifications to the cook.\n\nI ended up just eating what was palatable, chiefly the soup and meatballs, leaving the noodles unfinished.\n\nTake your business elsewhere. No need to look far. All other adjacent stalls are much more obliging. :)\n\nThe franchiser should teach his staff about basic manners and respect the food preferences of customers.",

He never failed to show unwilling face.. if other younger staff with spectacles is the one who cook,will be so much friendly.. sometimes u not only buy food, u buy because of service too... I will choose who to buy from in future..",
