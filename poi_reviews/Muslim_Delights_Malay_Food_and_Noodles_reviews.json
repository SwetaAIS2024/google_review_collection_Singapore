You could see the portion of the rice is as big as my Begedel, it's somewhat outrageous. I missed to glance at the cute bowl used to scoop the rice. Parking is a hassle, I would think that their competitor .. PU3 is gonna give them a run for their buck. However I would need to taste the chicken curry at PU3 because the chicken curry here is simply out of this world.. it's a mix of Indian and Malay cuisine.. they've used Malay cooking leaves and Indian spices.. I will judge again after comparing with PU3.",

Begedil is served hot and soft. Very tasty! However, the lady at the cashier wasn‚Äôt friendly at all.",
