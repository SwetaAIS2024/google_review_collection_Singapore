      "text": "~A review for Amigos Food Stall~\nWhat we had:\n1. Chicken Chip with Spaghetti ($10.50)\nVisual: 3.5/5\nTaste: 4/5\n* The black pepper sauce is not like the usual storeâ€‘bought varietyâ€”which was a very pleasant surprise.\nThe Aglio Olio pasta was decent; weâ€™ve had less satisfying versions elsewhere. It was a bit oily, but thatâ€™s to be expected with this style of dish.\nThe chicken portion was thick and generous.\n\nTo improve: Add a side to the plate at least as the plate looks a bit empty.\n\n2. Chicken Cutlet with Spaghetti ($10.50)\nVisual: 4/5\nTaste: 4/5\nIts a decent size of chicken cutlet, not tough to chew. It is surprising but good that mustard sauce is served with the cutlet, at least its not basic mayonnaise.\n\nTo improve: The cutlet is already oily and when served with Agilo Olio which is also an oil based style of pasta, the whole dish felt super oily. It would be nice to offer Chicken cutlet with tomato or cream based pasta. Add more mustard sauce!\n\n3. Guacamole & Salsa Loaded Fries ($4.90)\nVisual: 3/5\nTaste: 2.5/5\n\nIndividually each part (Salsa, Guac and Sour Cream) taste good on its own. Together, not too sure... perhaps someone likes this combo?\n\nTo improve: Double fry the fries so that its more crispy. Salsa and Guac should be served separately.  Salsa could be more spicy.\n\nOther:\nService: Unfortunately, the ringer we were given didnâ€™t work, and we only found out our order was ready when the coffeeshop cleaning staff came over to let us know. When we mentioned the issue to the stall employee, he simply took the pager back without offering an apology or acknowledgment. Its not a big problem but do ensure all ringers are in working condition at least.",

The Fish Burger came with a pathetic thin frozen deep-fried patty that didn't taste of fish - didn't match the price scale. McDonald's is still way better, and that's the cheapest quality of food in the fast-food chain. Great advertising and Friendly staff tho.",
