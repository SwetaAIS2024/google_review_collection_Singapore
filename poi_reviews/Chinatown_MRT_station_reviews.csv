å¼ TakWAI,5,"Chinatown Singapore.
This is a must visit location in Singapore especially during the Chinese New Year festival.
There are many stores popped up along the streets during the this period and in the evening the whole Chinatown will be so busy with the locals doing the usual New Year shopping.
It's so colorful and foods are on every street.
The wet market at basement of Chinatown complex is one of the busiest market in Singapore.
Many Dim Sum restaurant here in chinatown.
The tooth relic temple in Chinatown is the new landmark and you will never miss the temple when you are in Chinatown.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110639918171567841977/reviews

Mona Kriesdinar,5,"Singapore's Chinatown is known as Niu che shui in Mandarin, Gu Chia Chwi in Hokkien and Ngau-che-shui in Cantonese - all of which mean ""bullock water-cart"" - and Kreta Ayer in Malay (Post-1972 spelling: ""kereta air""), which means ""water cart"". This is due to the fact that Chinatown's water supply was principally transported by animal-driven carts in the 19th century. Although these names are sometimes used for referring to Chinatown in general, they actually refer to the area of Kreta Ayer Road.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113122156351041410524/reviews
