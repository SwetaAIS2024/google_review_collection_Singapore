He really enjoyed his time there and would constantly talk about his teachers with a lot of affection. There were many well-planned activities for the kids, and sharing sessions conducted occasionally by the teachers to update parents on the school curriculum as well. My son loved going to school and we would always drop him off with a peace of mind before heading to work. Thank you so much for all the care he has received :)",

The teachers/staff are nurturing and patient with her, and we have seen her progress significantly during her time there. They also take time to speak with us parents on sharing her progress and developments. Big thanks to Ms Nicole, Ms Eve, Ms Judy, Ye laoshi and Deng laoshi!",

The Japanese teacher told us only good things before entering. I couldn’t trust her at all. I regretted to stay here for a year…I feel sorry to my kids.",

The teachers are caring, the curriculum is great (lots of outdoor play and sensory exploration), and I feel assured and less guilty as a working mother who had to leave my baby under the care of another. When we have to pull baby out for a nearer and cheaper option, we were (and still am) doubting if we made the right choice. Baby seems to enjoy her time way more at Chatsworth than at the new school.\n\nMissing Chatsworth deeply at 2 weeks after we changed school.",
