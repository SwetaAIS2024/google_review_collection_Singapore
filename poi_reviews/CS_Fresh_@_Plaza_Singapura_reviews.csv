Buren,4,"I kind of miss the presence of Cold Storage near my area on the north. CS's price is normally higher, but they have good range of unique products that are hard to find in other supermarkets, especially baking products.

It was a delight when I found a range of dog treats available there where you can try bits and pieces of everything especially because my dog is picky. It's too bad that he only likes one type, but for other dogs, go for them!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103975090698079167241/reviews
Flo Yeow,5,"I really like how Cold Storage has revamped many of their outlets by now. This CS Fresh outlet is no different. Located on B2 of Plaza Singapura, you're able to get some fresh food items, beyond all the usual fresh groceries you'd find at a supermarket. Really liked that they have quite an extensive cheese section as well, in case you need to grab some for your cheeseboard or a party.

Eventually got myself some duck rice for lunch, and you really can't complain about the quality nor the quantity, for 5SGD.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
LiV3 LiFe,3,"Huge spacious supermarket at the basement of plaza Singapura. Service of staff was better. Waited for staff to finish washing the rack before turning to assist me. I tried to call out to her but no avail. Luckily, another staff saw me waiting and called out to her. Cashier wasnâ€™t in the best mood, but at least she tried to help me pack the stuff into my grocery bag.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112429413622143366667/reviews
