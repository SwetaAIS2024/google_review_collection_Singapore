The staff was accommodating to our request. I will return back! This restaurant is right in front of the bus stop hence its super convenient.",

We will totally visit again! Probably more patrons from the neighborhood but I feel the traffic could be better if there are better entertainment especially on weekends! Maybe a live band or ktv system?☺️",

Would recommend trying their pizza which was thin crusted and well seasoned, and chicken which was tender and mildly spicy (very shiok).\n\nFriendly staff + cool toilet / interior decor haha",
