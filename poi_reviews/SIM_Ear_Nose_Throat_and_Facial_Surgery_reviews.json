He and his staff ensured that I had a smooth prep, surgery, and follow-up.  Every appointment with him at his clinic is always on time. He listens, is up to date on the latest treatment approaches, and always has an open mind.\nI am so glad I chose “Sim Ear Nose Throat & Facial Surgery “clinic and would highly recommend it to anyone who would like to seek professional services in his areas of expertise.",

Simply brilliant!\nVery easy to talk to, he’s a doctor with ‘both feet on the ground’; practical & sensible. Hence, gives sound advice on maintaining good ear canal health.\nAnd Madam Tang, staff at this clinic, made us feel relaxed, and as if we’ve been friends a long time, eventhough it was my first visit to the clinic. Most helpful and patient to my enquiries.\nThank you both for a very pleasant experience at Sim ENT.",

I was having blocked ear but I was able to hear weird vibrating or ringing sound, after checking the ear, he just said nothing wrong, nothing he can do.  Will not recommend him, he is so not empathy.",
