Yen,5,"Located in Amtech building 07-01 (top floor), carrying a complete array of M10 tools from Taiwan/China, although being a whole seller they are kind enough to entertain small personal purchases. Thanks to Mdm Christine Ya for hospitality!",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111370030027609533797/reviews
LT Wong,5,"Wing Poh distributes Hozelock products in Singapore. I love their pressure sprayer, and have used them for last 20 years. I brought my 8-year old pressure sprayer as the spray was weak despite having pumped it. They serviced it free of charge, and told me it needed some cleaning to clear build-up over the years. The pressure sprayer now works as good as new. Great product, even better service!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107487527261532013673/reviews
