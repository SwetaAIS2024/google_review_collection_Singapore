The signature homemade Wagyu beef burger is a must-try â€” juicy, flavorful, and perfectly tender, not dry at all. The chicken cutlet fried rice was also fantastic â€” super fragrant with just the right portion size. Iâ€™ll definitely be coming back for more!",

The mushroom sauce was really nice and the chicken was tender and juicy ðŸ’¯\n\nOne young guy working late at night around 1+ am, but his service was very friendly and the food came out pretty quick despite there being a few customer orders before me. He even said thank you! Not easy to find such good service in kopitiam nowadays.\n\nNot to mention, the entire menu is affordable for the quality and portion!!\n\nIf you are in Yishun and want affordable western food, come here and try it for yourself ðŸ«¡",
