James Ho,5,Donâ€™t listen to the bad reviews . The students are actually quite nice when I visited the school to buy their school uniform for my daughter the uncles and aunties are always there to help although the students are shy to welcoming the guest the other are willing to help unlike some other schools but I suggest the school to make their students more comfortable with guests and welcome them more instead of just staring at them and speaking very softly.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104213881530915965140/reviews

Zion Sim Jun En (Cckss),3,"3 stars.

There are jerks in this school and they like to gang on others and overwhelm them. Teachers are very good, but sometimes boring, like Geography teachers.
In addition, the discipline in this school is moderate, but some people still find ways to vape, especially in the toilets. One time I entered a toilet cubicle, I heard 6 more boys enter as well and they didn't seem so friendly, and could've vaped.
My friend has also witnessed some boys vape and told a teacher about it.
Sometimes in the toilet, there's other problems besides from vaping. There's those boys who come to you and say ""Suck my..."" and it's disgusting. Most students are not well behaved either.

Why I put 3 stars in my review is that the school is generally not bad. The canteen food is perfect, and canteen vendors are very friendly, and not grumpy.
The Secondary 1 Orientation and Camp was extraordinary and memorable. It has a good lockdown drill, and fire drill unlike many other schools. Teachers are very kind and General Office Staff are very friendly.
Punishments are done fairly and well, but some students get away with crap they do. Teachers should look out more for these students.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102116345371854969850/reviews
Mi Xue Lee,3,"It's not that bad, the aunties and uncles are nice, yummy canteen food. The only bad thing is that there are some teachers that are very rude, there was even one teacher who told a student that he did not exist in her class, another one that brings a stick(3 canes tied together) to class and almost hits a student on multiple occasions",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101492096094472903012/reviews
Alex Sim,4,"Perfect school. The teachers are very disciplined and will take care of literally any problem you need. All the staff are friendly including the aunties and uncles in the canteen and the general office staff. Absolutely superb. Minor problems found though. Like people cut queuing, and disrespectful and toxic people who think they're cool. Coming from a secondary 1 this year btw",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114597628308178953491/reviews
