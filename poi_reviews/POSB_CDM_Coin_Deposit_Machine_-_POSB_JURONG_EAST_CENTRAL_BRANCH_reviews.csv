Cheyenne Ong,5,"I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Serene Tham for her excellent assistance in resolving my registration app issues. She was incredibly patient, knowledgeable, and efficient in addressing my concerns, making the entire process so much smoother.

It’s clear that many people require help with POSB banking every day, and Serene is doing an amazing job managing these requests. I sincerely recommend hiring more support staff to assist her and provide even better service to more customers. Thank you once again for Serene’s outstanding service!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101513237285222112382/reviews
kisyan pekasarouf,1,"Very bad experience, where I deposited cash and halfway my cash stucked inside ! And the ATM just released a receipt which says my deposit was unsuccessful and I need to call DBS hotline ?? And I need to wait weeks for the refund !? These machines always not working properly and will be under maintained very often !  strongly not recommended here. Please visit any other branch for better service !!!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108886899583343949772/reviews
