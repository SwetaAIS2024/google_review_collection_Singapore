Tried cow lungs for the 1st time today and I'd say it's quite mild taste and spongy like, unlike other organ meats which tend to have stronger and gamey taste. Unfortunately the fried chicken wings was flat and bit cold probably cooked a while back.",

I grew up in marine terrace, so I had this since I was young which was 35-40 years ago (can't recall when I first had it. And i am on the wrong side of 40s now.. ðŸ˜…). Now I am staying in the west side, and I gave tried many NSG all over sg, but I still go here every now and then to get my nasi sambal goreng fix.. too bad, now the kerepek is no longer available though.\n\nPortion size is a lot. Good value for money.. The sambal sotong is very highly recommended.. and the nasi rawon is not bad too.\n\nMe and family go to place for nasi sambal goreng.",
