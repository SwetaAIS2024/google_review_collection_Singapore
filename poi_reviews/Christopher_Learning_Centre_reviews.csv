Ben Kho,5,"Mr Lee is a kind and caring teacher,who has decades of experience teaching math.
He has taught me during my secondary school days and am so glad he is still teaching and my son has been going for his lessons for the past 3 years.
He is still teaching due to the passion and care for the kids.

My son grades improved hugely and he scored AL1 for psle math in year 2024.

Highly recommend anyone who needs a math teacher to Mr Lee.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103357097443831425701/reviews
Foo Yoke Yi (Ahs),5,"My math has gotten better ever since I joined this math tuition centre and allowed me to get full marks for my WA in sec 1. The teacher is funny and nice and provides breaks and may host celebrations at times as well. Overall, my math has improved by a lot and has made me more interested in math and I would definitely recommend coming for this tuition.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111890204842954926182/reviews
