I W,4,"Their three treasures (duck, char siew and roast pork) noodle is not too bad.   Reasonable portion for the price ($7).  It is the same price for the three treasures rice.  I thought they might charge more for the noodle, but they did not.

Nothing to complain about their noodles.  I was happy with the meal.

Taste 4/5

Having said that, I'd advise against ordering the dumplings.  The filling was very salty and also tasted off - perhaps it had been in the freezer for a very long time.
