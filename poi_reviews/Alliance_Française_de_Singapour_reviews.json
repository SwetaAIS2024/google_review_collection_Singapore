      "text": "The gallery was really detailed liked especially about the part on how much effort the restoration was done to the more dame as well as the history of the building. Overall, it was quite the experience.\n\nThe VR however, was kinda of a lil bit of a dissapointment, mostly because it was more game graphics rather than real life Images. There's also a limitation on movement. So it felt less interactive than I was expecting. I mean, It was based on Ubisoft's program. So I expected more out of it.\n\nThat said, the overall experience was still highly positive, and shout out to the staff for being patient and helpful because there was a period where the exhibition was really packed. The VR headset running out of battery was unfortunate and the staff handled it like a boss.",
