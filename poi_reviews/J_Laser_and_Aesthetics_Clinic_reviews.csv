da Wei,5,"Dr. Ngiam at J laser restored my confidence in my skin. Previously I’ve spent many thousands of dollars seeing dermatologists over many years for my intense acne, pore, and scarring problems to no result. My friend then recommended me Dr. Ngiam, who gave me a customized and comprehensive package at a very competitive price with both oral medication and skin surface treatments that completely cleared my acne and scarring and reduced my pore size over half a year. Seeing my before and after pictures, I’m a completely different person, it’s magical! Thank you Dr. Ngiam for the honest and effective work! I strongly recommend to all my friends.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112495572562501052845/reviews
cherlene,5,"Dr. Ngiam and his team consistently deliver exceptional performance, service, support, and care. Since December 2023, I have been undergoing treatments at J Laser Aesthetic, and the experience has been consistently comforting and enlightening. Dr. Ngiam goes beyond merely administering treatments; he takes the time to thoroughly explain my skin condition, the rationale behind each treatment, and the expected outcomes in simple terms. Throughout the entire process, including before, during, and after the treatment, the nurses and Dr. Ngiam himself ensure my comfort by regularly checking on me and addressing any concerns promptly.

Furthermore, I attend check-ups every two weeks to monitor the progress of my treatment. I am delighted to report significant improvements in my skin since the commencement of treatment. Dr. Ngiam meticulously documents my progress, providing detailed comparisons of my skin condition from the beginning of treatment to the present. These visual representations, including before-and-after smart images, vividly demonstrate the remarkable improvement in my skin. I am grateful for the outstanding results and service provided by J Laser Aesthetic, and I unequivocally trust Dr. Ngiam to continue delivering top-notch care and results.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102752826705481144574/reviews
