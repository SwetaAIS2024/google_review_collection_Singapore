The 2 staff (a middle-aged Malay lady and a younger female Indian dispensing medicine), were not helpful and gave wrong advice on the medication. After having to clarify again, they got impatient. Very unprofessional.",

But the lady did not bother to notify me when my medicine was ready. She processed several other people (people who consulted the doctor after me) and just left me waiting outside. When I finally got tired of waiting (about 30 minutes), I went in and all she could say was she was going to call me.\n\nIf one has no passion for customer service, then he/she should look for a non customer fronting job. Otherwise, change your attitude towards your customers (patients).",
