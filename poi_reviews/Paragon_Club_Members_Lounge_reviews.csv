Crystal Warren,1,"Absolutely awful and appalling customer service. Redeemed a box of chocolates under Paragon Club only to find there were 2 missing pieces inside. The only response provided by Paragon concierge is that this is my own fault for not checking carefully when I received the chocolates!

The lack of accountability and snobbery in the way you handle this trivial matter shows the kind of business you are. This is the first and last time I am shopping at this mall.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103913597420995894936/reviews
