Savio D'Souza,5,"I visited this branch yesterday. Had a mushroom baguette, Latte and a tiramisu tart.
All three were fabulous. There was plenty of seating available. I always like the gamut of bakery snacks available here.
I left this eatery after a very satisfying evening snack.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116410144810410942051/reviews
Keefy,5,"We have  been in SG for two weeks and this Paris baguette is our favourite local branch. The staff are friendly and helpful. The girl calling out the 9.30pm discount is so good, she put so much enthusiasm in the job lol
We love the Pais Rocher and fruity green tea
See photos.
Not the cheapest place in town but lively, clean and can usually get a seat, something unusually in Singapore cafe society

Jacob TAN,4,So many pastries shops at Bugis junction but only Paris Baguette offers a place to sit. Had a cake and coffee set for $13.50. Cake has fresh strawberry and the cake is quite good. The fresh cream on the cake enhances the taste of the strawberry. The young service crew members are energetic and friendly. Nice place for tea break.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
jayden,5,"Always love their coffee especially the latte in both hot or cold variations.
Standard is pretty the same throughout all the outlets. Always my top choice for a coffee or meeting session.
Their cakes and pastries are also great.
Staff at this outlet is also friendly and tables are clean.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
