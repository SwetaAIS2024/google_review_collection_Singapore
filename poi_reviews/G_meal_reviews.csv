Benedict Correya,5,"Serves solid fried chicken at an affordable price. The chicken is crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and well-seasonedâ€”great value for the price. No frills, just good, satisfying fried chicken that hits the spot. If you're in the area and craving something simple but tasty, this is a place worth checking out.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113292377967743781974/reviews
