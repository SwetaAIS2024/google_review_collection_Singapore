I truly appreciated her professionalism and prompt response during the entire process from the start till the end with the arrangement of my medication delivered to me. Thank you.",

Most doctors don't arrive on time when clinic opens so I am just happy that I didn't have to spend extra time just to wait for doctor to arrive after getting a queue number. Registration was quick and smooth. My boy was seen by Dr Nicholas Yong. Very pleasant experience and he was quite detailed in checking. Will come back to this clinic again when I have to.",
