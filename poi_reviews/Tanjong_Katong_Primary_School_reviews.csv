D Gabriel S,5,"My daughter went to this primary school from 2016 to 2021 and it was amazing. The teachers were great and I used to be a parent volunteer. Special shoutout to Mrs Oon who used to teach English to the kids who needed extra help. Such a caring teacher and an amazing environment for children.
