He always gives relevant advices (on exercises, foods...) with clear explanations other than the necessary treatment. Remember that during one of my visits, I was the last patient on that day, he did not rush and took his time to perform full treatment even though it was past their office hours. One of the staff also waited patiently to see me leaving the clinic. So thankful, really appreciated üôèüôè",

He treated my son's sport injuries and even taught him some exercise to strengthen the affected areas. At times, he will be attending a few patients, some were there for cuppings while he perform tuina on another patient. He told me he sees a lot of stroke patients whom need more frequent treatments. It's no wonder his schedule is always packed till end of the day.",
