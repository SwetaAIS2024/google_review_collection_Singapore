Wilson Ng,5,"Kudos to the receptionists for being very helpful, warm and efficient! I noticed it in not just how they treated me but with other patients too.

Waiting time is very good and service top-notch!

Dr Loh was absolutely professional and meticulous in treating my injury. He explained the treatment options really well and made me feel safe.

Highly recommend!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109847514532950432400/reviews
Amelia Tan,5,"We are truly grateful for this clinic. The doctors and receptionists are warm and friendly, making us feel comfortable during every visit. My daughter specifically requests the female doctor, which speaks volumes about how caring and approachable she is. The clinic's operating hours have been incredibly helpful, allowing us to seek medical attention during weekends for emergencies and even at night when urgent concerns arise. Highly recommended!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109985156584124282097/reviews

Shweta Verma,5,"Excellent clinic with great doctors, prompt service, neat & clean ambience and long working hours dedicated to taking good care of visiting patients. Viana at reception is very helpful both on WhatsApp and registration/billing. Dr Loh is simply fantastic - have been coming here past few times with my whole family and elderly parents. Even though we reached at 8.15 pm for my dad’s diabetes, the doctor gave him ample time and helped us source the right brand of injection which we had run out of. We learnt that the doctor hasn’t even had time to eat lunch or dinner due to the endless cue of patients on Monday yet he was so patient, caring and thorough with his treatments. Thank you so much Dr Loh & team - we really appreciate you!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110222655015303070486/reviews
