LAU HUI LENG,5,"Old Town White Coffee offers a nostalgic and comforting dining experience that combines classic Malaysian flavors with a cozy café ambiance. Whether you're there for a quick kopi break or a hearty meal, the menu has something for everyone—from their signature white coffee to local favorites like nasi lemak and curry noodles.

The white coffee is smooth, aromatic, and perfectly balanced—not too sweet, with a rich, creamy finish that keeps you coming back for more. The food is consistently satisfying, especially the toast sets and traditional local dishes that are both flavorful and reasonably priced.

Service is usually efficient, and the setting is casual and welcoming—great for catching up with friends or enjoying some quiet time. If you're craving a taste of home or just want a solid coffee-and-meal combo, Old Town White Coffee is a reliable choice.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116438744716106053117/reviews
Abraham Lee,4,Nice rest stop along the east coast park area for a bite and chill. Clean and air conditioned environment which provided a good respite from the heat. Food came pretty quickly but my only gripe was that it could be hotter. Staff were prompt and attentive. There are also couple of bike lots right outside where you can watch over your (rental) bikes while eating. Both indoor and outdoor alfresco areas to choose from.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews

N O,3,"I am still looking for a decent Asam Laksa in Singapore. And this, unfortunately fall short. Not that i had high expectation, this is after all, McDonald’s of Malaysian food. The chicken curry was better, however, the meat is a little tough. We were promptly served and the restaurant was clean and comfortable.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116315505302335582154/reviews
