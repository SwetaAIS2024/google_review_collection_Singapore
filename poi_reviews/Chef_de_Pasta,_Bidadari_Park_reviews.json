      "text": "Had not visited this coffee shop for a long time and was sad to see many stalls did not survive. Is business here so bad? But VERY HAPPY that Chef De Pasta opened up! The Japanese fried rice is actually the star of my dish - very tasty and generous in quantity. The veg was also well prepared and great texture. The Grilled seabass was fresh, wonderful texture and delicious. I can only wish for a little less sprinkling of the pepper on the skin. Aglio olio pasta was yummy and garlicky. Very generous in serving for the pork. It is a rare time that I can say I will honestly come back as soon as I can to try other dishes!",
