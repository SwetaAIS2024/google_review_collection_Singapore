Hrmgr,3,"Ordered roast duck Rice and an old cucumber soup. The roast duck was fine except more sauce will be great at least for the rice. For the soup, quite a few pieces of pork in it but unfortunately the soup was not hot despite being just taken out from the steaming cabinet.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews
Fabian,3,"For a hawker stalls centre, its not bad. First off its CNY season and some shops were business as usual. For a tourist, i appreciate this. Mind you they mark up the price and they announced it.

My wife tried the fried chicken noodle. The chicken looks good. It was obviously breaded chicken. I was thinking the chicken might be slightly dry but i was wrong. It was juicy. The noodle was in between soup and sauce. My wife gave a thumbs up.

The place is bright and relatively clean. The chairs and tables were pleasant use. Think will return here for CNY after all.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105050493329866631297/reviews
cava lulu,4,"The chicken rice is very fragrant. It is not too soft nor hard - perfectly cooked.
The white chicken is super tender and jelly can been seen on the chicken skin. Very well done with the right amount of sauce with strong sesame oil.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103608440499184771354/reviews
Lanny Tay,1,"I visited the drink stall on May 6, 2025, at approximately 3:15 PM. Unfortunately, I encountered unfriendly service from the staff. When I attempted to provide feedback to the supervisor, who happened to be present, it was not received constructively. Despite my polite approach, my concerns were dismissed. I hope the management will take this feedback seriously and address the issues to improve customer experience.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116008482995211546104/reviews
Millie Voon,4,We came particularly for the chicken rice.  The steam chicken was very tender and the price was very reasonable.  The serving was also bigger than expected.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117343379047607558029/reviews
