Human Voice,5,"""Rong Kee Three Treasures Rice""
Duck + roasted pork + barbecued pork

Meat is tender and delicious
The soup base seems thick but you donâ€™t get tired of it after drinking it.
The chili sauce is flavorful enough.
Especially the dark and thick braised sauce must be poured on the rice to enhance the overall taste.

The 2 young gentlemen are very friendly!

Stall located at Kopitiam Food Court in Rivervale Plaza second floor.
