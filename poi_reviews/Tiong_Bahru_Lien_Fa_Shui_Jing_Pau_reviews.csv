J Ling,1,"Had the yam ($1.30) and red bean ($1.20) dumplings - 4 pieces for $5. Small in size, skin and fillings were okay. Sometimes, we’re paying for ‘taste of nostalgia’, but the amount paid for the dumplings was not worth it. The last time I had these dumplings were more than 10 years ago, and they were plump and yummy. After today, I’d not think of having them again.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108959151753610110675/reviews
Flo G,4,"A nostalgic childhood taste that brings lots of good memories. This diminishing trade which seems that no where else has.
So for all the poor reviews, we cut them some slack.

Only manage to get the last of the savoury ones close to 1pm, sold out after.

Skin is thin and QQ, Taste is still as good as I remember. So good the chill..

Love the sweet versions, do call to reserve before heading down to save disappointment.

Don’t expect service or warm hospitality, won’t be disappointed.

$1.10 each min. 4 pcs at Feb24

Definitely coming back to satisfy my sweet cravings for their redbean & yam paste.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113094459489500763998/reviews

T greensake,5,Had turnip shui jing pau ($1.10 each) for breakfast. Minimum order is 4 pieces. Advisable to call in advance to order. I was there at 08:36am. This is my childhood's snacks the 80's.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107525471936198024/reviews
Dan Ho,5,Handmade and steamed freshly on site. The ingredients are well seasoned and the skin of the crystal buns is springy and supple. The popular flavours runs out of stock fast and expect a Long que during peak hours. A traditional snack not commonly found today and this is an excellent rendition of it. Highly recommended a refreshing variety to another popular snack shop nearby.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117612630125288267206/reviews
