DA Office,1,"549A and 549B Segar downstairs, all the trees are lush and there are a lot of weeds. The grass and trees here are usually trimmed once a year. Since it is the rainy season now, this may cause dengue fever or hygiene problems. I hope effective unit can be sent someone to clean up this place and pay attention to this problem.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103711984220760301273/reviews
Clement Chua,1,"This town council have the most arrogant and estate cleaners that  no one even manages them. Comes out so late at night everyday at my estate roaming around. When confronted asking what he was doing, he said nothing but why is he opening the compactor to put items so late at night? He even dare to talk back to resident. Is the town council sleeping on the job? Are they picking items to sell late at night and why are they doing so? Is their welfare being taken care of well?
Why are they still working so late beyond their working hours? Even so, rubbish strewn around the common areas and recycling bins are not cleaned when he is here at night? So I ask, what is he doing at night and is it legal?

Max Wang,1,Price of conservancy charges have been increasing but the services rendered by the cleaners are no where to be found. Waste items accumulating and floors not sweep at all. Furthermore my ceiling water marks and peeling issues till now not resolved. The dumb officer in charge of my block also not keeping his words on sending electrician down to my house for 2 days no sight of electrician. Should refund our conservancy charges. Election coming soon.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113816229318440757661/reviews
Nur,1,"Petir park taichi activities in the early mornings, with the irritating music and shouting/ chanting voices. Even their post activity chattering can be heard. All the way up to top floors. Can you spare us that? Because later in the day we have to hear Bto construction sounds which can't be helped. Why allow this noise making activities in estate area, this early in the morning ?",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112433383069483090791/reviews
El,2,"We've reported multiple times regarding water seepage in our flats through calls and emails, but there is no follow up at all until we personally visited the town council office. After which Town Council officers and their contractors came down for site visits and inspection multiple times but there does not seem to be any action being done by them. If there are, information is conveyed very poorly.

Edit: I recommend anyone who sees this to report any issue you notice within your flat/HDB block through the LifeSG mobile app if possible. They are much more efficient and responsive there regarding the actions they'll take and any other follow-ups/updates. Plus you can easily see all previous and current cases reported in an organized manner.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108775881396115601464/reviews
