The live band was awesome and the selection of songs was perfect. We ordered fish tikka, chicken tikka & seekh kebab, the food was super tasty and left us craving for more! Shared my experience with family & friends, and they can't wait to experience it themselves. Looking forward to the next trip! :))",

The chicken tikka is a must try, and if you have any drinks you’re considering to buy, the staff will offer you a sample to try. The drink prices are also affordable especially given the prime location. This restaurant is definitely worth your visit.",

They're actually very very reasonably priced. went there the other day with my buddies and got a bottle of Glenlivet 18 and fell in love with  the Lagavulin whiskey the bartenders let me try. Definitely a very underrated place. would 100% go back for their fresh naans.",
