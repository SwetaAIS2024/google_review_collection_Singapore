yoy yay,5,"Hi! Was in a terrible mood yesterday and for some reason today just got up and took a stroll, told God I wouldn‚Äôt stop walking until I found Him. I somehow strolled to mount faber park and He met me at this church, with a piano I found inside I worshipped Him, as well as uh a prayer book that really spoke to me when I flipped it open, so thanks! But uh I think you left the fan on upstairs, I can‚Äôt switch it off because the door is locked. Hope it doesn‚Äôt waste too much energy. Once again, thank you for this wonderful building God used to speak to me!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112689699088665532868/reviews
