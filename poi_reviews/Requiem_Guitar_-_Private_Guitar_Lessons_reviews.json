      "text": "I've always wanted to pick up the electric guitar but didn't know where to start. Found Ethan and he taught me everything! From the type of guitar/amp etc to get, to learning chords and songs. Within a few lessons, I was able to play some songs! Ethan is incredibly patient, always explaining the theory and chords/strumming in a way I can understand. He's also able to point out many ways I can improve. The best thing is that every lesson is catered to my learning pace/style and I can tell him the songs and guitar solos I'm keen to learn and he can teach me within one lesson. He is also flexible and is not only able to cater to my work schedule, but can also conduct Zoom lessons if I'm unable to travel to his home studio. Thank you Ethan!",
