Ching San Lim,5,"This is a compilation of the food I‚Äôve tried in the nest so far. It‚Äôs a Laguna National member‚Äôs only joint and the food is really pretty good. I particularly like the Laksa and Satay, probably some of the better ones around in Sg. They serve pretty good western food too and I would recommend the chicken chop, burger as well as fish and chips. The staffs are all very friendly and they make an effort to remember the frequent members, which is a nice touch üëç.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114041045991187253638/reviews
Elna Tan,5,"This is the ONLY MEMBERS F&B outlet of Laguna. I was very impressed with both the service, taste and quality of the food here. All three dishes mutton satay, salted egg bittergourd and fish curry were excellent. A great respite from the heat and newly renovated, truly living up to ‚ÄúLuxe‚Äù standards.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104513226543032200659/reviews
Annabelle C.,4,"Nice place to have a gathering.
Food is pretty good. Personally, I ordered a caesar salad with added grilled prawns.
The only downside was that there wasn't enough servers. We waited for some time before we got the menu and waited before someone managed to come take an order, albeit telling us that is isn't the one to take order usually as he is only a part timer but can help us if our order wasn't too much (as his colleague was busy).",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102000461114012949950/reviews

Ben Lin,4,"Came again with golf kaki on the first day in 2022. Weather is super nice for golfing and tried some different dishes after exercise. Awesome
This restaurant is quite comfortable sitting in for wine/beer and dinner with good friends or family due to its good deco and yummy dishes
From the full-view windows, it has very wonderful view of water and golf courses. We like the wayue beef and curry chicken
But one thing to remind, this restaurant is only for members, for non members even can successfully reserve the table they still don't serve.... Saw some arguments at the entrance between guests and the waiters.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112207206059430942725/reviews
