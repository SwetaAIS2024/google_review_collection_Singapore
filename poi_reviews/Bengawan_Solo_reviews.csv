Alicia Ng,1,"The cake not fresh so hard and dry, the pandan kaya cake was suppost to be the signature cake... but is so rubbery.  The black forest cake also taste dry like its been in the display for weeks. Bengawansolo such a disappointment. Don't buy from here",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108821798299779037178/reviews
Monty Griswald,5,"I was sent here by a good friend who is addicted to Bengawan Solo cakes and now I am a believer as well. The two young men working were very nice and attentive in explaining their offerings. I ended up buying several K Lapis and pandan chiffon, which did not last long in my fridge after.

This location is also conveniently next to the Singapore cable car from Sentosa.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105793569494450392534/reviews
jiaxian offcial,1,"Firstly, I would like to file a complaint regarding the HarbourFront branch. I spoke to the manager, a man wearing a red shirt, and he told me that all log cake pre-orders before December 15th would receive a discount. I informed him that I planned to collect it on the 19th, and he assured me that the discount would still apply. However, since the discount period ended on the 15th, I told him I would visit the store on the 15th to place a walk-in pre-order.

When I went to the store on the 15th around 2:30 PM, I saw an elderly female staff member, but the manager was not present. I asked the staff member if I could pre-order the log cake now and collect it on the 19th while still enjoying the discount. She rudely replied that if I collected it on the 19th, I would be charged the original price without the 10% discount.

I explained to her that the manager had told me otherwise, and I asked why it was now not allowed. She insisted it was not possible. Frustrated, I walked out of the store. Her attitude was extremely rude and disrespectful towards customers.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111970078174025695799/reviews

Jeffrey Lam,1,"The additional charge of 1 buck for a second bag for my second cake, intended as a gift is ridiculous. $20 small Chiffon cake the texture itself feels overly dense and dry, detracting from the delicate and airy quality expected in a well-executed chiffon cake.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115529390505537352536/reviews
