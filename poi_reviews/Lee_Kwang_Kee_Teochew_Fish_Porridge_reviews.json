I think the menu should better reflect this so customers can make more informed decisions about their spending.\n\nAs noted in other reviews, even as someone with a smaller appetite, the meal felt insufficient. The fish was served in only a few small pieces, with just some lettuce and a lot of soup. While the soup was tasty, the portion of fish was quite meager, which was very different from the photos advertised.",

Small bits and pieces.\nI give them thumbs up for taste but grouper fish is not worth it.\nStick with the standard. Tried once is enough.\n7/10",
