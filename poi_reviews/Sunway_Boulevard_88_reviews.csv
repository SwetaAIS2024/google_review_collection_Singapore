Cheewee Kok,4,"14 Oct 2023. First time here and surprised by the taste of the food. We only ordered spicy fish and very fresh. The waiter or boss that served us was very friendly. In the restaurant got Karaoke set and I sang few songs ( OK la, many songs). Nice place to visit again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104234572596322175340/reviews
