Portions were generous and definitely satisfying.\n\nThe Flat White, however, was a bit of a letdown for me. Not quite a fan of the beans they used this time.\n\nAs for the breakfast ingredients, the spinach was a standout, and the egg was done just right, though at $6, it’s definitely on the pricey side for a single add-on.\n\nAfter a few bites, the overall flavour leaned a little salty across all ingredients, but it was still really tasty and enjoyable.",
