The Eating Shrimp,5,"I LOVED THE JALAPEÃ‘O POPPERS ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

we also ordered the baja fish tacos & the barbacoa tacos (lamb). They were good but next time I want to try their quesadillas. I found it a bit strange that the baja fish had pineapple in it but thats just personal preference:)",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113289028711322653544/reviews
Jason Feuerstein,5,"Excellent Mexican food. Tacos are full of flavour and each type is unique enough from the other. My favourite was the beef cheek tacos.
Nachos were decent size with enough topping and melted cheese which the kids really enjoyed.
Mild green chilli sauce that came with it was delicious!
Would definitely come back ðŸ˜‹",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102782536632226571174/reviews
Zhen Wei Ang,5,"When you see bottles of sauce with monstrous pictures and gives you the vibes that your rear end is going to be in fire, that's half the battle won. Good condiments, checked.

The taquito filling is rather on the sweet side for me. Chips could be better, but guacamole redeemed the chips. It's an overall good experience at a fair price. It's a small place, with just a few tables at the corridor. Worth a visit and if you like it, go back again.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103823911807712842200/reviews
Zac Yeow (Zac Zakku),4,"Prices are not bad for Mexican food. The shop is really not easy to spot at first. And people who don't know about this place probably won't know it existed. Since it is inside the building. One woman shop owner running the whole place, respect.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117789579119392630062/reviews
