Jaslyn Lim,1,"Disappointing!!! We Scheduled a trial for my girl but it never happened. The location of the class is wrong, no apologies, no response and I don't even know if my refund will be returned. We went up to the wrong place only to learnt that there was no such studio. We texted, called but no reply from the person in Charge. Such irresponsible centre. My girl left disappointed. Will never step into the place again. Can't imagine if I signed long-term. Such a scam",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107954312986851807656/reviews
