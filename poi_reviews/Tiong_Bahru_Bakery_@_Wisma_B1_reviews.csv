Lewis Lau,5,"Have made several orders for colleagues to enjoy during meetings organized by my company from Tiong Bahru bakery in the past.

During my recent order the staff Afiq was patient and provided professional service as I had quite a number of different items to order.

It was also slightly confusing for both of us, as some items were sold out or unavailable, so I had to turn to the second choice option of my colleagues and some colleagues also ordered the same pastry.

However Afiq was patient and understanding and also provided friendly customer service, I would like to share a positive compliment for your staff Arif and Jovi and hope to come back again in future to enjoy your tasty pastry! And order them for colleagues in my office üí™üèª",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110053465538994346921/reviews

XY Lim,5,"This is a nice cafe addition to Wisma and is located on the 3rd floor, right beside the lift bank. Lots of seats with a welcoming ambience but you might still have to wait a bit for seats on the weekend. The cafe is newly opened, the manager was  enthusiastically dashing about to attend to customers who had queries on how to order.

As part of their opening month they have some special promotions, we tried their croffle dessert which was nice and flaky. Overall a good experience, if you want to just grab and go there is a standalone takeaway outlet located at B1 which is where The Face Shop used to be, near where the connecting walkway to Taka is.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109785791498103122701/reviews

Flo Yeow,4,"If you're looking for snacks or coffee, or simply passing by, this Tiong Bahru Bakery at the basement (en route between Orchard MRT and Ngee Ann City) is a new and very convenient option. They also have seats upstairs, in case you want to find a space to meet someone.

Grabbed myself some Salted Egg Brioche, and a Kale Caesar Salad for lunch, and did a grab-and-go.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
