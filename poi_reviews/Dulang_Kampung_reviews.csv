701,3,I must admit that this place offers good food and a good environment. But the owner should consider to top-up their side dish as I came in during lunch hour and the food is almost finished. If he keeping this up then I suggest just take the business to the road side as people waste their time to drive but only to find out that the food is finished,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112239067300131298858/reviews
