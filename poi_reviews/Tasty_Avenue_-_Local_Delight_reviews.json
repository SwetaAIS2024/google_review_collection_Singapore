This wet version hokkien noodles could be customised with various options.. I choose to add a sunny side up $1 and $2 oyster to pump up the protein and seafood favour. It didn't disappoint. The broth of the noodles are rich in favour, slightly sweet from the seafood. Noodles however is just average, lack of the wok breath. Very satisfactory $8 deluxe HKM of exploding oysters juices mix with seafood broth noodles. With Chuck of eggs to complete the mouth feels..",
