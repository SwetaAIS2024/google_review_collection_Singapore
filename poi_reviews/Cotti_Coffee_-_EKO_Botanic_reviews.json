      "text": "I've visited this café a few times, and I've always found the staff to be incredibly friendly. They serve food and beverages promptly.\n\nHowever, I wouldn’t recommend this place if you plan to work on your laptop. The internet connection inside the café is poor, and the Wi-Fi is quite slow. On a positive note, the atmosphere is pleasant—it's not too crowded or noisy. The restroom is also clean, dry, and has a nice scent. Bravo!\n\nIn terms of pricing, it's quite affordable, with drinks costing around RM 8.90 each. They also offer promotions if you use the Cotti app. My favorite is the Cloud Mousse Opera Latte, just perfect!\n\nPlease note that they only provide a receipt for drinks and not for cakes or pastries.",

      "text": "Personally I have never tired this chain of coffee before. Missus asked for a cup of coffee and decided to try them out. Loved their menu with options for the degree of roasting of the beans. I need to perk myself up with a strong coffee and ordered the dark roasted coffee. The taste was great, with a strong aroma to the coffee. The coffee was definitely strong and totally enjoyed it. The staff was pleasant and friendly. The cafe’s environment was pretty good with ample space and lots of tables for patrons to use. Parking facilities are available right outside the cafe. Oh yes, they offer some cakes and pastries as well. Never try them though.",
