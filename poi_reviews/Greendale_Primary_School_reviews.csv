joy x,4,"greendale is a great school. my son, currently in p4, there enjoys the environment and says it's going well. They say they treat him very nice and are all very kind hearted and has his back. üëç His only complaint is that the teachers are stinky üòÇ. Recommend sending your child here if you care most for good environment.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107670076447563459968/reviews
ea ea,4,"helo i am redoing the review cuz i left alot of stuff out :3 as a graudated student i wanna say some stuff,  first of all the reason why some students dont really do hw or follow with the class sometimes they just dont want to learn but the other times its because the teachers of that class makes them feel like not paying attention at all like imagine you had a family emergency and didnt manage to complete your homework and the next day when you have to hand in your homework, you try to explain why you couldnt complete it but the teacher doesnt allows you to and just scolds you on the spot, and even if you explain why, they will still scold you and im not saying most teachers are like this im saying only some are but these type of unreasonable teachers sometimes makes us dread going to their class. There is another type of teachers which are the ones that are too strict. Im not saying that being strict is bad for example like mdm koh as the discipline master she has to be strict but even she loosens up sometimes and another teacher, ms cheok, she gets along with the class and makes jokes and is pretty friendly but she disciplines students and and serves them the punishment/punishments they deserve when they get out of hand. what im trying to say is being strict is fine but the teachers need to be appropriately strict and not too strict if youre too strict it can impact the way you feel towards learning negatively but other than those teachers, i want to thank the teachers that have tried to help me and the ones  that helped me and succeded. bey bey (i forgot uncle simon but i lazy type more :3)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104387988969273242770/reviews
