      "text": "I went to Kimage Hair Salon (Parkway Parade)and had Irene as my stylist, and she was amazing! My hair was super frizzy and unevenly colored by another salon, but she completely fixed it, leaving it smooth, and looking so much better. She’s also super friendly and made the whole experience feel really relaxed and fun.\nOn top of that, she gave me a bunch of thoughtful gifts, which was such a sweet surprise. I’m so happy with how my hair turned out, and I’ll definitely be coming back. Highly recommend Irene if you're looking for a great stylist!",

My stylist Irene did an absolutely fantastic job—the shade is perfect, the application was flawless, and my hair looks healthier than ever. Not only was the result stunning, but the service was also top-notch. They listened carefully to what I wanted, offered expert advice, and made sure I was comfortable throughout the entire process.

She took time to understand my needs and challenge of managing my thick and voluminous hair. She did a great job cutting my long and thick hair to a manageable short bob. Price was reasonable at $165 for a hair cut and touch up colour of hair roots.",

See the before and after pics (I pestered her so much after the colour because I realised that I needed a trim and also wanted to darken my colour a bit - she was very patient with me)! Definitely recommending her",
