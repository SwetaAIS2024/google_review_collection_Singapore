Jenna Ding,5,"Ordered for delivery and everything arrived in good condition, well packed, no spillage for soup.

Chicken wings were still crispy, especially salt & pepper variant since thereâ€™s no (wet) sauce coating. Really enjoyed the fried batter!

Also tried Soy (sweet savory) & Korean spicy (not too spicy) variants, cannot really pick a fav! All pretty safe choices too.

We will happily order again!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110764123005436798033/reviews
Lawrence Zhang,5,"I grabbed the fried chicken to go in both original and soy flavours. To my surprise, they stayed crispy even after 30 minutes. The original was the standoutâ€”flavourful, crunchy and totally hit the spot. I can see these pairing perfectly with a cold beer. Thumbs up!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117799277650144962722/reviews
Nic,5,"omg a very small nondescript kiosk in the cimb plaza basement - blink and u would have missed it . thankfully my fellow foodie friends alerted me to this hidden gem because WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE

SALT has ruined ALL other fried chicken for me no cap ðŸ˜­ the honey soy sauce is sweet but not cloying, the batter and chicken skin remains crispy in spite of the sauce, and the chicken flesh moist and juicy. it's rly rly amazingly good

when the staff/owner? proudly proclaimed that she hasn't had better fried chicken before, i blurted ""sure or not???"" but for lunch today, i ate not only the best chicken ever, i also had to eat my words. her confidence rly wasn't misplaced.

the shop also sells Chinese soups that look really gao and delicious - branded  under the name ""hebrews"". always a sucker for witty wordplay.

i love the biblical references in the branding. also the food is so good even non-believers would gladly convert to christianity because u will see God after having a taste

they even provide gloves for eating the wings which is such a thoughtful gesture",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102964251419189624589/reviews
Wong Teck Jung,4,"# 2nd review# (4 days later)
The red wine chicken is my hands-down recommendation. It's actually the best I've tried from any restaurant or hawker stall. The flavor is rich, gingery, and has a pleasant alcoholic kick. I chose to pair it with mee sua.

As for the sous vide chicken bento set, it was decent, the portion of rice is generous.

I tried all the fried chicken wings, and loved every single one! So crispy and tasty.  For soup, I had the ginseng and danggui chicken soups. They were flavourful, but the chicken was a little dry, probably because they boiled it a long time to get all that flavour into the broth.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115500349786770672418/reviews
A L.,5,"Quality of food here was outstanding for an unassuming little stall for the office crowd. Loved that the bowl was half salad and half rice. Even the salad mix itself was so good, they used 4 different types of veggies and mine included kale which I loved! Chicken was crispy and juicy. Glad that I discovered this stall and will be back to try other options.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102376627396271466857/reviews
