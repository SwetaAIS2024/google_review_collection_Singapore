However, though the sauce was tasty, the noodles were slightly overcooked and was quite mushy. Not the bouncy jajang noodles type. The sauce had some seafood (prawns, mussels, octopus) and lots of potato and onion.\n\nAlso ordered their yangnyam fried chicken. That was really good, chicken was fried very well and sauce was sweet and a little spicy and well coated. Chicken meat was very tender as well.\n\nHowever overall bill was very exp. For 2 pax, it was $75. Slightly overpriced for Korean food.",

Yukgaejang is a big disappointment. I gave 2 stars for the kimchi banchan that tastes korean, and generous portion. Will never return to this.",

I have been to Korea twice and know what real Korean food is, my wife as well and we were both rather disappointed especially for the price that is being charged.\n\nWe had the seafood pancake (which was way too dough-y and didn't have much seafood, the big plate of squid in chill sauce which came with noodles. The seafood pancake was about $18, and the squid was $36.\n\nThe place itself is quaint, small, and casual and service was good and friendly. Would I come back? No. There are better Korean places in Singapore for less money.",
