My favourite was the beef cheek tacos.\nNachos were decent size with enough topping and melted cheese which the kids really enjoyed.\nMild green chilli sauce that came with it was delicious!\nWould definitely come back ðŸ˜‹",

Good condiments, checked.\n\nThe taquito filling is rather on the sweet side for me. Chips could be better, but guacamole redeemed the chips. It's an overall good experience at a fair price. It's a small place, with just a few tables at the corridor. Worth a visit and if you like it, go back again.",
