      "text": "Springleaf PRATA @ Railmall, Bukit Timah\n\nA Sunday morning outing that didn’t start well we arrived at 8.10 am!\nWithout a doubt the worst service ever!\n\nA table next to us, came 10 minutes after we ordered, got served before us, and the server screwed up our order completely!\n\nThey were completely overwhelmed, likely short of staff, and the face of the server looked like thunder & rain plus argued that there was nothing wrong with our order!\n\nOur next table, a bunch of Sunday morning cyclists, 1 female, 5 males, probably in their mid 30th, looked like a PMT bunch, talked so loudly like they owned the world, didn’t give a crap on other diners near by, and when they left the table, left it behind dirty and filthy! And here I thought Singapore has become a gracious country! Nope it didn’t!\n\nFood:\n\nPrata :\nI had 2 Kosong, my buddy had one with egg, our 3rd companion who arrived a little late, didn’t even bother to order as he could see the staff were not able to handle!\n\nThe Prata itself, was the usual Springleaf style, a tad crusty but looked more like a flat dense bread! Definitely not a fluffy style\n\n3 out of 10\n\nFish Curry Gravy :\nYou are better off to bring your own, the thick floury style sauce was below average, hardly had any resemblance of a fish style curry, and the tamarind was hardly noticeable!\n\n2 out of 10\n\nChicken Curry Gravy :\nActually if you buy Yeo’s Chicken curry you are better off!\nThis thick & floury gravy was totally abmissal! Probably the worst I ever had!\n\n1 out of 10\n\nOver all Quality of food? Below standard! Actually not just disappointing, completely unacceptable!\n\nOnly surpassed by the worst service ever!\n\nGo somewhere else it can only be better no matter how!\n\nSunday morning was completely spoiled!\n\n#foodgloriousfood\n#singapore #foodsg #sgfoodie #sgfoodporn #gourmet #cuisine #foodagram #foodaddict #SGfood #sgfoodstagram #heritage #springleafprata #rotiprata #sundaybreakfast #worstfoodever",

      "text": "Spring Leaf Prata Place is a must-visit for prata lovers in Singapore! Known for its crispy, fluffy pratas with creative fillings like plaster blast (egg and cheese) and milo dinosaur, this eatery offers a delightful twist on the traditional dish. The pratas are perfectly golden and buttery, served with flavorful curries that elevate the experience. While the place can get crowded during peak hours, the efficient service and affordable prices make it worth the wait. A great spot for a casual meal any time of the day!",

After 35min, then came the rest of the order. Not really satisfied with the Kheema mutton curry as was served with minced mutton. Overall food was just ok & service needs big improvement. There are more better prata place. Won't return to this place.",
