CP,5,"I was very excited when I chanced upon this place. And I was even more blown away when sank my teeth into their  burger - toasted sourdough bun, crispy bacon, thick juicy beef patty with delicious barbecue sauce. A perfect place to chill over a bottle of wine in the evening.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861923464679544218/reviews
L. c.,3,"Service was excellent as they helped to clarify the chicken parts used in the ccc burger (thankfully it’s breast meat) and separated the sauces for the kids. The price is steep $19 for chix and $22 for fish as you have to top up additional 4-5 bucks for normal or truffle fries/sweet potato fries. Kids prefer the chix over fish.

Both indoor and outdoor dining space with a play area for kids.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101825055847001791924/reviews
Ed,4,"Looking for a burger takeout on exiting Tanglin Mall and tried this spot. Parking was easy though the restaurant was hidden from view until you talk in and discovered it was part of Baker&Cook.
Burgers seem a little pricey and didn’t come with fries which I had to order as side.
Portion and taste wise, it was pretty decent and the truffle fries remained crispy when I got home ( though the paper bag was soaked through with oil).
Didn’t dine in so can’t comment on the service but the place seems catered for couples and small families.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104056554846052732887/reviews
Clare L,4,"Food : we ordered a Mo and the naughty CCC there are really delicious. The combination of the fried chicken and Cranbury sauce are absolutely amazing plus strong cemerbert cheese which bring the burger to another level. I enjoyed the sourdough buns very much.
For ingredients are fresh and the burger or a freshly made.
I think it would be great that they have more sauces for the chips and more vegetable options

Environment : Very clean and good for friends who are hungry for quick nice burgers.

Service : Very friendly staffs and quick service.

Price : $ 25 / person (plus drinks )",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108916871259693497832/reviews
Zhe Ming,4,"We ordered the ""Jo"" & the ""Holy Smokes"" burgers, along with the basket of Curly Fries! The final verdict was the it was a burger which is fairly valued! The burger was cooked to well done, and the thick meaty beef patty really did justice to the flavour and the overall taste to the burger. However, we did wish that the patty was juicier, it was slightly overcooked and led to it tasting a little dry.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105064890700482994206/reviews
