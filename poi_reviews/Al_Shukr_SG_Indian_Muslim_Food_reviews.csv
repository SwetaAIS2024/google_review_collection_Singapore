James Ang,5,"I wanted to create this place on Google Maps because I feel they really deserve more people knowing about them.

Not only do they open super early and close late at 8.00pm, the food is not expensive and portion generous. If not even curry can even just go back and take more. Most importantly, the food bro. Bro.

When your uncle slaps and very aggressively press them together to fluff them up you know this one power liao, your taste buds good luck handling the wow. Also, everything is made fresh so no 3 hour long prata sitting on the grill until its dry that kind.

I'm so glad while waiting for car servicing I can sit there eat prata soaked in savory curry. Life.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100655878992435360282/reviews
