Daryl was especially outstanding – he greeted me with a warm smile, was incredibly attentive, and made sure everything was taken care of swiftly. The quality of the chicken was absolutely delicious – perfectly cooked, flavorful, and tender. It’s clear that both the service and food quality are top priorities for this team. Thank you, Daryl, for making my visit so enjoyable! I’ll definitely be coming back soon and recommending this spot to my friends.",

Great tasting chicken that was crunchy and juicy, located on the ground or some call it basement floor of EHub Downtown East next to the escalators. There is ample seating here and the ambience is bright and wonderful!",

      "text": "I had an outstanding experience at Texas Chicken, thanks to the exceptional service provided by Jeanette. She noticed that I had ordered the Mexicana wrap for dine-in, which is spicy, even though I don’t particularly enjoy spicy food. Without hesitation, Jeanette kindly offered me a Tex wrap on my way out, ensuring that I could still enjoy the delicious offerings from Texas Chicken without discomfort.\n\nThis thoughtful gesture was truly a first for me, and I deeply appreciate her attention to detail and genuine care for her customers. It’s rare to come across such exceptional customer service, and Jeanette certainly went above and beyond to ensure my satisfaction. Thank you so much for making my experience memorable – I highly encourage others to enjoy a meal there too!",
