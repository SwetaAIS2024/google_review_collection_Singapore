The young lady who served me yesterday was friendly, helpful and I could see that she's trying her best to juggle everything from taking and preparing the orders to attending to everyone's requests like a one man show. Couldn't fault her, in fact I think she's doing a great job. This outlet is understaffed, it's too overwhelming for the workers and too long a wait for the patrons.",
