lontongstroong,4,"I wholeheartedly agree with their philosophy - good coffee is good enough without sugar (yeah this is kinda paraphrase). The espresso is very flavorful and packs a lot of aroma and pleasant notes (first one was chocolate, followed by dried fruits). The cheese omelette brioche was tasty and pretty filling - surprised there's caramelized onion in it. The price is rather steep for a neighborhood cafe, but still okay for a treat. The folks in the locality are lucky to have such eatery within walking distance.

There are dining spaces indoor and outdoor - the management went to great length to provide kiddie toys in the patio dining area. There's a small fan too for the diners who choose to have the meal or coffee outside.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews
Natalie Tay,5,"Small dainty cafe in the middle of nowhere in Clementi. It is a bit of a distance 5-10min from Clementi Central. It is next to the laundromat.

Staff are kind and friendly, coffee is good, food is decent. We arrived at 11ish on a weekday and ordered the mushroom mac n cheese and the Sunrise brioche bun ‚Äúburger‚Äù. Personally I preferred the mac n cheese but perhaps Sunrise is good for the morning.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102024748599130387710/reviews
Lina Lim,3,"Pricey for a cafe at a HDB blk.

Scrambled eggs are abit overcooked. I saw some look not bad, but mine received is overcooked. Mushrooms are good but quite little. Ham is just ham, little disappointing.

Service is also average. The lady doesn't give me a good vibe. Feels like she just wants u to finish ur food and go.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107917244728844048910/reviews

Jeremy Lee,1,"We waited 25 minutes just for our coffee and 40 minutes for the food. While the food itself was decent, it certainly didn‚Äôt justify the long wait. The slow service (tho friendly staffs) overshadowed what could have been an enjoyable meal.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111663436056514970819/reviews
