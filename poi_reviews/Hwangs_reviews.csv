Botak,4,"Reasonably priced Korean food in National University of Singapore.  I believe owners are authentic Koreans as we spoke to the Korean uncle who was clearing the plates,

Food was served fast as u queue and move along the line. The nice thing about it was probably the stall was situated n the air-conditioned part of the canteen, so u could eat in comfort. The hard part was looking for seats.

You also get to have a free Korean tea with your meal.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100060791396189603978/reviews
Ong Zhi Yuan,5,"Hwang's is a gem for affordable and delicious Korean cuisine, offering a variety of options, including pork, chicken, beef, and fish. With all their sets priced below $10 (the most expensive being just $8.90), this is a budget-friendly spot for a satisfying Korean meal.

During our visit, we tried the beef and pork belly sets, and both were excellent. The meat was tender, juicy, and packed with flavour. The accompanying seaweed soup was spot on, complementing the meal perfectly. As a bonus, I also sampled their Korean rice cake (tteokbokki), which was a pleasant surprise‚Äîsoft yet springy, with a texture and flavor that rival far pricier Korean restaurants that often fail to get it right.

The restaurant itself is spacious and comfortable, and even during peak hours, it wasn't overly crowded. This makes it an ideal spot for a relaxed meal without the hassle of long waits.

If you're looking for great Korean food at unbeatable prices, Hwangs is a fantastic choice. 8/10, highly recommended!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104417804420531473764/reviews
Tiramisooo Tiramisooo,4,"Cravings satisfied with some of my favorite Korean dishes ‚û°Ô∏è Samgyetang and sundubu-jjigae. üíï

Hwang‚Äôs Korean restaurant at University Town offers delicious and affordable meals that won‚Äôt break the bank. The half chicken, plump and stuffed with glutinous rice, ginseng and red dates is a winner! The smooth tofu soup pairs perfectly with rice although I‚Äôm trying to curb my daily carbs intake. üòÖ

I will definitely be back to try the Army Stew!

Dylan Li,4,"Good Korean food! My friend from Korea said the food is decent, with the ddukbaegi samgyebsal being the best dish. I enjoyed the chicken/beef + pork belly combo sets, and I like their new naengmyun. The free side dish of kimchi is small, but I think they're okay with you taking multiple. Worth a visit if you're craving Korean food!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115227455027475284936/reviews
