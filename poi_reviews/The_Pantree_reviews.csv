megan,5,"Worth it for the price. Go get it you wonâ€™t regret

Itâ€™s so crispy - the crispiest Iâ€™ve ever tasted in my entire 21 years of living in Singapore. This is the crispiest peanut pancake (meejiangkueh) Iâ€™ve ever tasted.

Itâ€™s not very sweet and has a little bit of saltiness to balance out the flavour.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100978343250742524720/reviews
TF,5,"This is the ultimate crispy peanut pancake that satisfy all my craving.

Have never been a chewy minjiang kueh person and had a hard time finding the crispy version which I prefer. Like all fellow foodies, I did a google maps search, found this place and saved it on the map waiting for a chance to pass by. Lucky day indeed.

The pancake was freshly made to order and it arrived warm. The Ying and Yang was showcased perfectly in this pancake. You have the crispiness on the outside while being chewy on the other inner side. The fillings of crunchy peanuts was complemented by the softer corn bits. How lovely.

Best of all, I love how this is so light on your stomach which unlike the typical minjiang kueh, wouldnâ€™t make you fall into a coma after enjoying.

The owner was extremely kind and friendly. Would definitely be back to try out their savory options! ðŸ˜‹",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101085736491369105980/reviews
Rene Lee,5,"Location was a bit hard to find (for others who have difficulty finding, it's underground from Shenton Way MRT or you can use a link way from Downtown MRT), but it was SO good. I got the Luncheon bomb (Luncheon meat, cheese and egg). Very crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and delicious!! ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹

Update: Came here to try the Floss bomb and I think I still prefer the Luncheon",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108481221892893207863/reviews
Samuel Goh,5,"The Pantree serves a really excellent pancake with a good spread of flavours from sweet to savoury. Their pancake is a good mix of soft in the middle and crunchy at the corners.

As our third time coming here, we ordered:
01 x Floss, Luncheon Meat, Cheese & Egg (endearingly known as HPL)
01 x Floss & Egg
02 x Nutella & Peanut

We loved it!

Waiting time could be up to 25 minutes during rush hour. Ordering online can only be done on Deliveroo, but it does not deliver to all places.

The seating spaces limited, so itâ€™s better for takeouts.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100714548997023510355/reviews
Kim Hong,5,Absolutely loved it! Bought it many days in a row and I love it as a quick snack. My go to is the sweet corn filling pancake. It goes so well with coffee or tea. I highly recommend this place for pancakes lovers. Two thumbs up!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110474306946590265362/reviews
