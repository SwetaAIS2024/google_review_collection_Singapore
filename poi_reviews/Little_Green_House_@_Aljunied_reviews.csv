Katherine Wong,5,"My little one has been attending Little Green House @ Aljunied infant care and I have been pleased with the attention and services that the principal and educarers have shown.
During the days of a daycare search (last min!), principal Yvette had been welcoming and proactive with the onboarding process to make it less anxious as a first time mother.
I am able to experience the love and nurturing of all the professionals in the centre being translated to the wellbeing of my child. Thank you!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117687194256115509544/reviews

The team is kind, professional, and genuinely loving toward the little ones. They have created such a nurturing environment, and it’s clear that our baby feels safe and happy there.

We appreciate how communicative the staff is, keeping us updated on our baby's activities, milestones, and overall well-being every day. The facility is always clean, well-organized, and equipped with everything needed for the babies’ comfort and development.

I can truly feel the genuine love and care that the teachers have for my son. Special thanks to Lan Lao Shi, Teacher Shah, Teacher Shika, Teacher Angel, and Teacher Florence for their dedication and warmth.

Jacqueline Tan,5,"Recently moved my kids over to LGH @ Aljunied in June 2024 after detailed considerations of a handful of schools. What drew me to move (and the school has proven right after just 2 weeks into school):

- A very dedicated principal who takes everything into her own hands. She is very interactive with parents, open to feedback and most importantly, action on them.
- Good profile of teachers with very different teaching style to handle different student needs
- Clean, neat and well kept learning environment with big floor area for kids to explore.
- Good curriculum to promote lifeskills as well as maintain BAU education.
- Strong believer of outdoor activities to enhance kids exposure to the outside world.
- Tchs, principal and parents engagement is strong. Parents are kept updated on students progression.

Plus Points:
- Shuttle service pick up at various locations from 7am to 10am.
- School able to cater to students needs eg. shower to kids with eczema
- Principal makes the effort to understand every single child and assess their strengths and weaknesses

Minus Point:
- Driving is a test to skill as school is located in an aged industrial with narrow driveway and parking.

Overall, am happy with the move to the school and I believe with the change in the new principal, LGH @ Aljunied will leave your kids with a memorable childcare experience.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104192817969010373159/reviews
