Shawn Keh,5,"I usually don't write review. But for this, I would need to shout out to 黄老师 and say a big thank you for her patience and dedication in chinese teaching.

My daughter just gotten her PSLE 2024 result. She scored AL3 for 普华 and Merit for 高华. From a AL 6 or 7 to a AL3 merit, I think that is a great improvement!! From someone that cannot conversed properly in Chinese till able to speak fluently. Don't think this will happen if not for 黄老师 dedication and teaching.

In my daughter owns words: 黄老师 is patience, interesting, most importantly don't make her hate Chinese and always encourages her to improve.

As my daughter move to her next phrase of education journey, I would like to thank 黄老师 for all her great works done!! 谢谢老师！！",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100650315170755245707/reviews
Marilyn Ng,5,My child has been enrolled in PromiseLand for a year and he loves his teacher and lessons. It really makes a great difference when he looks forward to attending his lessons with confidence. Even his Primary school Mother Tongue teacher feedback to us how my child has improved in his participation and school work. My child was even offered to take up Higher Chinese in Primary Three. We want to give credit to his teachers and the cozy and positive environment Promiseland provides for my child’s progress. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110798826682729196309/reviews
