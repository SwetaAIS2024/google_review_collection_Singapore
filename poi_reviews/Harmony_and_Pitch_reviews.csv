German Shephard Force,1,"Beware… In my opinion do not engage as unethical business.
We gave notice on 7/2/20 that we would be withdrawing our kid.
Was told on 4/3/2020 that the last lesson will be on 12/3/2020, but no notice that the deposit was going to be forfeited.
7/2/20 to 12/3/20 is more than 1 month
Was only informed on 19/3/20 that they will not refund us the deposit.
They are not very transparent and sly.
They had spuriously charged for a lesson, where the commencement date had been changed with mutual consent through text, as there was no dispute or notice of chargers.
Just be mindful if you still want to dealing with them.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113068772980230531942/reviews
Siddharth Thirumalai V.,5,"Decided to check them out to fulfil a long term wish - learning guitar - even though I’m in my late 40s with no music knowledge whatsoever. Best decision I’ve made on this front. They have the patience and the ability to support, challenge and keep me interested in coming back to learn more.

Sarah/Ben - Thank you for helping me get started on my passion - you guys are amazing!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106351014103367134599/reviews
