Elijah Tan,5,"I visited Essen for the first time with friends to celebrate New Year’s Eve, and it was a fantastic experience! The atmosphere was lively, thanks to the live band, which was not only talented but also incredibly humorous and engaging with the audience.

I had the Thai basil pork rice and grilled prawns, and both dishes were absolutely delicious. The cheesecake ice cream was the perfect way to end the meal – creamy and flavorful.

The only downside is that you have to line up to order food, as there’s no table service. However, the quality of the food and the vibrant entertainment more than make up for it.

Highly recommended for a fun and memorable dining experience!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109287346354369266778/reviews
Garry Ng,4,"""The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, making it a pleasant place to dine. The Carbonara and ribeye steak are good choices, but the Fish and Chips are underwhelming. The Long Black, priced at $4.50, lacks the aroma expected at that price point.""",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105969948223512649694/reviews

Kate Lim,5,"Great ambience, cool band and suitable for friends/family to hang out. Air conditioned, no smoking and no dog are allowed. Food was decent, saw people buying satay, fries, pizza, buffalo wings and spaghetti. They sell ice cream (at least 8 flavours) and liquor (craft beer, beer on tap, soju, red wine, soft drinks, etc) too. Seats are free seating after purchasing food/drinks from the counter. Saw family bringing children there for meals while parents ordered beer jug/barrel to share. Have high and low table. A few are reserved in advance. Almost full house for a Saturday night but customers are allowed to sit there with no time limit. Their band started at 8pm. 3 powerful vocalists, 1 guitarist and 1 drummer. They play at least 3 sessions, singing a mix of Chinese and Cantonese songs.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109932826812135529824/reviews
Saikhnaa,1,"Wait staff don’t come and bring you your food, they just tell you to come pick it up. Musicians weren’t the best and were overly loud. Rib eye steak was burnt, had cold potatoes and the sauce was old and crusty. The wings we got were clearly heated up (maybe in a microwave) since the inside was still cold.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109140017222769221912/reviews
