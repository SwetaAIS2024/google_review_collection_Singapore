Daniella Louise Santiago,4,"This is the definition of a mid hotel. Place was fairly clean, although it was the size of a matchbox. The staff were attentive to my needs especially when I needed help with my room’s lock, and when they let me check in an hour or two early. There are bus stops right in front of the hotel, and across the street from it.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103166766681992571142/reviews
JC Alex,1,One of the worst hotels I’ve stayed in for a long time. Hotel cleanliness is non existent. Room and bathroom in particular was dirty - hair on the wall in the drains and in the sink. Very bad cleanliness. Small room. Damp smell. For the price that they charge there are much better options in this area. Don’t waste your money. This hotel needs and update asap. Value hotel better option after I changed to stay there.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106448610006114220625/reviews
narvini ravi,1,"The worst hotel I was stayed. Room & toilet full of hair and smelly. The counter staff did exchange room for me, but the other room also same. Hotel corridor smells of smoking.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114845109919702088537/reviews
Mark Haskins,3,"It's OK. I don't think they are going for more. It's a room with air con, and a shower/today combined (almost overlapping!). The staff were really friendly.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109737532055049231400/reviews
Alora,1,"Staff was ok.
Hotel smelled like cigarettes. Room and toilet was dirty, dusty, and old. Shower and toilet did not have a separator so the floor is wet and dirty.
Not soundproofed so you hear other guests at night. We got woken up multiple times.
I don't recommend this place for a long stay.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113033006849422449117/reviews
