The school provides a wonderfully nurturing environment where children feel safe, engaged, and excited to learn. My kids absolutely loved going to school every day!\n\nMs. Carol, the school leader, is incredibly approachable and always just a call away. Her dedication and open communication made us feel completely supported as parents. The school also excels in providing timely reports on the childrenâ€™s progress, ensuring we stayed informed about their development.\n\nThank you, Little Ones Kindergarten, for creating such a positive and loving space for our little ones to grow and thrive!",

The nurturing environment, the structure to lessons and the bilingual mandarin program is fantastic. If youâ€™re looking for a fun and caring preschool with top teachers, this is the place for your little one :)",

      "text": "LittleOnes is hands down the best kindergarten in Singapore. From day one, it gave us the peace of mind we needed as parents to leave our boys in such capable hands while we went to work. Not only were they well taken care of, but they also learned so much, had endless fun, felt safe, and truly belonged.\nCarol, the exceptional principal, ensures every detail is meticulously handled. She kept us consistently updated on our boys' development and milestones, which meant so much to us.\nOur boys treasure their memories of LittleOnes and talk about their first school experience with so much fondness and joy. I cannot recommend LittleOnes enough.\nA heartfelt thank you to Carol and the amazing team of teachers for everything they did for our kids. The school is small, intimate, and incredibly personableâ€”a gem of a place that weâ€™ll forever be grateful for.",
