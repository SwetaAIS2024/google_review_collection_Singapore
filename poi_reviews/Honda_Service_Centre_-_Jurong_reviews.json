The Boss assessed and worked on patching himself before his tyre man come to work. He told me he helped , so that I don't reach office too late. Best in Customer focused service that I have come across. Thumbs up !!!",

Do take note that because of the space constraint, they do not have a proper waiting area and probably no eateries within a 300m radius. Kudos that the wait time for me was within 60mins!",
