Ricky Wibowo,5,"My experience with Little Footprints Preschool at Sengkang 275 has been wonderful. Since transferring our daughter to this center in January 2024, she has been excited to come to school every day. The Principal, Teachers, and Staff are all incredibly friendly, loving, and caring. I highly recommend this preschool to any parent looking for a nurturing environment around Sengkang.

I would also like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Nursery Teachers, especially Teacher Zoey and Ran Laoshi, for all the love, care, and dedication they put into teaching our daughter. Their efforts have truly made a positive impact on our daughter learning journey.

Harshidhdhi Joshi,5,"I want to take the opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude and share a few words about the incredible impact each of you has on my daughter, Nyra. It is truly a blessing to have such wonderful educators and staff guiding her during these formative years.

Ms. Evelyn, your calm and mature approach creates such a positive and reassuring environment for the children. Nyra absolutely adores you, and it‚Äôs easy to see why. Your meticulous attention to detail ensures that no aspect of her learning journey is overlooked, and your consistent updates give me great confidence in her progress. Knowing that I can rely on you completely, without any worry, is a comfort beyond words. I‚Äôm so grateful for the love and care you show to my daughter every day.

Ms. Lin Chunjuan, your vibrant energy and infectious smile light up the classroom, making learning a joyful experience for the kids. Despite Mandarin not being Nyra‚Äôs first language, you go the extra mile to support her, ensuring she feels confident and capable in her studies.

Ms. Jacqueline, your leadership is nothing short of exemplary. Your prompt responses, patience, and humility make you a cornerstone of this school community. I am grateful for the sense of security and trust you instil in us parents, knowing that our children are in such capable and compassionate hands.

Ms. Amelia, The way you connect with the children each morning during check-in asking about their breakfast, feelings, or vacations, speaks volumes about your kindness and empathy. These small but meaningful gestures help foster a strong bond and teach the kids the importance of caring for one another.
I am truly thankful that Nyra is part of a school where she feels at home and is encouraged to grow not just academically, but in all aspects of her character. It is so important for children to be nurtured in a way that balances education with the development of empathy, kindness, and resilience, and I‚Äôm so glad that her teachers play such a vital role in this.
Thank you so much for being there for Nyra and for all the children during these crucial early years. The foundation you‚Äôre helping to build will serve them well throughout their lives.
With deepest appreciation,

Nyra‚Äôs mummy

Sabrina Ang,5,"Dear Infant Care Centre teachers @ Sengkang 275,

We wanted to express our deepest gratitude for the incredible care and love you have shown to our child during his time at your centre. As a parent, there is nothing more comforting than knowing that my child is in the hands of such dedicated and nurturing teachers.

It has been truly heartwarming to see how our child has blossomed under your care. The way you all have encouraged him to explore his surroundings, and nurtured his curiosity has been nothing short of amazing.

One particular moment that stood out to us was when our child came home after learning to walk for the first time. The excitement in his eyes as he demonstrated his new skill was priceless, and we
know it was because of all of your patience and encouragement. Every little milestone he reaches feels like a victory, not just for him, but for all of us, and it‚Äôs clear that you play a huge role in those successes.

We also appreciate how you‚Äôve always kept us informed, not just about his development, but also about the little things‚Äîlike how his day went, what made him smile, and how he interacted with the other children. These updates mean the world to us as they make us feel connected even when we‚Äôre apart from him during the day.

Thank you for creating such a warm and supportive environment for our child. Your dedication and passion for what you do have made a lasting impact on our family, and we are so grateful for each of you.

Special shoutout to Liu Lao Shi, Liang Lao Shi, Zhang Lao Shi, Teacher Zak and Teacher Alyssa! Happy Teachers‚Äô Day to all of you in advance üòä

With heartfelt thanks,
Sabrina & Willy",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115074722086389340590/reviews
