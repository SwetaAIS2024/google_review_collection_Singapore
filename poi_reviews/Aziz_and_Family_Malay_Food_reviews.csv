Zul M,5,"Their briyani was already sold out by the time I arrived on Friday at 11:30 a.m. (a heartbreak moment, honestly).

So, I settled for white rice and decided to try the kambing curryâ€”and wow, what a surprise! The mutton was so soft it practically melted in my mouth, and the curry was rich, flavorful, and absolutely delicious.

While I missed out on the famed briyani, the kambing curry more than made up for it. It is a dish worth returning for, and I might just come earlier next time to get the full briyani experience.

But for now, that curry? Pure satisfaction.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118286768499241544620/reviews
Jack Sheo,5,"Aziz & Family Malay Food stall is operated by a friendly Malay couple.

They start at 5am daily (except for Monday) and serves very nice mee siam and mee rebus.

In fact, the mee rebus here is voted among the TOP 10 in Singapore.

The mee rebus gravy is thick and fragrant and the texture of the yellow noodles is just right.

Give it a try if you are in the Telok Blangah Crescent area.

They usually sell out by lunch.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103126351448694248763/reviews
