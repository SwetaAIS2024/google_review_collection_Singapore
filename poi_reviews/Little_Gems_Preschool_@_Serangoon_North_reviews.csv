Gladys Teng,5,"The preschool teachers are incredibly caring and loving, especially the director Ms Peh Woon has a heart of gold. They are truly child-oriented and prioritize the well-being of the children over profit.

Best is they made an effort to update most activities through the app, ensuring you won‚Äôt miss any events or milestones your kids achieve, while also staying on top of their academic progress!

Well done, teachers! Your efforts and love truly make a difference!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106990320738051078865/reviews

They have a wonderful app to share the check ins and check outs of my son and all the little memories and activities he has been doing as photos etc. I highly recommend the school.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114004437788145073709/reviews
