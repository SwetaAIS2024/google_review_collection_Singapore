Besides trying a few different versions, we also had their chicken curry roti, which was really good. The chicken curry, however, was one of our favorites. This is the perfect place for coffee and an original kayo toast that was sweet and buttery, which I would return to again and again.",

Will normally take the seats outside as I noticed my clothes stank badly every time I sit inside.\n\nBut bad thing about sitting outside is that there is no aircon, it was really stuffy and warm. Apart from that, experiences were good.",

The coffee, kaya toast, peanut butter, and butter toast are simply delicious. We enjoyed whatever we ordered for breakfast. I would really recommend people to try out this place. Overall, we enjoyed the food and Kopi!",

Probably because itâ€™s not quite compact. But maybe its also my carrier issue. Not really sure. So if you are planning to kind of do your work there and need an internet connection, I highly suggest not seating in the corner.",
