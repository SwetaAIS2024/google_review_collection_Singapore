      "text": "Teacher Germaine is an amazing teacher who strives to understand the way my daughter learns and tailor her lessons according to her strengths and weaknesses. She truly cares and takes a keen interest in her progress. Every lesson is a joy and we can see how her love for music has blossomed over the few months with teacher Germaine. Under Germaine’s tutelage, she achieved a remarkable distinction score in her grade 5 ABRSM music theory exam within a short period of 3 months. Germaine is a highly competent, passionate and dedicated teacher that I strongly recommend for all parents who wish to develop the musical talents of their kids.",

      "text": "I have nothing but praise for Teacher Germaine! My playful 9-year old signed up for theory lessons with the aim of taking the ABRSM Grade 5 exams. Teacher Germaine is very good at assessing a student’s abilities and interests, and tailoring her lessons accordingly. She is a very effective educator and through her clear explanations, regular homework feedback, and encouragement, my son was able to obtain a distinction in his theory exam. Thank you Teacher Germaine for your dedication and hard work!",

She was very patient and her methodical approach meant he could cover a significant amount of material within quite a short period of time. She was engaging and explained concepts well. He thoroughly enjoyed her lessons.\nAdditionally, she provided me with regular updates about his progress and this open communication meant we could better support him to achieve his goals.",

      "text": "Ms Germaine helped both my sons prepare for grade 5 theory exams, where they scored distinctions. Thereafter, she taught my older boy piano, and he just recently obtained a Merit grade for ABRSM grade 8 exam, despite a demanding academic schedule. She is currently teaching my younger son (who plays violin) aural, sight reading, and grade 6 theory. He enjoys his weekly lessons, and looks forward to them. Ms Germaine is a very knowledgeable, experienced and caring teacher, who is passionate about building up a good musical foundation in her students. If you're looking for a teacher for music theory, aural, sight reading and piano, we highly recommend her.",
