      "text": "Absolutely destroyed by this KBBQ buffet. Each person was around $30, and we have around 2 hours to dine in. We got almost everything in the menu and we are completely done after 1 round. Yes, everything is free flow but can your stomach handle it? Recommend you to starve yourself 2 days in advance to attempt this buffet. Food wise, if you can eat both pork and beef, I would recommend the beef slices as they are nicer and more substantial. On a Wednesday night there’s only a few people in the restaurant so we could sit from 6-9pm. Only one staff to serve the dishes but it’s enough for non peak days.",

Even though I made mistakes when ordering they were very nice to help me. The buffet comes w free ice cream too. Happy to dine here! Will be back again! :)\n\n(There are lots of kbbqs on this street but I like this one best)",

Sweet and spicy with lots of onions and leek with tender pork slices. We love their egg roll as well. So homely made. However skip their jamppong. Not tasty and noodles are soggy. This was their minus point with food service a little slower than expected. Probably most customers would go for their bbq buffet.",
