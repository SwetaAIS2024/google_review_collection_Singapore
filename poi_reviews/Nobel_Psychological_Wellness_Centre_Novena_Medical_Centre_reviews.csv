D W,1,"Nothing to complain about wrt the doctors, but the reception staff are a mess.

One person is professional, helpful, and competent. The other will do almost anything to avoid work, and is unable to even make any appointments without having to hang up and get her colleague to call you back",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101559032317058036445/reviews
W L,1,"I had a bad experience with this clinic. I am covered and have clarified with my insurance provider that no payment is required upfront. However, upon arriving at the clinic, I was told that I will need to pay out of pocket unless I have a referral letter from a general practitioner. This was NOT communicated to me beforehand but they insisted they did. They did not want to acknowledge a mistake made on their part and there was no apology for the inconvenience caused. I walked out despite waiting weeks for my appointment.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113644688398595637574/reviews

Pav Spacewalker,5,"Dr Zheng is one of the loveliest and most helpful doctors I have met. I have severe manic bi-polar and she helped me manage my symptoms and reintegrate myself into society as a more confident and positively social individual. Dealing with this illness is one of the hardest things I have ever had to manage. I am so glad I met someone who truly understands the person not the illness and is able to provide sound, practical, emotional and beneficial advice. Thank you Dr Zheng, I will never forget the times you were there for me. I highly recommend Dr Zheng for mood disorders and would advice anyone seeking help to give her a chance as she is unlike any psychiatrist I have met in Singapore.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105153897210918042297/reviews
