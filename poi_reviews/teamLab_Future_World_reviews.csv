Taz Tatt,4,"A Fun and Immersive Digital Experience ‚Äì teamLab Future World, Singapore

Visiting teamLab Future World was such a delightful and engaging experience. The digital art installations are visually stunning, interactive, and truly immersive ‚Äî perfect for children, adults, and families alike. The space is very kid-friendly and encourages creativity and exploration.

One of the highlights for me was the activity where you draw your own sea creature, scan it, and then watch it come to life on the big screen, swimming among other sea creatures created by visitors. It was such a simple but magical moment ‚Äî seeing your own artwork animated and part of a shared digital ocean was incredibly fun and satisfying.

The overall graphics and lighting effects throughout the exhibition were impressive and captivating. It‚Äôs the kind of experience that sparks curiosity and wonder, regardless of age.

That said, I did find the staff to be a bit overly strict at times, which occasionally disrupted the flow of the experience and slightly cut the mood. A bit more warmth or flexibility would have made the visit feel even more welcoming.

Still, I‚Äôd highly recommend teamLab Future World for anyone looking for a unique, interactive, and visually beautiful outing in Singapore.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106252418632801929289/reviews

daddydrives,5,"üíê A Touch of Japan in Singapore

Stepping into teamLab Future World at the ArtScience Museum instantly brought back memories of our time in Japan‚Äîimmersive art, vibrant colors, and a sense of endless wonder. üå∏‚ú® This interactive digital wonderland truly captures the magic of where art meets science, creating an experience that‚Äôs both visually stunning and thought-provoking.

From the moment we entered, we were surrounded by ever-changing digital landscapes that responded to our movements. The vibrant floral displays, cascading waterfalls, and glowing light installations made us feel like we had stepped into another world. Our kids were especially captivated by the interactive elements‚Äîchasing digital butterflies, watching their drawings come to life on the walls, and exploring rooms filled with shimmering lights. It was pure joy to see their excitement as they engaged with the exhibits.

Beyond the visual spectacle, the exhibition also sparked curiosity and creativity. Each installation invited us to explore the relationship between nature, technology, and human interaction. The seamless blend of art and science made it a fascinating experience for both adults and kids, offering something new to discover at every turn.

Located at Marina Bay Sands, the ArtScience Museum is easily accessible and perfect for a family day out. If you‚Äôre in Singapore, teamLab Future World is a must-visit‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre seeking inspiration, interactive fun, or simply a moment of wonder.

Chee Yau,3,"The Future Worlds exhibition is looking a little dated now. I remember seeing Team Labs digital art about 7 years ago in London and this exhibition isnt showcasing anything new or innovative. A few of the installations seem to be designed for a younger audience so may not appeal if you don‚Äôt have children. Also, having children screaming, shouting and running around the space ruins the atmosphere on some of the art work on display. Maybe they could arrange time slots where it‚Äôs for adults only.
