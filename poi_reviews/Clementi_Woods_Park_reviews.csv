Damcho Tshering,5,"Had a refreshing visit to Clementi Woods Park, a hidden gem filled with towering trees, shady trails, and a peaceful atmosphere. The cool breeze and chirping birds made the walk even more relaxing, offering a perfect escape from the city's fast pace. Whether it‚Äôs for a quiet stroll, some fresh air, or just to soak in the greenery, this park is a great spot to unwind. Definitely a place worth revisiting!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116833702802756994837/reviews

„É´„Éº„Ç∑„É£„ÇπLucius,3,"Very well maintained, clean and spacious. A lot of new plants being planted recent years, close to different bus stations but unfortunately not metro station, if you're driving there is car park.

Pro:
-spacious
-a lot of greenery
-there's some area that doesn't have so much traffic pollution
-most of the walkways are broad , losing chances of felony
-carpark
-if there is a arena ring, extremely convenient for whatever purpose needed

Con:
-really don't see a point building a toilet here, due to the low maintenance the smell is really putrid
-a lot of the facilities are aging, upgrade is needed",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103235381099676291640/reviews
