Jeremy Khoo,5,Great place to come try some genuine okonomiyaki with Japanese restaurant vibes. Itâ€™s a bit small and it gets crowded fast plus it doesnâ€™t take reservations so pls do come early. If you sit at the counter the okonomiyaki is cooked in front of you and the staff will ask for your preferences. Ingredients and fresh and the taste is close to the ones we had in Osaka and you can choose up to 3 toppings for free or add on more for extra money. The sides were also good especially the pork gyoza and chicken karaage. Staff were also friendly and will explain the dishes to you and recommend suggestions as well.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101975552015179312270/reviews

A.C.,5,"The food experience was the best and the most intruiging  of my whole life! They allow you to DIY your own okonomiyaki, and even put the sauce and design your own â€˜artâ€™ on it! They also offer different foods and the owner is very friendly and nice!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117664511363572188732/reviews
