When I am approaching she is listening music loud during work, she pause her music then speak very rude to me like I'm disturbing her listening music. I wanted to dropped off parcel but she told me this J&T branch is an warehouse, not accepting parcel drop off & direct me to other branch. Obviously this is an excuse she do not want to process my parcel. Very disappointing for this. Hopefully J&T management able to give me an answer for this.",

Reason: LAZY\n2nd I went and keyed in the apps, I didn't get it even though it's a simple thing..cancel but do it manually..I don't want to wrap the parcel, I don't want to tape the box either!! Cause: LAZY\nThere are 2 female staff at the counter, they are strict about eating politely at the counter.. They act like your own company.. They work like honest and LAZY.. Then they throw things at the customer loudly to show that they are satisfied.. I just reprimanded them because I have a complaint with J&T.. After this, their face goes viral on FB.. I hope J&T gets rid of people like this",
