Tin Ko Win,4,"A must visit for those who desire to do some trekking on Pulau Ubin.
This hill stands at 74 meters and offers a good vantage point of what used to be a quarry. On a clear morning, you can see the northeastern part of Singapore and parts of Johore. Good hiking shoes are recommended, as it can get slippery on a wet day. And there is definitely no way to cycle up this path.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116198990456185764576/reviews
