      "text": "Literally the worst Zi Char i have eaten in my life.  Venison meat was stir fried too quickly such that the meat did not separate. Instead we got a meat clump (see photo). Egg in the tofu hotpot was not stirred and so we got an overcooked egg instead of egg strend (see photo).\n\nService was so bad, they took the wrong order and insisted we were the one who ordered wrongly. Instead of serving the dishes when a table was freed, we were asked to accept the dishes whipped up in less than 5 minutes. Even McDonald's took longer to flip a burger.\n\nThe Malaysian chinese long haired lady is notorious for providing poor and rude service (read other reviews). It's like you owe them the business.\n\nDO NOT waste your money at this place.",

      "text": "Probably one of the worst zi char experience in Hougang. It’s a very normal and basic seafood menu but many items were not available upon ordering - standard dishes such as claypot toufu, diced chicken, kang kong, etc. We had to settle for other non-ideal options. The long beans was not fresh at all, some look spoilt and pretty tasteless. The tofu with minced meat is salty and again lack freshness. Taiwan claypot chicken could have saved the meal but the actual chicken pieces are lack quantity. Prices are overall slightly above average with shocking quality. My Beef Hor Fun order was also forgotten when there aren’t much crowd around. Unsurprisingly, the beef was super tough and the sauce was very bland. The cook made no effort at all. Staff are not attentive to customers nor friendly. No idea how they are lasting this long in the food court. Overall a disappointing experience. Last time here and please find a new tenant, Kopitiam.",
