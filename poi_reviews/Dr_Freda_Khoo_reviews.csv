Fina L,5,"I would like to express my gratitude and our heartfelt thanks to Dr Freda & her team especially Eileen, for their care throughout my pregnancy.
I trust that I was in good hands as she was really calm, assuring and patient. I loved her as my gynae, definitely would return to her if I were to have a second.
Thank you Dr Freda ",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117989942379208214665/reviews
Victoria Ng,5,"Dr Freda delivered our first baby. We had a really good experience with her, her clinic staff - Eileen and Shannon throughout the entire pregnancy and postpartum review. Dr Freda was patient, loving and precise during her consultations. Waiting time was usually quick during lunch timing slots! Overall, a very comforting experience from start to birthing process! Would recommend Dr Freda to anyone looking for a female gynae :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108817108139802915427/reviews
Pranita Purushothama,5,"Had the best experience with Dr Freda Khoo throughout my pregnancy. She is kind, caring and always recommends the best for you and the baby. We felt so calm throughout the pregnancy knowing we were in good hands. She would patiently answer all our questions and never disregarded any of the “silly”concerns we had. Even her staff Eileen and Shannon are very personable and would always greet us with a smile. Wait time can be a bit longer sometimes as she does have a lot of patients but once you’re with the Dr she never rushes you.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116018316264181363664/reviews
Wei,5,"Visited Dr. Freda for my first baby, she's very professional in planning and guiding which makes it easier for me to decide on things when required. She is also reassuring and patient in listening to my concerns. I was able to have a smooth experience due to her clear and firm advice especially at time of delivery. Shannon and Eileen at the reception are always friendly and helpful, they are also prompt in responding to my emails whenever I require assistance. Overall a very pleasant experience and will recommend to anyone who is looking for female gynae!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114717409065629977956/reviews
