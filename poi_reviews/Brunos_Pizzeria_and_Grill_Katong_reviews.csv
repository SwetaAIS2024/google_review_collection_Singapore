Charis,3,Overall food was okay.. very homely Italian place. I like the burrata the most. Ordered the crab pasta and the fish special and felt they were average. The merlot was quite good at $12 per glass. Pretty affordable.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114600726145980904216/reviews
Djohan Sutanto,4,"Only 2 waitresses serving 10 tables. Food is fantastic, tasty, sumptuous and well balance. Atmosphere is ok but noisy as space is not that big. Parking is a challenge",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118293793146713535512/reviews
david chong,4,"This place has been around for ages and ages. It’s likely a family run independent establishment hence preserving that bit of exclusivity and authenticity.
It’s a small joint. Serving Italian fair that’s well priced yet fantastic. Portions are pretty generous as well. Their pastas, pizzas and mains are good. There’s quite a good selection of off menu items written all over the blackboards on the walls that deserve a try. It’s a place that you can definitely visit when options run out.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107042046262066936048/reviews
Ankori,3,The Caesar salad was fresh and crisp. Calamari was not to my personal liking a bit chewy. Pizza was not as good as I can recall. The flavour and texture were not as good .

sethaie,5,"Had only ordered from here earlier as rumours of sub-par service had been strong.
It’s very nice to be wrong sometimes.

Service was impeccable, food was great, especially beef shoulder. Escargots could have had more salt to my taste but that was an easy fix.

Only small thing to complain was toasted bread, which was way too hard and crispy to be able to obtain the taste from cold cuts or escargots. And as bread basket instead was mouthwatering this a little strange but that’s splitting hair.

Tiramisu topped with chocolate sauce was a bit sus but given not a single atom was left behind I guess it gets my seal of approval as well.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118422232700885043987/reviews
