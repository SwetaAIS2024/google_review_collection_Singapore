Simon Y,3,"The pork chop was decent but there were so many to dislike abt the Pork Chop rice here. If you are unable to provide pearl rice, don't try to emulate it by cooking your rice soft. Using disposable utensil to break up the half-cut meat from the bone is a torture. And the large portion rice just make the pork chop looks small, especially when you are able to get from the same coffeeshop a seemingly bigger portion and boneless pork chop pairing with egg fried rice with about the same cost.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110316451866688483932/reviews
