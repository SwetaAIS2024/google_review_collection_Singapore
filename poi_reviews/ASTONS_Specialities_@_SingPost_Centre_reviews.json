      "text": "The fiery chicken is adequately spicy and tender. The herb grilled fish is well grilled at the edges and tender on the inside. It can be a bit dry. The herb gravy has no taste, the texture is similar mushroom soup. The addition of BBQ sauce to the baked beans at Astons is indeed a thoughtful touchâ€”it adds a rich, smoky-sweet flavor that elevates whatâ€™s usually a simple side dish. The baked potato, potato wedges and corn were all tasty too.",

Cos I ever ate at Swenson many years ago which my set was free and the food was not nice at all hence I always wondered is it free means they just anyhow cook? I am super particular on fish but todayâ€™s fish is an awe for me. Keep it up.",
