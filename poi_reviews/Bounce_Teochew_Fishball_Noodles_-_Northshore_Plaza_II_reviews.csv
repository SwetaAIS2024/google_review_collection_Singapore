Daren Tiang,5,"Ordered the fish ball noodles dry , sauce mix was on point and tasty. Fishballs cooked al dente , not overcooked. BOUNCY FISHBALLS.

Randy Ho,1,"The Indian or foreigner who took my order really kayu minded the on menu show kway Tiao fish ball soup $5.50 is not those ""budget meal"" but I order mi tai mak soup n the guy say I need to top up 50¢ just to change the kway Tiao to mi tai mak n that cost me $6.30 plus the container. The portion that he give me is super small. Frankly speaking I won't buy if I'm the one eating the food! Make no sense by changing the type or noodle plus only with soup want me additional 50¢ if I change to mee pok or mee Kia I nothing to say cos got add egg to make those noodles correct! The worst thing is when I get home i got scolded by my wife why I so stupid to pay such price for just 5 fishball+ noodle + soup. Shld have buy dry mee pok with the same with 5 fishball+ soup+ chilli+ mincemeat n additional container. Don't feel eating this stall in future.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110277065573364925684/reviews
