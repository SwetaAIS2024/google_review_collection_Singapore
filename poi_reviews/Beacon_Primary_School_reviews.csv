Jaime Pat,5,"I was from beacon. I absolutely enjoyed my time there and looked forward to going to school every single day. The teachers there are so kind and supportive to all students and in my opinion, they taught us well. I had teachers who went out of their way to give me one to one lessons when I was not doing so well in school. I remember the previous principal, Ms Lim. She brought light to my life every week when she tells us stories and shares with us news articles that make us smile so so so much. She was the one who also decided to install a playground in the school that we sometimes used during pe lessons and recess time. The beacon library wish filled with all sorts of fun and educational books, from Geronimo Stilton to encyclopaedias. They have a butterfly garden and a fish pond which I enjoyed visiting during my school days. Overall, I think that my best years in life were at beacon and I sometimes wish I were a kid again :(",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115130067778416629670/reviews
