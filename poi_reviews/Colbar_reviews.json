      "text": "Stepping into this place is like taking a delightful trip back in time! The old-school aesthetics, tucked away from the usual Singaporean urban sprawl, are truly interesting and create a unique atmosphere.\n\nI can definitely see why older generations would enjoy the major throwback this place offers. 😲\n\nThe abundance of well-maintained vintage decor contributes perfectly to the nostalgic and rustic vibe. The owner and service staff were also very friendly, and even the laminated menu felt authentically old-school with a surprisingly wide variety of dishes, from Western to traditional Chinese and Malaysian dishes.\n\nWe opted for the Western pork chops. While the porkiness was a bit strong, and for my liking, the accompanying sauce was excellent, as were the handmade potato wedge chips. The peas and mushrooms were satisfactory.\n\nWater is not complimentary, and they only accept cash payments – no QR codes or credit cards, so come prepared.\n\nThe price point of $14 for our pork chops felt rather expensive for the quality of the food, which I would describe as mediocre. You're definitely paying a premium for the unique environment and the overall experience.\n\nThe cleanliness and organization of the space were commendable, and the gentle breeze made for a comfortable outdoor dining experience (though sheltered). However, be warned: there were quite a lot of mosquitoes due to the outdoor setting. I highly recommend bringing mosquito repellent to fully enjoy your meal.\n\nOverall: This place scores high on its unique and well-maintained nostalgic ambience and friendly service. 👍\n\nHowever, the food quality doesn't quite match the price, and the cash-only policy and mosquito issue are significant drawbacks to consider.\n\nCome for the vibes and the trip down memory lane, but be prepared!",

The retro atmosphere adds to the experience, making it feel like a step into Singapore’s past.\n\nNow, onto the food—the Hainanese pork chop is a must-try! Crispy, tender, and covered in a flavorful sauce that hits all the right notes. The **hor fun** is another standout, with its silky smooth noodles and well-balanced gravy. Simple, nostalgic, and delicious.\n\nIf you’re looking for a place with history, character, and solid old-school eats, ColBar is definitely worth a visit!",

      "text": "Not the easiest place 📍 to get to unless you are driving 🚗🚙 but nevertheless, we made it here from Blessed Sacrament Church ⛪️ for lunch.\n\nLocation and Restaurant : If you don’t walk up to the actual front door 🚪, there is no way you are going to know that there is this coffee shop inside. It is nested at the fringing edge of the Commonwealth Forest 🌳 and from the carpark 🅿️ looking in (See my pic 📸), you can’t even make out the shape of the building.\n\nNevertheless, once you step in, you will find out that it is Nostalgic ☎️, Old School 💽 and Retro 🤖 Vibes all rolled into one! Wooden 🪵Walls, Grated Gates, Red Roof, 70-80s pictures 🎑🏞️🖼️ adorn the walls inside, weighing scales ⚖️ and lots of antiques 🏛️can be seen on the walls.\n\nFood : We ordered Beef 🥩Hor Fun, Seafood 🍤 Hor Fun, Mushroom 🍄🍄‍🟫 Soup and Hainanese Pork 🐷Chop Rice. My thoughts are, pls skip the Mushroom Soup 🥣….. It’s an instant soup, very watery and nothing to “Wah” about 😮‍💨. The beef Hor Fun was nicely done, saucy and beef well prepared. And the Hainanese Pork Chop portion is huge! ($16 and exclude rice 🍚) It was well fried outside, soft and tender inside. Went nicely with Hainanese sauce when you pour over but a point to note is the inside of the pork was not marinated 🧂and would have been tasteless if the sauce wasn’t there.\n\nIt’s an experience to dine 🍴 at the Retro Coffeeshop where time 🕰️seems to have stood still. It’s like St. John Island + Pulau Ubin rolled into one place and time just stood still. Hope the government 👨‍⚖️👩‍⚖️🧑‍⚖️ will continue to let this establishment operate as it brings back lots of memories. 📝 So, if you are looking for a fun and cool place to dine at Commonwealth, do give them a try.\n\n#retro\n#oldschool\n#timecapsule",

      "text": "The overall dining experience was average. The Hainanese pork chop was disappointing, with an acrid and greasy taste, likely due to the use of old oil. However, the prices are reasonable and comparable to other restaurants in the area. The ambiance is unique and nostalgic, with decor that transports you back to the 1970s, evoking a sense of time travel to a bygone era. The location is a plus, offering a peaceful retreat away from the hustle and bustle. One downside is the lack of modern payment options, as the restaurant only accepts cash. While this might be intentional to enhance the retro vibe, it could be inconvenient for some diners. Overall, it’s a charming spot with potential, but the food could use some improvement.",
