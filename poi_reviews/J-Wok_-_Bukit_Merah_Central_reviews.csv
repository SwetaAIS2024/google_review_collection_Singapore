Chocolatte2006,4,"Ordered the Gyu-don and Oyako-don with gyoza on the side. The gyu-don was great; Beef serving was generous and tasty. However, some pieces of beef was very slightly overcooked so was very slightly rubbery. Otherwise was still very good.
The Oyako-don was okay. Chicken and egg was slightly bland for my taste although it was just nice for my partner.
Shop was small so dine in seating is limited.
Overall was satisfied as the meal was very affordable and staff was friendly. See that the garlic fried rice is the recommended dish, will definitely come again to try it.

2nd Visit: Tried the Garlic Fried rice + Teriyaki chicken add-on; Both were amazing! The garlic fried rice was full tasty and of garlic flavor, but at the same time, well fried and not very oily. The teriyaki chicken was very succulent and flavorful too. Its no wonder most of the reviews here gush about it. Definitely a must-try if you only can try 1 dish.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101178101449329468950/reviews

Y W Tan,5,"I tried the Chicken Katsudon and Fried Gyoza for the first time, and both dishes impressed me. The Chicken Katsudon was crispy and flavorful, paired well with its savory sauce and tender rice. The Gyoza featured a perfect crispy exterior with a juicy filling. While I can't say if these are the best they offer, they definitely made me want to return to satisfy future cravings for Japanese cuisine.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109988334660886733306/reviews
