mikei baby,5,"Highly recommended! Even though I got it as takeout and it was a bit cold, it was still absolutely delicious! The signature homemade Wagyu beef burger is a must-try â€” juicy, flavorful, and perfectly tender, not dry at all. The chicken cutlet fried rice was also fantastic â€” super fragrant with just the right portion size. Iâ€™ll definitely be coming back for more!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105594396519331076534/reviews
Joan Lui,5,"Absolutely love this western stall at Yishun! We've visited multiple times and it never disappoints. The fried chicken and chicken chop are our favourites, crispy, juicy, and so tasty!

The staff are super friendly and always make us feel welcome. Food and service are restaurant standard. Top notch! The best western food! ðŸ¤©",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102668479356815518040/reviews
Shermaine Lim,5,"Travelled down all the way from the west for this!

One of the best western I've had in a long time! Their prices are super affordable and their portions are too huge!!

I'll be back! But please open one in the west so I don't have to travel so far for this!ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Enrique N.,5,"For $7.50, this is an insane portion!

Best chicken chop i have had in awhile too. The mushroom sauce was really nice and the chicken was tender and juicy ðŸ’¯

One young guy working late at night around 1+ am, but his service was very friendly and the food came out pretty quick despite there being a few customer orders before me. He even said thank you! Not easy to find such good service in kopitiam nowadays.

Not to mention, the entire menu is affordable for the quality and portion!!

If you are in Yishun and want affordable western food, come here and try it for yourself ðŸ«¡",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117004574208108852534/reviews
