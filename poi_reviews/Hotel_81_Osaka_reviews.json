      "text": "I really wouldn’t recommend this hotel, especially for families. The service was incredibly slow—I had to ask multiple times just to get fresh towels. The bathroom smelled awful, and there were mosquitoes all over the room, which made it hard to relax.\n\nIt felt more like a love hotel. The worst part was the noise—around 3 AM, people in the room next door were \"doing it\", and it was so loud it kept me up. If you’re looking for a peaceful stay, this is definitely not the place. I won’t be coming back.",

Near a very safe, friendly and peaceful community area, it’ll be great if you can take time to walk around in the morning.\n\nThe room is kinda small, but you’re gonna wander outside around all day so perhaps it’s not a big problem. With this kind of price, I have no complain. The room is clean. Room service is always available when we ask for it.\n\nDont worry about the AC problems that other reviewers said, you can control the AC by your own in your room, no need to talk to the receptionist",

There is nothing to complain about the hotel except for the aircon which sometimes goes to temps that can't be adjust and its control by the lobby. The best point about this Hotel 81 Osaka is that they have the best friendliest staff. One staff name James always try his best to accommodate to our request. KUDOS to all the staff of Hotel 81 Osaka!!!",
