      "text": "I thoroughly enjoy indulging in the thunder tea rice at this stall. Despite being a loyal customer for years, I realized I hadn't left a review until now. It's my top choice for Lei Cha rice! The fried niang tofu with minced pork is exceptional. Although, on my visit yesterday, they only had vegetable pancakes left. Surprisingly, it turned out to be delicious and crispy. Pairing it with the diverse assortment of vegetables on the rice made for a delightful combination. The thunder tea itself was amazing‚Äîslurped it up and loved every drop!",

      "text": "Update price went up again. Now it is $5. But size seems to be more as well. Tea js gery savory as always\n\nUpdate\nPrice went up to $4.50. but still very value for money. Definitely not thirsty yet cha is super flavorful.\n\nPeanut is optional so good food those allergy to peanut. But I wonder if it is peanut or seasame in the cha.\n\n~~~~~\n\nIt cost $4.\n\nAs a whole it is greater than sum of its parts. For uncultured swine it means individually part of the meal is pretty ordinary but together they just work in a very comfort meal kind of manner.\n\nHowever how to eat this? Pour the tea over or dip it? I choose the later. But disclaimer the tea/soup actually feel quite msg but they claim not to be using. Nevertheless salty though acceptable for me if I go with either of the above method of consumption.\n\nIndividually nothing special, if u don't like onion perhaps u need to ask them not to add? I am fine with it though. Peanuts add the crunch and it wasn't tiring for the jaw. Overall fantastic... Why is there no queue for this? All drawn to the $2.20 fried bee hoon?\n\nThe only disappointment is where is the ah mo... Was expecting an 80 years old grandma to be there... None in sight... Gutted.",
