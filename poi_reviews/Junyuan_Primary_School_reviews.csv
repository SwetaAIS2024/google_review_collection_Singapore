Gibran Sahir,1,"im currently 24 years old and i still think about all the awful memories i have of this place, back when the internet wasn‚Äôt really a place for voicing out issues. i think its time to voice out concerns, im not too sure if the same teachers that i had are still teaching here but i hope they are not and if they are i hope that they change. ive been physically and mentally abused by the teachers in this school especially by a teacher called Mr Jaya. i believe that educating children should not be taught with pain and violence, he has hit me with a ruler, smacked a book on my head, slapped my hand, pulled my sideburns, etc. i was always slow at learning and he has always been making me as a bad example in my class back then which has traumatised me till this day. it is not just him but as well as the other teachers as they are aware but choose to be silent about this. they have all watched me go through this and have never supported or care about me. i hope that people know, children are the future of the world and should be educated with compassion and empathy. my whole life my parents have not once raised their hands on me, so how can teachers do so?",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103408967103867306050/reviews
stream armageddon,1,"the kids ALWAYS yap and scream on the bus when i want to take a peaceful ride home. the MOMENT they get on the bus they start creating ruckus and also talk about inappropriate topics. most of them have no public transport etiquette whatsoever, not willing to quieten down even when there are people VISIBLY UPSET with them. after a long day of work or school, we of course want to rest lah but we cant relax cause of the junyuan kids. they run around the upper deck and not only is it dangerous but also incredibly distracting and annoying for other commuters, please teach ur students how to properly behave on public transport. they are immature to say the least, unfortunately i didnt have a chance to look at the name tags and rmb some names.. its not just a one or two time thing, its EVERY single time i take that specific bus. No improvement made whatsoever.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108540462890780059838/reviews
