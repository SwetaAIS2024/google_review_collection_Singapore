      "text": "Initially came down to pick up FOC Miffy bowls but was greeted by a vintage curated store of sort! It was as if I was walking right through my childhood ‚Äî I noticed lots of iconic characters from my younger days. As I looked through the store, it really unlocked old memories from the past ‚Äî be it Mcdonald‚Äôs Happy Meal Toys, watching Cartoon Network, playing Pokemon, Love&Berry etc.\n\nIf I had to describe this place it‚Äôll be extremely nostalgic, homey and heartwarming. From the placement of all the trinkets/toys to the welcoming owners (shoutout to Nat). Nat seems to know the place inside out too as she could identify where certain Miffy stuff were in the store-full of curated vintage toys.\n\nIt was so kind of the owners to give me FOC Miffy bowls and I came out of the store with some gems too! An unexpected find on Carousell led me to something even bigger ü•π I‚Äôm so sad that they‚Äôre closing down as I only got to know of this gem of a place right now but I‚Äôm truly lucky to have visited once before they relocate to Thailand/Japan.\n\nI‚Äôll catch you guys in Thailand when you open up üáπüá≠üëãüèª Thank you for opening a treasure trove, it is truly a hidden gem. üíé",

      "text": "Ever since I was a kid, I've always had dreams where I would walk into a store, one that had all of the old, weird Japanese stuff that I adore, but couldn't get in America. That dream came alive here, I had to stop myself from buying so much stuff! And beyond the items, the experience felt very personal, welcoming, and safe. I highly recommend Thrifteyseconds to anybody who loves vintage aesthetics, to live the childhood fantasy of being a kid with money, and to finally find Bomberman figures! üòÇüíñ",
