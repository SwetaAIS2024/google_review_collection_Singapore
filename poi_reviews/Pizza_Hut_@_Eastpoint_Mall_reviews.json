Really hope that the restaurant can clean the fabric seats as the seats are just too gross, too dirty with stain marks and spots that we actually had to place a tissue paper (the one provided in the cutlery box) on the seat to sit on.\n\nUpdates on 3/2/25: Sent my feedback via the link provided below as requested.",
