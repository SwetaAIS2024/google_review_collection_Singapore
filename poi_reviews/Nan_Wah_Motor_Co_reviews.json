      "text": "Crazy expensive and dishonest. Took about a week to get my bike and gave me a shock when he quoted me the final price including “labour”. Wouldn’t mind paying but the lack of transparency and honesty is disappointing. If I was told the ACTUAL price BEFORE the job, would have definitely gone elsewhere. Quoted me one price prior to servicing, and charged me twice the quoted amount AFTER servicing the bike, saying it was the labour charge. Initially was told that the quoted amount was inclusive of labour. Upon picking up the bike, was told there was an additional labour charge which essentially amounted in me paying double the quoted amount. Lol.\nOh well, lesson learnt. Pick your workshops wisely. Go somewhere else. Cheers.",
