      "text": "Top notch Mutton Briyani $6.50 is a must and worth a drive from any part of Singapore.\n\nShopfront looks unassuming but the taste is super.\n\nAvailable from 11am Mon-Fri only.\n\nTasty wet style rice even without adding on the gravy. But yet it's just very slightly oily only. Very balanced 5/5\n\nVery flavourful and tender mutton ribs 5/5. Surprised at the excellent quality and generous portion!\n\nFriendly and cheerful Indian couple running the show...\n\nHygienic no flies 5/5. Good quality non greasy cutlery with no sharp edges.\n\nAmple outdoor parking directly infront of the stall. Slightly remote but pleasant breezy location on a hilltop in Mandai. Just follow Google maps...\n\nSo tasty I have to come again next week! Better than all the famous stalls in Singapore, JB and Batu Pahat Johore....",
