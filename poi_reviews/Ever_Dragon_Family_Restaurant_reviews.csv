Helen Vu,1,"Food quality dropped badly recently. Bad service. Don’t order the signature grilled sotong, very salty. When we feedback about the salty food, the waitress said it is normal like that. Won’t never come back again. Expensive, bad quality and poor service!!!!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101685739852342585612/reviews

Stephanie Ong,5,"My dad brought me here for a quick breakfast.  Ordered wanton noodles.  Very simple and delicious meal that cost $5, which to me is reasonable.   Noodles texture not too al dente and not too soft.  Char siew was nice and tender.  Wantons are big, juicy and delicious.

Would come back again.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100397174187969036484/reviews
Jayon See,5,"I speak only for the dish I've tried, which is the Roasted Duck Drumstick Noodle.
Roasted Duck is just amazing, meat is tender and the skin is super good. The amount of fat in the duck is perfect.
Noodles are also springy and tasty. I would definitely revisit for other dishes as well.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116724448114310213003/reviews
