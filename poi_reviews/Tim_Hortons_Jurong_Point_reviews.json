Hope the management could put a time limit like Starbucks or stop students from using the space and be mindful for others too. Be gracious  society not a selfish one. Thank youüôèüèΩ",

Go to sandwich is pesto chicken, though this time it seemed a bit light on the chicken.\n\nHighly recommend the double double (with skim mill for the weight conscious, traditionally this is served with cream).\n\nThe coffee won't impress the connossoirs, but it's the taste I grew up with and nice to see they haven't tried to 'elevate it'.",
