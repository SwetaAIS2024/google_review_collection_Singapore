S P,5,"I had such a wonderful experience at this café! As I was walking to my seat, I accidentally spilled my drinks, but the staff was incredibly kind and understanding. @Grace, @Charmaine, and @Faisal immediately reassured me that it was okay and quickly cleaned everything up with a smile. Their warm and thoughtful service truly made my day. On top of that, they even remade my drinks without hesitation, which I deeply appreciate. Exceptional customer service like this deserves to be recognized! Thank you again for your kindness. I’ll definitely be coming back! :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105711552996909024405/reviews
M L,5,"Among the many coffee vendors in Millennia Walk, this is still our favorite. The coffee is great, the staffs are so friendly and the sitting area on the overhead is airy, not crowded.

I had the Columbia decaf (bean came from Common Man Roasters) in a flat white and all the Columbia signature notes are there in a nice cohesive balance. Yum. Thanks barista!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103187261271244782117/reviews
Mun Kew Leong,4,"I've been getting the coffee here for a few years now but usually just takeaway. Sitting down for a change so doing a review.

The beans are from Common Man Coffee Roasters but the baristas here so a good job. My wife got a decaf flat white using Colombian Risaralda (see pic) and I got a normal double shot flat white with their Lucky Basterd beans.

The decaf had a good body and the Colombian characteristics are evident. Good taste and complexity for a decaf. The Lucky Basterd starts with more floral and citrus flavours and had a nice complexity. Body was decent but the length faded very quickly.

Overall, the coffee is still great. The seating are on these two bridges spanning the mall below. Comfy seats and good to relax. We'll come back.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107424005787229475559/reviews
Josh Lim,5,"My buddy says their coffee is good and I fully agree. It’s strong and fragrant and I really liked it. We shared a carrot cake and an almond croissant. Both are really nice. The seating area is rather limited though. Thankfully someone left, otherwise we would have gone somewhere else",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100606910212221946176/reviews

The friendly staff went to look for a table space for me as I am alone and can’t really leave my bag around to Chope a seat. So thoughtful of them.

Ordered the cake set and went for a hot mocha and speculoos cheese cake. The coffee was intense and tasted of what a great mocha should have. The cheesecake on the other hand is passible- nothing to scream about but nothing to fault either.

If there is one thing to wish for, I hope that the outdoor aircon is a little cooler though. I guess that’s because the afternoon is really hot outside when I arrived.

Overall a great place to chill for an hour or 2 in a quiet mall.
