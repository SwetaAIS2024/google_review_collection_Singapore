There are 2 types of Indomie.\n1st is the normal indomie.\n2nd is the samyang indomie. (very spicy)\nThe indomie is slightly overcooked. But i love my indomie to be that texture. Overall decent, would return again.",

The taste they create here is seriously nicer than how I made it. No kidding. It is slightly wet and not soggy.\n\nPair with wantan and ebi-fry, add on chicken seaweed and with their spicy sauce..totally bomb. They even have cracker on the side. What more could you ask..\n\nHopefully many will try this place.\n\nPs: they even have dendeng indomie and satay in cup...",

The food is ok for it's price.\n\nBad: Service needs to be improved. The one serving will always have an attitude.\n\nUgly: this is the umpteen times that after ordering the \"Mee Rebus Satay\" and paying for it, they will give you mutton instead of what you requested for. The guy will say all the satay is available to choose, but once you pay, he will claim that there is only mutton left.\n\nRidiculous.",
