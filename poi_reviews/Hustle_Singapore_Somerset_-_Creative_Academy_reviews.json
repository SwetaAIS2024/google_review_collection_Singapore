      "text": "I joined a 3-day videography course starting today and was quite shocked by the setup. The course is conducted right at the main entrance of the school, where the reception area is busy with people registering, talking, and constantly walking in and out. There’s also a lot of movement with people getting coffee or going to the restroom, which is very distracting.\n\nWhile the trainer is excellent and highly skilled, the arrangement is very disappointing. Without a proper classroom, it’s challenging to stay focused and fully concentrate on the course. I hope the management can improve the learning environment for future participants.",

Jason Wong was a knowledgeable and engaging trainer who explained complex editing techniques in a clear, beginner-friendly way. His real-world tips on shooting with mobile devices were especially useful. I’m walking away feeling much more confident about creating quality video content. A bit more time for practice during the sessions would have made it a 6 star experience!",
