Leon Kwang,5,"Viets are really good with their coffee ‚òïÔ∏è and there's been a wave of such coffee offerings across hawker centres in Singapore.. which i think is giving the ""traditional coffee shops"" (those selling cold/ can drinks & beer type) a proper run for their money.

This salted ice coffee is not the level in Vietnam but is more than competent here in Singapore .. my kopi-c kosong was also very enjoyable, fantastic balance. I think i can have another right away.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116326892362989736040/reviews
