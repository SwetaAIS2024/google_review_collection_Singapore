Chow Wen Jie,5,"Very good bread fully filled with fresh cream and nuts, baked daily in the morning, with very good price, cheaper than breadtalk. Compare to most cafe selling bread easily at 6-7 dollars, I obviously preferred their bread better. Aircon indoor seats available if you preferred to dine in. Coffee is also up to cafe standard with decent price. Friendly & helpful shop owner. :) Hope more people to visit here. I haven't found a cafe with good bread and decent price for a long while. Feel so happy to have one around this neighbourhood.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113409117704089734400/reviews

Leong,4,"Air con, fast service, tasty soft bread and decent coffee. Had the fruits and nuts bread and it was good but can do with more cream so it doesn't taste a bit dry. Bun + black coffee costs $7.50 and good value for a coffee break with air con environment.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103245425383323064898/reviews
SY LS,5,"Tried their orange peel and cheese bread and it was DELICIOUS! Bread was light and fluffy and although it sounded weird at first I was pleasantly surprised at how well it all worked together. Owner was also very welcoming and very enthusiastic in introducing to us what she recommended. Atmosphere was also very clean and calm, with good ambiance. Overall will definitely revisit and try many of their other goods!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114346061568690918808/reviews
