Shan Leong,3,"Is located at Eastcoast lagoon hawker, the chicken wings was quite normal. Didn‚Äôt give me the wow feeling, but at that this type of local hawker center is a place where you will want to have some BBQ chicken wings and satay. To me I prefer the pork satay, the taste was nice and well marinated. It got abit of the fats with some burnt taste. üòã. But I don‚Äôt really like the mutton satay. Too hard‚Ä¶ But in the evening is difficult to find parking. As for overseas friend, which I think may have a lot of tourists will visit this place. Go ahead and try. Is a local delicacy.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113138367268114769094/reviews

Wee Peng,5,"The bbq spring chicken was delicious. After reading the review about waiting time. I asked the seller how long was it and turned out to be just 15 mins and I went for it. And it was delicious. Well marinated, spring chicken was juicy. Chilli sauce was well done and not too spicy and sharp. Will buy again and check waiting time in advance.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105415708366200818398/reviews
