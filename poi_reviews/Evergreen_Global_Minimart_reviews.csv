Leonard Leong,5,Friendly owner and goes the extra mile to get what i needed.

Hannah,5,Compact minimart that has most basic necessities in stock. Love that they sell eggs here because I’m always running out of eggs. Store accepts most QR / Paynow payment methods which is wonderful because I’m always out of cash too. Opens later than most convenient stores.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105678768144129608031/reviews
