Totally amazing!  ðŸ¤©.\n\nHighly recommended to start of with a trial lesson to find out more about their lessons which I did.  Definitely will have a fruitful and wonderful time.",

      "text": "Raelynn had the opportunity to attend a free trial at The Living Lab where she learnt about aquatic animals. The experience was hands-on and interesting for a 4yo. She enjoyed herself thoroughly from the ice breaking catch bubble game, using the magnifying glass to explore real fishes and finally learning the life cycle of fishes. It's a great exposure for science to create that curious mind and explorative nature. Highly recommend to parents who are keen to allow their kids to explore nature without compromising on safety.\n\nOh, they also have kids sink at the washroom bay which was a very nice touch. Not forgetting the playground greeting you at the entrance.",
