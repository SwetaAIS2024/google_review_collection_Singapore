Yang Ll,1,"very warm and too packed after renovation (not elder-friendly due to cramp walkways). aglio olio was olio e olio (oh no!)... felt nauseous after the meal and didn't even finish the pasta.

pastries were ""warmed up"" but still cold despite asking for extra toasting time; this has consistently been an issue over the years and has not improved despite feedback to management (we don't want to be given free things for bad experiences, we want to help you improve an old brand from childhood...).

better alternatives downstairs.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103525635954616463663/reviews
aqilahdrake,3,"I wish they could review the prices because it’s rather expensive for what it is. my croissant + black coffee was $11.90 and that’s a promo price. good as a light snack, but not very filling. felt like it should be 8.90 or 9.90.

although i used to love Delifrance, i would come here more often if the prices make sense. you get better value for money at subway or paris baguette.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117828736363403695017/reviews
Bryan Chan,1,"Had a very disappointing experience here. I was queuing up by the pastry fridge outside the shop for a good 15 minutes, right in front of an elderly person. I was patient at first as I understood there seemed to be a large Grab order. But what triggered me the most was that no one took the initiative to direct us to the counter to order. Instead, they prioritized walk-in customers at the counter and completely ignored us. No apology was given, and to make things worse, the staff showed us a black face as if we were the ones at fault. Ended up walking away — extremely poor service and very disappointing.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106699352305051100210/reviews
Pamelo Bee,2,"Besides the newly renovated outlet, everything else needs to improve! Been eating Delifrance since young age for many years and must say their standard/food quality dropped significantly despite the increase in price over the years. And the counter staff need to be more pleasant with customers instead of being grumpy. Will be better if they improve their service. Especially at this outlet (NUH) where the customers mostly are hospital staff and patients who seek some comfort in food despite their illness.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107532547359122431144/reviews
T M L,4,"Food is fairly good and items heated up after order. The staff at the counter are friendly. Big mugs of coffee and hearty pastries. They have various combos for savings if you come at certain times.
The seating area is self-serve and can sit as long as you like, but perhaps not given as much attention in terms of cleaning.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102593754539610261264/reviews
