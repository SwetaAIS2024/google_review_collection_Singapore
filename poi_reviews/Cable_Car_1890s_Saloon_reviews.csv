Raul Benjamin Libunao,5,"The restaurant's beginnings of Sunday afternoon was slow, with only one table occupies. We were greeted and seated immediately with the accomodating server.

We ordered two of their 10 SGD Sunday Promo Pizzas: one 4 Cheese Pizza and the other Chilli & Sausage Pizza. Total came to 24 SGD (inclusive of 10% service charge and 9% G.S.T.). Serving time was eighteen minutes from the moment we placed our order.

Both pizzas taste great, with the Chilli & Sausage Pizza having a kick in spice, but I would call this expensive, as all the restaurants in the area.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117337029462221719046/reviews
Dru Lu,5,"I love how this place is rated so low on google. It‚Äôs got cold beer at reasonable price for orchard, it‚Äôs got a fairly quiet and comfortable environment, it‚Äôs got a decent selection of hard liquor (not expansive), it‚Äôs got izakaya food???? That‚Äôs weird for a pub. But it does checks all the marks for neighbourhood watering hole. The beer is poured well and cold.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115927493800245457440/reviews
Dylan (The Cool Dude),5,"Nestled in the vibrant heart of downtown Orchard, Cable Car 1890‚Äôs Saloon seamlessly blends the elegance of classic cocktails with the artistry of Japanese cuisine. This chic establishment offers an inviting ambiance perfect for both intimate evenings and lively gatherings.

Upon entering, you're greeted by a chic, classic interior with subtle English influences‚Äîthink soft lighting, woody decor, and a warm, inviting atmosphere. The bar boasts an impressive selection of spirits, with a particular emphasis on whiskey and beer. Their skilled mixologists craft timeless cocktails like the Highball and Negroni with meticulous attention to detail, while also offering innovative creations that tantalize the palate. They also make alcohol free cocktail like the Gunner.

The culinary experience is equally exceptional. The menu features an array of Japanese delights, from delicately prepared sashimi and sushi rolls to heartier dishes like tempura and yakitori. Each dish is a testament to the chef's expertise, with fresh ingredients and traditional techniques taking center stage.

Whether you're savoring a perfectly balanced cocktail or indulging in exquisite Japanese fare, Cable Car 1890‚Äôs Saloon delivers an unforgettable dining experience. It's a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy the best of both worlds in downtown Orchard.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114322867736248245242/reviews
