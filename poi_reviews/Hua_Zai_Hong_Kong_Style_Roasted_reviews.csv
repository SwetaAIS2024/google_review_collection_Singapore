Darren,5,"My go to lunch spot. Standard order: Chicken rice for $2.50, and the portion is decent so it's really value for money! Their rice is fragrant and delicious, and I love that they provide self serve soup which you can try to dig out cabbages, corns, and even bak kut.

Right now they're having a promo, one chicken rice for $1. My photo is for two portions of it but less rice. Go go go!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116771157599704611382/reviews
KW Yoke,5,"Updates: stall assistant was really nice and gave me more veggie and radish in the soup after I requested!!!

This was so good, hua zai is quite consistent across its branches I feel.

The smoked duck rice is on discount, just 3 bucks right now.
I added charsiew with plenty of sauce, super fragrant, one of the best sauces I tried at 烧腊 places.

I loved their radish soup also, and the radish was cooked so soft and also absorbed the soup, super tasty.

Can see myself frequenting this branch.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101653153694763341697/reviews
Wiborski M,3,"I use to enjoy having 烧腊 here. But recently, the standard for this outlet seems to have dropped.  My wife was with my son and she bought him a packet of char siew rice with soy sauce chicken add-on. She has specifically mentioned that it's for my son and prefer lean meat. When she went home, she realized that the char siew is almost 80% fats then lean meat and the chicken is close to meatless mostly rib bones. This is the 3rd encounter for us, as the previous purchase, we have given the benefits of a doubt that some days they may not be getting good supply. But then again, it shouldn't always be every time when we patronize their shop..",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100639725394450553857/reviews
thanksforpayingme,1,"Seldom give bad review to food but this is just ridiculous
Firstly I have ate a ton of roast pork rice in my life since I was young , I’ve seen some with some fat meat here and there, it’s fully fine and normal .

But for this place The pork is all fat meat making the whole pack of rice unbeatable unless you wanna go to the hospital to wash your kidney after eating .

For the cook preparing . Please have some self conscious,  do you even check the food before packing , this is morally
Not right to sell such garbage.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108551851840072868910/reviews
Joanne Lim,5,"Midweek during this pandemic, I used to feel sad and unhappy and tired — but after ordering half a duck on Grab 2-3 times every month for the last year, my mood has improved greatly (despite the corresponding increase in cholesterol levels). Because I love this magical duck.

It always comes with extra sauce, so that you can reheat and eat the duck the next day. The meat is herby, salty and addictive.  Packaging has greatly improved with spill-proof containers.

On the rare occasion that I travel down to this stall, I found the staff soft-spoken, thoughtful and considerate.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114417143774761772673/reviews
