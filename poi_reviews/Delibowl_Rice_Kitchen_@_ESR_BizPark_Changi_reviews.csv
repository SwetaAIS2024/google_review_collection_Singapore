Sharif Sha,5,"Visited on a weekend so no crowd at all. Staff were very helpful. Ordered the cumin beef. Tender hot spicy. Wonderful. Mapo tofu was also a good choice. Fried eggplant was good, could be better if it's a little less sweet.  Overall an enjoyable dine in.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104069398826869388454/reviews
Adam Leong,5,"There's food for all ages (Shiok Burger is just next door) and palates. Fast to cook, good to eat. Service staff are cordial. Place is clean. Plenty of seats. What's not to like?!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118235569510621853611/reviews
Andrew Jamito,5,"After a gym session, I gave Delibowl a try—and what a pleasant surprise! The Stewed Beef Brisket with Tomato Set Meal ($15.15) was a standout: tender beef, perfectly cooked potatoes, and a refreshing cucumber side. It’s like a Filipino caldereta without the extras but just as delicious.

I also loved the Fried Potato, Eggplant, and Long Bean ($7.70)—a well-seasoned, hearty dish where the veggies were cooked to perfection.

Prices are fair, portions are generous, and the food is surprisingly good for such a quiet spot. Just remember it’s self-service—clean as you go! Definitely worth a visit.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109609425072681151365/reviews
Muhamad Khan,5,"It's been quite long since I tasted halal Chinese food and this was really delicious.

Being vegeterian I ordered the fried potato eggplant and long bean dish along with cold mix cucumber with 3 rice. Not to forget they provided free soup to go along as well.

Will definitely be a regular here thank you Delibowl!!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113711134157533776424/reviews
Julian Chow,4,"Tried the sour fish soup.  The soup had plenty of vegetables and garnishes to provide a refreshing crunch to complement the slices of fish steeped in the sour soup base.

The soup is a tad on the spicy side but I presume this is the standard for this restaurant with a stable of mala spicy dishes.

The ordering was smooth via the table-specific QR codes. The service was also very quick.  Hallmarks of efficient management.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114457626465323361622/reviews
