Hupgee Goh,1,"It was a very bad experience. On the second day of my visit, I was told that the numbers had been allocated. I came back tomorrow morning. When I came to queue at 8.50am the next morning, I was told that there were no more numbers. I ignored him and continued to queue, but I was cut in line.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116616993751469560829/reviews
Jiajunx Lim,1,"This work efficiency is not only poor but also poor
I really have nothing to say
No matter where you go, the room is the same
The attitude is extremely bad. It takes a whole day to open an account. How big is this bank?
How many counters do you have to change to open an account and get a card? ! ! ! Your time is time, but other people’s time is not time? ?",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110663792448649169545/reviews
Fang Liu,1,"I arrived at 8 o'clock in the morning, and the number was queued until 1:30. The processing basically did not follow the time schedule. It depends on who occupied the stool earlier. I took the number at 1:30, and when I arrived at 1 o'clock, I asked the staff, and the staff said that the number was only processed at 1 o'clock. The people who queued up at two o'clock are almost in, but I'm still sitting on a stool waiting. I don't understand what the time you gave me is for?",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110959285408896773335/reviews
龙龙,1,The work efficiency is so poor. This is the only place on the island where you can handle business. There are too many people and you can’t even get a number. You have to go to the queue at seven o’clock in the morning. This is the most troublesome place in Singapore to do business.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105589332849872994328/reviews
gang sun,3,"The business hours are Monday to Friday 8:30-16:30 and Saturday 8:30-13:00. About four to five hundred people can handle business every day, so it is best to queue up before 7:30 to get the number. Passport and permit are required.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110663961183943170101/reviews
