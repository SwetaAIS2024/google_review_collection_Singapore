      "text": "I really like this quaint toilet. For a cyclist, this restroom is conveniently situated between T4, Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal and ECP.\n\nNote that there is NO potable water here (so no sink) but there is toilet paper. As a cyclist, I just use some of my bottled water to wash my hands!\n\nThere are two gender-neutral restrooms, both catering to those with physical disabilities. These are wide and spacious enough that I bring my bicycle in with me when I need to use the facilities.\n\nThe toilets have lights and they were on when I went about 7am.\n\nNext to the restrooms is a vending machine with drinks, plastes, small towel, etc. If there was a water cooler here, I would definitely not stop by NSRCC's any more!\n\nThe restroom is located next to a wide canal opening into the sea and there is a small area to park bicycles and even take a wade!",
