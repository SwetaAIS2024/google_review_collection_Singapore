Free but limited parking on site, but visitors clear quite fast. Btw they changed name to Soon Soon?",

They are also famous for their braised pork belly. Unfortunately, the vegetables they cook are too oily including their fried eggs. Car park is small and limited hence it's a challenge to eat there if u drive. Not convenient for handicapped as it is a very old coffee shop, it doesn't come equipped with handicapped parking lot nor path.",
