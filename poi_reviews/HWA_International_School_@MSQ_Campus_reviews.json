      "text": "HWA INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL is located in the most central area of Singapore, which is home to the financial center, cultural center, and tourism center. It is adjacent to the F1 racetrack and has the quickest access to the seaside. Therefore, studying here allows one to experience the rich national characteristics of Singapore and the convenience of multicultural exchanges where people from all over the world gather. HWA provides an education philosophy that keeps pace with the times, and my child can learn many realities here that cannot be experienced from textbooks. This is what we often say, reading thousands of books is not as good as traveling thousands of miles, and practice is the ultimate goal of learning. HWA offers an excellent team of teachers who will tailor the best learning plan for my child, allowing them to start from their own interests and love learning from the heart. HWA also has multiple campuses, providing a comfortable classroom environment for students of different ages. Most importantly, I feel that the team of HWA school is dedicated to education, and this lifelong career philosophy is the source of the school's long-term progress. For those interested in understanding Singapore's education and receiving education in Singapore, I highly recommend it.",
