Joan Phua,5,"It was a wonderful and stress-free experience engaging Free Movement Sewing for my daughterâ€™s first romantic tutu! The team was responsive and even had YouTube video to help us take accurate measurements.

The end result of the tutu has exceeded our expectations. Not only does the tutu turned out gorgeous, the material used is also very comfortable! Not only that, they were efficient and delivered the tutu earlier than expected! The fitting at the studio also went smoothly. Sandra was really friendly and took time to walk us through the things to take note.

Once again, thank you Sandra for the amazing tutu!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101249221894386917455/reviews

Suwanti Tan,5,"We are so glad to be recommended to Free Movement for our one-stop solution to transform our little girl's bedroom into her personal mini studio.

Glad that the whole team including the installation guys was so friendly and fitted everything for us perfectly just like what we wanted.

Patient with our requests of finding the perfect colors for the barre and mat flooring. As well as our 10000 different requests for mirror installation.

Thank you, Team!!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110312389651741504702/reviews
