Sharina Bynes,4,"Great cafe; nice and neat w some cafe vibes. Staff were friendly. Had the chili crab and salmon brown butter pasta and while they‚Äôre tasty and flavourful; it‚Äôs a bit on the sweet side for both dishes. Had an iced white and that was impeccable.

Would have preferred if utensils was placed properly with enough napkins; rather than just bunched in with 2 pieces of napkins.

Went on a weekday afternoon at 12pm and it was 70% full. Not bad for a weekday business. All the best.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112455686131891152322/reviews
Diana Su,4,"Came on a Friday afternoon. Place was quite occupied. Was raining and aircon was blasting away, pretty chilly. Ordered chilli crab pasta (a tad too sweet for me, but my aunt likes it), spring pancake and fried chicken ( my mum don't like the curry spice in the pancake, but was alright for the rest of us. Fried chicken was good thou), Brussels sprouts is a fav for everyone. Had roasted rice softserve w kinako riceball atop buttermilk waffles, it was good. Really not that sweet w diff layers of textures. Spent ard $120 plus for 3 pax.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104613634261382288996/reviews
J ‚ÄúNobita‚Äù O,5,"Food is very flavourful, hopefully not too salty or something else that will dry your throat.
Price is pricey but i think it is reasonable for the fresh ingredients.
Service is normal, i would said comparable to any good cafe.
Atmosphere is good; music not too loud, conversations among family members were good, lighting is also good.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105771351544529915239/reviews
Dillon Tan,5,"Had a pleasant visit to The Apricus Coffee & Food Co. - the food definitely stood out! The salmon brown butter pasta was well-prepared, and the fried chicken burger was juicy and flavorful. Both were enjoyable and worth recommending.

However, the beverages were just okay. The signature drink - mix berry limeade on the menu might be a hit-or-miss depending on personal preference, so it may not suit everyone‚Äôs taste.

That said, the overall experience was good, with a nice ambiance and well-cooked dishes. Would return for the food!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105540585831511095969/reviews
Annabethia,5,"The salmon brown butter linguine is absolutely delicious! The salmon skin was crispy, salmon was nicely salted. The sauce was buttery with a bit of sour to cut the creaminess.

The seafood pasta has a deep seafood scent and was generous with scallops.

The potato stack had a crispy edge and was coated in sour plum powder. It was a nice side üòã

The sticky date pudding was a nice combination of warm, with cold ice cream, sweet salted caramel sauce and crispy bits. It was a nice mix of flavours and textures.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111192356538083019275/reviews
