Andrew Ang,4,"Came here for a late lunch and had the roasted chicken riceâ€”it was amazing! The chilli sauce was delicious too. A great spot for a simple, satisfying meal.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107102294621091457763/reviews
Alvin Li,5,"Situated across the road from Bukit Gombak station, Dajie has been around for years.

I was really impressed by their mala chicken rice in the past (which is now no longer available).

Nevertheless, their chicken rice, be it roasted or white is of great taste! Don't be fooled by the facade as their menu is very extensive. Many diners opt for the chicken rice set with YTF. If not, the chicken rice sets are good options!

The last time I was here, I spied additional items like fried rice and sliced fish dishes on a handwritten whiteboard.

The place gets crowded during mealtimes. If not, they are busy preparing for food delivery orders.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101636040394390892825/reviews
Phyllis Chew,5,"I really like eating here compared to the nearby coffee shops. Itâ€™s clean and airy which makes it more comfortable. Staff are friendly and efficient!

The chicken rice is pretty good, to me the amount of chicken is slightly more than usual stalls ðŸ˜…

I always get the Ampang sauce for yong tau foo. The fried items are always nicely done and they will cook the veggies separately. Yet to try the other bases but there is also Hakka sauce, Tom Yum, laksa and soup!

Overall, worth to stop by this place for a satisfying meal if youâ€™re nearby. Itâ€™s just across the street from the MRT anyway. They sell kopi/teh, canned beverages and also accept various cashless payments too",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110451883767881693336/reviews
Alex Pfieffer,4,"This place is a monthly visit requirement even pre pandemic ðŸ˜Š

Enjoyed the chicken rice (good portions), the Yong Tau Foo was good (more variety would be nice) and price was reasonable for sure.

Biggest issue with me since day 1 I visited here was the tiny tiny tables. 2 person to a tiny table is just super crowded and uncomfortable. 2 tables seating 2 people (as per the required regulations) would not breach the space and distance requirements. So hopefully they can look into this.

The food can be nice, the staff can be wonderful but when the set up is uncomfortable, the whole experienced is compromised. Again, hope they will look into this.

Zubaida Beevi,1,"I came to buy chicken rice set which cost me $5.50 for my son. 4 hrs later only when he wanted to eat we realised there's no chicken. It's not about the amount I paid but it's when I called the bukit gombak branch to tell them about the issues, instead of apologizing the staff was very rude and just simply said ' oh ok! Nanti kita refund la! Like I said it's not the refund that I wanted but at least she could be more tactful in talking to the customer. Sometimes it's because of these kind of rude staff that made customers never want to come back.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100145157692611499038/reviews
