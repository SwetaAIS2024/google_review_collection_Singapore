      "text": "I rarely review food court stalls due to their generic food that can be found elsewhere.\n\nBUT why I am reviewing this is due to the fact there is an amazing store here that I feel I need to share with everyone and the fact this place is pretty isolated.\n\nThe Dry Ban Mian Store is just simply put AMAZING. I tried their Dry Ramen and there no words describing how good it is. It is simply restaurant standards and the tanginess of the noodles and flavouring in their sauce just made me wordless at first bite. I also added abit of chilli on my first trying and for my second trying I added more to make my ramen spicy. But you can perfectly eat it without chilli as well.\n\nThe soup version is just ok as well but not as nice as the dry.\n\nConsidering the affordable price (refer to picture), this stall is a must vist.\n\nThere is also a Japanese store. (Refer to image) The food is pretty ex for a food court. $6 and above minimally but it's not bad. No wow factor but decent.\n\nWestern food is halal. Decent cream spaghetti but abit tough chicken chop.\n\nThe food court opened at 11am daily and closes at 8pm.\n\nThere's parking nearby. Or you can always just take public transport.\n\nFood court is non-airconditioned.",

Soup is not salty and filled with collagen.\nAdded beef tripe that‚Äôs for additional $4.\nLittle over price though.\nBut very satisfied with the noodle.",
