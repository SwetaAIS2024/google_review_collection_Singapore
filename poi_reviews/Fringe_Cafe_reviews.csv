edtayjb,5,"To me, this cafe is highly underrated. The cakes here are simply scrumptious and reasonably priced. As for the ambience here, dining in might be not so great if there's an activity going on while you are there. So, I almost always do a takeaway. Today, I tried its Mango Almond Cake, and as expected, it was very good.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107467079327459015215/reviews
C W,5,One of my favorite places for Rainbow Cake. Love the way they present their gourmet teas too. The cafe is within Attitude Arts dance studio. Can get crowded on weekends and when there are classes in the dance studio. Good place to chill in.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110878945777494875802/reviews
