Ravimaran,4,"Great place to visit with kids

Our kids loved it! We visited in the evening, and the lights on the water made everything feel magical. Plenty of space for strollers, and safe areas for children to walk around. We even grabbed some snacks nearby and had a small picnic. Clean, accessible, and perfect for a quick family outing with amazing photo op",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102743349168226581410/reviews
SHISHIR DK,5,"Great place and must visit when in singapore. Try visiting in early hours as later in the day will be very crowded and also sunny which might not be very suitable for good photos. Also gives a picturesque view. Evening view is also very nice . Try walking around the place in the evening , which is simply surreal experience",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110146412385406120590/reviews
Carleen Bongay,5,"This park is one of the most iconic landmarks in Singapore, offering a breathtaking panoramic view. From here, you can catch a glimpse of the iconic Marina Bay Sands hotel, the stunning Esplanade, and the cityâ€™s modern skyline. Itâ€™s the perfect place to take in the beauty of the city from above, all while being surrounded by nature.

P.S so many people visit here so you better be readyðŸ˜‚",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118043577808879045436/reviews
Riesa Rizkia,5,"Iconic landmark with a great view!
Merlion Park is a must-see spot when visiting Singapore. The statue itself is smaller than expected, but the view of Marina Bay Sands and the city skyline makes it worth the visit. Itâ€™s a great photo opportunity, especially at sunrise or sunset. Can get crowded during peak hours, so early morning is best. Nice place for a short stop while exploring the city!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102078837941924135953/reviews
Jenna Limited,4,"Merlion Park is a must-visit landmark in Singapore, especially for first-time travelers. The iconic Merlion statue, with the Marina Bay skyline in the background, makes for stunning photo opportunities. The area is clean, spacious, and well-maintained, offering a relaxing atmosphere to walk aroundâ€”especially in the early morning or evening. There are benches and shaded spots to rest, and itâ€™s close to other key attractions like Marina Bay Sands and the Esplanade. While it can get crowded with tourists, itâ€™s still a memorable and symbolic part of any visit to Singapore.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106112611970896909857/reviews
