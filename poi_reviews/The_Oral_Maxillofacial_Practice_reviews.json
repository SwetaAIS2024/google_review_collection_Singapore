      "text": "I had terrible tooth pain and reached out for help. From the start, Ms. Wen Han was so kind and responsive—she guided me on what to do and kept checking in to make sure I was okay.\n\nAt the clinic, Mirah welcomed me warmly, and both Ms. Wen Han and Dr. Eric stayed after hours to treat me. They were super gentle and made the whole experience surprisingly comfortable. The relaxing music and big screen with beach views made it feel more like a spa than a dental clinic!\n\nEven after the visit, Ms. Wen Han followed up with reminders and checked on how I was doing. I’m feeling so much better now.\n\nBig thanks to The Oral Maxillofacial Resort—and a special shoutout to Ms. Wen Han for going above and beyond!",

He was very professional and he explained to me my condition in simple enough terms and was very thorough in his explanation as well. He was very open to hearing my concerns and questions, and I felt empowered as a patient :)  The visit was overall extremely helpful in terms of next steps and what to expect. Thank you Dr Shawn and clinic staff!",

      "text": "I have been holding back my wisdom surgery till late age, this is due to a previous very bad experience in my early 20s. I was highly recommended to see Dr Shawn Goh this time and indeed it is the best choice. They will advise you on the procedure, before and after what to expect and very informative and helpful. Most important of all, Dr Goh's expertise is superb and my recovery was a bliss. In fact, there is minimal pain, and bleeding was controlled within a day.  I was able to eat by Day 3 and  i am very thankful that i came here, especially for someone like me who is a nervouse wreck with dental treatment.",
