Brandon Lim,5,"Never expected to find this café among the hidden gems in the area! The iced latte had a lovely aroma and smooth flavor. The Margherita pizza had an authentic Italian taste, and the bread was perfectly done. The staff were attentive and made sure everything went smoothly. A great surprise!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102502396832068023846/reviews
KJ Yaw,5,"Really unexpected coffee and food place in the industry area. 1st time try lavender coffee, taste interesting and good. For those non coffee drinker can try their lavender milk. Which is like a vary pale smurf milk. Their popcorn chicken is a spicy kicker. The pisna is like pizza but not so gluten and taste more like compare to pizza.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116863040644685304402/reviews
Maisie Chew,5,"Was searching for cafe near my place on google and this hidden gem showed up on the page. Cappuccino and Pizza was perfect! Tried their aglio olio as well. Pretty good, prawns were fresh as well but pasta was a little over cooked. It was a little difficult to find parking, had to do a few u turns to find a nearby lot however it’s all worth it :)
Will definitely visit again!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118386427626704190534/reviews
Andrei Jedidiah,5,"Interesting find at a semi industrial park at Pasir Panjang. Love the coffee art and coffee, a super rare find nowadays. Nice variety of snacks and simple food. It is hidden in the floors of an office building.

It might do better at a different location, sadly the rental market is atrocious.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108282722018621898245/reviews
Calbee Cracker,5,"Natural lights, delicious food, good service. Staff took time to explain about their gluten free pinsa (healthier version than pizza). Really delicious! The tart was moist and soft, not too sweet.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110229110724135670872/reviews
