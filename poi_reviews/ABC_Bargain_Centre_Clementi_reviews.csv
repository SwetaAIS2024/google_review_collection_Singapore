Choi Ablay,1,"this morning I bought 3 kinds of chocolate and another wafer because I was going to divide it into 3 batches, but when I got home and looked at the receipt, there were items listed as 4 items and I knew that I only bought 3 kinds, so I just let it go I didn't have time to go back, I paid the Indian lady there, it was disappointing. THE REVIEWS ON THIS SHOP ARE TRUE, he overdoes the tapping when she knows you bought a lot. PLS. MAKE AN ACTION FOR THIS.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109668095309192119379/reviews
Inez Cahyani,3,"A good place to get some things at discounted retail prices, but:

- I’ve had an item scanned twice and therefore I paid for 2 instead of only 1; haphazard young Indian lady. There’s another more mature Chinese lady who’s patient and nice though.

- the store is the messiest ABC shops I’ve been to. Ladder blocks the already crammed walkway. You might have difficulties reaching for some items too as they are blocked by stock boxes

Always check your receipt before leaving. Bring your own bag. Be intentional about what you’d like to get here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112651517202310505587/reviews
ringding ding,1,"The worst shop i ever met... super lousy service... especially the ladies at the counter... their service getting worse day by day ... i am not expecting a super good service but not a service like mad at the customer that did not do anything wrong...like all the payment need to made by one second if slower abit the ladies will made a loud noise, like threathening the customer, which already can be sued under assault in law, as i did apprehend some kind of fear because of her conduct.

Noted : there is possible an action will be brought against the ladies for tort under trespass to person, specifically assault, and ABC bargain shop will be vicarious liable for the tort act did by the employee.

I didnt receive any good service, or at least  a minimum service, for me to proceed the payment in a reasonable time, but a threaten conduct from the employee. Also, if there is other people also suffered such treatment before, now or future, there is possible an action will be brought against the employee and employer if needed tgt by the customers.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107400225909784041603/reviews
Tiban Raj,1,The most disrespectful shop that i have been... If I am not wrong there's is a Filipino women who is manager at that shop .. talking so rude with the customers and also using some unnecessary words.. it's not a right way to serve the costumers. Hope the management take action on it. I think she is not suitable for the position she is right now ..,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112811153536133405980/reviews
