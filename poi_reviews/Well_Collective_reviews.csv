JY Zheng,5,"Well Corrective is a gem! I’m especially impressed by their tasty food and the thoughtful inclusion of gluten-free options — a huge plus in this neighborhood where such choices are limited. The waffles with gelato were exceptional, honestly one of the best I’ve had in Singapore. Their gluten-free pasta is also a winner — flavorful and satisfying. I’d love to see even more gluten-free dishes on their menu in the future. Highly recommended!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106694525211482187562/reviews
Britney Khu,4,"Wells Collective presents itself as a charming, child-friendly and pet-friendly cafe, which is always a plus for families and pet owners looking for a welcoming spot. The ambiance is warm and relaxed, with plenty of seating options to accommodate both kids and furry friends.

When it comes to the food, it’s decent, though not particularly remarkable. The menu offers a variety of dishes that cater to different tastes, but nothing truly stands out as a must-try. While it serves its purpose as a casual dining spot, it may leave foodies wanting more in terms of flavor and creativity.

That said, the service is friendly, and the environment makes it a pleasant place to unwind. If you’re looking for a cozy cafe to hang out with your kids or pets, Wells Collective is worth a visit. Just don’t set your culinary expectations too high.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105275845067023903938/reviews
MH Tham,4,"I have visited Well Collective several times over the years for its pleasant ambiance and generally good service.

However, the food often falls short. Flavours clash or are overpowered by a single ingredient. For instance, the smoked salmon sando is overwhelmed by sweet jam and tamago, while the salmon itself lacks any real smokiness, despite the generous portion. It’s a shame, as the ingredients are fresh and full of potential.

The same issue applies to the alcoholic drinks, which taste rather disjointed. The Baileys mocha, tasted like mocha with a splash of Baileys, lacking depth or cohesion.

Desserts are the best of the lot, though flavours lack complexity and are literally the ingredients showcased in the menu, put together on a plate.

Prices are reasonable, though some may find it not worth the cost. Still, I hope Well Collective improves, as it is a lovely, pet-friendly cafe with great potential.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112376174358198242550/reviews
Nic,5,"Tried a range of dishes and they were all great.
The dessert portions were generous as well, which helps justify the prices.

The dog food served was also cooked, unlike quite a few other places.

We really appreciated the staffs' efforts to cater to our request as well (surprise birthday message).

Service was great too. Well worth the trip.
One can easily enjoy here both the cafe and pet-friendly parts of this establishment.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103904891546165224811/reviews
Nash ki,5,"Went there for dinner on New Years Eve and it didn't disappoint. The interior gave a very modern and minimalist Bali vibe. It's very cozy too.

Staff were efficient and courteous. Ordering process were seamless and like other food establishment, they used qr code ordering method which was convenient and saves a lot of time.

Food arrived fast and hot. We ordered tofu Tempe fries with wasabi mayo to share. Very simple yet delicious. Seems like a weird combination of wasabi mayo and tofu Tempe but I love it.

We ordered 4 mains and mine is beef curry rice. Very rich and beef is tender. Barramundi with miso sauce were fresh and no fishy smell. Miso yuzu sauce complement the barramundi fish perfectly. Mentaiko pasta and medium rare steak were perfect too.

As for dessert, we chose creme brulee Shibuya toast. We devour it in minutes.

Shout out to the manager on duty that day, Wanqi tracy, for ensuring our food arrived in timely manner and multitasking.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104320437175051524313/reviews
