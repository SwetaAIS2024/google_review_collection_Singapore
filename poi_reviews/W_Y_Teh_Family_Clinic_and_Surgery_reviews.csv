Superfamily acc,5,"Went to this clinic and had a very pleasant experience. Dr Joel was empathetic and showed concern when giving the diagnosis.
Waiting time was minimal, sitting area is spacious as well.

What struck me the most was him calling the lady receptionist into the office to be witness while he was hearing my breathing with the stethoscope. Absolute green flag.

Lady receptionist was really friendly too, gave clear instructions when dispensing the medication.

Best experience visiting a doctor while sick. One visit here is enough for me to choose this clinic over others in the neighbourhood (This clinic over V*** clinic any day)",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108265852721254658825/reviews
