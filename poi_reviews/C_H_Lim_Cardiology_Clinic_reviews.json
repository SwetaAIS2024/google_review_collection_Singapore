I have always obtained the best possible care from Dr. Lim and his excellent staff.  He is always unhurried, always intent on listening to his patients, and does a very good job explaining his treatment to non-specialists. As a long-term survivor of bypass surgery, I am very grateful to Dr. C.H. Lim. I wholeheartedly (pun intended) recommend him in the highest terms possible.",
