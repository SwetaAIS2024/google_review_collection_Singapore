laoren teo,1,"The staff at the clinic is very nice and helpful.
But after 10days , they still can't provide the results to the clinic. Don't think this is a place for x-ray. Imagine a case that is serious but had to wait for more than 10 days.. Go polyclinic should be so much faster even the wait is long.
Never want to visit clinic under this company again.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116691796401374423257/reviews
