The dessert offerings were delightful, with a pleasing variety to choose from. The service was excellent - attentive, friendly, and made the experience even more enjoyable. The restaurant offers exceptional value for money, and I look forward to returning. While the quality had declined somewhat following the pandemic, I am pleased to say it has fully returned to its former standard. I highly recommend this establishment.",

We took the senior citizens promotion but the normal weekday lunch price of $29.90++ is still worth it considering the diverse varieties of food.\n\nThe staff are very service oriented. We would like to thank Iwin and his team for rendering us a good dining experience at Kiseki.\n\nDefinitely we will patronise Kiseki again in the near future.",

The service was attentive and timely, with no rush to finish our meal.\n\nHowever, the food quality was inconsistent, with some dishes standing out while others fell short. Overall, it was a reasonably good dining experience, suitable for those looking for a variety of Japanese options without breaking the bank.",

      "text": "Really crowded and some seats are narrow and near to the food. Otherwise, the services of the cleaning lady and the uncle helping with the shabu setup were excellent. A good variety of food, I liked the sashimi and shabu. The tempura and desserts were alright.\n-\nVisited again, the quality of the food is fresh and they replenish frequently. There is a good range of drinks such as winter melon and barley which mum liked, cakes are not as nice but cheese cake was better.\nFamily prefers this buffet to the hotel buffets. Lotsa elderly patrons due to their promotion for seniors.\n‚Äî\nNo cheese cake today but they had matcha red bean cake and pudding, mango pudding was also nice, all not so sweet and suit my taste. I enjoy their steamed sweet potato, some of the sweet potato tempura too. My family enjoys eating here. Thumbs up for the service of the staff. üëçüëç",
