Meng Fai Yip,5,"According to the Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, a breakwater is ""an offshore structure (such as a wall) protecting a harbor or beach from the force of waves."" Here are some photos taken at Breakwater @ Marina East. There is a playground nearby, and when you turn away from the breakwater to face the opposite direction, you would see Marina Bay Sands in the distance. Understand that Pontian Shoal (in Malaysia) is much better. Can't wait to check it out.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109238839349859158213/reviews
William,5,"Evenings and nights are the best times to visit, as the cooler weather makes for a more enjoyable experience. The sea breeze here is incredible, offering a rare treat of strong natural wind that’s uncommon in Singapore, giving the place a unique charm.

It’s an ideal spot to relax and soak in the views. Facing the sea, you’ll see a picturesque scene of boats dotting the water with no visible horizon. Turn toward the city, and you’ll be greeted by the iconic Singapore skyline. The location, surrounded by water, sits on what was once a helipad made of sturdy rocks, adding to its distinctive character.

The rocks are fairly even and safe to sit on, but the gravel can get a bit irritating—consider bringing a mat for added comfort. On lucky days, you might spot otter families lounging on the rocks. More often, though, you’ll find moody couples hanging out and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101379353848168923346/reviews
