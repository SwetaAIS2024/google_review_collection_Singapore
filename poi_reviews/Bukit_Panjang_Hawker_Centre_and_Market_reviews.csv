Ivan K,4,"Tried the signature Lor Mee with fried fish. Reasonable price at $5 with 5 to 10 mins of wait at around 12 noon weekday. Decent bowl of lor Mee, above average but didn't like the fried fish, taste bitter and overfried.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115562172613538213642/reviews
Bian Lee,4,"We were there for breakfast after morning exercise. We had the tau Hu goreng and Gado Gado. The tau Hu was cut into pieces before freshly fried. The sauce was refreshing and well balanced, topped with thinly sliced cucumber. The Gado Gado has a good mix of crunchy bean sprouts, cabbage, tempeh, potatoes, eggs topped with fragrant peanut sauce",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106963842817729813226/reviews

This is a great place to get traditional food. You will know which shops are popular as there are often a long line!
I totally recommend the $1 Kopi (aka coffee) and the nice traditional noodles (in the pic). You get to choose any other add-ons to your noodles. I chose the luncheon and an egg, and it cost $3.
Great value for money. Totally recommended. We'll be back tomorrow",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111180464498217111348/reviews
