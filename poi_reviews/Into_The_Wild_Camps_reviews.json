Faith had so much fun and learnt so much, she can't wait for the second day of the camp and also asked for a third. Her little brother is gathering friends for his turn next. It looks so fun that I was asking if the team can organise one for adults too!",

Most recently my son had his 11th birthday with the ITW team and it was epic. The night survival adventure got the most jaded tween excited. Educational , character building and most of all super fun, this is a super birthday party option.\nThe ITW team are friendly, expert and great with kids of many ages.\nI canâ€™t say enough what a super offering this is.",

She was so proud of herself that she didn't give up. And she's really glad to have hung out with other big strong girls in Girl Squad. She couldn't stop talking about the giant centipede for days! Thanks for having her, and we're looking forward for her to attend more camps!",
