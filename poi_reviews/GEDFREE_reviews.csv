Eni S.,5,"If you are tourist like me with coeliac ( gluten intolerance) then this place is for you, meat lovers and veggie options are also available and everything is 100% gluten free , make sure you download the Grab app so you can place a quick order and see what is available , everything made freshly. You can do it outside of the shop the order and there‚Äôs a QR -code to scan to download different app in case you want to order, and then lady is very kind and quick and makes delicious food in 15-20 minutes and she is extremely helpful and understanding, trust me it worth the waiting!   I have ordered Chicken Cheese Tortillas (see in picture) it was very delicious!
