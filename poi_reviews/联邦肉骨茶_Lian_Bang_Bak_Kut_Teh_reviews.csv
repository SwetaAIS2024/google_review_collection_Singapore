Angel Tan,4,"On my quest for herbal Bak Kut Teh, found this stall at Jurong West Hawker Centre, serving a dark broth along with off-the-bone pork ribs, beancurd skin etc in a claypot! To balance the meal, we had a plate of Iceberg lettuce drizzled with oyster/sesame sauce (tasted like a mix of both).

Jolyn Choo,5,Very nice bak kut teh. We ate the herbal bak kut teh and dry bak kut teh. Both are nice. The dry bak kut teh was very flavourful and there was alot of cuttlefish  shreds inside. Highly recommended ðŸ¥°,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106558021798890589063/reviews
