From the surprise of a bouquet of orange roses to the mothers to the interesting appetizer One Bite to the mains (generous vegetarian menu!!) and the desserts (the creative crème brûlée in three flavours was exquisite: green tea, miso and black sesame).\nAlso appreciated the lovely service very much!\n\nWe sat inside, it was too humid. But would be nice to sit out on a cooler day especially if there were horses out practicing.\n\nAmple parking and relatively access for elderly with walking issues.",

      "text": "A wonderful first experience at this much touted establishment with a large group of friends. Food was exquisite, full of flavours and spices that spoke of the chef’s imagination and thought put into them. Atmosphere was excellent set in the Polo Club. The only slight downside was being charged $100 (incl taxes) for 7 bottles of water, which a member of the party thought was complimentary when asked by the server “still or sparkling water?” As always, communication on both sides could have brought about more clarity that would result in a total positive experience rather than a “this place was great but…” taste in the mouth.",

Even on a balmy May night, the alfresco area seemed cool enough,  helped by the ceiling fans.\n\nNeedless to say, the food is excellent. We had the garlic naan, olive fried rice, chargrilled broccoli, spinach parcel, grilled paneer, and curry prawns.",
