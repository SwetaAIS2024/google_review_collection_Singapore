Dennis N,5,Now comes with less sweet and no sugar options! Damn amazing that we can still enjoy the same tasty dessert and not consume too much sugar. Really kudos to the owners who thought of this and kept the business growing till this day. Really happy with my bowl today :),a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104988888938292694772/reviews
Dale Mac,5,"Yes yes yes!!!!

Definitely the best Cheng Tng I've had.

Heritage stall with great consistency.

Generous with ingredients and very well balanced and fragrant. (I enjoyed the normal one - not the less sugar one).

I personally like the fact that they used crushed ice instead of shaved ice because it stays refreshingly cold throughout the meal and doesn't dilute fast.

Superb and well done over all these years! üôèüèª",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113950514812482140406/reviews
Jacob TAN,4,"Bought the cheng tng back at $3.50 each. Quite a generous amount and good mix of ingredients. Taste of the ingredients are nice but the syrup is too sweet. Might taste better for the cold version with added ice.
Service is friendly.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
