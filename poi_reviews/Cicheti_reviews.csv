J L,4,Not so special. 1) The balsamic glaze was not enough on the pizza so it didn’t taste much flavor but instead was kinda dry. 2) Pizza got burnt on certain spots. I saw the pizza on the other table was also burnt so I guess it’s normal? 3)I’m not a fan of using chipped plate. 4) the crab meat pasta was fishy. We asked the waiter for suggestion on the mains and he recommended this dish. Later on we saw this dish was on every table. The waiter suggested the same to everyone….

Sng Ler Jun,4,"Impeccable service and super accommodating team. This is hospitality at one of its finest. My friend even got a birthday card that contains well wishes from the team - say what?!

Anyways I had such a wonderful time here and forgot what I ordered. The most memorable was the roasted pumpkin with like amazing nuts. It’s charred, tender and has nice crunch.

Oh anyways, GRAB their tiramisu! It’s amazing.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114515718804993781182/reviews
Mark Tho,5,"Food was really good!

Enjoyed the Bismarck pizza very much… good crust and topping ratio was nice, especially with an egg that makes it so yummy!

Pastas were very good too! Al dente and standout were the vongole, ravioli and sausage. Calamari was so so.

Only thing is they do not offer bread basket.

Place is quite small as well and food is slightly pricier with per dish averaging $30.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108336947993231942478/reviews
Avis Peng,5,"When back again. I love their pizza, we ordered Bismarck. It is not the normal crispy crest dough, the dough is soft and tasty. One of the best pizza i had in Singapore. The Burratina is fresh and good. When to many Italian restaurant, this is one of the best. Vongole pasta, they use very fresh clams. Better to book in advance. Seat indoor, out is a bit hot for Singapore weather. At this time, the street outside is quite happening.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112154892036335324432/reviews
Les Buckley,5,Fantastic evening - highlight was the miaile (pork rack with charred honey Brussels sprouts)  and the pizza Bianca. Next time enough. Delicious.  The polpa  was nice but I’m not a fan . The calamari was good. The prawns a little tough to deshell,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114227995632187701280/reviews
