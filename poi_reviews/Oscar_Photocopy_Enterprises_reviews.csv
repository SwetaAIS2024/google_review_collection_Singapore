M C,5,Great service and affordable as well! The auntie was very nice and accommodating.  Printed about 60 pages and was only charged about $15 ( mix of both plain and coloured pages). She even went through the file again to make sure correct printing process. Binding was really nice too! Auntie was also super friendly and funny! They offer their services via whatsapp as well ! Will come again for more printing matters.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101056447018833949861/reviews
klauds,5,I live at Sembawang but my friend recommended me to print my poster and assignment artefacts here and it was definitely worth the trip down. The aunty was super helpful and tried her best to cater to the printing specifics (which was v troublesome) I wanted. I’m very thankful for this quick and smooth transaction and would definitely come back again if I needed a printing job done! Thank you aunty!!! :-),2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118036328363015683035/reviews
