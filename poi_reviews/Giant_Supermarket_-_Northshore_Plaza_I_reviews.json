      "text": "It’s not an extremely large outlet from what you see on the outside, rather crammed actually when you are inside. That said, you will still be able to find the standard items for groceries on a daily basis - fresh poultry, fish, fruits, canned items, snacks and drinks. It’s well-stocked mostly with decent variety. Nothing like a Fairprice extra or finest they are not meant to be competing at that scale for this outlet at least anyways. Sometimes they do make use of the large open air atrium just outside for additional space to conduct larger sales for specific themes (e.g. CNY). Checkout is on a self-serve basis mainly if you are looking for a quicker and more efficient option. It’s a convenient location to grab groceries on overall, especially for residents in the area but don’t expect a super extensive range of goods.",

The staff are poorly trained, and the management seems to lack any understanding of how to run a business. Every time I visit in the morning, I end up stuck in long queues. It's extremely frustrating.\"",
