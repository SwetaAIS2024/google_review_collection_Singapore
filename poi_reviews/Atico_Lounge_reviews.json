      "text": "The window seats are quite hard to book on weekends. Initially, the air conditioning at our table wasn’t working, but the staff later moved us to a sofa seat, which was much better. We waited over 30 minutes for our food to be served, and it was difficult to get the staff’s attention. However, one staff member was especially sweet—she apologized and even offered to help us take pictures, which we really appreciated. So, we decided not to let the wait spoil our mood. The view is great, and the food was decent, though not particularly outstanding. That said, the high tea price in this area is quite reasonable and offers good value for money.",

It was very foamy. As for the afternoon tea set, it is very worth it! The desserts and light snacks were very good for the shared price!\nAmbience and vibes were lovely. Would come back again.",

      "text": "Visited today for high tea to celebrate my wife’s birthday. I had made a reservation for two at 3:00 PM and specifically requested and secured window seats online. We arrived 30 minutes early, but instead of being informed that our reserved table would be ready at the designated time, we were immediately seated at a high table—which was uncomfortable and not what we had booked.\n\nWhen I asked the waiter about it, she confirmed that the window seat was indeed available at 3:00 PM, meaning our original reservation could have been honored if we had simply been asked to wait. Unfortunately, no one took the initiative to communicate this, and it felt like our preferences were disregarded without explanation.\n\nThis kind of oversight is unacceptable, especially when guests have made a clear request for a special occasion. Better communication and respect for confirmed reservations should be a priority.\n\nThat said, I do appreciate that the team followed through on my birthday request for my wife. Small gestures like that made a difference, even if the seating situation detracted from the overall experience.\n\nBetter coordination and clearer communication would go a long way toward improving service for future guests.",
