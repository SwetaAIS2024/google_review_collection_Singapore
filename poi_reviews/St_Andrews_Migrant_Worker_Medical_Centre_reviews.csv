Omel Magano,1,"I was given an appointment at Tue 9-10am. Arrived at around 9.15am. At the registration they give me Q number 45. I waited for almost 2hrs but the Q number is still on no. 16 and very very slow moving. I decided to go already cos I am starting to not feel well due to my condition of having a chest pain. Too crowded and I hope theres more Doctor to accomodate all patients.

And please when you send an appointment time, kindly follow it! Noted that theres too many brothers on that timing/day but please FOLLOW on the timing that you have given! You are misleasing your patients! Will NEVER come to this medical center again! VERY VERY FAR!!!!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117477346929592981433/reviews
