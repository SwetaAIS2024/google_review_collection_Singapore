Kenneth Teo,5,"I had an incredible experience with Victoria World Academy! From the very beginning, their recruitment process stood out for its professionalism, transparency, and attention to detail. The management team is truly dedicated to ensuring a seamless onboarding experience for new employees, and itâ€™s clear they take pride in finding the right fit for both the institution and the candidate.

The staff members were exceptionally welcoming, making me feel comfortable and valued every step of the way. Communication was timely and clear, and they provided ample resources and guidance, making it evident that they genuinely care about employee growth and success. The management is highly approachable and open to feedback, which creates a positive, nurturing work environment.

Overall, Victoria World Academy is not just a place of work but a community where each personâ€™s contributions are valued and celebrated. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a supportive and forward-thinking organization!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115444702196078705293/reviews
Evelynn Ko,1,"This school is the worstâ€”totally shameless and disgusting. There are no rules or discipline at all. Students smoking and drinking? Thatâ€™s just everyday stuff! So many people leave early or ditch class, and bullying is everywhere. The school does absolutely nothing about itâ€”in fact, they even gang up on students who want to transfer!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109248335214938664667/reviews
Mary J,1,"Disgusting. My child used to go to this school, and I'm confident in claiming it's not even exaggerating to say that he's been fully traumatised. A prison would be more suffice to describe this school. I advise all parents to seriously reconsider their decisions before sending their children to this academy.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118214636693276281908/reviews
