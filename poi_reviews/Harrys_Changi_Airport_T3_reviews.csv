casey novak,4,"Had a few drinks while waiting for our connecting flight.
Great tap selection, and they have a further range of drinks by the bottle!
Beer out of the taps is average- the Tiger tasted off, and the Guinness wasn’t up to standard.
Overall, pretty good place to relax given the prices aren’t extreme to enjoy a beer!
