Anis Sakinah,1,"Disappointing Experience with Lack of Specialized Support

We had a very disappointing experience with Bright Kids @ Pasir Ris. Our child has been schooling there since she was 18 months old and is now 3 years old. However, in December 2024, we were informed that she would need to withdraw, with her last day set for the end of March 2025.

This unexpected decision, after so many years at the center, gave us limited time to make alternative arrangements, causing unnecessary stress. Clear and timely communication should have been provided much earlier to avoid such an inconvenience. Parents who require specialized support should be cautious when considering this center.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117081791672281008459/reviews

Fahmi Daini,5,"I cannot recommend this childcare center enough! From the moment I walked in, I felt the warmth and care from the staff. The facility is clean, safe, and filled with age-appropriate learning materials and toys.

The caregivers and teachers are exceptional—knowledgeable, patient, and truly invested in the children’s development. I love how they tailor activities to each child’s interests and needs.

Communication with the center has been outstanding. They keep us informed about our child’s progress, daily activities, and any special events. It’s evident that they value open and transparent communication with parents.

Overall, our experience has been nothing short of wonderful. Our child is thriving here, and we couldn’t be happier with the level of care and education they receive. Choosing this childcare center has been one of the best decisions we’ve made for our child’s early development.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110766941174084452867/reviews
Mei Jun low,5,"My child has enrolled into the school since 2019 and she has improved a lot in terms of communication, playing well with other kids and dancing.
It was great to see that some teachers had been there for long time, indicating that the working environment is good and good retention by the principal.
The school has also been awarded with healthy preschool for their balanced diet meals.
The teachers and principal have also maintained good communication with us via the little family room app which keeps us informed and updated of the school events, parental involvement activities and Covid cases updates during the Covid period.
I will definitely recommend the school to other friends.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111757478030159737229/reviews
