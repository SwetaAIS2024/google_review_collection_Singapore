      "text": "A beautiful trail for a weekend. Takes to the backside of Bukit Timah Hill and there is also a lush green plain area too.\nYou can start from Hillview MRT station and jump on Wallace trail. It's a short trail of 2.2 Km only but you get a good taste of dense forest area. There is also a Wallace learning Centre which opens at 8.30 am and has a small permanent exhibition.\nOn returning to Hillview you can take a trail to Singapore quarry which is really beautiful and there is a viewing dek there. If you love walking you can hop on to Old railway track but that deserves a full review of its own.\n\nYou can see monkeys, Kingfishers, butterflies and sometimes wild boars and even snakes. We could spot monkeys and kingfishers.",
