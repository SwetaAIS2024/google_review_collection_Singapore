The two young men working were very nice and attentive in explaining their offerings. I ended up buying several K Lapis and pandan chiffon, which did not last long in my fridge after.\n\nThis location is also conveniently next to the Singapore cable car from Sentosa.",

      "text": "Firstly, I would like to file a complaint regarding the HarbourFront branch. I spoke to the manager, a man wearing a red shirt, and he told me that all log cake pre-orders before December 15th would receive a discount. I informed him that I planned to collect it on the 19th, and he assured me that the discount would still apply. However, since the discount period ended on the 15th, I told him I would visit the store on the 15th to place a walk-in pre-order.\n\nWhen I went to the store on the 15th around 2:30 PM, I saw an elderly female staff member, but the manager was not present. I asked the staff member if I could pre-order the log cake now and collect it on the 19th while still enjoying the discount. She rudely replied that if I collected it on the 19th, I would be charged the original price without the 10% discount.\n\nI explained to her that the manager had told me otherwise, and I asked why it was now not allowed. She insisted it was not possible. Frustrated, I walked out of the store. Her attitude was extremely rude and disrespectful towards customers.",
