LP Pua,4,"To us, A&W is comfort food to be enjoyed occasionally rather than frequently. The signature root beer is delightful but too sweet to consume often. Unfortunately, the table was not cleaned properly (or at all) and had water spots here and there.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Heskey 10600,5,"These picures were taken on the 2nd of April, 2022. The food, service, atmosphere are excellent. The price of the burgers, spring fries and the 2 mugs of root beer are reasonable in Singapore standard of living.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106782145521703088877/reviews
Chian Song Lim,5,"Ate the Chubby Chicken burger set meal with root beer float. The service was fast, the root beer float was served in a chilled mug without ice, so there were a lot of root beer. There are lots of seats and spaces in the restaurant. Too bad there is no place to watch my hand.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117597573277381456027/reviews
El Alv,5,"Came on CNY holiday. no CNY surcharge.

Burger, fried chicken, cheese sticks, fries, root beers were great.

Not to my liking:
- onion beef sauce sausage. tho my bf said it was american taste
- chili sauce was sweet, personal preference to sth more savoury.

Spent about $40 for 4 people, acceptable.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107609901703594470041/reviews
the_real_kk,4,"ordered cream cheese, chubby and classic cheeseburger. all of their flavours were on point and did not disappoint. best part of the meal was their curly fries and root beer float with the ice cold mug. one complaint is that the fries' portion is too little. it is also towards the pricey side.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107690913721311493554/reviews
