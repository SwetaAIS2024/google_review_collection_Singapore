      "text": "The taste of the ban mee here is quite good, especially when paired with their signature chili. If you're a chili lover, this place might just be your kind of heaven. One great thing is that you can customize the spice level by adding as much (or as little) chili as you like, perfect for those who enjoy a bit of control over their heat.\n\nThe portion size is on the smaller side, especially considering the price point. It might not be the most filling meal if you're really hungry. Another downside is the ventilation, since they also serve mookata, the space can get a little stuffy.",

      "text": "The ban mee is quite small portion, I’m not a heavy eater but still one portion if not enough for me. The soup will be nicer if they use the mani cai ( sayur manis) in it. The noodles should be dry ban mee, bt it’s quite soupy, don’t know why. Ordered ngoh hiang as the side, it’s decently ok. The sauce is nice though… the location of the place is not as convenient unless you have a car, carpark is also not as convenient. If you can’t get the spot at the road side for parallel parking, the nearest car park shown in Waze is at least 5-8 mins walk.",
