      "text": "It’s frustrating that Minmed Tengah, the only clinic in the estate, often doesn’t have a doctor or pediatrician on standby. When you need urgent care—especially for children—not having a doctor available adds stress and uncertainty. I hope another clinic opens soon to meet the community’s needs.\n\nUpdate: My son had been unwell for an extended period, so I called ahead to check if the doctor was available, based on our past experience and the fact that there are no other clinics within walking distance. I was told the doctor was available, but upon arrival, the receptionist informed me that the GP does not see patients under two years old. This inconsistency adds unnecessary stress to an already difficult situation.",

When i walked in and said hi, she completely ignored me and continued to do her stuff as if im transparent. As i was feeling light headed from a fever, I went to take a sit first and she still continued to do other things like prepping meds and stuff without letting me to know to wait for abit or smth. Decided to walk out after this horrible experience.\n\nThe doctor however, was nice to talk to. I went the day before to consult her for fever but unfortunately the fever did not go down. Please do something about your receptionist. Thank you.",

      "text": "Being the only clinic in tengah, it's amusing how you always don't have a doctor in the clinic. Google showed that you were open this morning and when my family went to the clinic, the receptionist very casually told us that there is no doctor and that we have to download an app to do a teleconsult. This is extremely frustrating and adds alot of stress when someone is already unwell. If you are not happy to serve the community, perhaps another clinic can open to serve the people better.",

I even WhatsApped the customer service. All they do is check. No answers at all. Just go elsewhere.",
