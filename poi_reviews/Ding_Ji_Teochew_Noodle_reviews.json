Didnâ€™t bother looking at me and taking my order and started cooking. I had to repeat my order a few times before she finally looked at me. She finally looked up at me when I was trying to pay and I had to call her 3 times before she responded.",

Just read the others poor & bad reviews, found that these noodle stores mostly have very bad attitude staffs. The boss should get rid of such employees. Will definitely affect their business. For that, I will never eat their noodles ever again ! ðŸ˜¤",

      "text": "Very average bowl of noodles, honestly it depends on whoâ€™s cooking but recently the standard has dropped tremendously. Portions are small too. Soup has lost its original touch becoming bland\n\nUpdate: ordered their dumpling soup for $4, which was supposed to contain 5 pieces, I asked if I was able to add dumplings at additional cost, they told me itâ€™s $1.50 for 2 more pieces. Which would bring it to 7. When they were cooking mine I asked again if they had added the additional pieces, they said yeah. To my dismay when I dapaoed it home, it only had 5 pieces again at $5.90. Dishonest and disgraceful really. Yucks boycotting it forever.",

If you are craving for a bowl of hot noodle and nice soup, I would strongly recommend this stall. :)",
