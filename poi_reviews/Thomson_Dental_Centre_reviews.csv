Alisa Taha,5,"My family and I have been visiting Thomson Medical for years and am always grateful for the warm hospitality that we‚Äôve received.

Our dentists Dr Neo and her nurse Wendy, Dr Loh (braces specialist) are very professional, always concern and will try their very best to accommodate to our needs by sharing professional advises and following up on us whenever needed.

We‚Äôre also always greeted with a warm smile by Berlin and her colleagues over the counter whenever we‚Äôre here for our appointments.

Really thankful for the team at Thomson for making our experiences a positive one! (:",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111790725887610874484/reviews
Winnie Lim,5,"I was always scared to visit dentist since young. But never did I expect to meet Dr Yeo Siang Khin who was recommendedto me by the counter, Ms Gigi Tan. Dr Yeo was so gentle n knowledgeable about everything. I had my 1st root canal n crowning with her. I was scared out of wit that took 2hrs opening my mouth with all the reno inside my mouth. But she was an expert that I don't feel much pain n discomfort that time flies so fast n it was done before I can remember. After then, I would always visit her when I need my dental services. I'm so glad I had found a dentist that reassured me n calm me down. Thanks a million Dr Yeo n Ms Gigi Tan. üòä",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102124697596793977570/reviews
Anny,1,"I've been a regular patient at Thomson Dental for some time, but I‚Äôm quite disappointed with the recent experience I had with your customer service. I had reached out via text a few days in advance to request an appointment but did not receive any response. When I followed up with a call, I was informed that an appointment had already been made for me the next day‚Äîhowever, I was never notified of this.

When I expressed my frustration and requested to cancel both this and a future appointment, the response I received was a curt ‚Äúsure,‚Äù followed by an immediate cancellation message. It felt dismissive and lacked the level of care I would expect, as a patient.

I hope this feedback is taken constructively, as I do value the dental care I‚Äôve received in the past and would like to see improvements in communication and service.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113560713124320200841/reviews
Jimmy Chua,5,"Lovely vibes. Hope the patients all get a speedy recovery

Brought my wife twice to visit Dr Kwok. He is very patient, gentle and caring. My wife was afraid of dental visits after past experience elsewhere.

I visit Dr Charlotte. Had my front teeth extracted. Did deep cleaning for my gums. Multiple visit. Thanks for the patient, friendly and helpful support.

You guys have passion in what you do.

Great friendly team here. Thank you!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100652967180584813933/reviews
deedlit wind,5,"I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Dr. Chua Chee Haow for his exceptional care in addressing my dental and crown issues. Last year, I had a crown that came off, leaving a stent sticking out of my gum. I consulted three different dentists, each of whom explained the complexity of my case, as my old crown was near nerves. However, all they did was provide an X-ray and a quote. When I asked about fixing other cavities, none of them offered any help.

Then I decided to see Dr. Chua, who is well-known for helping patients, especially those who are fearful of dental treatments. From the start, Dr. Chua and his team made the entire process seamless, painless, and highly effective. Whenever I felt anxious during the procedure, Sandra and the other nurses would calmly tap my shoulder to reassure me, making me feel comforted like a child. Dr. Chua‚Äôs occasional whistling also helped me stay relaxed, letting me know everything was going smoothly. Even Maria, the receptionist, checked in on me after my procedure to ensure I was doing okay.

Today, I had my dental implant completed, and Dr. Chua took extra care to fill cavities whenever he spotted them. I always leave feeling that my teeth are incredibly clean, and I am so grateful for the outstanding care I received throughout the process. Thank you, Dr. Chua and team!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113676011710249327832/reviews
