      "text": "Delifrance Caf√© @ Sengkang Hospital\n\nTucked inside Sengkang Hospital, Delifrance Caf√© turned out to be an unexpected gem ‚Äì not just for its food, but for the truly exceptional service.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped in, I was greeted with a warm, genuine welcome from a lovely Malay lady crew member. She didn‚Äôt just say ‚Äúhello‚Äù ‚Äî she made every customer feel seen and appreciated, offering her recommendations with sincerity and a bright smile. While I initially declined the weekday sandwich bundle, she gently suggested upgrading my order to a set with a drink and soup or dessert ‚Äî not in a pushy way, but with care and consideration. That kind of personal attention is rare these days.\n\nAfter payment, she didn‚Äôt just move on to the next customer. She ended with a heartfelt ‚Äúthank you‚Äù and ‚Äúdo come again,‚Äù something surprisingly uncommon in many places across Singapore. What stood out even more was her consistency ‚Äî every single customer got the same warm treatment. And when there was a lull, she didn‚Äôt idle ‚Äî she cleaned and organized her counter with the same dedication.\n\nKudos to her ‚Äî she‚Äôs a shining example of what great service should be. Honestly, more service staff should take a page from her book.\n\nThe only downside? The kitchen isn‚Äôt soundproof, so you can occasionally hear the kitchen staff chatting from the dining area. But that‚Äôs a minor hiccup in an otherwise relaxing caf√© where you can enjoy a quiet meal or coffee break.\n\nHighly recommended for both the food and the outstanding service ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôre lucky enough to be served by that incredible staff member.",

I had the tuna sandwich set ($16.60), which included soup and a drink. While the food was okay and the staff friendly, the price felt a bit high for a sandwich set.
