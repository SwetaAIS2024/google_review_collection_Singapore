Sten (Piqued Wanderer),5,"Great place to chill especially for a sun rise photo shot. U can refer to my shot and do better than what i can do.

An alternative and secluded place for photography lovers. From what we heard, there are people fishing here as well BUT i never it is approved, so its jz a hearsay.

Nonetheless, d place will start get busy with heavy vehicles. Do becareful around this area. But nonetheless, the place is nice to be at.

Cheers!!

Willy Lim,5,"Restricted jetty, not opened to public. To support the fish farming industry, AVA invested $3.85 million in building this jetty for local farmers.Â Some fishing enthusiasts come to this secret fishing spot. While you can't fish at this private jetty, you can fish by the sides of the jetty. Rumour has it that there are numerous barramundi, grouper and mangrove jacks being landed there!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101956172504276757657/reviews
