Forest BK,4,"Lakeside Field is a grand lawn located across the Entrance Pavilion.
Lay a mat on the ground for picnic in the evening or have some fun with a frisbee.
It was the venue for the Lights by the Lake 2023, the annual lantern light up event.
The open large lawn is good for organising carnivals, corporate family day and sports day.
Lakeside Field is also available for rent from NParks.

C,4,"Located within the scenic Jurong Lake Gardens, Lakeside Field offers a peaceful escape with its vast open lawns and beautifully maintained green spaces. It’s the perfect spot for recreational activities, whether you're gathering with friends, flying kites, or just enjoying a picnic by the lake. The pathways around the field are well-maintained, making them ideal for a leisurely stroll, jog, or cycle through the serene landscape.

Lakeside Field's proximity to other attractions like the Forest Ramble and Rasau Walk adds to its appeal, offering a seamless experience for visitors exploring the rest of Jurong Lake Gardens. The space also frequently hosts community events and festivals. I recently visited during the Mid-Autumn Festival Lights by the Lake event and thoroughly enjoyed the enchanting light displays, which added a festive charm to the tranquil environment. It’s a must-visit for anyone looking for a blend of nature, recreation, and cultural activities.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
