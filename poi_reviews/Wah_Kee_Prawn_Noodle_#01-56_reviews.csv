Cookie Monster,4,I thought the noodles were really good. Very Q. The prawns were fresh but Would have liked the soup to be thicker and stronger taste. Lots of pork lard in the noodles and soup!,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107796989497608846184/reviews
Kevin Lim,5,"I would like to highly recommend this store. Their service is excellent. They provide free soup, chopsticks, and spoons without you needing to ask. The food is reasonably priced and the portions are very large.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106673512036124640849/reviews
Stanley,2,"Noodles were clumpy and soggy. They were mixed in their chilli and tomato sauces. The prawns were half sliced, with a few slices of fish cakes and lean meat, not particularly remarkable though. The prawn soup was light and slightly bland, not as flavorful as others. Overall, the prawn noodle was not bad, if you like the soggy noodles type. However, I wouldn't make a special trip down just for this.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109779294020772182875/reviews
CY Lee (CY),4,"Old style prawn noodles..
Tried the soup version.. taste like the good old days on how prawn noodles were originally made.. not those fancy king prawns.. etc.

seh alex seh,4,"hidden gem old school prawn noodles where decent size fully shelled prawns and pork slices is being served. recommend the dry chilli version instead of soup. owner is humble and friendly even when they are busy.
pricing is fair and u can see every bowl served is delicately prepared.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109120433171919613461/reviews
