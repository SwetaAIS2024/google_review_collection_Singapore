Chicken has obviously been deep fried several times. It's tough and dry to the point I cannot tell if I was biting into the flesh or the bone anymore. Like a jerky tough, its disgusting.",

I think your staff should try a small cup after prepping the milo to ensure quality. Ain't expecting milo dinosaur kind of thick but definitely not so diluted yea?",

The combo looks makes you feel you have been swindled of what was meant to be larger than a muffin with the same ingredients and still less of a cheese.",
