Red Head,1,"Used to patron the bryani at 622D Punggol Central. However today when i visit them for my usual to go, i was asked if i can opt for chicken breast instead of leg for the bryani. Taken aback i insist on the leg as there were plenty of them on displayed in the glass rack.
Upon payment, i was told each packet cost $7. Shocked but i paid nonetheless. I left and switched on Foodpanda and discovered in their app the bryani at the same stall selling for $6! Why such attitude and intentions to deceive? I went back to the stall but they have closed the shop for their afternoon break.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109451648754122759501/reviews
Mustika Musa,1,Today ordered the mee kuah via food panda. Mee Kuah gravy was very diluted and don’t even taste like the usual mee Kuah and the portion of mee was very stingy! Won’t recommend eating here if you are going to get your mamak cravings fixed,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110114677585349166920/reviews
