ZK,5,"I’ve tried it a few times in-store, and it was tasty and delicious with generous portions. Today, I ordered from Foodpanda, and the porridge was packed in a warmer bag, while the condiments were individually packed. Very impressive!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115645124655469836873/reviews

Lydia Xie,1,"Saw all the 5-stars review here and decided to order this for myself and daughter. It’s either the cook is having a bad day or I have a lousy taste bud compared to the people who provided the reviews here, the porridge is super salty and the frog sauce was even saltier. The sauce is not the typical frog sauce but just Ma Yu oil which is oily and salty. To be fair, the you tiao was ok.

First and last purchase from this place.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117872342392770465039/reviews
