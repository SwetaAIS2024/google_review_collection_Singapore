Calvin Bow,1,"1July24 Today's exam was terrible! It didn't resemble the mock exams at all. There was no network in the classroom, so I couldn't access my IC on Singpass. I almost got rejected by the rude staff at the counter, who continued to harass me after the exam as I was leaving, reminding me to bring my physical pink IC. Sigh...

I achieved a score of 99.4% on the mock exam, but only 34% on the actual terminal exam today. I'm worried about the discrepancies in the scoring. It's frustrating that the mock exams seem designed for students to fail. I am concerned that the system is monopolized and that there may be unfair practices in place. Sigh ðŸ¥²",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104249260209390016255/reviews
Zouhura Backers,5,"Hi there,

I would like to extend my gratitude to your staff who is front counter lady by the name (Shu). She is so helpful from the first day I attempt to the exam.

Iâ€™m not from insurance background, but on my 6th attempted i passed the exam. She help me through this time by giving me moral support and she was very empathy.

She guide me so well when i canâ€™t get into exam hall because of my ID issues. She went beyond then her service.
