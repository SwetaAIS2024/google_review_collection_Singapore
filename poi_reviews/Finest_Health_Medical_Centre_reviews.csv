Lauryn Leow,5,"had a great experience getting vaccinated for flu in this clinic. doctor and nurses were very friendly even though it was 9.30pm at night and my partner and i were the last visitor. doctor trin was very friendly and greeted us warmly when we entered the room. he was super professional in administering the vaccination, ensures that my vaccination records were correct and briefed the details on the vaccine and precautions to take. we even had wholesome small talk and it was a pleasant chat despite it being so short! 100% recommend this clinic!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111565850444860345041/reviews
Evelyn Chee,5,"It was my first time and I was in awe of how seamless the whole process was. From making appointment online to seeing the doctor. No need to fill up forms which I hate. The nurse was very patient and nice.

I saw Dr Dinesh and I totally in love how detailed he was. He listened to me attentively when I described my symptoms. Some docs would multi task while listening to you but Dr Dinesh stopped what he was doing and just listened to you, always making eye contact. He gave very good suggestions and recommendations. He was also very assuring!

I would go back to him again when I am sick. He has been such a nice doctor to talk to.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102072768121584190019/reviews
