Jonathan Chew,4,"Had the wings as some of the food blogs had recommended it from this stall, and it can be hard to differentiate the decent from the great at the Lagoon. I immediately noted that the price had increased to $1.40 per piece, pricier than some others. The wings were decent, but not something I would rave about. I would even find them a tad tough and dry, and they could definitely be juicier.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106144108752002112533/reviews
W Lin,2,"It was one of the best bbq chicken wings I had in singapore.
It was juicy, well marinated and bbq well.

However after the new people took over...

I have tried it at least 3 times to confirm my disappointment.

It is no where near the taste from the previous stall owner.

Wings were over grilled and dry.
Not well marinated.

Gave it 3 chances but still did not make the standard.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105355883108065990903/reviews

Alex Soo,4,Perfectly BBQ/grilled crispy skin with a little juicy inside. Properly arranged for serving and comes with the perfect matched chili sauce. One star less for seasoning as the taste is slightly below my expectations.Chicken wing is slight smaller size.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112268683474201894113/reviews
LULU EVOX,3,$1.40 per pcs now.  Well its really grill from charcoal but the meat from the wing is really dried and hard. Although skin crispy on the outside  from the grill fire but result in dried up the whole wing. Is it because rushing the order so fire too big?? Kinda disappointed ..,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107012020161541736403/reviews
