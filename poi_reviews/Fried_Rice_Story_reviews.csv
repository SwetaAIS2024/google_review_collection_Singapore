Cher S,5,"One of the most delicious fried rice we've had!

The Shrimp Egg Fried Rice was fragrant and perfectly cooked.

The Braised Beef Teriyaki Fried Rice had a generous amount of Braised beef, and the rice had such a yummy roasted flavour to it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107817726526626375036/reviews
Nurul Afifah,5,"First time here. Just found out that it's halal (perfect for Muslims!). Ordered the egg fried rice with chicken katsu and it was sooooo good. I don't usually eat a lot of rice but because it was delicious, I finished the entire plate by myself. Will definitely come back to check out the other menu items. In my opinion, the fried rice here at Fried Rice Story tastes better than Wok Hey.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100696263247067775374/reviews
Edrie Boomz,4,"Heard many things about this shop so I decided to give it a try.

There are many variety to choose from but I chose the most basic friend rice w prawn, to be safe.

It tasted pretty mid, nothing special but I can’t wait to be back to try the truffle fried rice.

I have to say the wings were the star! Really love the Thai sauce which elevates the taste even more.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111751045487129289869/reviews
