Add a boiled egg and the crackle of fresh pappadum, and you‚Äôve got the perfect meal. From across NTU, I walk the 20 minutes‚Äîit‚Äôs my way of earning the food and making it a healthy ritual. A warm, comforting break from the stress of traffic and daily grind. Hearty, affordable, and packed with flavor‚Äîjust the recharge I need.",
