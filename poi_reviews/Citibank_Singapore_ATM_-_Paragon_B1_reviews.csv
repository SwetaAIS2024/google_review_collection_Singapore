Flo Yeow,3,"By nature of how they build up their ATM networks, Citibank's ATMs have traditionally been hard to find, hard to access, and very scarcely spread out around the island. This is not any different, as this is probably the first of few Citibank ATMs that I've personally come across. Located at the basement of Paragon mall, right by Ya Kun Kaya Toast. Shouldn't be hard to find once you're able to Google this location.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
