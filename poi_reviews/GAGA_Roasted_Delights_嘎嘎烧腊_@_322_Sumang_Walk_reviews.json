      "text": "[24/05/2024] ordered 2 packages roast chicken+roast pork, both add roast pork & egg =$15.60. I purposely didn't ask for breast meat to test how honest they are at giving the chicken meat. End up both package they gave rip area and both package not much chicken meat, mostly are bones.. Not honest seller. Roast meat very dry, not good. Rice is abit too dry. I'm a chef with 9 years experience and have done alot of roast meat, their meat are really dry. When they pack the rice, they pack it losely, resulting portion very small. After adding meat, Portion okok but a little lesser than other sellers. The roast meat store directly beside soo teck lrt coffeeshop is so much better and I recommend all their roast item.",
