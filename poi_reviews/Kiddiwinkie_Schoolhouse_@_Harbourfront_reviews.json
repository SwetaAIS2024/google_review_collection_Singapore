      "text": "I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this infant and toddler school! The learning program is incredibly thoughtful, striking the perfect balance between structured activities and play. Teachers provide regular, detailed updates, ensuring families are always informed about their child‚Äôs progress. They also offer valuable support tools to help parents stay engaged and assist with learning at home.\n\nAlthough there‚Äôs no dedicated outdoor space, the team more than compensates by organizing regular walks and field trips, ensuring the children still get plenty of exploration‚Ä¶the indoor gym is our kids favorite probably because they don‚Äôt get hot running around. The staff handles illness with professionalism and care, and they are always open to finding or offering accommodations to meet the individual needs of each child.\n\nThe infant program and nursery are thoughtfully separated, giving each group the attention and environment suited to their age and development. Above all, the teachers are incredibly caring, making sure every child feels valued, supported, and loved. This school truly provides a nurturing, enriching experience for both children and their families!",

The school provides a warm, nurturing, and fun environment where she feels safe, happy, and excited to learn every day. The teachers and staff are wonderful‚Äîdedicated, kind, and always going above and beyond to support the children‚Äôs development.\n\nA very special thank you to Teacher Felicia, Wai Laoshi, and Jingjing Laoshi for their patience, love, and genuine care. It‚Äôs clear how much they adore the children, and we are so grateful for the positive impact they‚Äôve had on our daughter‚Äôs journey.\n\nOne of the best things about this school is the incredible group of friends she has made. She comes home every day with memories and stories about the fun she had with her classmates, and it‚Äôs heartwarming to see her build such meaningful friendships. The sense of community here is amazing, and it makes such a difference in her happiness.\n\nOn top of all that, the location is super convenient, making drop-offs and pick-ups easy for us as parents.\n\nWe couldn‚Äôt be happier with our experience at Kiddiwinkie and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a loving, supportive, and enriching environment for their child!",

      "text": "Our son Ethan Hong has been with Kiddiewinkie Harbourfront since Feb 2023 and must say it has been an enriching experience.  We can see Ethan developing well on all front, both physically and intellectually.  Special thanks to the previous teacher group led by Chong Peng / Sally and now Èü¶ËÄÅÂ∏à / Felicia for all the care and guidance.  We particularly appreciative of the regular development progress / assessment, and as parents we can reinforce some of the observations / assessments back home.  The learning curriculum is highly inclusive, with emphasis too on cultural diversity and global connectivity.  Recent excursion (our 1st) to cat paradise was really impressive and memorable.  Thanks to the teachers for looking out for Ethan and keep us updated on his health well-being.  Only suggestion is the lack of outdoor activities which perhaps the school can consider partnering the new Kiddiewinkie East Coast school which offers outdoor facilities.  This can be in the form of periodic trip to the east coast school as part of PE activity.\n\nKeep up the good work teachers....and a happy Teachers Day!",
