Abraham Lee,5,"We visited Daisy’s Dream Kitchen on Mother’s Day and had a lovely experience. The place was relatively crowded but had a warm, homely vibe. Staff were friendly and polite throughout. A thoughtful touch was the free pack of belachan given to all mothers. The food was good, serving up traditional Peranakan flavours just like home. Indoor seating is limited, but there are alfresco outdoor seats as well. A great spot for comforting Peranakan food.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews

Jason Ong,4,"Cosy cafe that serves good nonya food, although it's a bit on the pricey side.
I have been here a few times, and each time the food we ordered were generally delicious. If you are looking for good nonya food, this place is definitely worth a visit. It's not very accessible, so the best way is to go by car or taxi.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101337983538091125134/reviews
Mi Bome,5,"I came to love Peranakan food from my previous visits of Singapore so I suggested Peranakan food to our little group. This restaurant came to mind. We were not disappointed. The taste of the slow cooking dishes was sensational and with so many different layers of taste, the consistency as tender as it gets. As a bonus, the lady from the restaurant explained to us the background and philosophy of each dish when it arrived. Considering the superior quality of food and laid back atmosphere of the restaurant I felt that the prices were extremely modest. Thank you.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112963167728638730193/reviews
