rachna narula,3,"We hosted an event for our clients at the Magic carpet, Singapore in May.  While the service was great and the owner of the place was himself present to ensure perfect arrangements, we were disappointed with the quality of the food. Also, they need to work on improving the infrastructure including toilets. Can‚Äôt share pics to respect privacy of guests so here are food pics.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114299289093935030545/reviews
Abhishek Gupta,1,"The DJ is really bad, no one is dancing. The dj keeps playing songs which he likes rather than why people love. People left in mid way. The entry price is too expensive. Magic carpet used to be good but not anymore",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102190522932905052094/reviews

Josephus Premkumar,2,Music is too loud. Playlist and music transition is not that great. It gets too cramped and crowded after around 11pm. Drinks are too expensive and tastes cheap. The only way to stay hydrated is to buy 200ml water bottles for $5.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109964047630817360057/reviews
Harjit SIngh,1,"Had an absolutely horrible night with the new Dj from India, Dj Aaron I believe.
After spending a hefty amount on drinks I would at least expect the music to be good.
Unfortunately all I got from Dj Aaron were bad mixes, abrupt changes in between songs and honestly music that no one has heard off.

Throughout the night he rejected all our song requests but entertained a specific group (most likely his friends). When I asked why is he not taking my requests he comes up with the excuse ‚Äúi dont have the songs‚Äù or ‚Äúits going to ruin my flow‚Äù and continues to play absolute garbage.

He plays his own nonsensical music and honestly just killed the vibes. Not to mention an empty dancefloor while he was spinning. Thankfully the other Djs after him were great.

I feel Magic is a great place to party but Dj Aaron really needs to go üëé",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112308480701988710737/reviews
