Ray Tan,4,Pretty large viet ktv. Even the small rooms are larger than other places. Alcohols are reasonably priced. Entertainers here not the best looking ones iâ€™ve seen but still decent. Ample parking space here as well.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118226053308108066808/reviews
EL PKnight,1,"Visited ktv, very disappointed. Viet girl sit 10 mins n left, came back 2nd time for less than 2 mins and left. Mgmt claim girl got drunk...is it? She don't even look drunk or tipsy at all when she was with me. Left the place after 1 hour. Not recommended. Waste of time",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115623919224704619509/reviews
