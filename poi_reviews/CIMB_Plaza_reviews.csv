Wu Anthony,5,"Hello again, my name is Anthony. I am a Google reviewer from Indonesia.

This establishment is located near the Raffles MRT station. It is a food court that caters to businessmen and other workers in the area.

There are many food stalls to choose from, and you can pay using cash, Visa, or other payment methods.

It is also a good place for sightseeing.

Thank you, and may God bless you.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110561422577939376703/reviews
Daniel Sin,3,"Really deserted place especially during weekends or public holiday, due to Covid-19 most offices here have reduce the workforce and the shops or restaurant in this mall have closed or moved out. Very little choice nowadays, totally different from the good old days. There is a food court in the basement and there are few eateries that sell a variety of dishes. Morning and lunch time is peak and it could be difficult to find seats.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112598854240446452449/reviews
Flo Yeow,4,"Really love the new set up of Change Alley Mall. They never used to feel this posh, and the entire stretch of shops and restaurants were just against normal backdrops. Now that they've revamped it, especially with the black and white floor tiles, it actually feels really good walking past the entire stretch. I even had 2nd glances backwards to admiring the whole ""mall"".",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Anne Marie Kim,3,I saw people walking into this CIMB Plaza and decided to check it out. There were some minor renovations and many of the shops were closed. On the other end was Collyer Quay Centre.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108954682555429603246/reviews
