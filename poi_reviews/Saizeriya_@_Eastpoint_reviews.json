Food came quickly, and the prices are super family friendly too. Good dining spot that works great for a casual family meal. Weâ€™ll definitely be back",

I love all the food we ordered. I super love the garlic focaccia sourdough bread while it was served warmed. Itâ€™s really delicious! Itâ€™s a cheaper version as there is no gst or service charge. The portions maybe small but one can order 2 different dishes if it does not make u full, or u can eat with rice or focaccia bread! Yums! ðŸ˜‹",

The chicken salad is less than $5 and comes in a big bowl. It's quite filling as the chicken portion is pretty big. The salmon salad is a bit less abundant but still ok.",

Even when you are not able to open the restaurant at 11am which is stated at the restaurant, minimally you could let us sit inside. As I type this now it's 1110am and the restaurant is still not opened for operation",
