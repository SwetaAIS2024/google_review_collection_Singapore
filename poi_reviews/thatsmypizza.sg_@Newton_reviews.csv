Carol Ho,5,Have taken away from this store twice. Really like the dough used for the pizza. Have a good selection of traditional and fusion flavours. Prefer the traditional ones. The staff are friendly and prompt with our orders. Would order again for comfort food.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111110848837397658671/reviews
Sheng,3,"Had the applewood smoked bacon. The dough was moderately soft and nicely charred all round. There was also no overpowering yeast aroma, so that's a plus. The slices held up fairly well too and weren't overly moist or limp, though there was a small pool of rendered bacon fat below the pizza. However, the crust is slightly bready and not as fluffy as I expected, and from my observation, it probably has to do with the stretching. As for the toppings, the tomato sauce could be much more pronounced and richer, as it only offered subtle tart afternotes, without any of that natural sweetness/savouriness.  Surprisingly, the bacon also didn't add much savouriness (very low on the salt) and mostly contributed by way of rendered fat. So the overall flavour of the pizza was rather light.

To sum up, it is a decent neo-neapolitan, but not the best qpr, and that's also just the reality of doing pizzas in a hawker, not least in newton.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106087228995573038993/reviews
Boon Yeow Leo,5,Hands down. Best pizza me and my family ever had. The hyper-hydrated dough was incredibly chewy. The flavors in each bite were perfect. My personal favourite was the garlic base. Everyone else loved the tomato based. Each pizza that reached was finished in minutes. We'll definitely be back again.

Garey Gan,5,"Look at my happy girlfriend. Good food = happy girlfriend.

Quality of ingredients are solid, and the chef takes pride in his pizzas. You're basically getting a fine dining fancy pizza in a unique hawker setting.

Ivan Lian,5,"I recently tried the rosemary smoked duck pizza, and it was delicious! The combination of tender, smoky duck and the fragrant rosemary was perfection. The crust was crispy yet soft, and the balance of flavors was spot on. Every bite was rich, savory, and bursting with flavor. The owner was super friendly and gave his recommendations based on what we could eat, without over ordering. If you're looking for something unique and delicious, this place is a must-visit. Iâ€™ll definitely be back!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109074763150086628250/reviews
