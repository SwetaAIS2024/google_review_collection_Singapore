Vivian Chee,1,Ordered butter sugar toast and  and only butter. Feedback to the staff but they just said its what I ordered but obviously its  not. And my husband took a bite and immediately he  spat out. And we left the toast untouched. Spent $5 for this quality.

Donny Yong,5,"The best cafe ever had in SDC. Didn’t even realise it is halal until my wife told me. Tasted just like any Zi Char stall outside.

But the down side is to enjoy the 10% member discount, need to order over the counter. Self service kiosk doesn’t support member discount",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105219769624388539185/reviews
D Y,4,"Cafe style dining. Queue to buy food and wait for your order number to be called. Self tray return after eating. Ordered pan-fried beehoon, hacheong chicken and hotplate toufu. Overall rating of the food is not bad,  just that the hacheong chicken (prawn paste) is a little salty. Price is reasonable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116259102453311674322/reviews
