Perhaps they can make it less hard as elderly may have problems biting into the murukku. You can taste the spices used. Great snack while watching TV. Most importantly, there was no \"stale oil\" smell or taste.  They were very responsive to my questions and delivery was punctual.  Will recommend to my neighbours!",
