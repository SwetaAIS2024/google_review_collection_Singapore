The Â∞èÁ¢óÈù¢, they removed the small steamboat with fire & replaced with a paper bowl‚Ä¶.

The char siew was generous, but average in quality. The portion was large, for $4. I would say it's good value for money (5*), but taste-wise, slightly better than average. Not worth specially coming here for.",
