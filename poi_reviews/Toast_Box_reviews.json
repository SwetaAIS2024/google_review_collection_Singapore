      "text": "Simple Yet Delicious – A Must-Visit!\n\nI had the pleasure of visiting Toast Box, and it truly exceeded my expectations. The food is simple, yet incredibly delicious. I had the signature toast and soft-boiled eggs, which were absolutely perfect—crispy toast with just the right amount of butter and the eggs cooked to perfection. The coffee was equally impressive, rich and smooth, a great complement to the meal.\n\nThe atmosphere is casual and cozy, making it a perfect spot for a quick, satisfying meal. If you're looking for something uncomplicated but tasty, Toast Box is the place to go. Highly recommend!",
