I was failing my science in p5 and that was when i joined this tuition and her teaching was very understandable and i end up passing my science. In secondary, I was failing quite badly for my emath getting f9 and E8 but thanks to teacher jody, my emath started passing with an A1! Teacher jody's lessons are all very very fun and very entertaining. She is very easygoing which allows us to ask her questions that we dont know without a worry. She explains all questions thoroughly and patiently! This makes me believe that i will get good grades for emath!",

Her lessons are always fun and chill which makes me look forward to going to tution. Along the way, I find myself slowly improving and i started passing my emath and amath. Surprisingly, through the tution, I found myself liking amath more(hated it). Hopefully ü§û I am able to get A2 for amath and emath for olevel!",
