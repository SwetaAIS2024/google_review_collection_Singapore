c tzehow,4,"Q for almost 30 mins. The staff seems new, so slow and not clear with order. Wanted to order $5 but staff wasn't sure if this is available. Taste is close to what I had in KL but not as good. I hope over time, they can speed up with order and cooking. Else will skip if q is long.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102842308844590273724/reviews
Jurn Chan,4,"Been there a few times specially for thus rather unique mixed pork noodles, laden with a good heaping of fragrant crispy pork lard. Pork is tender, the intestines are cleaned very well with no ordor. It is very reminiscent of Malaccan style kopi tiam style noodles. Worth going specially for it. Only down side is that it's small with limited seating.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116586487153379676938/reviews
TCH,4,Had to try this KL Style Pork Noodles since I was in the area.  Read so many reviews about their noodles and true enough; this stall sells pork noodles from $2.50 and the taste close to KL ones!  Ample parking here and expect to queue if you are there in the morning.  Limited seats in this small coffeeshop though and one could also find Roti Prata and supposedly another Stall selling Fried Carrot Cakes; but it was closed today!,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102467592239988127131/reviews
