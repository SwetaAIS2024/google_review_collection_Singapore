They were tasty.\n\nCondiments of minced garlic, Chinese chili oil, cut chili and soy sauce or vinegar options.\n\nThe elderly uncle was amicable and the shop enjoy quite a loyal following.\n\nThey also offer various frozen dumplings for takeaway.",

But the ambience is kind of unique (not necessarily good, just different) for a restaurant, so it's worth a try.\n\nI genuinely think one could cook better food by themselves, but I guess if you're hungry, there's no really any option in walking vicinity.",

There are a lot of dishes on offer but I like to order the dumplings to eat.\n\nThey are all bite sized and a good ratio of meat and vegetables in each of them. The cook will pour a bit of sesame oil on it so they don’t clump together quickly. For $6, I think it’s a steal.\n\nI also ordered their signature fried rice on a separate occasion. Pretty good I would say and it has cucumber bits in it, so quite unique!",
