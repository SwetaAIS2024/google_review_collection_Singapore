CS's price is normally higher, but they have good range of unique products that are hard to find in other supermarkets, especially baking products.\n\nIt was a delight when I found a range of dog treats available there where you can try bits and pieces of everything especially because my dog is picky. It's too bad that he only likes one type, but for other dogs, go for them!",

Located on B2 of Plaza Singapura, you're able to get some fresh food items, beyond all the usual fresh groceries you'd find at a supermarket. Really liked that they have quite an extensive cheese section as well, in case you need to grab some for your cheeseboard or a party.\n\nEventually got myself some duck rice for lunch, and you really can't complain about the quality nor the quantity, for 5SGD.",
