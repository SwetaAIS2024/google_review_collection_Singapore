      "text": "I have been a patient of Dr. Quan for my IBS.  One of the standout qualities of Dr. Quan is his willingness to truly listen to his patient. He will actively engage in a dialogue with us, ensuring that you not only understand the medical jargon but also help to craft out a treatment plan for me.\n\nI encountered various professionals during my struggle to normalize my life. What sets Dr. Quan apart is his exceptional patience. He does not rush through appointments; instead, he takes time to listen, advise and explain every aspect of the medical journey. Dr. Quan does not just prescribe treatments, he ensures you understand the necessity behind each recommendation, allows you to make decisions about your health within the constraints of your budget.\n\nWhile the diagnosis of IBS can be a time-consuming process, the assurance and confidence I feel with Dr. Quan make my journey more manageable. If you are seeking a doctor who combines expertise with patience, understanding and commitment, Dr. Quan is undoubtedly a commendable choice.",
