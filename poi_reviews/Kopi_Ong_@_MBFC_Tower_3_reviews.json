I came to realisation that they fill the whole cup with ICE CUBEs. The speciality is they use ice cubes which leave no room for liquid to stay. I will not recommend this shop.",

Hope your business last long with that bad attitude of yours! I ever visit again I'm gonna record your attitude down and viral it!",
