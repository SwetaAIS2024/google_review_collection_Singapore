Therese,5,"This was so good!!! We ordered the emperor chicken (half a chicken) for $16, just nice for two people! The chicken was fall off the bone tender, and the soup was soooo good I wish there was more! I don’t know how they cook it but the ginseng wasn’t bitter at all, we finished it too!

Definitely would come back again",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102611027380319473560/reviews
Stanley Pang,4,"十全鸭汤was very herbal and robust, not for the fainted hearted. Loved it.

Lotus root soup was very well balanced, loved it too.

西洋菜汤 wasnt the best i had, but still pretty decent.

Overall, place definitely worth a visit.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101763161466007280569/reviews
Super Fragrance,3,"Ordered great health duck soup for $8. Dou miao cost $7. It is ridiculously expensive.

Duck meat wise and other things to eat is really nothing nice. Soup was decent, is really for the health benefit if anything. Can finish the whole pot.

Dou miao taste good but it is too expensive maybe $3 or $4... Why need such a huge margin?",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105892392413528737906/reviews
Samuel Lam,5,"They make a variety of herbal and non herbal soups. Boiled for hours! To supplement it as a meal, there are side dishes to add to make it a full lunch or dinner!

Seriously quite good! Perfect for those wet rainy days.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103278705053675847980/reviews
Hrmgr,4,"Tried the Chinese Herbal Duck Soup 十全鸭汤, something rarely found in other soup stalls. In general the soup was good though I would prefer it to be more bitter with Dang Gui 当归 probably than the sweetness for the soup. It came with a bag of herbs and 4 pieces of duck meat. Overall not expensive for the price of $8.
Probably can try other soups it has too.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews
