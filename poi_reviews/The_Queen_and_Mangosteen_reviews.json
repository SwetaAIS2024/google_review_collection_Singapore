Young part timers are typically shy and does the bare minimum and thatâ€™s fineâ€¦ but the staff here were so bubbly, chatty and friendly. Definitely a huge plus point!\n\nThe shepherds pie was ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯. It was probably one of the best Iâ€™ve tried. The 3 little pig burger was really nice too! Fish and chips were a little disappointing but then again our standard for f&c is usually too high so itâ€™s actually not that bad.\n\nSticky date pudding was lovely too!\n\nWas quite pricy definitely. 3 mains, 1 side, 1 dessert and 4 drinks amounted to $200. Portion was big so itâ€™s not too bad.",

My husband thoroughly enjoyed the Guinness and had a delicious bacon butty. I went for the lychee salad, which I thought was a unique and amazing ideaâ€”the flavors worked together perfectly, and I was pleasantly surprised. We would definitely come back here again!",

      "text": "Come here for a family gathering.\n\nHad ordered a few dishes and found them to be alright, but would like to suggest a few tweaks to the menu to be more British.\n\nFor one, the sausages were too salty as compared to the ones in the UK. Nonetheless, the accompying sauces were good.\n\nFish ans chips were on point. Though malt vinegar should be by default served with the dish. Again, the curry sauce was nice to go with it. Would be interesting if they served with mushy peas as compared to the salad.\n\nThe beef and Guinness pie was a hit , as well as the seafood pie.\n\nThe ploughman salad should have a mix of three cheeses, perhaps can give this a thought.\n\nNachos was not really British but it is a hit for the table.\n\nOne gripe: the service could be more attentive to offer to remove the old plates as compared to just standing behind and only moving when the manager told them to...\n\nTotal bill: 350+ for 10 adults",

Plenty of place to sit and enjoy delicious western/ mexican food. Good beers to choose from and a nice, lively feel to the place. Would go again for a friend's hangout.",
