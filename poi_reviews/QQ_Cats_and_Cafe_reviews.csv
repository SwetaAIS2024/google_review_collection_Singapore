lee ipman,5,"This cat cafe is an absolute gem!
The cats here are incredibly well - cared for. Their fur is soft and shiny, and they all seem to have such friendly and relaxed personalities. Whether you're a seasoned cat lover or just looking for a unique experience, the cats will make you feel right at home.

The staff is outstanding. They provided great service, answering all my questions and giving useful tips on how to interact with the cats.

The cafe also offers a great selection of drinks and snacks. It's the perfect place to unwind, have a sip of coffee, and enjoy the company of these furry friends. I can't wait to visit again!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103808651544211440503/reviews
Yuan Sheng Wong,5,"Visited QQ Cats & Cafe with a friend and 2 kids and it's a lovely place. Very spacious and clean. The cafe is separated from the cats interaction area which is great and hygienic. The cafe side also offer a great view of the cats interaction area. There are tons of cats, all looks very healthy, clean and well groomed. Staff is very friendly and service is great. One of the best cat cafes I've visited and would definitely recommend people to visit this cafe!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116851135651848461979/reviews
Aminuddin Lee,5,"Came to this cafe to celebrate my daughter’s birthday on a weekday. The vibe were above our expectations! Food was delicious, the truffle fries is a must try when you visit them! Pizza was freshly made on the spot. Staff are friendly, they even went the extra mile to play a birthday song for us.

The cats are very adorable. Their explanations before entering the cat area was very clear and easy for kids to understand. Do visit them and celebrate your special occasion here. We will come back for more time with them!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100029039908216294497/reviews
Haikal Tan,5,"QQ Cat Cats & Cafe has always been my go-to spot whenever I want to bring my daughter to play with adorable cats or catch up with friends over a meal or drinks. The cafe is home to a wide variety of cat breeds, both kittens and adults, all of whom are well-behaved yet playful and full of character.

They offer a good selection of food and drinks, including alcohol, and often host special events like sake and wine tastings. It’s a fantastic place to relax and spend quality time with your loved ones. The staff are also very helpful and friendly, making every visit a pleasant experience. Highly recommended!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116994381402108232742/reviews
