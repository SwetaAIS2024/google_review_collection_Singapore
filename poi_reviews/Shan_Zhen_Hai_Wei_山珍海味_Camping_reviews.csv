Shirleen Goh,5,"Discover this BBQ restaurant by chance...
late tonight when cycling.

Located at the end of Pasir Ris Park (Area 4)..
by the beach
outdoor seating ..
and true to the name..
""Â±±ÁèçÊµ∑Âë≥ Camping""
This place is really very camping feel..
very relax..very chill place
to dine and drink with friends...

Good selection of beers and can sing karaoke with your friends.

A good place to hold private event here too.

Only had some yummy skewers as late supper but will come back again for other food which got very good review..especially the ZIBO Roasted Lamb..one of the special dishes.

Oh ya..the Chinese boss..
is friendly and helpful too.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112868210065049400174/reviews
Nikki Chong,1,"Great atmosphere, and service but the value is really really very bad. $33 for 2 pax for all this food + 1 beer.

Very not worth it although the food itself tastes quite good but $1.20/$1.50 for this amount of meat per skewer is laughable.

Fried was not bad, just a little oily.

Highly do not recommend to come, even ""just to try"" or ""just try once lor"". Just give it a miss and go to another place with better value üôè",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116410828640376065215/reviews

Jack Lee,5,"Food is really good. Kind staff, nice vibe, clean & chill.
Less salt option for children is thoughtful.
Fyi, there is a back door connected to the beach side, which google map doesn't tell.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100944476799796069688/reviews
Grace Zhong,5,"Amazing place!
Highly recommend this spot for skewers! Very flavourful especially the cumin skewers and a good spice level when selecting the spicy option.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108133886599009918687/reviews
