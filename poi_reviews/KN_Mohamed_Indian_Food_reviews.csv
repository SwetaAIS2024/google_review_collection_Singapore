Satheswaran Jeevaratnam,1,"Absolutely appalled by the rudeness and the terrible service of the staff from this place. There’s big sized older man with the headgear on who is just completely unfriendly and rude towards customers.

There were no cutleries left and upon checking this with them, he just gave a random spoon. Was unsure if it’s washed as he just took it out of nowhere and clearly it was not at the usual dedicated space.

In turn, I received a backlash of “are you out of your mind? Would anyone give a dirty spoon?” This was shocking.

Really spoiled my appetite and I regret the decision of heading to this stall. Absolutely certain that I’d not patron this place and recommend others to stay away unless they’re ok with rude encounters here.

I should have just headed to the other place (Aladdin’s Castle restaurant) nearby where the service is good and the staff is friendly.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104740238151605659712/reviews
