I personally think it is the best in town, their sauce is very unique, a little bit of sweetness that you don’t taste the bitter from black pepper like other famous touristy restaurants.  Must try menu are black pepper crab, fried dough fritter with sotong, and fried bee hoon.",

Even though only half of the tables were taken, we waited almost an hour for the crab dish. In the past, we were always served the dishes very fast. A check at the kitchen showed the chef was idle, not busy cooking dishes to be delivered. I won’t come back again after this experience. The price of a crab cost about $80. Not quite worth the price and experience.",

The meats are fresh and junky.\nThe claws are huge and filled with meat. The black pepper is a little spicy.\nThe chilli crab sauce is a little too sweet. Good to dip with the fried man tou.\nVegetables are fresh. A little over priced.",
