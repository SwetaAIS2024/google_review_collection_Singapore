Was intrigued by this little shop with no seating area in Ann Siang, finally picked it up for an office lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Pizza dough quality is extremely high and the flavours and options are innovative.\n\nI hope this opens into a fully fledged restaurant because Iâ€™m sure I will be a regular! Canâ€™t wait to see what new pizzas the team here create.",
