      "text": "I ordered the hawaiian & Formaggio both with stuffed crust\n\nEfficiency of Restaurant: 1000/10\n- Easy & breezy order process. Best part is? $5 ISLANDWIDE delivery. slay\n\n- Delivery is on time & prompt. Arranged for 8pm delivery, came just around there! üíØ\n\n- ++++++ point: Halal certified too!\n\nPizza review: 8.5/10\n- my parents & i love it! All of us agreed that the pizza dough is soft, totally agree with the other reviews written here. 10/10 for the dough!\n\n- stuffed crust however, would give it a 7/10, as i feel the cheese in the crust could be slightly more. Pull wise i couldnt rly review it bc i didnt heat the pizza up (it came slightly warm but totally understandable bc my place is q far from their location)\n\n- Formaggio is a bit salty as its a mixture of different types of cheese. But i still love it!\n\nSides Review: 1000/10\nROASTED DRUMLETS ARE SO GOOD\nWedges came w a small tub of barbecue sauce, yumssss\n\nOverall, 4pizza slayed! this is so much better than those famous pizza joints, and a great alternative to the big names that Im boycotting. i would definitely order this again & will try the ranch chicken next. üï∫üèª",

      "text": "Found Four Pizza on foodpanda but decided to buy directly as there's 1-for-1 pizza and read good reviews. I was not disappointed. I ordered two pizzas (BBQ Chicken and Pesto Veggie) and spicy roasted middle wings for delivery. Both pizzas were great and still hot upon arrival. I included a note to arrive nearer to 1pm as the delivery slot was 12.30-1pm, and the delivery person arrived around 1pm! Really appreciate it. Recommended Four Pizza to a friend and she'll be ordering for New Year celebration!\n\nSuggestion: Add a vegetarian option under Premium pizza.",
