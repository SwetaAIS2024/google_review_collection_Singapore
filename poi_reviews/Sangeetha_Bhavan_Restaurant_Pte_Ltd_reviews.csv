A T,5,"I am probably not an expert in Indian food, but I have been patronising this restaurant for the past 4 years. Recently they renovated and is brighter and cleaner!  Have not been posting previously. Love their samosas which I always ordered 10 to takeaway üòÇ.  Ordered my favourite Masala Dosa again. I love all the dips they served. A mix of flavours to my liking. Prices are really affordable for an air-con shophouse!  However was abit disappointed that we need to cancel our order for Gobi. Will be back again.  ‚ù§Ô∏è",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110290698573319690288/reviews

Sonu Agarwal,1,Worst food in Singapore. Everything they prepare in south Indian style. Zero knowledge of cooking any food. Useless cook and food. Very very unhygienic food as cook barely care what to provide to customer. kitchen is worst. Staff itself tells us they are using same clothes for cleaning shelf and plates too. Hygiene wise minus out of 10. Food Cost is ok. But Big NO. There are other better restaurants with good taste and hygiene at Farrer Park near Mustafa.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115597384230724876668/reviews
Nirmala Subramaniam,5,Pure Indian vegetarian shop located near Singapore Indian Fine Arts Centre. Puran poli was cold and not soft. Paneer pav was delicious. Tea and coffee was superb. Chocolate cake tasted but but too creamy for adults. Chappati was soft and served hot. Short of staff and service was slow,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104927793721361596669/reviews
