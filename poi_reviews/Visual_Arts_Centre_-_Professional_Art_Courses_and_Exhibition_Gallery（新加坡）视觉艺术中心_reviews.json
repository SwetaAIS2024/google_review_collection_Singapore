      "text": "This is truly one of the best adult art courses in Singapore! The entire experience is thoughtfully designed and incredibly professional ‚Äì from the teaching methods to the course structure and materials provided. The instructors are not only highly skilled but also very professional, patient, and passionate about helping every student grow.\n\nWhat I really love is that the centre offers a wide variety of mediums to explore ‚Äì acrylic painting, watercolour, line drawing, and more ‚Äì all taught in a clear and encouraging manner. Whether you're a beginner or have some experience, this is a good professional course to deepen your skills and creativity.\n\nThe location is super convenient, right in the city centre, and the studio environment is clean, inspiring, and well-equipped. It‚Äôs the perfect place for working adults to relax, recharge, and pursue art seriously or as a hobby.\n\nHighly recommend this studio to anyone looking for the best professional adult art learning experience!",

Everyone got involved and the end result was surprisingly impressive especially since we themed it around our company values. It was a great way to bond and do something different from the usual team activities. Both our instructors were helpful and friendly. Highly recommended for any group looking for a unique and meaningful team building experience. üëç",
