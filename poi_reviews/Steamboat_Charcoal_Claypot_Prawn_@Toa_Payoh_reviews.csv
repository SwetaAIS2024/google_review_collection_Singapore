Craig Gan,4,"First point: Halal, which is important for the Muslim friend I dined out with.  A claypot of prawn with broth set us back for $30+, while the hokkien mee that came with prawns was $8.80.  We were offered the choice of charcoal stove or the claypot being cooked at the stall itself.  We chose the stove and promptly regretted our bad decision because the fire was leaping out.  The stove had to be pushed as far away as the table could accommodate, as the fire was too intensely hot and scary!  Nonetheless it was an enjoyable experience.  The 2 of us couldn't finish everything.  The setting is a big coffee shop in the middle of an industrial estate in Toa Payoh.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102110249150882451112/reviews
Shawna Lim,5,"It‚Äôs a Halal outlet, great for our Muslim friends. There are more beef options here and even have lamb. Come with more people so you can order more ingredients to share.

Love the fresh prawns, flavourful broth and the sauce selection. My fav is the homemade chili sauce, very spicy!

They‚Äôve also installed huge fans to keep the customers cool while we enjoy our charcoal Claypot. Very thoughtful. There are also ample parking space.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104998866997771855288/reviews
