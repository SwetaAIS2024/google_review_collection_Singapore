ipis lean,1,"Thank you for the birthday wishes on my girl's birthday.
The IMM branch looks great after renovation. However, the staff service should be maintained well too.

Your staff keeps on asking me to scan the QR code to order food. To be honest, I don't like to order through Ipad or QR code. Not only in your restaurant, as I went to other restaurants.
Sometimes just me and my girl, okay fine, I¬† will order my own.

I repeated 3 times to your staff Yun Yee, I prefer to order manually. Just do a quick order by asking everyone what they want, I don't want to keep on browsing it.

But at the beginning he already showed his impatience to me when he helped to manually order. My fault to request such service?

I think on 4 Dec, Thursday around 4pm, considered non-peak hour.
Quite a few staff there. He never showed his service manner to complete our order first but showed us that he was so busy, attended the next table, after that came back to our table, after that put us on hold again to attend to the customer waited at the entrance and the cashier point. Seemed like he was the one to run the whole restaurant.

When he came back to our table, I asked him already preceded our main course order? He showed me his impatience again and told me it was already done.

Then we continued the ice cream order.
(I am always thankful for so many vouchers for me. Of course, I really never go see, one by one, the terms and conditions.
Bukit panjang staff always explained to me well in a good manner.)

Oh my goodness, ordering ice cream also caused such an unpleasant experience.
I told him, one for one ice cream, as long no repeated, no need so complicated (because I also didn't hear what the kids ordered well, and I don't hope to take too much time, then I randomly chose an ice cream to order since it is one-for-one). But he told me, I am the one to make him confused.
Seriously, I think this guy had an attitude problem!

The whole dining period, the main course put on the table and no one to serve the cutlery. We had to take the chili sauce on our own.
The birthday cake was served, no cutter, with the cutlery knife unable to cut it. My girl's friends waited for the ice cream cake¬† to be served. You can imagine the situation being so embarrassing.

I am not a nasty customer and make the staff so difficult. Honestly, the person's impatience is not suitable for work in the service industry. I never expected tip top service from your restaurant, but at least a little respect. Not every customer likes or is able to order food through the machine or phone.

Well, I will continue to support your restaurant of course. I hope your restaurant continues doing good business!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113106149906072157226/reviews
Kelly Tan,1,"We had an appalling unpleasant experience at the SingPost outlet and was asked to bring it up to Swensens HQ. I had spoken to the customer service manager Frankie and had also written in to relate the matter as requested by Frankie so he can investigate the matter.

I was given an apologetic reply a week later and was offered $30 voucher as compensation. While it is a nominal amount, I accepted it. However, it has been at least 5 weeks since and nothing was received. I sent a note to advise nothing was received and there has been silence.

It is a shame that despite the effort to provide our feedback, it turned out it was just mere lip service provided by the HQ manager. There was no intent on Swensens part to make amends nor improvement and our feedback is certainly not valued. It is no wonder that we had been given such poor service and attitude by the restaurant manager.

As the restaurant reputation has gone down the drain among our family and friends, this has just quicken our decision to rule out Swensens completely.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115054000490885835845/reviews
LH,5,"I often dine at Swensen Ang Mo Kio outlet. This outlet seems to be short of manpower especially during the weekends. All staff work efficiently and with speed. I am especially impress by Irene's customer service. Despite her seniority in age, she is able to take the stress and attend to the endless demands of the diners promptly. If matters are not within her control, such as the long wait for a dish to be served, she will explain patiently and cordially to the diners. She is a worthy employee and well deserve commendation by Swensen.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108270884913757714006/reviews
Alice Tavamani,5,"I was at Jurong Point Swensen‚Äôs last evening. I am very impressed with the customer service as well as the speed of serving ordered food. The smiling face of interaction by the staff makes the ambience better and I really enjoyed my birthday dinner very happily. Previously I hated to go to JP Swensen due to their poor service and I needed to wait long for my ordered food. I used to be a regular customer to Swensen but I moved away due to bad experiences.

Food served is hot and yummy. Just a little caution with the marination of salmon fish and the curry. The salt had overpowered the dish. As for the rest we had ordered yesterday, I would give a 5 star rating. üëçüëè

I am glad there is a change in service. I value customer service more compared to the cost of food. I would return to JP Swensen when opportunity arise.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103644175978086085403/reviews
Alicia Sim,5,Recently just had my son's 21st birthday party at Swensens Plaza Singapura. I want to thank Elaine and team for their good service and efforts in making the party a successful one. All the food were prepared beforehand and were served when our guests came.One small hiccup was that a salad that we ordered was served late together with the dessert.Overall was happy with the service and food.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116877513654021945560/reviews
