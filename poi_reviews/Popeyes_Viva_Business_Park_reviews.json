Popeyes is affordable and their chicken wings are not spicy for kids too. The meal is reasonably priced. They provide gloves so that your hands won't get dirty too. An alternative to other chicken fast food if in the area.",

Super disappointed as i really love the potatoes. No idea what the packer was doing but a SPOON was even provided ? Yet no mashed potatoes was inside. Pls fulfil the orders properly. We paid $ for that to be delivered to us in COMPLETE sets.",
