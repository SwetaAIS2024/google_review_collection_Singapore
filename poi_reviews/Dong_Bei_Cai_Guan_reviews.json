      "text": "Sweet & Sour Pork was superb. Still so crisp after being drenched in the addictive sauce. Best I've ever tried. Mantou and grilled enoki mushrooms also good. The roasted lamb leg also can try. Can skip the shredded potato, cauliflower pot and grilled leeks. If possible, sit indoors in air-conditioned comfort; we sat outdoors because of the grilled lamb leg and was quite affected by the smoking and shouting and vomiting at the outdoor section.",

      "text": "Decided to check this place out for dinner earlier. Parked outside open air of midview bldg, tho they have basement Carpark. Took lift and walked thru offices til the end of the block.\n\nPlace run by Chinese. Not the cheapest. But made up for by its authenticity. Had cold veg, soup with winter melon and mutton, some bbq mutton and roast belly, and roasted brinjal. Plus a tsingtao. $8 per bottle.\n\nWhat I like, is the food doesn’t have MSG, and the bbq sticks are pretty gd. The mutton soup isn’t too heavy. V slight tinge in smell. Brinjal has its flavor from the generous garlic dressing. Cold veg was not bad. Good appetizer.\n\nAll in all, 55$, incl taxes. Gd meal.",

      "text": "Second time visiting this place and I really like the food that is served here, which is northern Chinese cuisine.\n\nWe ordered the suan cai yu which was really good and tasty though not spicy at all. The bbq dishes were also good; we had the mutton skewers, beef tripe skewers, corn skewers and bbq leek. We also ordered the deep fried yellow croaker. This dish was the only one that is not as great. The fish was had a strong fishy taste. We previously tried the lamb ribs which were so good but rather expensive.\n\nThe restaurant is located in an industrial area which is rather hidden and may not be the easiest to get to if you do not have a car. There is an indoor seating as well as an outdoor seating. Both are good depending on the weather.",

Ordered the spicy frog legs and sour vegetable fish slices. Priced reasonably. Tasty and the portion was big. The BBQ meats is good and reasonably price. Fried rice not so good. Suitable for families to gather and enjoy spicy Northern Chinese food",

Overall still a good option in Bukit Batok for skewers and beer. Came here for lunch but I think the outdoor area would be a nice place to chill on a Saturday night.",
