Coco Yu,1,"The church looked very nice... however, there is no air conditioning, making it very hot inside. There was a performance at night for a school choir and someone fainted from a heatstroke in the middle of that performance. The staff there had to call an ambulance.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106086377322265902189/reviews
Wei Seng Woon,5,"My first time here was when I jogged by one evening from home. Had heard about this historically and architecturally significant church last time and bookmarked it on Google Maps, so I was happy to have a chance to see it for myself. Second time here was after lunch at The White Rabbit a short walk away (2 months ago!). You wont think that this is in Singapore, the kind of design. It's quite pretty and very charming from the outside, and very well maintained. Wished I could go in though! Caught a glimpse from outside in, it is naturally ventilated inside... keeps its authenticity!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109537932225775392030/reviews
Moi,3,"À bit far away from Napier MRT with no sheltered pavement. Unless you drive or take a taxi to the church, it would be unthinkable on rainy days. Nevertheless, seems like a nice church.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117021795429732267661/reviews
