Benny Tan,1,Ordered delivery medium but came as small..not only 1 time but many times ..very dissapointed.  Your cost of noodles isn't alot and yet you want to cheat your customers.  No wonder 3.5 stars review. Very bad. Just close down,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111666036404965895900/reviews
Joice Tjen,1,"I like their food. However, they have issue with queue / crowd management. Came to the stall and order without any issue. 30 minutes AFTER ORDERING, we are still waiting for the food. The queue number never moves. Meanwhile, I can hear the Grab orders keep coming and they are still taking in order from walk-in customer.

The place is now so crowded with people waiting for their food (both dine-in and deliveries). They should have stopped taking order if they have too much order to handle!

I can see the staff frantically cooking the food with balls flying as they try to move as fast as they can.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100492087803175128162/reviews
