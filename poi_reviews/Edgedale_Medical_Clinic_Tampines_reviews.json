      "text": "Convenient location, great doctor and support staff. My go-to clinic. About 13 weeks ago, I had a stroke scare. I went to the clinic on a Monday morning and was concerned that I might have Bell's Palsy. The lady hijabi clinic doctor activated the paramedics, just in case I had a stroke. Everything went like a blur and I am truly sorry that I couldn't get all your names. She didn't want to take chances as I had facial droop and weakness on my left side. Was also starting to run a high fever from flu and only after the MRI results came out, could they eliminate stroke and confirm that I had Bell's Palsy. From the bottom of my heart, thank you to the dedicated healthcare team from Edgedale Medical Clinic (Tampines), SCDF and CGH. Your love, kindness and medical expertise have given me an easier recovery.",
