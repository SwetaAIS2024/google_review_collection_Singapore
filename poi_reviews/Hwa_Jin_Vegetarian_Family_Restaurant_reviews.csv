Kly,5,I’m not a vegetarian but I still enjoy the food here so much. Must try the fish curry! The gravy is super tasty and goes very well with white rice! Another must try is the fried oyster mushroom with tomato sauce. The fried hor fun has a strong wok hey and very tasty too😋,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104106844849786226128/reviews
Ada,5,"BEST Mala dry noodle ever!

They used to have the best dry noodle (干捞面) IMO, but ever since they changed the base (it used to have more mushroom and gravy), I switched to their Mala dry noodle and has never once looked back! Only downside is, the spicy level changes every time, either too spicy or not spicy at all haha.

Their set (rice + soup), I love the rice, super tasty. The soup, i think it largely depends on what is the soup of the day…. As I usually feel really thirsty after having meal there.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118337726150683689365/reviews

Calvin Chong,5,"This Bukit Gombak vegetarian restaurant serves 2 best dishes I have always savour whenever I visited the outlet.

These are the ""curry fish"" and ""kambing soup"" dishes.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100673547431431908607/reviews
Sean Phua,5,"Delicious and hearty vegetarian food at affordable prices. They're also generous with their portions as even a small sized serving of their 干捞面 is surprisingly filling.

Menu also has a decent variety of options besides their standard 菜饭 style dishes.

Although the place is not small by any means, seating can be difficult to find during peak hours.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111873474510600087406/reviews
