Carmen L,5,"My friends and I love this no-frills place for K, and there's also a $40 deal (on weekdays only IIRC) where you can sing from 2 to 6 pm. We booked a small room with 2 microphones. The mics are also super loud though you can adjust the reverb. We didn't bother with the fancy lighting and we just got right down to singing!

Do take note that when your time is up, the song will be cut off halfway and you won't get to sing the entirety of it!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113784368027194022523/reviews

Khai Liang Koh,5,"If you love singing, Sing My song Kinex is a location that you should not miss. The rooms are equipped with great sound system and if you are enthusiastic or hardcore enough, come sing at the hall that is well equipped with fantastic sound system ( I kid you not) as well. You will definitely sound great! (In my opinion) Staff are friendly and a joy to interact with. Give it a try and I’m sure you won’t regret. If you are going to sing in the hall, please make a reservation beforehand. Table are usually booked especially on weekends or public holiday.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107664648037662625358/reviews
