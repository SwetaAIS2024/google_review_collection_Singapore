This unassuming stall serves delicious and authentic Thai food that is wallet friendly.\nI have been there several times, and this time, being a quiet evening, our food was delivered to our table. The Tom Yum Soup was tasty and not overly spicy, just nice. One of my favourite dishes is the Crab Fried Rice, which is enough for 2. The Prawn Cakes were excellent too.\nWhen we couldn't finish our food, they were nice enough to pack the food up for us to bring home, and after packing everything nicely including chilli sauce, they brought them back to our table. Really great service. Highly recommended.",
