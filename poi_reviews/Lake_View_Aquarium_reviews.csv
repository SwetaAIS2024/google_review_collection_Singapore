Isaac Goh,5,"The fish has a lot of variety and the price is really affordable.

I got mine goldfish for only $3 a piece which is rare nowadays. Uncle a little queer but nonetheless very knowledgeable about fish and small turtles. I already buy from him 3 times! Hope you find this little gem too.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101858476216886215482/reviews

Yao,1,"Owner very rude. I walked in on a late afternoon and when I’m looking at the fish, out of a sudden he pull down and shut the front gate!! I felt afraid cos I’m the only person in the room besides him and I’m a girl. When I asked he just said can go by back door.

Muhammad Irshad,1,"Have visited this place 4 to 5 times now. The Uncle was asking rude and dismissive on every single visit. Only plus point is price, but not worth going there as there are many other affordable aquarium shops as well. Hopefully management changes soon, cant believe the place is not out of business given it's horrible customer service. Do not recommend at all! Plus all my fishes died within a day of buying from here ☠️",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106688149842885868147/reviews
Choo Seng Teo,1,"Cannot decide which fish to buy and I only got space for only one more fish at home.  Request to take photo to ask friends for opinion. Boss of the shop not happy and he said out loud to his friends “$3/- only also need to photo, want to buy, buy lah” in a very bad tone. He wasn’t busy n no customers at that time. Very rude!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101688835292969614622/reviews
