andyloe,3,"Ordered on foodpanda with free delivery. Items ordered butter squid, hot plate tofu and prawn paste fried chicken. All items were decent and flavour like what you find in most Zi char. Portion was reasonable and the food came relatively on time.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110109116555826289679/reviews
Edward Wong,3,"Paid $72.40 (after 10% discount) for 5 persons dinner. The prawn paste chicken was tasty - crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The san lou hor fun got a lot of wok hei. The salted egg prawns were fresh and tasted alright. The sweet & sour pork was just acceptable. However, the fu yu you mak was without wok hei and the ginger lala was a disappointment. Service was friendly and efficient.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110173188680901424865/reviews
Mun Chong,5,"Fried red cargo rice with fish slices and sotong
And extra veg
Plus one perfect fried egg sunny side up
Very fragrant wok hei and not oily
Now that's what I call a true chef - a huge thanks to the whole kitchen who's willing to work together and handle so masterfully an ordinary man's lunch request into the memory of a lifetime
You guys made my day!!
Note I brought my own 2 day old cold leftover red cargo rice
It stunned me that they took it like it was the most natural thing in the world... They knew I had dietary restrictions
Most of my photos are takeaway food cos I usually don't finish the whole portion at lunch so I bring back home about two thirds almost everyday",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103491652776344320179/reviews
Toh Teck Kim,1,"Bad experience eating here. Been to this place several times since I stay near, but they have skipped my order so often and made me wait for nothing.

Louis S,1,"Less meat portion. As for my ordered Dry Fried Hor Fun, it is supposed to served with tender beef in Deliveroo menu.

However , actual meal received has NONE of beef. Only 2X Small Prawn.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104983190229357312971/reviews
