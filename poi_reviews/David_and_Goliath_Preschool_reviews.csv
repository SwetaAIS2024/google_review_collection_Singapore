FangYin Lee,5,"This is a very caring loving pre-school. Many teachers are senior teachers. The classrooms are very spacious. The school hold morning assembly in a large and high ceiling hall, with music and movement. Very frequently, the teachers take turn to play piano while leading the singing during assembly. I think this is excellent start of the day for all children. My children behaviour improved after we changed to this school.

I have no regret putting my children to this team of teachers in this good environment.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103011725832385978203/reviews
