      "text": "Attended the 22th Sunday 9am service,being really offended by one usher female staff wearing Santa hat very rudely use her hands Infront of my face almost hit my face for almost a few minutes while I am worshipping. And she continued to do it twice to me. Best of all she is very arrogant and proud of what she did . I am disappointed that church has this type of rudely usher staff hiding among them. Very sad this church harbour this behaviour of the ushers .and some even cut q to take coffee without asking those already queuing. This type of behaviour should not even be tolerated outside church not to mention it happened within.what a shock that grace assembly turn out this way nowadays.",
