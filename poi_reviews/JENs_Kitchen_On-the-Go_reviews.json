Honestly what's so difficult about cooking fish and chips. It should have taken 15 minutes maximum. Wouldn't recommend for the long wait and average food.",

When asked why we were not given proper utensils, they said because this is the way for halal and that these cutlery are more expensive than normal?! The bolognese we ordered was just sphaghetti with tomato sauce and the laksa was tasteless. Will never come back here again and will not recommend.",
