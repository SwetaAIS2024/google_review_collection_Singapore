      "text": "Had seen this place quite number of times while driving pass and thought of taking away one burger üçî ever first time. The guy at the counter appeared not to be interested in serving and pushing himself to work. It seems it‚Äôs due to his super hot working environment inside, he sounded rude and frustrated. I ordered one burger to go and later while waiting for my order realised the staff was continuously wiping his sweat on forehead with his elbow. Unfortunately I simply discarded the food after collection. Management must look into the welfare of the staff and hygiene for such outlets.",

      "text": "On my way to Sultan Mosque at Arab street in Singapore, i saw this place. So later i come again, as a turkish person i wanted to see if this place is real a turkish kebab place or just a place that use the name and pictures from internet. It feelt more like the last part, but still taste like a kebab.\nI did order a chicken kebab wrap and my wife baked pasta with chicken kebab and nuggets.\nMy wrap did look more like a Burrito than a D√ºr√ºm, the pasta was with pesto topped with chicken kebab and mozerallo top of it. Seems like the pasta was premade, did not taste bad their chichken kebab was too spicy for my wife.\nThe nuggets was good.\nThe price was total 38 SGD, which is fair to the big portions you get.\nSo if you really want a kebab in Singapore then try tvis place but be aware it is not turkish, the workers was definetly not.\nIt says on their menu it is halal, but was little curious there was not the national Halal Singapore certificate.\nThe last bad thin was no a place to eat at, more like take away since not tables but just some small chairs outside.",

I don‚Äôt understand all the positive reviews and probably won‚Äôt be coming back. The bread wasn‚Äôt fresh either, which is almost an insult to serve. cheers!",

Its texture is a symphony of contrasts ‚Äî the outer layers golden and slightly crunchy, giving way to a soft, luscious interior that is both satisfying and rich. Topped with a drizzle of sweet syrup and a scattering of pistachios or rosewater, each bite is a harmonious blend of sweetness, warmth, and a touch of floral freshness. Perfect for those who appreciate the art of dessert, kunafa is as much a visual delight as it is a flavor experience ‚Äî luxurious, comforting, and undeniably indulgent.",
