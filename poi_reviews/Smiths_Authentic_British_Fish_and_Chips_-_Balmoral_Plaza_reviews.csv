Benjamin Park,4,The food is not too bad but not the best fish and chips. The chips are nice but it does not come with tartar sauce you need to pay for it $1.60. Although the vinegar and salt is not bad. The ketchup is diluted so it flows easily. I prefer thick ketchup. The fish is nice although the portion is not that big. The coleslaw is delicious but expensive. I don’t really enjoy the steak pie as much. It’s closing soon and since it’s a mixed bag I’ll give it 4/5 stars,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117599988314464672388/reviews
Su Min Lim,5,"Mr Smith was there: busy as a bee, welcoming guests, showing them to a table, clearing tables….
I showed him the sketch and added hairs in his chest.
One goes up to the cashier, orders, pays, and gets a buzzer.  When the buzzer buzzes, one collects the order.
Mine was battered hallibut and chips. Fish was fresh, tasty, lightly buttered and fried to perfection. Generous portion of chips, nicely fried. The provided lemon went well with the fish. So did their malt vinegar. I thought the ketchup and HP sauce were overpowering.
I has a Diet Coke.
Wife had chicken pot pie… pronounced good.

William Ow,2,"28 Mar 25 - Went at 7.30pm and after queuing, told me only take away because they ran out of ultensils for dining in. The staff were overwhelmed and dishes piled up.

The fish and chip was soggy and soft. It did not come with lemon. There is also no disposal forks or knifes because they ran out of them.

The taste was bland so I slathered vinegar and salt but it did not overcome the fishy taste. Ended up I tried different sauce at home.  The portion is good but it just made the process of eating torturous eating oily dough.

All in all, maybe I will have a better experience dining in and with the assort sauce. Honestly I wanted it to be good, it cost me $29.50 sgd. And I had wanted to leave a good review because it is closing. But alas, I find it below average.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102779766764269863375/reviews
Victoria Ng,5,"The minute I stepped in, I was warmly greeted by a wonderful lady. She immediately asked if I was Victoria and led me to my name table. There was my name on it and her sense of humour made me feel so honoured as she asked whether I felt honoured to have a table with my name on it... Hahaha! I ordered the Haddock and should have asked for it to be breaded for that extra crispy sensation. However I still enjoyed the Standard Fish and Chips. Somehow made me feel so nostalgic as if I'm back to my student days in Edinburgh! Had an awesome late lunch with my friend and we planned to go back before it closes in May!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113256242126785660635/reviews
Tony S (Foodsage),5,Love the fish and chips here.   Portions is good n big.  But remember this is English style chips not the USA way French fries that is crispy and crunchy.   So manage your expectations. The fish batter is not so crispy too like others.  But given that the fish is fresh and good   So if u are ok with that then this is for u.
