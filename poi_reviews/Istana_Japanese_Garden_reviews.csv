Bala Krishnan,2,They could have created magic with these gardens.  But disappointed.  No shade and it was blah.   Not worth the visit,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109989767287093054467/reviews
xiong jing,5,Very scenic and picturesque place with a serene and clear pond. There is many fishes inside swimming happily. There is also an arch bridge. Skilfully trimmed trees and bushes offer unique flora and fauna. A great pleasure walking through breathing in the fresh air. We enjoyed us thoroughly and would come again.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117049585208534108812/reviews
