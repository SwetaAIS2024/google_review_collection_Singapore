Kiran S,4,"Nice cafe located in Co Yuan CC. A great place to take a break from cooking at home and enjoy some tasty food. The dishes are good, and the chicken wings are a must-try ‚Äî really crispy and full of flavour. A cosy spot for a quick meal or a casual bite with friends.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102797829528594168216/reviews
Dan Lin,4,"It‚Äôs a heartland cafe experience. As such, it‚Äôs not right to compare against fancier and more expensive cafes in town or in affluent neighborhoods. At the wallet friendly price points, the food, ambience and service is pretty good. I would only say that the fried chicken and waffles could be seasoned a tad more - whether with salt or garlic powder or paprika.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112581484236511629366/reviews
Daniel Koh,5,"[SOD Cafe]
üåü 9/10
üìç Ci Yuan CC
üí∞ Expected damage $15-$25

Value for money and no service charge. This place has been around for a long time and their serving is huge for their prices. My personal recommendation is their mentaiko pasta with the fried chicken. The sauce makes the pasta very savoury which goes well with the crispy chicken. Wanted to try their soft shell crab mentaiko pasta but they only serve it at the upper thompson branch.

The mentaiko Mac N' Cheese is very decadent due to the heaping amount of cheese which caters to many young cheese lovers. Fried chicken and waffle was good and a go-to for those craving a sweet and savoury meal once in a while.

The dessert - devils chocolate cake, is the icing on the cake as it was so thick and sinful. When paired with the ice cream, you are guaranteed to be seeing a doctor soon which is the job of a good dessert. Definitely recommend this place üëç",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107471666959556168769/reviews

Lance Tan,4,"Located just at the entrance of Ciyuan Community centre. Serves a wide array of brunch items as well as ala carte mains. They have drinks that are unique and tasty as well.

I recommend the ‚Äòbuild your own pasta‚Äô as I‚Äôve been trying all the different variations for a while now and non of them disappointed me.

This place tends to get really busy on weekends so I recommend checking it out on weekdays.
They also have their own loyalty system where you can accumulate points for discounts.

Family friendly and suitable for casual dining.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103171518127946119222/reviews
