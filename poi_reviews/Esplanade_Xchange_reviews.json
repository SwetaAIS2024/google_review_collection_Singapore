I wouldn’t travel here for the noodle but if I am around here, this is a good location to makan.\n\nPricing is affordable for the location. Abalone noodle with a lot of ingredients at $6.\n\nThat’s what you pay for a noodle in most heartland food court.",

      "text": "Was here for dinner with a friend last evening. We had Chicken Pho and Vietnamese Rice Paper Spring Roll. The chicken broth was tasty with a lime squeezed into it. However, it was way TOO SALTY. Chef must adjust the salt level to improve this dish. It is lovely to see lots of spring onions in the soup. The spring roll is lovely with the right amount of crunch. I would recommend that they serve plain water for a small charge instead of selling tetra pack plain water at $3.00.",

      "text": "Have always walk past and never tried any of the store. Today is my first and also last tine to step into this food court. I ordered Thai basil pork rice takeaway from the Thai Stall. The fried sunny side egg  & basil pork were already pre prepared. Stall holder is a gentlemen,  he didn’t go to kitchen to do any stir fry for my order. He prepared my order by taking the pork n egg from some pot. Seeing that, I had a gut feel this is goingto be disappointing. And it is, this is the worst Thai basil pork rice I ever had. No basil taste,  no Chilli padi , sauce used wasn’t fish sauce , just taste weird. My daughter commented it’s worse than her school canteen. Feel cheated, it’s not Thai .....",
