      "text": "We got the sambal fish and cream sauce fish that comes with 2 sides of choice per dish. We also got the happy hour beer at $5 per bottle, limited to 1 per pax.\n\nFood: very good taste, good prices for a bar setting. Would come here again for lunch or dinner. The sides exceeded expectations.\n\nAmbience: they have live music at night but not at the time of our visit. Indoor and outdoor seatings available. There is a billiard table outside. Would visit occasionally for the music.\n\nService: order via QR code, service time is consistent with other bars",

      "text": "Visited Sunday 8September at 12.30pm.\n\nSuper unfriendly and rude female staff.\n\nI ordered at counter because they insist we cannot use QR code to order lunch sets. I told the staff I wanted BBQ pork chop aglio olio then I hear her say okay pork chop. So I repeated and emphasised BBQ pork chop aglio olio. She then gave me a frustrated face and said “next time must say earlier”. I replied “I did”. Then she repeated herself “next time must say earlier cause they got pork chop alone and pork chop aglio olio”. I said “I DID??” She is SO rude. It was her own ears that didn’t listen carefully or couldn’t hear properly due to the loud music. And she had the audacity to retort back.\n\nPlease ensure your staff who’s doing customer service is decently respectful. Such a horrible experience. The food here is good. Thanks to her horrible attitude, my experience is bad. I would have enjoyed my experience better if the staff was decently respectful to her customer.",

I heard them saying they were \"sub\" for 14 June 2024 performance. Hopefully the owner can hire them as regular performers on Friday night since they are really good.",

Both indoor and outdoor areas able to listen to music.  If you prefer to have conversation, I suggest outdoor will be better.\n\nThe food was surprisingly quite good.  We ordered the spaghetti with salmon, spaghetti with sausage, fried luncheon chip. Adding on a Beer tower to go along with our food.\n\nA nice place to chill out for those staying in the East and don't feel like going too far (central) for a night out.",
