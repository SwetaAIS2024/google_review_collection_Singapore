Skye Tan,5,"Six stars! My birthday stay at the Champion Suite was absolutely perfect!

Huge congratulations to Dusit Thani Laguna Singapore for having such a stellar team. A special shout-out to Chester Low, the Assistant Front Office Manager, who provided an amazing experience from before we even arrived until after we left. The concierge and in-room dining teams also took excellent care of all our requests and needs.

My family and friends felt so welcomed and well looked after.

The suite was beautifully maintained and boasted a stunning view of the golf greens and the pool.

Breakfast was also incredibly generous with both the portions and the variety of choices. We will definitely be back!

Special mention to Chester Low as well as Tiffany Loh for the hospitality!

Thank you again, Dusit Thani and your wonderful team!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108662179138653546780/reviews
Roger Hawke,5,"The Hotel was one of the best we have stayed in over the years.
Exceptional service, immaculately clean and excellent food. Whilst a little out of the way from the hubbub of the city it is peaceful. Free shuttle service to various points including Changi Airport/Jewel is a real bonus.
The staff are exemplary and a credit to the GM Todd.
There is no doubt we would stay there again üôÇ",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117829932024746986520/reviews
Tan Li Ting,4,"Seeking a serene escape within Singapore, I recently indulged in a staycation at Dusit Thani Laguna Singapore, a resort that seamlessly blends luxury with nature.

I stayed in the Deluxe Laguna Pool View room where the highlight was the floor-to-ceiling windows that opened up to a panoramic view of the sprawling golf course and the award-winning pool below. The sight of airplanes ascending in the distance added a dynamic backdrop to the tranquil scenery.

The resort boasts three distinct swimming pools: a lap pool for serious swimmers, a relaxation pool with submerged loungers, and a children‚Äôs pool. Spending the afternoon lounging by the poolside, with the gentle breeze and serene environment, truly felt like a retreat from the city‚Äôs hustle. For those feeling active, the 24-hour gym, tennis, paddle courts, and the Laguna 9-Hole Putting Course provided plenty of options.

Dining at Greenhouse was a highlight. The forest-themed restaurant, accentuated by abundant greenery and natural light, created an inviting atmosphere. The restaurant features multiple open kitchens, each specializing in different cuisines‚ÄîThai, Japanese, Indian, Mediterranean and Chinese. The Thai dishes stood out, while the fresh seafood, including succulent lobsters and snow crab legs, was an absolute treat. Breakfast was equally indulgent, with a hearty selection to start the day right.

Whether you‚Äôre lounging by the pool, savoring international cuisines, or simply enjoying the scenic views from your room, the resort feels like a sanctuary worlds away from the city‚Äôs bustle.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104947271214129334571/reviews
