Love the otak which i am going back for more. Chendol was thick and fragrant.  Worth the drive there.\nEnvironment is good for family dinner and group gathering.",

As a result, the ambient noise was almost unbearable with just 4 tables dining in. The sound of people chattering and dishes clanging was echoing throughout our dining experience and my group could hardly talk to one another. My apple watch registered up to 90db of noise while we were there. I would definitely reconsider coming again if the place is full of patrons.",

It looks brighter… though I do miss their old batik tablecloths!\n\nWe’ll definitely be back to try other dishes. Lots of parking is available just opposite the restaurant, making it very convenient.",
