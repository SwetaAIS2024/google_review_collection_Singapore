Tan Lee Ching,5,"Dr Seow is a very honest, patient and kind doctor.  He was able to offer an accurate diagnosis of my dental problem.  He treated my gum infection successfully.

As such, I didn't need to spend $3000 plus dollars for a root canal treatment as advised by another dentist at Q and M.

Thank you, Dr Seow.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106270678844404423847/reviews
Roy,5,"I am impressed by the thorough and efficient care I received. Dr Amanda is very professional and friendly. My polishing was done meticulously and made for a pleasant, comfortable experience. I have been keen to have my teeth whitened and finally got it done after Dr Amanda's efforts in concisely explaining the process and benefits of clinic vs home whitening. The OPG XR was also obtained very quickly during the consult, which allowed me to get on with my day asap. An excellent experience altogether thanks to the wonderful staff!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101706887822895535452/reviews
