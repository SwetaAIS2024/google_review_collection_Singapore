Ms. Rai, the principal, has been very welcoming and approachable, making the transition smooth for both parents and children. Our child’s teacher, Ms. Nantheni, is kind, patient, and encouraging, helping him feel comfortable in a new environment. It’s reassuring to see how she engages with the little ones, making learning fun while also helping them settle into the routine with care. The rest of the staff are also friendly and attentive, creating a warm and safe space for the little ones.

Overall, we are glad with our decision to join Little Footprints Bukit Purmei. Seeing our child gradually adjust and enjoy his time there has been a great relief, and look forward to seeing him grow and learn here!”",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117655012907233746034/reviews
