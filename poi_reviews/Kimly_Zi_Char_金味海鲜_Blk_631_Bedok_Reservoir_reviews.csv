Ryan Wong,1,"Placed my order via GrabFood at 6:37pm, and was given a pick-up time of 6:53pm.

Arrived on time but the order wasnâ€™t ready. I understand that itâ€™s Motherâ€™s Day and the volume of orders may be high. I decided to be patient and wait.

At 7:15pm, two self pick-up orders were ready, but neither were mine. I checked the slips - one was for GrabFood and the other was for Foodpanda. Both were placed at 6:58pm, and were given pick-up time of 7:15pm. So orders placed 20 minutes after mine faced no issue and were ready on time as promised.

My order was only ready at 7:23pm, a whole half hour after the promised pick-up time. Clearly thereâ€™s no effort to ensure customers are served on a first-come-first-served basis.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101949755172043206014/reviews
