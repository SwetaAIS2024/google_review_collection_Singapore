Edwin Lian Jian Han,5,"I'd like to extend my sincere gratitude to Shahul for reaching out to me with a fantastic job opportunity. After being retrenched in November 2024 and experiencing little success in my job search and job interviews, Shahul contacted me via MyCareersFuture on March 21st. From that point, he diligently worked to secure me an interview with the company. Approximately two weeks later, I had the interview, and Shahul consistently followed up with me afterward to see how it went. About a week after the interview, I received the wonderful news that I was their first choice. Shahul also skillfully negotiated a competitive salary that met my expectations. Finally, within another week, all the necessary documents were prepared before my start date.

Over the course of these four weeks, Shahul consistently impressed me with his professionalism and dedication. Without his proactive outreach regarding this opportunity, I would likely still be in the frustrating cycle of endlessly applying for jobs. Thank you, Shahul!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106983670427015975441/reviews

Hui Shan,1,"I had an extremely disappointing experience with Nura's handling of my employment case. From the start, I was given high hopes for a very competitive salary, only to be repeatedly asked to lower my expectations after each interview. Even after finalizing salary negotiations and accepting the offer, I was suddenly asked to sign additional forms that had never been disclosed earlier in the process.

One of these forms stated that I would have to pay them one month’s salary if I did not stay in the role for three months—something that was never mentioned before. When I raised my concerns, the recruiter’s response was dismissive and unprofessional, questioning why I was uncomfortable signing and even suggesting that I ""ignore"" the problematic clause and sign the rest. Such an approach is highly unprofessional, especially coming from someone with 15 years of experience in the industry.

Transparency and integrity are crucial in recruitment, and my experience with this firm fell far short of those standards. I would not recommend working with them.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103070612768502513507/reviews
