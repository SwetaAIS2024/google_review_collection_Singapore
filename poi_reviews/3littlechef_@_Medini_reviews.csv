妮妮,5,"Stumbled upon this cozy café tucked away in Medini – definitely a hidden gem! The place has a beautiful little garden that gives off super relaxing vibes. It’s perfect for high tea, catching up with friends, or just unwinding solo. Service was warm and friendly, which made the experience even better. If you're looking for a chill spot to escape the city buzz, this one’s worth checking out.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103584216165734223468/reviews
Calvin Loke,5,"Great food, great environment!

Some seating area comes with big mirror  to keep our dining experience more private and cozy.

Very cosy and friendly dining environment.
Always our favourite place to visit whenever we are nearby.
Earl grey burntcheese cake  is mostly our SOP after coffee！
They have a strawberry and mango tea is strongly recommended to go with this sweet ending!

Not forgetting to buy some dessert takeaway too ! Always selling fast!!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109300536768467357268/reviews
