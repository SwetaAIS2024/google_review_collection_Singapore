Agnatta Teng,5,"Tasty and affordable cai fan they have. 1 fish filet and 1 steamed minced meat egg was only $5. Value for money.

arChy,4,"Fairly new food court with the usual selection of local food and of course an Indian stall, western food, mala, dessert, zichar, economy rice and of course, drinks.

G,4,Tried Bedok Corner Hokkien Mee. Had their Hokkien mee and white Carrot cake. Decent enough. Coffee shop is in a new Hdb estate but doesn’t seem to have sufficient ventilation. Will probably continue to takeaway food from there only even when dining restrictions ease.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112916055706142007559/reviews
