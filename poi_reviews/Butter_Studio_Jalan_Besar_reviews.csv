Gopi Bala,4,"I happened to pass by the little cafe in Jalan Besar and went in to have a scoop of ice cream  last Saturday 12 Apr.

I ordered the lychee raspberry and it was pretty good I must say.

The service was great as the person at the counter did inform me that the ice cream stock had just arrived and all ice cream were soft, which Is how I like it usually. I was promptly served a scoop for $5.50.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114775727475904526433/reviews
