Kelvin Tay,4,"Went for the Orientation, not the best in term of maintenances appearance, a bit run down and the garden is a joke. Students are well behaved but times will tell. My child is settling in quite fast, already make few friends. Seems to have few foreigners student. Principal speak lengthy on nurturing a better person, treat others with respect, and pride itself having the best admin but perhaps walk the talk by responding to emails first. Send numerous email to school yet after 3months still no reply. If not for the CCA you offered and relatively close proximity, lesser of the bullying case, i might having second thoughts.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109093096409977575806/reviews
