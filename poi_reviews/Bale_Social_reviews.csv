tze tzeying,5,"We visited on Thursday Night and found it plenty uncrowded. The atmosphere was fantastic, with the empty golf park providing a serene background and a gentle natural breeze keeping us cool.
While food selection wasn‚Äôt extensive, it offere ample choice for small gatherings. It‚Äôs an ideal spot to enjoy a beer and some lite bite with your close one. We particularly appreciated their unique fusion of western and Indian flavours, which add a special touch.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107061733926151999852/reviews

Sebatian Wilder,2,"Located in a remote resort 30 minutes from town.  The atmosphere is good facing the green field,  the clubhouse is well decorated. Unfortunately the food is below mediocre. The creamy chicken pasta is a fusion dish using curry leaves and spices. The combination is a bit odd but the thing that threw me off is the use of fresh onion in pasta.  ü§¢ the service is quite slow as well. Have to wait for half an hour despite there being only 2 other guests.
Overall it's hard to justify a long journey here for food.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117146563852180445127/reviews
Jenzen Chow,5,"Very lovely and homely ambience, cozy hospitality. I had the Aussie burger (a lil more seasoning would be great), enjoyed it very much with the sweet potato. Cheers to the manager and her team for making this club vibrant!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100572182533837232268/reviews
