Christian Navien,5,"The burger tastes exactly like the ones in Malaysia! I haven’t had one in so long, and I’m so glad it’s delicious, it reminds me of my childhood memories. If you’re craving a burger, just visit this place. To be honest, it’s even better than the ones at the pasar malam. Those were expensive and not great but this place is the right spot to enjoy a proper Ramly burger.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108410482781190724111/reviews

Anthrax V3n0m,4,"Tucked away from most food locations. If you are working in the warehouses nearby, this humble food stall might seem unassuming at first, but it’s a true hidden gem. In an area where food vendors are hard to come by, this stall not only fills the void but sets the bar high with its delicious offerings—especially their top-tier Ramly burger and freshly cooked bryani.

Despite its remote location, the prices here are incredibly reasonable. You get great value for money, especially considering the quality of the food, variety of food selection and combo sets.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101110186271625843161/reviews
