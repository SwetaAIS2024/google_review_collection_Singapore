Rachael,1,"This outlet has extremely bad customer service, one of the workers gave us attitude when taking our order which made the process extremely uncomfortable and aggravating. Having good customer service is a basic requirement of the F&B industry, and this outlet falls short in that aspect. Do not come here if you expect to be treated the bare minimum.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112873722479523795150/reviews

Ceon Ng,1,"Ordered for takeaway. Double checked with the staff on duty if all orders are correct, including add ons, even so. When I reached home, found out order was wrong. Can't even serve properly when it's not crowded.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112868992703251005997/reviews
Moin Shah,1,"Might as well just close the shop guys. If you have no will to work donâ€™t work but donâ€™t mess with otherâ€™s meals. Ordered a sandwich after a hard day of work to only be cheated with this pathetic excuse for a beef sandwich.  Never am I ordering from here again. Looking through the reviews here, Iâ€™m not even surprised. If management is turning a blind eye to this, better to close the shop than tarnish the image and reputation of Subway with this outlet.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114046006809002897241/reviews
