Hsieh Chi Tung,5,"I joined Mr Espen’s class at the begin of J2. Throughout J1, my physics grades were constantly B and no matter how hard I tried, I was unable to improve my grades. After joining the class I started getting straight A for physics and physics became my best subject. His lessons are engaging and the tips and concepts he shares helped me understand physics much better.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106153043936937304081/reviews
