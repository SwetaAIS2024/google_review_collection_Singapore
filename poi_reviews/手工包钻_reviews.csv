Ivan Michael Pung,4,"手工包钻 is warm welcome to the Lor 8 market.

It is the one stall that we really needed to break the conventional Wanton Mee 🍜, Hokkien Mee 🍲, Chicken Rice 🍚, carrot cake and Lor Mee 🥘.

Lady boss 💁🏼‍♀️ is friendly, polite and gave some recommendations. Food was ok ✅✅✅. Wasn’t fantastically great like those big restaurants but I will take it any day over the restaurants considering the location📍and price 🧾. 😎

Belly Happy 😝 for my breakfast 🥢☕️ and it was just nice. Fairly new shop but a queue is forming constantly, I hope they stay long enough for the residents to enjoy Dim Sum!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100551027047446956883/reviews
