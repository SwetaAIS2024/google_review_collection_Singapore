Empty bar is just a representation of why people in their right mind dont want to come here, at least not again.\nThis pic reflects why they charge extra for no ice, because they will be shamed for giving only half a glass juice.\nThere menu is very basic, just a couple of options.",

But I guess it is due to 31st being overcrowded. Could see the drone event and fireworks at the palawan beach from here. Great experience. Recommended if you want to chill and party.",

But the place is quite nice, you can climb in and out to the beach and bar :D but there's a minimum charge to dine in. So we ordered quite a package but we ended up ordering even more.\n\nThe platter was nice, it got taco's, smoked duck, chicken, beef and salmon, corns and fries. All are okay, nice and gives you appetite. The satay is also very good, I love it!!! I just hope you can put more light bites on the menu and give more flavor from around the country.",

Check out this place if you are looking for somewhere to chill at the beach. The area is barricaded with ropes so you can leave your belongings there while your kids play around there. Other than beer, check out their cocktail too.",
