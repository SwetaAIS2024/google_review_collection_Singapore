Yang,4,"Modernised Claypot Rice with price starting from $6.50. Pre-cooked pearl rice that’s soft, fluffy, and healthier. It develops slight crispness but lacks traditional scorched bits/chao ta bits. Smooth, starchy texture pairs well with the sauces. Ideal for those seeking a lighter, modern twist!

Signature Chicken Claypot Rice ($8): Tender marinated chicken, Chinese sausage, and secret dark sauce create a sweet-spicy, chewy mix. Slightly salty for some.

Kung Pao Chicken ($6.50): Mildly spicy tender chicken in savoury, starchy claypot sauce balanced well with rice.

Minced Meat Eggplant ($5.50): Deep-fried garlic-style eggplant absorbs flavours beautifully without sogginess.

Minced Meat Tofu ($5.50): Classic smooth tofu with crisp edges served in a savoury meaty sauce. Always satisfying.

Overall, food may be a tad salty for some, while those with heavy taste bud will find it okay. Pretty affordable meal with generous portion.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103078870952547064508/reviews
Xin Hao,3,Finally got to try this near the neighborhood after reading the mixed reviews. It has been open for some time now and is usually pretty popular during the dinner and supper crowd. Tried the signature kung pao chicken ($6.50). Asked for less salt but still tasted slightly too salty for me. Portion is pretty generous on the outside but most of the chicken parts given to me were fatty and had little pure meat within on overall. Rice is slightly sticky and not fragrant at all - some parts were in lumps. Glad i tried for the experience but doubt i will visit again. Very average at best. Cleanliness of stall seems fine when i visited.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101038177603319548234/reviews
Joyce Tan,4,"Located just opp Kovan MRT, the stall is tucked within the ban mee coffeeshop. One should try their Signature Claypot Chicken Rice - Opt between spicy or non-spicy for the extra kick. Generous portion of tender chicken chunks, with chinese sausages that adds chewy, oily bites that contrast with the crispy rice. However, it lacks the extra salted fish chunks.  The sesame oil chicken is  flavorful, warming enough. However, i find it a lil too starchy at the end, when you want to drizzle the sauce onto your plain rice. Be prepared to wait for some time esp peak timing.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108038308755313884310/reviews

Choy Chengzhen,4,"This claypot rice stall hits the spot when you are craving something comforting and satisfying. Their signature chicken claypot rice at $18  —served piping hot with tender marinated chicken, Chinese sausage, and a perfectly charred rice crust that adds an irresistible crunch. Portion is generous for 3 pax! Give it a good mix—pure satisfaction in every bite!

Pair it with the sambal kang kong at $4, which brings a bold, spicy kick, and the garlic eggplant at $5.50, which is silky, fragrant, and so moreish.

With such wallet-friendly prices, it it easy to see why this place draws a steady crowd.  Really worth checking out!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112117557623921378675/reviews
