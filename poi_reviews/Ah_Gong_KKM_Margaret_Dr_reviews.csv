Candied Stars,5,"Tried the spicy version with prawns, egg and pork and normal soup version with clams, prawns, pork and egg today.

I enjoyed both versions. The noodles were curly and springy, the protein portions are generous and the soup is tasty. The pork liver is soft too!

I will definitely return and you should give it a try.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109255972854924437353/reviews
