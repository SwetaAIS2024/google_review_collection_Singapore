Elaine Quek,4,"Interesting concept of weighing the raw items by yourself. Apparently veggies or meat, same price, so better take more meat.
Help yourself to the limited range of drinks and pay at counter. No cup. No ice. Hence, no service or minimum service.

Taste is not bad. Appreciate that there is free flow of kimchi. And you can formula your own sauce too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103201350123704289751/reviews
Rayner Tok,1,"If I have an option to give 0 stars I definitely would have given, there’s a queue of guest waiting for payment but none of the staff came by, the lady that’s cooking the dishes look at us a few times but didn’t even came forward or even tell the other staff saying that there’s guest waiting for payment. Apparently when the total amount came by I was shocked by the price and amount of food. Doesn’t looks like it worth the price for the amount that I ordered. I don’t know if they even “tare” the weighing scale, but this is too exaggerate. Not coming back anymore",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103292857567194930874/reviews

Alexandro Lim,1,"Ordered pork bone broth and requested separation for fried items, but the fried stuffs were mixed into the bowl during collection. The amount of soup is also miserable. Staff attitude was poor; witnessed another customer asking what sauce he's holding but was replied rudely in an unwilling manner. One of the chopsticks was unclean. Return tray area was full of returned bowls. I am totally disappointed, will not recommend this outlet.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114100249944463015884/reviews
Jason Koh,3,"Walked in on a Thurs evening @ ~1915hrs. Had to wait for a table. There was no queue management from the staff.  The cooking speed was not slow, and we did not have to wait long for the food to be ready

Food overall is decent. Taste of soup is decent and ingredients were mostly fresh (at least those we had).

Would I revisit? Unlikely. Will try somewhere else.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112346680571976756133/reviews
