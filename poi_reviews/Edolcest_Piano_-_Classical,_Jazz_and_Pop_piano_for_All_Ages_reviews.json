      "text": "Esther is a fantastic piano teacher who has taught all three of our children over the years, who have all progressed within AMEB with solid grades. She is patient and gives a lot of valuable input during the lesson as well as notes to aid their practice in-between lessons. She always keeps the children interested in piano with a good mix of songs and theory. We have recently recommenced lessons with Esther online as we are now living in different countries and her technique is flawless even though she is teaching online. I would not hesitate to recommend Esther as your piano teacher.",

She is very reliable and responsible, friendly but firm with my kids and my children adored her. She is particularly good at preparing the kids for exams and both my children got their Honor certificates with their respective levels of AMEB.\nIf not for her relocation back to Singapore from Australia, we would have still happpily been with her for her promising teaching.",
