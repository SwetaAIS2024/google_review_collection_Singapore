He is a very patient and reassuring doctor. He performed a sclerotherapy and the procedure went smoothly. I had no pain or discomfort after the procedure which surprised me. I appreciate Dr Chen checking on me twice even after the procedure had completed which is usually rare for a specialist.\nThe staff are also very caring and efficient. The clinic is well run. I recommend Dr Chen and this clinic for those who wish to seek treatment on this issue,",

On the day of the procedure it was a very warm welcome, everything was well explained, my husband felt really well taken care of. The procedure went perfectly fine and the aftercare was excellent. We can absolutely recommend. We felt super happy that we chose this doctor and his wonderful staff.",
