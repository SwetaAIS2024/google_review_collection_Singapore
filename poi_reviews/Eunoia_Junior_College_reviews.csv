Craig Gan,3,"12 storey tall JC.  Good facilities as it's still relatively new. Convenient now with Bright Hill MRT down the road and also accessible by buses. Personally from my own experience at the 2025 JC, I feel a bit alienated and I don't feel the warmth that I felt at another JC.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102110249150882451112/reviews

Adam Lee,5,"In 2016, the general public of Singapore were far from impressed, after the announcement about Singapore's newest junior college, Eunoia Junior College. Jokes and criticism surfaced online. ""Pretentious"" was among the kinder adjectives used in online reaction to the news, with many saying the name was hard to pronounce and lacked local heritage.

Explaining the naming process, Mrs Wong Mei Heng, principal of Eunoia Junior College, said parents had been invited to submit suggestions online, while students were asked for their input. There were brain-storming sessions to discuss each of the 200 proposed names, all of which were meticulously documented and systematically reviewed.

The Eunoia team met students later again to share their findings after six months of discussion. Only one name that ""best captures the collective aspirations of our stakeholders"" could be chosen, she said. While it could have been challenging to pronounce, ""we were captivated by the enduring meaning the name presented us with"".

Language experts have differing views on how the word should be pronounced, Mrs Wong said, adding that the college has decided that it should be ""yoo-noh-iea"".

""At Eunoia... our aim is not to be seen as high class, but to be known for delivering first-class education,"" she wrote in a letter, addressing claims that the name was pretentious.

Apparently, Eunoia Junior College (EJC) was set up because there was no suitable junior college at the time to partner three secondary schools, Catholic High, CHIJ St Nicholas Girls’ and Singapore Chinese Girls’ School, for the Integrated Programme ie: Integrated Programme students proceed to JC without taking the GCE ‘O’ Level exams and ""have a broader curriculum"". The 2010 decision was made even though the Government was aware that cohort sizes would fall, said Senior Minister of State for Education Janil Puthucheary on 3 July 2017.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115680102960193169110/reviews
