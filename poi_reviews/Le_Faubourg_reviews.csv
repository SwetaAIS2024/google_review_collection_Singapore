Evangeline Tan,5,"Service was excellent! There is both indoor and outdoor seating. I opted for outdoor seats and was treated with the sighting of a beautiful peacock. The service staff was patient and friendly. Baguette was served hot, the orange juice was freshly squeezed, quality tea and grandmaâ€™s chocolate was lovely. It would be wonderful if the basket of mini viennoiseries were soft hot too! The jam deserves a special mention too. Definitely a cheaper option if you donâ€™t want to pay for hotel breakfast and if you donâ€™t want a heavy breakfast. (Read on trip advisor that people are asking for cheaper option with RWS eateries under renovation.) Only set back is table is a little small but they are very thoughtful to cater to family of adult and children diners. 2 adults can dine at bigger table while the 2 children dine at the childrenâ€™s table ðŸ˜Š",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106532653439880681935/reviews
eastpaw,5,"Yen made us feel really welcome and was extremely kind to us from beginning to end. This has been one of the best restaurant experiences we've had in quite a while.

The gallete and crepe we had were quite good. My wife found the food all a little overpowering, hence the 4 stars in aggregate for food quality. I personally thought that was the best crepe I've had in Asia or Europe though.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111485353511750623437/reviews
S g L,5,"I love this place so much that I visited 3 times in 1 month (including my birthday).

The cafe's cosy ambience and relaxed music makes you feel transported (especially on rainy afternoons) ...

Their afternoon tea is my type of afternoon tea - nicely balanced with 4 savories and 4 sweets so you get to try a bit of everything, and don't feel overly stuffed like at other places.

On all my visits, it's been the lovely Yen who's looked after us. She's kind, friendly and capable. It's always nice to chat with her when I visit.

I'm looking forward to my next visit. (I keep inviting my friends so I have an excuse to go back :)",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116447499116802684484/reviews
Michelle L,5,"we recently tried the new afternoon tea set, and it turned out to be an excellent choice. it allowed us to sample a variety of crepes and dishes they offer.

the salmon avocado was a standout for us - absolutely delicious!

altho itâ€™s located in sentosa, we were pleasantly surprised that it wasnâ€™t crowded with tourists, making it a perfect spot to unwind.

the lady who served us was incredibly helpful and friendly, even sharing tips about sentosa islander perks.

we highly recommend giving their crepes a try!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118428053350836615628/reviews
Lena Lee,5,"I have been to Hi Tea places in fancy hotel and restaurants. But this place food was a pleasant surprise for me. Everything is so well made, especially the savoury dishes was amazing.
The cafe embience and service by Yen was also fantastic. Love everything.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103701870972934708692/reviews
