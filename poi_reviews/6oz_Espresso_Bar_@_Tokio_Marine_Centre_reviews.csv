khrhms,3,"Trying out all the coffee spots in the Cecil area. This spot gets an average rating as there’s definitely better coffee in the area. Iced americano costs $6, and the beans tasted a tad weird. Service from the female barista could definitely be improved. Open seating area but gets a bit warm overtime, not the most conducive if you need to get work done.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104014469499009095905/reviews

H,3,"Chill atmosphere and lovely service staff who always make you feel welcomed. Their lattes aren’t the best, it’s really acidic. I think the issue is with the type of beans used. Their oat latte has gotten a lot better ever since they switched to Oatside milk.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101720094477320888158/reviews
