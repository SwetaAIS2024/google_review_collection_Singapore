YY,5,"Signed up for Trail Ride at Gallop Stable üèá as we have never tried Horse Riding before. Total damage for each pax was about $117. We went in a group of 4. This was a lovely experience and all of us had fun. We were really glad for the pleasant weather as well!

The trial ride was 1 hour long, and it was filled with lots of greenery and nature. We also managed to  experience some of the off-road track. The instructors were really pleasant, and they were so patient with us as they could tell that we were a tad nervous! üòÖ

Truly a fantastic experience for all of us  üëçüèª",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
Cheng xi Li,4,"Management is good compared to other riding schools. In Advanced lessons, we get very misbehaved horses. It is impossible to learn with horses that we can barely canter because of how misbehaved they are (bucking, bolting etc). Stable conditions are fine and students are allowed to tack up & shower their horse after the lesson.

Recommend for beginners to intermediate.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108881380239089894795/reviews
Vincent Luo,4,"There are quite a number of places to ride horses in Singapore and Gallop Stable at Horsecity is one of the easier one to arrange. Many other stables either don‚Äôt offer one-time fun/trail rides or require memberships. There is a restriction to note though, no more than 75kg, no older than 55 years old.

Although the administration of the ride could have been better managed, the ride itself is fun and relaxing. The staff who facilitated the ride, Maria, was knowledgeable and provided many insights to the well-being of the horses, their quirks and how to interact with them.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113537426768821049197/reviews

Huge effort caring for these magnificent horses.

I'm a animal lover. And horse are unique. How nice if horse caring are introduce to the primary to JC schools.

yee amel,5,"Went here for a school excursion. The instructors were so amazing and well-informed. Mitch, who gave us a tour of the stables, was so informative, engaging and spontaneous with the children. The instructors were friendly and patient also. Thank you so so much for accommodating such a big group of us and being so patient and kind!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105412703743441778403/reviews
