Forest BK,4,"⛺Campsite Area G is further away from the more congested part of East Coast Park, and thus it's quieter and less rowdy.
⛺There seems to have some nice big tents that are pitched permanently here.
⛺This campsite is near to toilet and BBQ pits,which is great.
The downside is that frequent plane noise can be heard and food is not nearby.
⛺But, nevertheless, can still 'tar pau' from the Food Village or fast-food outlet.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Rubi Saini,4,"Great location for overnight camping. It has beach view and nice garden. However because Changi Airport is nearby so there is very loud noise from planes, so better bring earplugs. You can bring your own tent or book glamping from one of the companies. Bring your drinks, food, speaker and games and you will have a great time. There are good restaurants nearby with amazing food.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116094210598631262879/reviews

Lyon,5,"By far the better place to camp as compare to other places. Free cark park, lesser mosquito or none, good wind breeze, quiet area of ECP, cleaner toilet in general. Kids can easily go to beach and have fun flying kite as well. The only bad thing is not so near to any eatery or food stall. Can still grab or bring your own food to cook/heat up in discreet.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101677400368616244021/reviews
