Here the mala xiangguo was prearranged, hopefully there would be al carte menu in the future. The dish was somewhat fragrance, spice level was pretty manageable, perhaps to cater to the mass.",

      "text": "Chanced upon this stall after my training nearby. This is another outlet of their Bedok outlet. Very friendly & chatty boss who recommended us some dishes to try. Eventually tried their Mala Xiang Guo set, prefixed for now & comes with a bowl of pearl rice, $10.90. Portion is pretty decent for this price with 11 ingredients. The mlxg is more of the dry kind, not overly spicy but fragrant to me.\n\nWe also tried their Grilled Fish in Golden Soup, half fish for $8.80 only! Very worth in my opinion, only disappointed that the serving pan is not heated. Fish is soft & smooth, few bones, broth is pleasant, sweet & refreshing with a very slight spiciness kick. Grill fish in Golden broth also has cabbage, beansprouts, beancurd skin strips & peanuts atop.",
