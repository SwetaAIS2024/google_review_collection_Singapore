Handri Kent,5,"I had a great experience buying Kelvin’s shrimp from Indonesia and had my friend who visit Singapore and get the shrimp for me.

The shrimp quality is very good. As a beginner I start with PRL (Pure Red Line) & PBL (Pure Black Line).  VERY BEAUTIFUL SHRIMP!!!

And I want to thanks to the shop owner, Kelvin Wong. He is a very nice person who are very patient teaching a beginner like me.  He taught me a lot how to be a shrimp keeper, from choosing soil, water parameter, and the maintenance.
He a a great person to learn from.

Even I didn't visit the store and picked the shrimp myself, Kelvin choose a very good color shrimp for me. He also gave me 10  culled shrimp for me to test my water. It tooks almost 24H from getting the shrimp which put in the flask until I got it in Indonesia. All shrimp survived, no death. Very beautiful and healthy shrimp.

No wonder his Reputation and Trustworthy makes him a Champion in Caridina Shrimp Breeder.

I can not wait to visit and meet Kelvin when I go Singapore.  Thank you Kelvin Wong !",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109466238023624380729/reviews
John Eames,5,Kelvin has thee best bacteria I have ever used hands down. You’ll get green walls up fast during cycling and maintain a healthy balance to your shrimp tank. His Lubao balls are fantastic as well. Tons of biofilm!!,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108636092559530311335/reviews
Bob Wang,5,"The amiable owner treated this customers cordially and tended to each one, veteran and beginner alike. As i was fairly new to shrimp keeping, i was hesitant to ask about the hobby however Kelvin gracefully shared his knowledge and personal experiences, giving pointers along the way. Not to mention, the shrimps are stunning and online photos do not do them justice when you see them in the store. Would definitely come again and recommend anyone who is interested in the hobby to check out  his vibrant menagerie. Thanks Kelvin once again!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114829016232177689098/reviews

Johnny Chua,5,"Quality shrimps, knowledgeable and humble breeder. This is what you can expect to find at KW shrimps. Kelvin has been breeding quality shrimps for many years, and also willing to share his experience with people who are interested to start shrimp keeping. Everytime I need some advice, I never feel afraid to drop Kelvin a text and he is always happy to share his knowledge. Definitely recommend newbies and breeders who want to go into high grade shrimps to patronise his shop!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114302441614305260055/reviews
