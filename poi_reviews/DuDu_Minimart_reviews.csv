edwin,1,"Incredibly rude China male staff.

I’ve had to collect Shopee parcels here a few times since it’s a designated collection point, but every single visit has been a horrible experience. The attitude is consistently bad—unfriendly, impatient, and borderline hostile.

Honestly, I’ll probably just start using Amazon more from now on. The convenience is not worth the treatment.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109891667258604967057/reviews
