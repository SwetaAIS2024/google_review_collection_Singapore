It was like they were trying to balance their mistakes across two different pizzas and ended up messing up both.\n\nThe worst thing? The response to a complaint about food quality and safety was that it was still edible and no returns or refunds were permitted ðŸ˜‚\n\nFor this level of quality and service they should just close down and fire all their staff.",

Give you 3star because the spaghetti Bolognese were not just right for me. And the garlic bread is awful omg I cant describe it.  Service is fast thou and the environment is full of odour from their oven . Floor is  clean but its too small for a restaurant .",
