Juztin Png,5,"Chui Huay Lin Teochew Cuisine is a gem tucked away in a charming heritage clubhouse. The restaurant's ambiance perfectly complements its rich Teochew culinary offerings.

The service here is exceptional‚Äîstaff are attentive, warm, and always ready to ensure you have a great dining experience.

As for the food, it‚Äôs absolutely delicious. The menu offers a wide variety of options, and from what we tried, the steamed chicken stood out. The meat was tender, the gravy deeply flavorful, and the pickles added a delightful crunch that perfectly complemented the dish.

Another highlight was the crispy sea cucumber‚Äîa unique dish that amazed us. It was our first time trying deep-fried sea cucumber, and it was a revelation! Crispy on the outside and soft yet bouncy (""Q"") on the inside, paired with a sauce that matched beautifully. Simply outstanding.

Conveniently, there‚Äôs parking available, making it easy for those driving.

Highly recommended for anyone looking to enjoy authentic and delicious Teochew cuisine in a lovely setting!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117169322123176550814/reviews
Evie Wong,3,"We came here after seeing great reviews on Google, however was disappointed to find that the signature dishes were largely on the salty side and not impressive.

I would have to say that the steamed soon hock was not fresh. Even after providing the feedback to the staff nothing further was done.

Having said that, of all the dishes, the highest praise goes to the Yam paste. It was smooth and tasty!

Service was also good, with attentive and helpful staff.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111014769497128651380/reviews
Lee Zhi Hao,5,"Went to the restaurant for food tasting pre-wedding. The food was excellent. Although there were some differences in opinion among my family because some prefer stronger taste and some prefer lighter taste for the different dishes. The food mostly meets our expectations while some were above our expectations.

The service was excellent as well. Special thanks to Justin serving us. He was attentive to our needs, always making the best effort to answer any doubts we may have.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102973768985881287867/reviews
Wong Teck Jung,5,"This establishment is a superb Chinese restaurant specializing in Teochew cuisine.  I had:
1. oyster omelette
2. braised duck with tofu
3. roasted piglet
4. pumpkin yam paste

The braised duck with tofu was exceptional; not only was the duck itself excellent, but the tofu was also of superior quality and flavour.  This dish was truly outstanding.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115500349786770672418/reviews
