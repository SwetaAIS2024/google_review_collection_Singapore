Cham Jin fan,4,Dis was a rly good sch whe I went there when i was studying there. The teacher was rly nice and the food was kinda good. The activities there were fun and I still think about it now. This place rly nourished me and I learnt a lot from being in dis preschool. I rly recommend that u bring ur kids to dis preschool as if will help them like how it helped me. 5 out of 5!,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104500750142966066274/reviews
