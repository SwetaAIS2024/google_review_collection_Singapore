Or maybe just my imaginations.\n\nDining here has always been so-so.",

However stir-fried eggplant with mince meat and mushroom is excellent, fried pumpkin with salted-egg is excellent, and fried fish skin is awesome. Will go again. For 5pax cost about 60sgd. Parking is a bit difficult, go before 11:45am for lunch to ensure space, otherwise prepare to wait for table.",
