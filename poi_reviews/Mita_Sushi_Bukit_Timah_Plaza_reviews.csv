Clara Lay,5,"Service was prompt and attentive, food was delicious and reasonably priced. My first visit and immediately won over by the wide menu options, fresh sashimi and flavourful dishes. The cramp dining  space only adds to its charm, exactly how a good cafe that values food quality over blitz should be. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107566272009282710247/reviews
Eunice Chin,4,"Was there around 6pm on a Wednesday night. Small shop with few tables, giving cozy feeling. Saw 1 staff attending the shop. One man show doing cashiering, cooking and clearing of tables and worried that he couldn‚Äôt handle it. Luckily there‚Äôs not much crowd.

Ordered Madai sashimi and it was so fresh! Their sashimi selection was fresh as well.
First time encounter Aburi Mehajiki and it was interesting!

Love the ochazuke! Very flavourful and not stingy with their fish. Recommend to order!!!

Tried the dried Japanese sardine (looks like white ikan bilis to me) and reminded me of the cuttlefish snack, just that this taste lighter.

Would definitely go back to try other dishes from them.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107803028677360828009/reviews
edwin,5,"This restaurant is relatively new and not very crowded. While the atmosphere feels a bit quiet, I happened to pass by and decided to give their buta kakuni (braised pork belly) a shot, priced affordably at $11.90 with no extra charges. The dish exceeded my expectations ‚Äî the meat was tender, flavorful, and cooked perfectly, with a portion size that felt just right. Overall, it‚Äôs a great spot to enjoy a simple yet delicious meal without breaking the bank. Worth checking out if you‚Äôre in the area!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109891667258604967057/reviews
Abraham Lee,4,"A new spot in Bukit Timah Plaza for chirashi and sashimi, giving the other two Japanese eateries some stiff competition. Although the space is much smaller, with only around five tables, the menu is equally‚Äîif not more‚Äîpricey. However, they offer an extensive selection of alcohol. I ended up at Mita as a spillover guest from the other Japanese restaurant with an overwhelming queue. It has a cozy, family-run vibe, with a young boy helping to serve, with pretty polite service. I tried the gyudon, which was on promotion‚Äîtender beef and perfectly textured rice made it a satisfying dish.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews
Limzy,5,Delicious rice bowls and value for money. Managed to get these at 15% off with ongoing promotion. Decided to try this newly opened restaurant as a nearby popular Japanese restaurant was crowded. Not disappointed at all. Fresh sashimi and well seasoned rice. Proportion is balanced as well. Limited seats and no baby chair available. .,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116700878853534773356/reviews
