Ong Ashley,1,"The car workshop at caltex isn't honest. I went in with a punctured tyre. The Indian worker told me they charge $15 for repairing and I agreed. But after pulling out the nail, it was realised that it couldn't be repaired due to the placement. Then came a Chinese man in his late 40(slighty bald and slightly short) telling me he need to check the price of the tyre if I want a replacement. And I agreed. After afew minutes, he informed me that I need to get 2 tyres and they don't sell in one. Which I told him to go ahead for the repair so that I can get to my regular workshop which was nearby. After repairing the hole, he wanting to charge me $30 instead of $15. I questioned him why am I being charged with the price of 2 tyre repair prices. He took a sticker type thingy and show me  which i don't even know what the heck is that. Explaining he use 2 strips of  that, and need to charge me for 2 tyres repair. I told him I will paid for $30 but I will review in Google all the details. And he changed his mind about charging me $30. That was when he changed his mind and said i could paid $15. I insisted I'll pay $30. Which he insisted $15 in the end.
P/s: Boss of that workshop, I stayed nearby. I'll glad to explain the whole situation, if you wanna know how your workers carrot customers. I emphasised, the Indian worker wasn't aware of the whole situation.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116647461021307601707/reviews

Benjamin Ng,1,"I have shared my feedback on caltex website & was advice they will reply three business day. I have sent on Monday and is been three days. Seems like they are ignoring my concerns. I have send another email to advice them to contact me by today, still no reply or concern.

I have sent my car for a wash on Monday which I have bought a package with their partners on February. The package includes dashboard & leather shine. I have spoken with the staff who is attending to my car. They have mention is was polished. I shall let the picture do the talking.

I do polish my leathers and dashboard just that since I have purchase the package why not use it.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114838754054405344304/reviews
