Dr Yeo was so gentle n knowledgeable about everything. I had my 1st root canal n crowning with her. I was scared out of wit that took 2hrs opening my mouth with all the reno inside my mouth. But she was an expert that I don't feel much pain n discomfort that time flies so fast n it was done before I can remember. After then, I would always visit her when I need my dental services. I'm so glad I had found a dentist that reassured me n calm me down. Thanks a million Dr Yeo n Ms Gigi Tan. üòä",

I had reached out via text a few days in advance to request an appointment but did not receive any response. When I followed up with a call, I was informed that an appointment had already been made for me the next day‚Äîhowever, I was never notified of this.\n\nWhen I expressed my frustration and requested to cancel both this and a future appointment, the response I received was a curt ‚Äúsure,‚Äù followed by an immediate cancellation message. It felt dismissive and lacked the level of care I would expect, as a patient.\n\nI hope this feedback is taken constructively, as I do value the dental care I‚Äôve received in the past and would like to see improvements in communication and service.",

      "text": "I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Dr. Chua Chee Haow for his exceptional care in addressing my dental and crown issues. Last year, I had a crown that came off, leaving a stent sticking out of my gum. I consulted three different dentists, each of whom explained the complexity of my case, as my old crown was near nerves. However, all they did was provide an X-ray and a quote. When I asked about fixing other cavities, none of them offered any help.\n\nThen I decided to see Dr. Chua, who is well-known for helping patients, especially those who are fearful of dental treatments. From the start, Dr. Chua and his team made the entire process seamless, painless, and highly effective. Whenever I felt anxious during the procedure, Sandra and the other nurses would calmly tap my shoulder to reassure me, making me feel comforted like a child. Dr. Chua‚Äôs occasional whistling also helped me stay relaxed, letting me know everything was going smoothly. Even Maria, the receptionist, checked in on me after my procedure to ensure I was doing okay.\n\nToday, I had my dental implant completed, and Dr. Chua took extra care to fill cavities whenever he spotted them. I always leave feeling that my teeth are incredibly clean, and I am so grateful for the outstanding care I received throughout the process. Thank you, Dr. Chua and team!",
