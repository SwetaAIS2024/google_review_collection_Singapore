Leah Dominguiano,5,"Just wanted to share a quick thumbs up for the Park View Hotel! The staff here are genuinely friendly and alwats ready to help, which make a real difference. The location is fantastic too - right in the middle of Bugis. And you can practically stumble out the door and find tons of great restaurants just a few steps away. Our family room was surprisingky spacious with a single and a double bed, and everything was spotless clean. Definitely a greay choice for a comfortable and convenient stay.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105603510209548821299/reviews
saket benurwar,5,"I would highly recommend this hotel for the excellent breakfast alone.
Strategically located, close to most of the main tourist places.

The rooms are small and windowless but are perfect for travellers who intend to stay out and roam around Singapore's various attractions.

Ideal for families and budget friendly.

Would definitely stay here again.

Yasmine A,1,"I stayed at PARKROYAL Beach Road and found bed bugs in the room ‚Äî my one-year-old daughter broke out in a rash. On top of that, I found hair in my food, and when I raised these issues, the staff were dismissive and rude. I‚Äôve stayed in many hotels and never experienced anything this bad. Avoid at all costs.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116456301805936726262/reviews
Thuy Nguyen Thanh,1,"The location is good that you can walk to Marina Bay in 30 mins, Chinatown 30mins and Little India around 15mins. However I have to put 1 star rating because my family of 3, me, my husband and my 10 months old son got FOOD POISION after we had breakfast from the hotel (we ate on that day nothing but their breakfast). We all then had to go to hospital and my husband had to stay in the hospital for 1 night of observation because he was in the critical situations. However, after reporting to the hotel, we got NO APOLOGIES from the hotel. And the hotel denied their responsibility as they said none of their guests got sick except of us. We have a report from the doctors that we got food poisoning but they said it does not mentioned their hotel so its not their responsibility.
Additionally when I asked for changing bed sheet, the receptionist said all staff have gone, we have to wait for next day. But when we went out to buy drinks, they sent someone to come to our room for cleaning. On one side, it was good but on the other side, I do not understand why they have to lie to me about having mo staff????",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108646749608690314417/reviews
