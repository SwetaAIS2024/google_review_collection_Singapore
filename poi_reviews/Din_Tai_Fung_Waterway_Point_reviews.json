U lose all taste and trust in the brand despite them having a glassed kitchen. The back kitchen is not visible to you and thatâ€™s where all the other food poisoning is occurring. Wonâ€™t be surprise to see them on news due to food poisoning soon with such poor hygiene standards chefs\n\nWe decided to cancel our orders and went Tim ho wan instead",

      "text": "The restaurant excels in its delicate and flavorful xiao long bao, which is a must-try for any visitor. The precise balance of thin dumpling skin, savory filling, and rich broth exemplifies the mastery of their chefs. Additionally, the clean and modern ambience, combined with efficient and friendly staff, enhances the overall dining experience. While there might be a wait during peak hours, the experience is well worth it for the delectable Taiwanese cuisine.",

      "text": "Quality food, good service & pleasant atmosphere are reason why this Michelin star famous restaurant always has a long queue of customers at its many outlets. This Punggol outlet did not disappoint.\n\nFOOD\n+ Many of its dishes are great. But the Xiao Long Bao is simply a must order. A crust well made enough that it doesn't tear or break easily and at the same time thin enough to allow you to savour the soup within the dumpling\n+ Spicy oil dumplings had a great flavour of chilli & vinegar that is not too oily too.\n\nSERVICE\nInterestingly, they augmented their service with a robot that brings you to your table. The good service that you come to expect from all of its outlets is still there though\n\nATMOSPHERE\nPleasant & clean. Ding Tai Feng outlets all have this vibe that makes you feel comfortable",
