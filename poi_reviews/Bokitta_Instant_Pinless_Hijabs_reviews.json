The hijabs are definitely worth the price cause you can wear the inner many ways! Some photos here to show some of my favourite designs.\n\nIf you think this is only for new hijabis, trust me even as a not so new hijabi myself, I would go for it.\n\nDo come down and try it out yourself especially if you are looking for fuss free, pinless hijabs.",
