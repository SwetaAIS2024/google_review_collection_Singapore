Simplehappy zen,1,"Title: Disappointing Customer Service Experience at 99 Speedmart

I usually enjoy shopping at 99 Speedmart, but my recent experience left me really disappointed. I was at the store looking to buy a few items and asked the cashier (who appeared to be of Indian descent) if there were any baskets available to put my items in. Instead of offering any help or a simple response, she just shrugged her shoulders and completely ignored me with a dismissive body language.

I understand that everyone has off days, but the lack of basic customer service and the indifferent attitude left a bad impression. Good customer service goes a long way in making a shopping experience enjoyable, and this definitely wasn't it. I hope management looks into this and trains staff to be more professional and courteous in the future.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102610098977518237219/reviews
Kimberley Howarth,2,"Shop is abit messy and disorganised. You  can get most things here... daily sundries, cold drinks etc. But not fresh produce. Its all packaged and dry goods. But the staff are very unfriendly. Not a single smile, and no thank you. Like they are angry to be working there.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114957590885643931784/reviews

Ollie Odysea,1,"Staff don't do anything except sit around like they're at a party, don't help they just point. Place is always a mess can't get through the isles because trollies are in the way. Today I went in and the temperature check wasn't working and the girl said it doesn't matter. Then I had to ask someone to come to the till as they were all sitting on the floor at the back of the shop playing games on their phones.

I wouldn't put a review but the staff at this shop don't seem to care about their job and it's annoying.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116382660715946184948/reviews
