Kwong Fei Yee,4,"Nice tasty powerful coffee. Based on the drinks itself I think it deserve 5 stars.

However, didn't give 5 stars because the system is quite fast but chaotic ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£. See quite a number of people ordered already but still have not gotten their drinks and the queue is not very clear.

Looks like a very popular drink stall with the neightbourhood.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118030178376808365901/reviews
