Christopher Fong,5,"So this will come across as unconventional but we actually engaged Loco Loco to provide our post-wedding dinner food! It was a secret kept by everyone except our wedding planner and us and it wasn't anything on their current menu (if you see it online after this review it was cause of our wedding!!).

We engaged Loco Loco to provide INDOMIE W/ NUGGETS AND SAUSAGES and honestly after a meal of fine dining what a way to open the after party. Our emcees announced that there was Indomie available at the back as a secret 7th course and flocks of people rushed to get their indomie fix!

Everyone thought it was so amazing and such a fun idea. We had it on a small food cart with the words emblazoned ""INDOMIE"" and what a fun way to end the night with alcohol, music and indomie!

Thank you for making our dream come true in the after party and I hope everyone reading this will get an idea to host an indomie (or any other instant noodle party for that matter) party for your wedding soon!

Love, C&J",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108413265639599649117/reviews
Amber Deux,5,"Zi Yao and team was really professional and helped us to organise a successful live station & tea reception for our event. Their milk tea is so delicious, one of the better ones when we engaged vendors. Their food was yummy, everyone was enjoying them. The display was very beautiful too.

We would definitely be engaging them again if we have events in the future.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103937834318495304089/reviews
Nur Aainaa Nadiah Ja'afar,4,"Loco Loco was very prompt with their responses and acceded to my last minute school event order for breakfast.
They were able to customized our orders accordingly and even provided Vegetarian option sandwich for us. Thus making it easier that we do not need to source from another vendor.

All in all, it was a great experience with Loco loco. Punctual and deliver what we ordered. Which was the Egg Mayo sandwich, Tuna and Chicken Ham Sandwich. My staff had a good breakfast today.

Thank you!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109652078420662672200/reviews
