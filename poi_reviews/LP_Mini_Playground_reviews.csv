Ivan Loh,4,"Small sandy playground with just a few things for kids to play. A couple of see-saws, swings, and a mini merry-go-round. However, there's lots of space for kids to have fun in the sand. There's an old bunker at the back of the playground, which is really cool. There's history to this place, and the views are awesome. Great for an evening stroll as well.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114542374982525257775/reviews
