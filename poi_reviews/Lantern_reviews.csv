Fab Foodie Swede Malin Nordblom,5,"One of the best rooftop bars in Singapore with its panoramic view over the Marina Bay waterfront and city skyline.
Great cocktails and if you wanna it something they have pizza, hummus, satay etc. As it’s often fully booked maker sure to reserve a table before.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107062657007062713328/reviews
Pingu Sim,5,"I had the pleasure of being served by Asel, and I must say—she was truly exceptional. She was polite, attentive, and incredibly helpful in answering all our questions. I’ve dined at several fine dining establishments, and Asel stands out as the best waitress I’ve ever encountered.

What really impressed me was her thoughtful approach when we asked for a couple photo. Not only was she happy to help, but she also put genuine effort into finding the perfect angle. We even showed her an example of the kind of photo we wanted, and to our surprise, she captured it almost identically. I was both shocked and delighted by her attention to detail and care.

Asel truly sets the bar for what excellent service should be—she is the perfect example of professionalism, warmth, and genuine hospitality. Because of her, I’ll definitely be returning to Lantern at Fullerton Bay. She made our experience unforgettable.

As for the food, here’s what we ordered for two pax:

Wagyu Beef Short Rib – 10/10
Absolutely amazing. The meat was incredibly tender and flavorful—this is a must-try! The portion was generous and beautifully presented with a large rib bone. The accompanying tortilla was unique and delicious, unlike any we’ve had elsewhere. Highly recommend.

Mini Wagyu Beef Sliders – 7/10
Not bad at all. The beef was medium rare, juicy, and tender. A decent option if you're craving something more casual.

Eggplant Bruschetta – 8.5/10
Tasty and well-seasoned, though I was surprised there wasn’t any visible eggplant. Still enjoyable and worth trying.

Mongolian Spiced Kebab (Plant-Based) – 6/10
Flavor-wise it was okay, but I didn’t really enjoy the sauce that came with it. However, it actually tasted much better when paired with the mustard sauce from the short rib.
Speaking of which...

Mustard Sauce (from the Wagyu Short Rib) – 10/10
This sauce was insanely good! Smoky, chargrilled, rich, and flavorful—I couldn’t get enough of it. It elevated everything we dipped into it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105072609120093759254/reviews
Robin Beivi,5,"I was there last week with my girlfriend.
It was a wonderful experience.

We had two drinks each and then some Mini Beef-Sliders and a portion of Sticky Korean fried Chicken.

Both were amazing but the Chicken was just out of this world tasty;)

It’s a rather expensive place.
Although the great Food & Drinks, very attentive service and awesome view make it worth the price.

If you are in Singapore some time, and don’t want to go to the extra fancy Rooftop Bar with the Ship on top.

This is the next best thing.

Would definitely recommend !",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106257467118986465064/reviews
