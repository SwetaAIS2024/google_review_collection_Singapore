Great pastry to filling ratio. Yum! One of the best curry puffs in SG, in my opinion.\n\nService felt a little disinterested.",

      "text": "Highly recommend this curry puff stall!\n\nThe puffs are always fresh, with a generous amount of quality ingredients inside.\n\nFrequently order the sardine and tuna mayo varieties, and they never disappoint. The egg tarts are also fantasticâ€”super soft and delicious. Even when kept in the fridge and served the next day, the taste remains great! Plus, the prices are very reasonable for the quality.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit for anyone craving tasty and affordable treats!",

I got chicken mushroom, lava cheese and lava salted egg. The curry chicken sold out and its only 12.30pm.\n\nThe lava cheese is sweet, the lava salted egg is very nice, reminds me of liu sha bao. The mushroom chicken is fragrant",
