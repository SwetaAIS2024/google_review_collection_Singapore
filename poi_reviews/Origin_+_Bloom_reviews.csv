Orange,4,"The staff is very friendly, and the bakery offers fresh bread, sandwiches, and a small selection of cakes daily. Coffee is served in generously sized cups.

I tried the green tea latte and americano, but they weren‚Äôt particularly impressive. However, I wouldn‚Äôt mind returning if I‚Äôm in the area.

The net pricing is a great bonus, though seating is quite limited.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
Chow Wen Jie,5,"Slightly busy & noisy but cannot complain about it much. Service crews are polite and pleasant, also tidy up the table quickly after customers left. Cake taste good & coffee decent and portion is generous Prices are similar with most cafe out there. Next time should try out their bread as I saw there were lots of orders of the pastries while queuing.

I would like to visit the cafe more often.

The cashier lady compliment to my favourite skirt really cheer my day up. :)",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113409117704089734400/reviews
Susan Chua,5,"Nice cosy outlet, reasonable priced pastries for the usual pastries. The current decor and many pastries are themed along with upcoming Easter.

Enjoyed the pistachio twist donut, deco and ambience. Ordered 2 usual pastries, 1 eastern pastry and 1 coffee.

Friendly staff too.

Will visit after Easter for the usual pastries.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109044323196867718721/reviews
Natali Kilic,5,"I‚Äôm in love with this bakery! Very good service, tasty food, reasonable prices for this place! Sandwich with mozzarella, tomatoes and pesto was just perfect! Mushroom quiche was also good, very light structure. Danish with blueberries made my day! When I‚Äôll come back to Singapore, definitely come againüëç",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109402747555737069020/reviews
Javier Jin Hao Ng,5,"Love the pastry! It‚Äôs delicious and tasty.
Highly recommend its croissant as it‚Äôs crispy and very generous portion for its meat/cheese. Not really a coffee person but their green tea latte is decent!
Overall staff were friendly and there‚Äôre 2 outlets in mbs tower 3 & 2 plenty of seats available.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116365497736509490861/reviews
