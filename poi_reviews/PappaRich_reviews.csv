Raymond Lim,4,"Nice! 👍 The dishes were competently done, though not spectacular. 🍽️ Prices are quite affordable considering the ambience. 🌟 It’s a one-stop solution where you can find almost all your comfort food here. 🥘🍜 But… every dish has a nicer version elsewhere. 🤷🏻‍♂️😅",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113370341685762605307/reviews
Ev,5,"Finally I found one of the authentic Penang Char Kway Teow.

We tried out the new bamboo rice. The rice was pretty fragrance. Their muttons can be softer/ more tender though. Nonetheless,
they have several meat choices which maybe better.

We never got tired of PapaRich. They have been around for many years, it's reliable.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105439494723492784969/reviews
Joy KC,3,"Affordable fare, dishes competently done though not spectacular. Had the wat tan hor fun, and white coffee. Nice place to sit and catch up with friends, great to have a halal certified eatery for meet-up. Service is brisk, though the staff appeared really busy, managing best as they can, without establishing any eye contact.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116810438378403865075/reviews

Nandini Kitroo,4,Fresh and flavourful food at reasonable prices. The Chendol was the showstopper ❤️. The restaurant will be relocating to the other side of the mall soon at 01-35,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104800889578817619901/reviews
