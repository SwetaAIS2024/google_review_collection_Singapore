Shrimp dumplings and Wanton have a good bite & water chestnut added texture. Noodle texture is chewy,\nsauce is flavourful enough to cover the ghee taste of noodles. Charsiew was average though, so this is truly a place to get your wanton/ dumpling fix!",

I ordered extra wantons and shrimp dumplings with spinach green noodle which is quite uncommon in most wanton noodle stalls.\nWanton and dumplings were fresh and skin were smooth but not dry. Was bit disappointed with the noodle as I can taste hint of \"kee\" instead of spinach. This is probably their source of noodle supply is not good.\nOverall, I am very satisfied with the meal!",

This meal is also the healthier choice meal, so you get a QR code which you can scan in Healthy 365 and earn points. Service was good as the staff cooked quickly and I received my food about 3-5min after I ordered despite the long queue. The food portion is just right and the ingredients are fresh. The staff are friendly and enthusiastic too. Really a hidden gem if you crave Char Siew Hor Fun/ Wanton Noodles.",
