Manasa Elaya,4,The 70 year old boss is really nice to show us a lot of fish. Itâ€™s interesting how he can make the mother give birth instantly by just pressing on it. He has been taking care of fishes since he was 8. The huge varieties of fishes is colourful and beautiful. He even has turtles and chickens. Hope to be there again some time.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114583281334024005184/reviews
Darren Yau,5,"Amazing cichlid store, highly recommended to all cichlid fans out there! Fish are well maintained and healthy - and most impressive, they have over 150 different species. Auntie there was super helpful and ended up buying many nicely sized African cichlids (my favorite being a Star Sapphire). Plus they had many other cichlids I havenâ€™t seen in other stores, or ever before. Will certainly be back for more!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111641574529139728675/reviews
Lawrence Tan,5,"3 months ago, have been looking for a Cichild fish to cross breed with my blood parrot fish. Went to many places, unable to get it, either overly expensive or the Cichild fish quality was small and unhealthy.
By chance, found this place while driving to get some plants around Sungei Tengah area.

Even its a Cichild fish farm, they are selling other kind of fishes too.
Yesterday, I have bought some baby Angel fishes. The uncle has given me some baby Cichild fishes too.

Within 3 months, I have been to Cichild aquarium at least 4 times. Everytime definitely will get something from the fish farm.

The service is awesomely friendly and the uncle knowledge on fishes is beyond words. Condition and variety of the Cichild fishes are excellent too.

The pricing is absolutely reasonable. The owners are not pushy and give you ample time to select your fishes.
Furthermore, at time, the lady boss may also give me some free gifts. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

This place is definitely 1 of my favourite place to get my fishes in Singapore. Furthermore most of the fishes are locally bred. We should give more support to local.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113972593164393012890/reviews
