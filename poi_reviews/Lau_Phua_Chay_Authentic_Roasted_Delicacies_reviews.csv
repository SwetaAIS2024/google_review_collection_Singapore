Vivian Kang,1,Total scam. Got charged $17 for one plate of 3 meat rice and auntie put in an egg I did not order. Crazy man. Blacklisted forever. I don‚Äôt even see how that could add up to $17.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117905568509714554209/reviews
Yong L,1,"***DO NOT PATRONIZE***
A swindler and uses underhand methods to gain more money! Overcharged and was way too pricey!

This couple‚Äôs attitude is worthy of a Michelin star award.

My order($30) was 2x packets of char siew rice and 2x packets of char siew & roast pork rice. Meat given was meagre and amount of chilli given is stingy!

When asked how much, she was unable to even tell me verbally with such simple calculation. She had to punch out the numbers using calculator!

Read the other reviews and you will know what I meant! I only found out after trying to google about this stall.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107225568265737125930/reviews
CL ‚ÄúHoSayBo‚Äù,3,"This is a stall that have patronize frequently 2 decades ago when I was a young man in my late 20s when working near AV.  After so many years, I tried looking for it again when I happen to pop by AV. Right at the corner of the hawker center and opp back of Ah Seng Durian stall (AV branch). I recall there used to be a tyre shop and I think it's gone now....

Order a plate of char hou fan which consist of char siew and roast pork. The char siew is the dark type....probably using slightly darker sauce and well marinated. The roast pork could be crispier. The sauce is thick and might be overly sweet.

Won't say it taste bad but I thought it used to be better.....different from the usual char siew rice but with so much sauce on it, might not be a healthy option..... Guess with age, getting  more health conscious now. üòÜ",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111982090917080208619/reviews
Stanley Pang,3,"Ordered char siew/roast pork rice and it was sweet and drenched in their syrupy sauce. Kids will likely love it.

Everything was decent but for Folks expecting crispy Roast pork skin, unfortunately it's not.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101763161466007280569/reviews
Timothy TM,3,Strange.. when I ordered online using whyQ the food was so good! but when I ate there at the store it was quite average. Had the char siew and duck rice for $5.50. The dark sauce is dark and taste ordinary. Sorry but it‚Äôs just not that good. Hope they find out how to improve it to how I experienced it when home delivered.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116897826354325250403/reviews
