GUIN,1,"I had a very frustrating experience with this branch. The sales executives are consistently late for appointments, often arriving one to two hours late without any apologies. Communication is poor‚Äîthey are reluctant to reply to messages and provide unclear or inadequate explanations. This behavior reflects poorly on the branch's professionalism and has left me extremely disappointed. I hope the management takes this feedback seriously and addresses these issues to improve their service.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109487737675250418011/reviews
