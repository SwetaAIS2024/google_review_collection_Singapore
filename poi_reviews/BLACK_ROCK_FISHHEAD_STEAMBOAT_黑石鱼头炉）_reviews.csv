Edwina Pariwono,5,"Had an good dining experience here. The dining area is spacious, making it a comfortable spot even when it's busy, especially on weekends.

The fish head steamboat is the popular dish you must order. It's flavorful and the soup can be refilled, which is great for enjoying the rich, savory broth. The fish slices are generous and fresh, and there are plenty of sides like vegetables.

We also loved the Two Ways Kailan, which was tasty, and the Crab Roe Noodles were definitely worth trying! Overall, a great spot to enjoy hearty, delicious meals.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110865738734976473001/reviews
Berlinda Goh,5,"The dining area is spacious and clean! Service is pretty fast even though there were many customers (we went on the weekend).
Most popular is of course their fish head steamboat, very flavourful and soup can be refilled.
We also like their Two Ways Kailan, Char Siew, Roast Duck. Crab Roe Noodles is very worth a try too!
Truffle tofu was a bit overpowering for my family's taste but definitely recommended for those who love truffle dishes üëçüëç",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100207240187708698568/reviews
Melvin,5,"Absolutely loved my meal at Black Rock Fishhead Steamboat. The soup base was a perfect balance of umami richness and light, clean flavors, and the fish was incredibly fresh and tender. You can tell a lot of care goes into preparing both the broth and the ingredients. The charcoal fire added an authentic touch and kept the soup bubbling nicely throughout the meal. Service was fast and friendly, and the portions were generous too. Would 100% return for another hearty, satisfying meal!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108316928831037752348/reviews
Cody,5,"haha i read the reviews and decided to go early (public holiday). Food is awesome!

Service was smooth and fast (they must have read the reviews and improved)

Easily one of the tastier Fish Head Steamboats my fam has tasted.

Also, char siew is a MUST to order. I think I would travel down just for the steamboat and char siew.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117150727195226649277/reviews
Steven Lim,3,"Food was unremarkable, puzzled at the rave reviews. Pretty crowded on a weekend night. Noisy due to poor sound insulation.
Only the Garoupa steamboat and sambal potato leaves (the lard helps) acceptable but doesn‚Äôt warrant the price at an industrial park place.
Marmite Chicken was dry and unimaginative whilst the chilli prawn with beancurd was also forgettable.
Saving grace - friendly and efficient service staff and aircon environment - hence additional star
Definitely not returning.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112184808310540243609/reviews
