L,4,"Came on the Christmas Day morning, good vibe with non stop Christmas songs. The place is clean and the soft seats are comfortable.

Full breakfast- 👍🏻
Cappuccino - 👍🏻
Fuji signature dessert - 👎🏻 red bean paste too sweet, it is absolutely a sugar shot",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115891254688245762238/reviews
W8ll8am Gastby S8m,5,"Nice ambience,  peaceful and relaxing place to unwind .

The dessert 🍨 always thrill me. Japanese fusion with French = deliciously good ice cream bread and waffle.

The Nacos was deliciously tasty .

Will keep coming back .

S Law,3,"Cozy restaurant to have a decent western with Japanese fusion cuisine. Love the ocean view. We had the portobello wagyu burger and grilled chicken. Both are good and prices are acceptable. Service staff is friendly and helpful. As it’s pet friendly, we get to admire lots of cute puppies and dogs.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117634223302075240385/reviews
Sabrina Ng,3,"Mains are ok, tasty but not wow. Menu isn't that huge. Caesar salad is good but would order the dressing on the side next time. Pomodoro pasta and tuna tomato pasta (not pictured) are nice, too bad they ran out of mochi pasta so they used normal pasta (we were informed beforehand). Chicken steak served on hotplate is nice but pricey. Highlight of the meal was the Little Fuji dessert. Nice place to chill though, very spacious. Not crowded on Sunday night. There is free plain water. Staff are friendly. Will return to try their breakfast which staff mentioned is nice.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112095562145865275866/reviews
Amanda Baey,1,Ordered the Truffle Mushroom Pasta. Such a huge let down. Nowhere was truffle flavour present. Pasta tasted bland with only the garlic helping to break the monotonomy of the taste of oil. Totally not worth $24 at all.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104437937485691191829/reviews
