      "text": "Paid $5.90 for a plate of nasi Padang.\nThe dishes were well-prepared, flavorful, and balanced‚Äînot overly spicy, making them enjoyable for a wide range of palates.\nI selected the achar, tofu, and sambal fish. The achar was refreshing, with just the right balance of sweetness and tanginess, adding a nice crunch to the meal. The tofu was soft and well-seasoned, complementing the other dishes perfectly. The highlight was the sambal fish‚Äîfresh, tasty, and cooked to perfection, with a mildly spiced sambal that enhanced the flavor without overpowering it.\nOverall, the meal was delicious and well-executed, offering a comforting yet authentic taste of Nasi Padang. Definitely worth a visit.",

Price is very reasonable for a coffeeshop especially for the Nasi Rawon, Nasi Sambal goreng, Nasi Jegannan set which is only $5!\nWith the great ambience, clean and well lighted coffeeshop, makes it best to dine in..\n\nWe took the Nasi Rawon set and it was good.\nThe Rawon was not only given the gravy but the meats as well.. the sambal belacan, paru sambal, bagedil and sambal sotong was all a great combi. The portion was alot too for $5.\n\nWe were here at 9am (Sunday morning) Queue was already super long..\n\nWe will definitely return!\nWell done Desa Rancapanggung!",

      "text": "Update 2025: wanted to try their $3 budget meal at lunchtime but was told it was sold out. Wonder if it's fake advertising. Wanted to try their Nasi Lemak but it's already sold out past 11 am on a weekday. And they don't indicate on their signboard that it's sold out, wasting my time for queueing. Tried the Mee Siam and Lontong at $3.80 each. The Mee Siam is quite spicy but not really outstanding with basically just only mee hoon, small pieces of tau pok and one hard boiled egg in the bowl. If you like vegetables such as cabbage and long beans, then try their lontong which I feel is more value for money. It's not too spicy and the bowl is full of vegetables. You can also order caifan style from their spread of plain rice, eggs, vegetables, fish and meat etc. Take note the prices of fish and meat are $3 and above. P.S finally got to try their Nasi Lemak. Comes with fried chicken wing, a tiny fried fish, peanuts/ikan bilis, cucumber and a small slice of egg. It's quite tasty and value for money. My only complaint is that the egg slice is too small. If the egg is full size, then it'll be a perfect Nasi Lemak. But please indicate promptly on your signboard that Nasi Lemak or budget meal is sold out so that people don't queue up for nothing.",

The dishes were flavorful and satisfying, with standout items like the tender beef rendang and perfectly cooked squid. Prices are incredibly friendly‚Äîwhat you get here would easily cost double at the shops along Kandahar Street.",

      "text": "My second visit to the malay restaurant. I ordered lotong and nasi rawon. The lotong cost $4.50. I add tampe goreng. Excellent lotong with plenty of vegetables. The gravy is just nice thickness and taste with coconut. The nasi rawon consists of paru,sotong kering sambal, begeli. The rawon gravy is the most excellent taste I ever eaten as a Indian Muslim customer. Their balacan samble is different from I had eaten..their is sourly and pedas. Its goes well with the rice rawon. They gave me plenty pieces of beef in the rawon. They cooked into perfection. No room to complaints. For $5.00 is the best I had ever eaten nasi rawon. Good quality and excellent taste. There were long queue but the staff are friendly and helpful and prompt service üòÄ. I definitely will recommend this restaurant to my family members and friends too. Well done üëè",
