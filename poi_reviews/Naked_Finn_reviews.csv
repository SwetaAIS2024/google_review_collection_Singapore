Jeremy Teng,5,"Had always wanted to try but it was also quite out of the way. But am glad we came as the food was really good! Had the default dinner set which at first I thought was a little short but ended up very full.

Really enjoy the donabe and squid pancake tho! All the rest was very pleasant too, think for the price range defo a visit. Will wanna try their ala carte next time, saw fish being served and looks really good.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100877805630930813915/reviews
Patrick Poh,5,A unique experience - bee hoon and kang kong were served as cold dishes. They have a refreshing taste with some tanginess. The highlight for me was the claypot rice with yellow croaker fish meat that had been deboned.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107673184510491093624/reviews

Ian Teo,5,"My first full 5-star review goes to Naked Finn.

Service was fantastic, the staff were attentive, especially Felicia who went to great detail to go through the menu.

Next up, food. In summary, food is deliciously crafted.
• my favourite dish was the Dungeness crab with chwee kueh.
• the deep fried soon hock with curry is also a very good second. The meet was tender and juicy, with a crispy exterior.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107217578563907122844/reviews
Wai Keat Chong,4,"The food at Naked Finn was generally enjoyable, though the lunch menu felt somewhat limited with only about four main course options. I opted for the claypot rice, which was expertly cooked with a delightful crispy rice layer and flavorful fish.

The sharing plate of squid pancake was a delicious and flavorful choice. However, I found the prawn cakes to have an overly sweet flavor that wasn't to my liking.

The restaurant itself seemed rather empty during my lunch visit, creating a slightly cold and echoey atmosphere.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109182883906783051248/reviews
