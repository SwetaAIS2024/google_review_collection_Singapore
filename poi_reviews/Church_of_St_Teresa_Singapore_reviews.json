      "text": "A serene and historically significant Catholic church nestled on a quiet hilltop near Bukit Purmei. Its striking Romanesque architecture, complete with elegant arches, high ceilings, and a beautiful white façade, sets it apart as one of the more unique church buildings in the city.\n\nInside, the atmosphere is calm and reverent, with soft natural lighting adding to the spiritual ambiance. The church provides a peaceful setting for prayer, reflection, or attending mass. The community is warm and welcoming.\n\nAs one of the few churches in Singapore built in this architectural style, it offers both spiritual nourishment and visual beauty, making it a memorable place to visit for locals and visitors alike. Whether you're attending a service or exploring its history, the Church of St. Teresa offers a deeply meaningful experience.",
