Noemi Tasarra Twigg,4,"Decent coffee but the cakes were not very tasty. I do have a sweet tooth, so that may be a personal preference. Great service—the barista informed us of the bundled drink-cake combo when we ordered them separately (made some savings!)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108035868513094287837/reviews
Zahari Nawi,5,"Very nice place to chill and relax.

A delectable array of pastries, drinks, cakes, salads, and soup.

Conveniently located at Level 1 Hillion Mall. Friendly staff. French delights to whet your palette.

Do try the coffee and croissant.

Take away or dine in. Seats are limited, though. Will try more in my next visit.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101847246619607795969/reviews
Catherine Tan,4,I ❤️ the bread here. The croissants are so light and fluffy. Their baguette pizzas are also really good too. A breakfast here is more competitively priced compared to TBB. Highly recommended!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108571598741145831471/reviews
roberto suarez,3,This coffee place didn't impress me at all! The coffee served is not hot but warm. Suggest you have your mugs under heater so as not to dissipate the heat. The croissant with avocado and tuna has no tuna taste. Quite expensive for a food that doesn't taste good. Will be difficult for me to return eating here.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107936027613304776219/reviews
