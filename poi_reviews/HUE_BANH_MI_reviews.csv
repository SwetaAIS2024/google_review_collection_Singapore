Posh Pearl,5,"Via grab delivery.
I like how well the food is packaged, how the spring rolls are wrapped individually to prevent them from drying out, how the huge baguette stays crispy and airy and how the owner is so generous to provide a multitude of ingredients and fillings for each dish. The vegetables are also fresh, crispy and refreshing.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106728704755913363642/reviews
Su L (Su L),5,"Their rice vermicelli (bun cha) with chicken is fantastic. I was surprised to see mint, basil and peanuts in my dish. (Many restaurants skip on these accompaniments.)

Flora Aurelia,5,"Honest food made with love at its best.
The bahnmi bread is so fresh and crispy, stuffed with fresh herbs and your choice of protein
( every protein is üëå)

The bun thit nuong , goicuon and mango salad are madly delicious as well.
The price point is insane considering the amount of prep work and effort that goes into it.

Be prepared to wait for a lil past the agreed time slot because the lovely lady boss is a one man show with the orders Pilling up like no tomorrow.

Therefore human error is inevitable with regards to missing out 1 or 2 bahnmi or salads.

So if you decided that you can't afford that, show yourself out to the door. You don't have to be a self entitled sgp and raise your voice and make a scene.  For this price and the quality of food you are getting one should be real ashamed of behaving ill manneredly.

End of the day , its just a Great couple selling honest good food,making a living.

Be kind.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109688135932628621461/reviews
Jernesa Tan,5,"Hue Banh Mi offers exceptional food quality and will be my go-to destination whenever I crave authentic Vietnamese cuisine. While it‚Äôs an 8 minutes walk from the nearest MRT station, the journey is absolutely worth it. I couldn‚Äôt resist and started enjoying the delicious banh mi on my way back to the station.

The mango salad is a standout ‚Äî incredibly flavorful and addictive. Don‚Äôt miss out on their iced milk coffee, which perfectly complements the meal. The experience (friendly owners too!) was well worth the 1.5 hours travel time, and I‚Äôll definitely be returning. ‚ò∫Ô∏è",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101705552496105943842/reviews
Calvin L,5,"There is no dine-in since it is home-based.

The food overall is very good with a generous amount of ingredients. But the cold drinks have alot of ice possible due to too sweet.

The owner is very friendly and takes time to explain the possible long wait.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107912927968526228289/reviews
