I can’t thank the teachers, educators and the staff at Haven Schoolhouse enough for their passion and thoughtfulness in taking care / teaching my kids. I can entrust them and hence able to focus on work during weekdays. My children look forward to go to school everyday! Thank you teachers and aunties once again!",
