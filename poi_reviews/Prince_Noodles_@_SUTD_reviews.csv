Kim Min Sung,5,"Ban Mian so good i made a picture of it my phone wallpaper and telegram profile picture 😋❤️❤️😘 LOVE LOVE the texture of the noodles, its so springy and chewy and I just cant get enough of it. Must make sure to add the onsen egg to make the noodles creamy and extra yummy. I live on the other side of SG but i always come here just for the ban mian, even during my holidays.

The boss is also super nice! He became my wingman and helped get me my current girlfriend 😂😂 Sometimes i miss his ban mian more than my gf 🤣🤣 Gonna bring our kids here in the future😆😆",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100153795125946843584/reviews
Cherie,4,Really enjoyed the springy handmade ban mian with a generous amount of toppings. Must add chilli for that extra punch of flavour. Would prefer a thicker dark soy sauce tho.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109705162568473781293/reviews
