Grace Lee,4,Ample parking. Good food & service. Food came out fast too. All the dishes were commendable. Perhaps the trio egg spinach soup could have more soup/liquid. Good Portion sizes. We ordered 2 soups. 6 dishes were more than sufficient to feed 8 pax. $18/pax is a good feed. Wasabi prawn could have used better quality wasabi paste/sauce. Did not give the kick. But the prawns were fresh and big. Overall good clean ambience with fans for a cooler experience.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114868807802053749557/reviews
CK C,4,"Gentleman who took orders was very friendly. Steamboat was cooked using charcoal and the soup was very delicious with no hint of MSG. However, the quality and quantity of the fish was rather disappointing. The honeydew wasabi prawns and caipo tofu were OK. Will be back to try the other dishes.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
