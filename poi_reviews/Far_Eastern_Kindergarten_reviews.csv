Elaine Wong,5,"We absolutely love FEK. This exceptional preschool truly stands out for its focus on character building, family values, academics, and Bible based teachings

The dedicated teachers and staff are the backbone of this incredible school. They create a warm, nurturing environment that feels like family. Our children look forward to school every day!

We're most impressed by the preschool's emphasis on sustainability, teaching children the importance of caring for our planet.

Highly recommended!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117232804196575873965/reviews
khoo yvonne,5,"FEK has a very nurturing and loving environment. Mrs Ang, the Principal, knows every child by name and I love the way she interacts with them. She regularly engages parents in conversations as well. It’s wonderful to see how the staff (teaching & non-teaching) encourages the children to think outside the box and explore their ideas freely. The children are so engaged in every activity, whether it be making props for the concert or just watering the plants in the garden. As a parent, I’m really heartened when I see my son enjoying his time in school. I’m really thankful for all the experiences my son has had in the school over the past 3 years and I applaud the dedication and commitment of the staff here 🙏🏻😊",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101025821298420805217/reviews

ChanSus Music,5,"My son struggled a little bit during the 1st few weeks as he was not strong in Chinese Language and he is an introvert type. After a few weeks, he loved it to be in school. Fully dedicated teachers and staff, fun activities, friendly environment and lovely friends. The parents and kids are still meeting up even after graduation. If you’re looking for a safe place with strong Christian value for your kids to grow, FEK is the right place. Thank you Mrs Ang and all the teachers and staffs for their strong dedication to FEK and its community.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107570284893736749638/reviews
xuannyxuan,5,"As a young parent seeking a reputable preschool that upholds strong Christian values, boasts caring and compassionate teachers, and provides a safe and nurturing environment for my children's growth and learning, Far Eastern Kindergarten (FEK) unquestionably fulfills all my criteria. I am delighted to have made one of the best decisions by enrolling my kids in FEK!

FEK instills a strong moral compass in children during their formative years, fostering qualities like kindness, honesty, forgiveness and empathy that are essential for character development.

Each term anchors itself on a character value supported with activities and projects that adds a layer of excitement and engagement to the learning process. It not only makes education more enjoyable for kids but also helps them build meaning connections to the Bible.

The dedication of the teachers in the 3-hour program is praiseworthy, evident in the thoughtful planning that underlies each lesson. Witnessing the teachers exceed their duties, dedicating themselves wholeheartedly to this heartfelt work, has been truly remarkable. While some may draw comparisons based on the duration of childcare versus kindergarten, the emphasis should truly be on prioritizing quality over quantity.

In essence, FEK goes beyond mere academic instruction, shaping the child's character, fostering positive social behavior, and providing a moral foundation that can significantly influence their future interactions and decisions.

I’m so proud to be part of this FEK community and wouldn’t trade anything else for this!
