Francis Kwang,3,"A somewhat out of the way place near the Clementi Fire Station. Quiet place in the mid morning of a Saturday. Was there to grab a coffee / matcha while burning some free time.

It shares the rather spacious place with a gelato parlour. Was there for the coffee / matcha and therefore didn’t try the ice-cream but they had a few interesting flavours.

The service at the coffee side was pretty poor. While it’s a weekend but I would expect a friendly face rather than one that is so surly and disgruntled.

The drinks - macadamia coffee and matcha latte, were forgettable and lacklustre in flavour. Surprised and disappointed given the rather good ratings. The banana cake was also dry and lacking in flavour.

The space is kind of weird, they have a corner partitions by glass for the coffee with limited seats but connected to a larger area with more ample seatings where they serve the gelatos.

We sat at the gelato area and since it was quiet, it was very comfortable - we literally had the whole place to ourselves.

The upside is the parking… limited but free as it was private to the shophouses.

I would return likely to try the gelato but I’ll skip the drinks.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115353246724953608735/reviews
GG K,3,"Quiet atmosphere on a weekend with great aircon. Drinks are so-so, but it's not a bad place to sit and chit chat.

Babycino was nothing special, would give this a miss. I also felt that it wasn't very appealing to serve it in a paper cup. Their coffee was also not impressive.

Would not come again as it's not worth the price.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113182488876013163119/reviews
shzhong,3,Quite a nice environment for chit chat. the white is slightly on the acidic side while the hazelnut ice cream is not bad a choice to go along with the waffle ice cream.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100751887826137549593/reviews
celinemy,3,"Taro latter is worth a try but a bit too sweet for me. Latte was average.
The cafe shared a same dine in area with an ice cream shop. Not too crowd and not noisy.
There’s NO wifi and tab water at the place. And restroom was broken when visiting (need to borrow restrooms next door). Wouldn’t recommend for using laptop here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113590329818045001653/reviews
Daryl “Dino”,5,"I wasn’t able to try their gelato counterpart next door but I was able to try their coffee. Cute little cafe with a light colored decor and ambiance to it. Really enjoy the space as it is quite aesthetic: also have windows that pour the natural light in. There are limited seating inside but there are benches and stools outside which are quite comfy too. It’s located in an interesting spot where it gives a very homely and neighborhood vibe - which I enjoy very much. The coffee itself I found could improve a bit more on the balance between the acidity and bitterness, but was still acceptable.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103770357976578998557/reviews
