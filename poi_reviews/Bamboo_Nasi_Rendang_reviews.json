      "text": "Initially wanted to try the Rendang Beef Nasi Bamboo but unfortunately it was sold out close to 6pm that day. Opted take-away for the rusuk(rib) instead.\n\nThe rice was wrapped using pandan leaf, which led to every grain of rice being really fragrant & rich in flavour. There were no clumps at all. The rib was succulent, well-cooked & it literally peeled off the bone effortlessly. The piece of fat was a bonus at it enhances the taste of the meal without overpowering it.\n\nThe rendang gravy was slightly underwhelming for my taste however it still went well with the rice & meat.\n\nFor take-away, the dish was further wrapped using aluminium foil which kept the dish warm till you get home.\n\nThe uncle manning the store was extremely friendly too!",
