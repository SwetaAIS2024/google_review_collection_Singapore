      "text": "2 things stand out here\nMee goreng is incredibly NOT salty at all, just another miraculous find in the world of heart-healthy hawker food\nIt's still very very tasty so this is my new favourite mee goreng stall\nPortion is huge, piping hot fries in cheese sauce are served as sides\nFries in cheese sauce in mee goreng. Standard serving. They moved here from Shenton Way.\nIn the neighbourhood of My Father's Minced Meat Noodles, suddenly blk 477 has become my favourite haunt in Tampines.\nDo note that they can be pretty hard to find. They're right behind the Family A1 Ayam Goreng and Western food stall (another of my favourites)",
