So far this is the best! We tried 2 of the toasts...so syiok!! My wife loves the porridge...Hainan Chicken Porridge. Flavourful!!",

The Singapore fried mee was OK. Would have preferred the thicker white noodle and white squid. More gravy too. Long wait to get a seat.",

It was also kind of hard to find parking. But parking was not the main issue, the underwhelming food was the let down.\n\nBut I have to add that we only had mee soto and hor fun. Both dishes did not taste like what we were used to or expecting. We've definitely had better versions elsewhere. Maybe we should have found out first what's the must eat here?",
