Also the sweet front desk staff!\n\n22/03/2025 Update: Oh my gosh, please don‚Äôt mix up this Smile Dental @ Blk 59 with Smile Central @ Blk 58! Totally different clinics with similar sounding names. There‚Äôs no Dentist ‚ÄúJonathan‚Äù here so please call the right clinic for your dentures, implant problems or whatsoever.  Poor staff here have to endure all your call complaints wrongly directed to them because of your lack of care in checking.",

She replied, half an hour more! Why? Because the existing patient decided to do an implant. No one approached to inform me abt the expected delay and no apology. Time wasted.",
