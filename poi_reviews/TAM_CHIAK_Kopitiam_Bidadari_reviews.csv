Wesley Tan,4,"Would suggest more tables as it crowded due to some promotion I guess. Also if the china food can put there stove at other place not the table as it take out space for the table. Went to queue for the promotion grilled fish 86 Bao Chao Dian but sad to say the queue was long and waiting time was more then 1hour after the cashier say but end up we waited for 1hr40mins. End up we had to Tabao the food and order something else. Food was alright, not bad. Had order fish ball noodle not bad. Also the zhi Cha salted egg pork rib rice was not bad too",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104083313029760015937/reviews
anonymous,5,"Generally great coffeeshop. Only downside is limited seating during peak periods (weekend lunch and dinner timing), all other times are pretty okay. Baby chairs are also readily available (not really common for coffeeshops but Tam Chiak has them). Food options are not too bad in terms of variety. Pricing wise might be pricier than the old school void deck coffeeshop, but food quality wise is definitely higher. Only down side is no muslim option. Most shop owners are also friendly, with the exception of the roast duck shop. In short, food is good and justifiable for higher price, just that maybe residents there might not be willing to spend that extra $1 everyday for the quality.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107226983645585855715/reviews
Kin Nam Chan,2,I had my food from Chef de Pasta but honestly speaking.. it was a bad dining experience at this coffeeshop. I know what not to expect but the tasteless music being blasted from this Cai fan stall is pure rubbish. Tam Chiak you need to control your vendors a little man. The neighbourhood would love some peace especially at 8pm when people want to wind down after they get home.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100410629878648536483/reviews
Gohht 13,4,"For a coffeeshop, I think it offers a good spread of food choices. Thereâ€™s peking duck and ice cream waffles as well. Nice peking duck for $27 (Â½) and goreng satay special. Taste great, coupled with thai green tea. ðŸ˜‹

Roger K19,4,"For $5, it's value for money.
The noodle includes 3 reasonably sized prawns, a fair amount of fish cake, and slices of pork.

Pork lard, chili powder, and fried shallots are available for self-service.

I felt quite full after finishing my meal.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100258467229178460654/reviews
