zainol iz,1,"Im using the tourist pass card and it is my last day here. So i asked the Indian officer at the counter where can i return the pass to claim back my deposit. He mentioned that it can be done at Terminal 4 (of where im heading to) confidently. As i arrived at Terminal 4, I was instructed to go to Terminal 2 instead for the claim.

So thank you dear officer for the false info and making me go around changi. You should  get a raise for being so “clever”",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110392317865430528362/reviews
