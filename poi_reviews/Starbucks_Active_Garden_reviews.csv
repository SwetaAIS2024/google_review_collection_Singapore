I won't say it is quiet nor packed but at least u can find a seats and drink coffee to enjoy scenery. There is a playground beside the  Starbucks. U can drink  coffee beside the playground at the open space.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115116364248656767934/reviews
MJ Ang,1,"This is the second outlet opened near Active Garden in Gardens by the Bay. Unfortunately the outdoor area was invaded by birds hunting for food and they would aggressively snatch your food the moment you stepped out from the aircon to the outdoor area. The service staff shared that they had written to the management several times but no help was given to them.  Birds were seen on tables, signages and bins posing hygiene issues.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111829771208338608145/reviews
