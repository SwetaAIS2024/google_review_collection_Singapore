Price is actually reasonable after dividing up the total.\nMy main complains about this place is really the size of each table, too cramp and too hot. I would probably visit again after they move, if they move.",

The soup base and adding the wine at the end makes it even more rich.\nThe homemade wanton is really good too!\n\nWe have never finished the entire pot of soup at any hotpot restaurant and this is our first!\n\nNo photos of the food before we ate because we were too hungry to dig in ;p",

The ingredients are super fresh from the beef and pork to fish. The udon is so springy too. Really satisfied by the end of the meal! The staff are friendly despite being busy during peak periods. Be sure to check the opening hours as they are not open daily. When they are open, it feels like One Pot and the Free Movement Dance Studio (directly across) are the most happening and bustling places in this cosy corner of Singapore. There‚Äôs free parking here which is huge plus. We will be back! üôèüèª",
