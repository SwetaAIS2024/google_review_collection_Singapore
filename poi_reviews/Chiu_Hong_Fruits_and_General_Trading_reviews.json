Yesterday, out of 5 pieces, only 2 pieces were fresh (see photos). The other 3 pieces (watermelon, rockmelon and papaya) were few days old and can't be eaten at all! I have to throw them in the chute! Wasted my money! The woman boss look like she's not interested to do business. Don't waste your money here ;(",

After dodging my question, she finally snapped and said, \"All the watermelons are unripe, don't buy.\"\n\nHer response was rude, and it felt like she was deliberately misleading me from the start. The lack of honesty and respect was really disappointing. I definitely wouldn’t recommend buying from here.",
