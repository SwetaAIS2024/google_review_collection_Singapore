Marvin Chew,4,"Location not that accessible, but it's surrounded with many nice eateries, like bak gu teh and famous Loy Kee Chicken Rice, there's also an Indian ABC Restaurant opposite the hotel which opens 24hrs.. Commendable to the staffs for their proficiency during check in. Although there was a crowd during check in time, it didn't take me too long to check in to my room. Excellent customer service!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116407727303442394593/reviews
Kirti Bokde,3,"Good hotel with apt staff. the staff at its restaurant is not rude but aren't friendly either. They never smile, no greetings, nothing. They just do their job like machines. Rooms are good and well equipped, located near to bus stop, its just a minute walk. Breakfast menu is good, but would have rated more if more indian menu had been added, given that many guests are from India.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105945208759940085784/reviews
CCS,2,"Went there for its famed 1960s buffet dinner. And the hotel looks the part. Time had stood still.

Nothing has changed said my companion. The food is just as good. The hotel however,  could do with some sprucing up. The car park is dim, dingy and narrow. The path through to the hotel lobby (passengers lift was ""under maintenance) was an harrowing experience for me, a senior citizen,  and my high-heeled lady companion.

The washrooms are worthy of any Korean zombie movie complete with blinking overhead lights and a pipe humming that is louder than a passing jet plane.  No wonder the ladies have the fastest turnaround in Singapore.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
fennie lim,5,"I went there to have porridge buffet as supper. The variety was not bad. There were chicken curry, braised duck, herbal mutton, steamed prawns and squids. There were 6 different flavours of ice cream. There was a self-service laksa station. There were rice, noodles, plain porridge and sweet potato porridge. Refill of food was done quite promptly. The service crew cleared the empty plates quite fast too. I had a good experience dining there.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110750758349398421950/reviews
