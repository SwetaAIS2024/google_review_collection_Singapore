      "text": "An excellent meal, the butter chicken (murgh makhani) was delicious. We also tried the jeera rice (basmati rice cooked with cumin and coriander) and the allepey fish curry (cooked with green mango and coconut milk gravy) for the first time. Interesting in a good way! The dishes were full of flavour, we mopped up all the curry gravy with a garlic naan and the rice, and washed everything down with sweet lassi as well. Service staff was very attentive and courteous as well, even though the restaurant was full. We enjoyed our dinner very much!",

Excellent place for vegetarians with lots of options! The quantity was good too and appam was great. The service was good and the staff were helpful.",
