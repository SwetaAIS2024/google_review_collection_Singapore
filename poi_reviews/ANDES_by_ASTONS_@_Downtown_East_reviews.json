      "text": "We visited Andes at Downtown East on a quiet Tuesday afternoon, which was perfect as there weren’t many customers. The peaceful atmosphere made for a pleasant dining experience.\n\nI’ve always loved their Fiery Chicken, and once again, they didn’t disappoint. The crispy skin and tender, succulent meat were absolutely spot-on—delicious as ever! I don’t know how they manage to get it so perfect every time, but it’s a must-try for anyone visiting.\n\nIf there’s one area for improvement, it would be the service. It felt a bit awkward overhearing staff conversations while we were dining. Perhaps the staff could check on customers more frequently to enhance the overall experience.\n\nThat said, I still love Andes for their consistently amazing food. It’s always a treat!",

The mac & cheese and fries were a hit with the little ones, and the New York strip was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. Service was friendly and fast, and the place has a welcoming vibe—very family-friendly. We’ll definitely be back!",

The cheese was diluted and not great taste.\n\nThe other sides were all right.",
