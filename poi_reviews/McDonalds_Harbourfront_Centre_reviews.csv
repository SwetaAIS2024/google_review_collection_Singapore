A,2,"Can Mcd hire more staff here to help or at least plan strategic campaigns? they launched this $1 coffee promo and the place is so packed and crowded with people waiting for their coffees. One of the staff told me that their machine can only produce 1-2 coffees at a time so the waiting time will be long. I can tell that the staff are all stressed from the overwhelming orders too.

Ordered myself a fillet o fish and waited for almost 20mins. i guess the staff that was handling my burger really gave up as seen in the photo.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112720716536799123767/reviews
Randy Ngatimin,1,"Double Prosperity beef burger is the best.

McCrispy signature is alright. The 1990s McCrispy is still the best.

Mala Chicken McCrispy and corn pie are not bad. Mala isn‚Äôt as spicy though. Potato pops are so-so only.

Curry McNuggets are quite underwhelming. Curry flavour is really light.

1 star as this outlet isn‚Äôt able to cope with promotional period overload ($1 coffee).",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107076346774947547605/reviews
Nyonya Rumah Asli,2,"Had very very bad service from one of female MCD staff in red shirt who was standing at the ""payment only"" counter.  I've ordered through the automatic machine, but I don't know what the next step is. Then I asked her.  But she was just stared, didn't say anything and then she walked away left me like I'm an idiot. She's maybe a kitchen staff, but if she doesn't understand what I was asking about, it's better if she tells me to ask other staff, not just walk away.  How rude!!!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102403129090076352294/reviews
Blackraven,4,"29 Jul 2024: Very busy Monday morning breakfast hours, but food was distributed in an orderly manner! With many patient customers too!
14 Aug 2024: I would like to feedback that Satay Burger has too little satay sauce! The combination of onions and cucumber is great but lacking taste of the peanut sauce, so a bit disappointing!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114385515451710838076/reviews
Kristabelle Poh,1,We stay near Harbourfront so naturally when we place an online order it‚Äôs always from this restaurant. Countless of times we have placed orders and 8/10 times they will miss out the maple syrup for the breakfast pancakes and we have to deal with dry pancakes for breakfast or they will miss out something in the order. Really don‚Äôt know what to say but to not order delivery from here. Not sure if they want us to choke on the dry pancakes. We had to buy our own honey to standby instead üòµ‚Äçüí´,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110838214081304086884/reviews
