Kai Ling,5,"Huge spread of ready meal and food items ranging from salads, rice bowls, korean to Japanese sushi, yakitori as well as bentos.
This is op top of the regular supermarket sections.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100635259993109346258/reviews
So,1,The new salad bar is a bit of rip off. He claims that they are very generous on the portion; i got 3 small pieces of chicken breast in the small box (9.50 sgd). Your customer will never return when there are better value options around. Even CS’s own fresh meat is far better value. Also the chicken does not taste fresh. You cut corners so much then people will notice and leave you!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109240826741499586913/reviews

Bogdan Costache,5,"Clean and spacious supermarket! If you value freshness ,variety and quality, this supermarket is for you! Good standard selection of food and groceries here, in this Cold Storage. Not all the prices are higher compared to Giant or NTUC Fair Price! The store is very well organised.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101508702539459432019/reviews
Kelly Low,1,"Probably the worst Cold Storage outlet.

Limited variety and shelves often left unstocked. Do not trust any “fresh” produce and dairy products sold here. Fruits and vegetables are often old. Mold is frequently observed in fruits. Yoghurt that is supposed to expire in 2 months is watery and grainy.

Staff still overlooks the quality when stocking the shelves despite numerous feedback. I will not visit unless it is an emergency.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112623737791453883966/reviews
