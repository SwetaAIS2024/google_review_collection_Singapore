The dedication of the teaching staff, their politeness, and attentiveness truly stand out, making every interaction a positive experience. My elder child attends an international school, yet I find myself even more pleased with Qdees. Their events, such as sports day and graduation day, are handled with great care and creativity, making each moment memorable for both the children and parents. The teachers and staff at Qdees Ecobotanic are committed to excellence, creating a warm and supportive environment that fosters growth and joy in learning. I will highly recommend this school to any parent looking for a quality preschool and daycare for their child. Thank you, Qdees Ecobotanic, for making this journey so wonderful!",
