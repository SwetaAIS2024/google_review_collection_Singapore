(Should have recorded!)\nIt was easier to sing and sounded better!\nLearned that it‚Äôs not how loud you can sing but need to understand how to control your voice!\nA very fruitful 60min‚ù§Ô∏èüé§\nWill bring my husband next time so that he can sing better in Karaoke HAHHAHAHA",

I had been learning from her for more than 5 years for J pops songs to ensure the pronunciation is up to Japanese standard. I was one of the finalists in JAS NHK karaoke competition and performed 2 songs on her Angel live k on event with proper musician. Thanks to her I passed the audition. She always encourages her students to sing their favorite Japanese songs. She encouraged us to use our natural voice to sing the covers instead of copying the original singers. Until now I‚Äôm still her loyal students.\n\nÂÖàÁîü„ÅÑ„Å§„ÇÇ„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜ„Åî„Åñ„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åôüòä‚ù§Ô∏è",
