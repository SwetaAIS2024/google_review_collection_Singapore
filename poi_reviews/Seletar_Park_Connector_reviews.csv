Universe Infinite,5,"Finally opened ðŸ˜ŠIt is about 1.43km from the  map board till the dead end, where you will need to turn around to get back out. It run along the perimeter of the seletar club and itâ€™s very quiet with little human traffic. You see the club on 1 side and the reservoir on the other side. Nothing much to see, till 1 day they tidy up the shore side and people can really enjoy the reservoir view. The park board should tidy up the place abit!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108896893300731369390/reviews
