Menu is a little limited but they are more like a food kiosk so that is understandable. The only gripe I have is that sometimes when the stall is busy, they have only One staff. The poor staff has to collect money, take order, fry the chicken, cut the chicken etc. Your staff not actually super humans okay?",
