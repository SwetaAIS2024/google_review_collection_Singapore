Kitty was looking for some essential oils for her living room, and this charming little shop had a great selection.\n\nThe essential oils smelled wonderful, and the prices were reasonable.  Although the brand wasn't well-known, the quality seemed good. The owner was very friendly and helpful, offering recommendations for oils that would be perfect for Kitty's space.\n\nWe had a pleasant experience at The Aroma Hub, and would recommend it to anyone looking for essential oils and aromatherapy products.",
