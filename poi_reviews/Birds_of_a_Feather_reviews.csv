Brendan,5,"First I want to highlight the exceptional service of the team at Birds of a Feather. I had a large group booking and they were proactive and communicative. Also had a last minute change and they were very understanding in accommodating our changes.

Really enjoyed the food which was a creative fusion of flavours, familiar yet refreshing. Each dish was well executed. Personal favourites were the pork dumpling and the Chicken in the Chillies.

Also got the lunch sets which were good value for money, with large portions. Would highly recommend.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117583092881609068665/reviews
Serene T,5,"We had a fantastic dining experience here, trying the sharing menu for two and enjoying every dish. The standout for us was the Homestyle Braised Pork Belly. It was rich, flavorful, and absolutely satisfying.

Despite the busy lunch crowd, the ambiance remained cozy and inviting, making it a great spot to relax and enjoy a meal. The service was attentive and efficient, adding to the overall pleasant experience.

Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for delicious food, a great atmosphere, and excellent service. We’ll definitely be back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109445538959776207310/reviews

Shanice EZX,3,"Decided to try this place for mother’s day.

The dishes here, or at least the ones I’ve ordered were a hit or miss for me. My favourite dish would be Crab & Avocado Brushetta ($18), nothing too heavy and I liked how they incorporate crab together with guac.

Yu Xiang Eggplant Soba ($18) was a tad bit salty for my liking. This was the only dish we didn’t finish 🫠

Find the Chickens in the Chillies ($19) was pretty good 🌶️ The spices were fragrant and chicken pieces were fried to perfection. They used cashews, which I thought didn’t have that satisfying crisp compared to peanuts…

Tried out the Homestyle Braised Pork Belly ($63) everyone raved about. It was ok, nothing amazing. The table found it too greasy and overwhelmingly rich after a few spoons. The taste of truffle wasn’t very prominent in this dish. But you can taste lots and lots of kale 😂

Yammy duck ($28) was my least favourite. This dish is probably an acquired taste, you’ll appreciate this if you like foie gras. I thought the yam didn’t go very well with the duck confit. In terms of texture, the yam was very slimy, and the duck confit wasn’t crispy enough. I’d skip this dish 100%.

Got a osmanthus cocktail ($26) too. Overall service was good. Servers were all very helpful when recommending dishes, taking pictures, and explaining the different components of the dish. Ambience was good too, though I didn’t really like seating as there were no lights above us which made our surroundings pretty dark.

Overall: ⭐️⭐️⭐️/5",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100410728520692118490/reviews
