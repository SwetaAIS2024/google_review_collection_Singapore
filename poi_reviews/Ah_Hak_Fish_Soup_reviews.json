Could not taste any prawns stock.  Pretty bland.  Perhaps just a bit salty.\n\nNot likely to come back again üòÖ",

      "text": "so surprised by the amount of fish inside!! so much fish and all very fresh. i like eating fish soup but many places give only few miserable slices of fish . very fresh and good quantity of fish!!! recommended! i will come back again. came back again after renovation . uncle very generous gave me a crab! very nice uncle tending to the store. Also if you come here often enough you can ask for other items not listed on the menu. Sometimes he bring in seasonal fishes and crabs and shell fish. During Chinese New Year it's rabbit fish, now is the season for lizard fish . Today i went in the special was sea cucumber and hand made prawn balls which tasted soooo good and refreshing with chestnut inside !! I will come back again for the lizard fish",

      "text": "Owner and his assistant used to run a zhichar stall at Fengshan 85 Market. The stall is called Guan Guan Seafood. The stall closed down subsequently after the food centre going through a major renovation. Surprised to find out that he open a stall at this current place selling fish soup instead. Have visited this stall quite a few times already. Price of the batang fish soup starts from SGD$5 onwards. Apart from that, they also have something more premium which is the red grouper fish soup. They also have other dishes like braised egg and taupok and braised pig trotter.\n\nUsually, we would order the braised egg and taupok to go along with our fish soup. Soup is flavorful and the sliced batang is fresh. Overall, enjoyed the fish soup very much! would definitely come back again in the future.",
