Would like to express my sincerest gratitude to Sheffield family for nurturing Rochelle. What's more amazing are the unique educational hands-on activities which Rochelle's previous preschool did not do. Rochelle looks forward to come to school everyday and it makes me feel so happy and safe to send my daughter here. Thank you",

From the bottom of our hearts, we sincerely appreciate all the time spent into teaching our son and shaping him to a smart and confident primary 1 student.\n\nPutting him at Sheffield kidsworld was the best thing that has happened to him. As it is at Sheffield where he gained his confidence and motivation to learn. He has been selected as class monitor now.\n\nHopefully his primary school will nurture him as well as Sheffield did a great job",
