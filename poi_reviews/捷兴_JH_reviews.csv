Terence Lee,4,"This stall serves nice decent bowl of fishball noodles.
Their noodles are well cooked.
Fresh ingredients, their fishballs are firm and chewy.
Chilli sauce gives a kicked to your taste buds. May want to ask for less spicy if your spicy level is low.
Their soup is tasty.
Very economical pricing starting from $2.50.
Definitely worth eating.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113175319567959304019/reviews
Darryl C,3,"Average tasting bowl of fishball noodles but offering value with even a $2.50 option available. Where itâ€™s lacking are the noodles.

Ideal for value seekers looking for a cheap fishball noodle fix.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116339559063664007715/reviews
Wilson Foo,3,"One of the cheapest fishball noodles in Singapore. This stall is at Teban Gardens Food Center.

Not the tastiest nor the biggest serving, it is cheap even though the prices have gone up by 50cents compared with one year ago. You get 4 fishballs ($3.00 portion) and some sliced fish cakes. Thereâ€™s also minced pork in the noodles itself.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114263857328212431619/reviews
Eric Wong,3,"Had lunch here on 11 May 2022, the meepok i had is extremely spicy.. i think they used chilli padi or something.. think need to tell them to not add so much chilli if you cant take too much spice.. overall, the fishball is nice, soup not salty, meepok is ideal for me ðŸ˜Š price very reasonable from $2/$2.50/$3... i ordered the $3 portion",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117691308830861443080/reviews
