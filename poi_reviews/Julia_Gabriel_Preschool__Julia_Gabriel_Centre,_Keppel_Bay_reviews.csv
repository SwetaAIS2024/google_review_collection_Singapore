Al. L,5,"Great experiences here at the enrichment center tucked away in picturesque Keppel Bay! The location by the marina offers a serene backdrop, and the new facility boasts a warm and inviting environment. The teachers are not only incredibly funny and engaging but also exceptionally nurturing, especially with young children and babies. Our little one adores every moment spent here, and we've seen remarkable progress in their development. Highly recommend this center to any parent looking for top-notch care and education for their child!""",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113347660454757545633/reviews
Sean Tang,5,"We really like the program in Julia Gabriel Keppel Bay and we can see a vast improvement in our child's overall development since he attended school here. We feel that our child has become more outspoken, confident, and sociable, and he seems to enjoy all the activities and lessons in school. Furthermore, we like that the school is clean and bright, and our child loves looking at the scenery of the harbour from his classroom. We are very satisfied and happy with Julia Gabriel Keppel Bay, and we recommend all parents to bring their children here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105997574853598148235/reviews
Peter Chan,5,"Great environment with a brand new facility and furnishing that’s so inviting that our daughter didn’t want to leave school.

But above all, the staff and teachers are awesome. They’re well spoken, highly passionate and extremely loving. Contributing to the warm,  homely and family like culture at the school.

It’s certainly a place where our daughter identifies as her second home.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104931346394603569844/reviews
