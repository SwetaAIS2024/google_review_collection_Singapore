Eng Seng Yeoh,5,"I had my jaw surgery done early this year by Dr. Chan. The surgery was life-changing and the whole journey was really a pleasant one. During the consultation appointment, Dr. Chan communicated patiently with me to find out the result that I wished to achieve. I was so glad that his clinic was equipped with the latest imaging technology that allowed me to visualize the result that I was going to get. He really tried to formulate a perfect plan that can treat my functional and aesthetic needs. Dr. Chan and his team had really prepared me well for the surgery, making sure that I was well aware of the sequelae and possible complications after the surgery. At that point, I knew that I was in good hands and I knew I most likely was going to get the result that I longed for.

The recovery was a lot easier than I expected. With the help of the medications, I did not suffer much. At one week mark, I was already confident to show myself to the public. As for today, I am still really grateful for the result. The surgery was one of the best decisions I have made in my life. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Chan and his team for the wonderful care they have given me.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112439007199697710685/reviews
Andrea Goh,5,"I had my jaw surgery done by Dr. Chan, as well as braces done by Dr. Chow. Both doctors were highly professional and advised me well regarding how to go about this. When I decided to do this surgery, I had many commitments like school, CCAs, and other events which the doctors had to workaround. Thankfully, they were very understanding and adaptable and were able to plan the surgery and my recovery process so that my swelling would have gone down before I had to start school again. This process took about two years, and I was amazed at how both doctors performed during every appointment. They were very gentle and knowledgeable, allowing me to place my trust in them. When we faced a setback during one of the checkups, where one of my brackets came off (probably because of something I ate or from brushing my teeth too hard, but even I did not realize that it came off until Dr. Chow told me about it), causing my teeth to not shift to the correct position, we were all worried as it was extremely close to the surgery date. Both doctors were calm and quick to discuss the best solution to this problem. Eventually, my teeth shifted to the correct position in time, allowing the surgery to proceed as scheduled. After the surgery done by Dr. Chan, I was shocked as I had expected the swelling and bruising to be worse than what I had experienced. The pain was minimal and almost felt like nothing. I also thought that it would take me about a month before I could eat proper solid foods. To my surprise, it only took me about 2-3 weeks to start eating solid foods. Although the food I ate had to be cut into tiny pieces and cooked till it was very soft, I was more than satisfied. Before the surgery, I had felt pain near the area where both jaws met, near my ears, whenever I ate something, and would occasionally occur even when I was resting. However, after the surgery, I have yet to feel any pain at all. The nurses and dental assistants there took care of me exceptionally well too. Overall, I had a fantastic experience at Aesthetic Reconstructive Jaw Surgery and would recommend Dr. Chan and Dr. Chow to anyone looking to do this surgery:))",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113354136891248555379/reviews
Cassandra Gayle,5,"I had dental implants placed 2 months ago by Dr Chan. I have the worst dental phobia possible and my anxiety kept me making excuses from having the surgery done a long time. Dr Chan and his staff Karling were amazing at putting me at ease from a week before and answering my 101 questiond relative to pain (which was really nothing compared to what i imagined). On the day itself, Dr Chan kept me calm and almost in a child-like manner had to reassure me i was in good hands. Next thing i know, i was awakened to the procedure completed. Recovery was quick and easy (any other discomfort owed purely to me being such a baby). Dr Chan and his staff are accomodating and patient and never fail to indulge my need for a follow up appt. I highly recommend him and his team to anyone who is looking for a Dr who makes a difference. (He made a huge impact to me).",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111046192418752814442/reviews
