I visited a couple of times a few years back before covid, and back in 2015.\n\nJust visited recently in 2024, and was shocked to find out that most shops & F&Bs have closed for about a year now - all started when hotel Jen shut its operations. The entire bustling area where hotel Jen used to be is now a ghost town. All the shops have closed down permanently, was a little sad to find out as the area was really nice.",

My fam and I didn't eat there, but the place was quite a vibe ! Will suggest you to go when it's a bit later , maybe around 7-8 pm to enjoy the night performances ! Overall nice place to walk around and enjoy the breeze ~",
