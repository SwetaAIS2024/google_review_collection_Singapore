He listened to his lungs carefully and was told he is having some wheezing which were always not heard by the GP and lead to my child admitting to High dependency as his lungs collapsed and have lack of oxygen going to his body. Although the bill was at the pricier side. But thankful that Dr Leo heard the wheezing and we can start him on medication.",
