GV R,3,"Wrong bill (instead of 6 beers shown 8) presented to me. When i asked to double check, they bring same wrong bill 2 times, finally 3rd time corrected bill. Still no proper calculations of happy hour and non happy hour orders. I saw no proper order management. Bit careful on what you order

Rest.. Spacious chill out space,Indo Chinese food,  drinks and live band to enjoy late night

Recently again in 2024 Jan/Feb, ordered chicken tikka, buffalo wings.. not properly coocked, smelly and hard. Informed and replaced with something else... Be careful  food quality and bill",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105381097029297819062/reviews

Lorraine Ching,1,"Unsure if this will help the restaurant improve its services, but it is a must to share my experience. I have never had this unpleasant experience as a customer willing to spend quality time with a friend. We ordered a bottle of wine and were served an unopened bottle with 2 glasses!! Yes, we both rolled our eyes and were surprised by the mistreatment here as a customer. We ordered 2 glasses of water, which wasn‚Äôt served after we reminded the same waiter after 30 mins. Well, without any surprises, yes, there isn‚Äôt any apology. I believe that the owner and the manager don‚Äôt believe in customer service. Otherwise, why were there so many posted unpleasant experiences here?",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103330083672149776736/reviews
Matt,5,"Via loca is amazing! The perfect place to have a drink, play some games, and relax. They always play good music and the atmosphere is always amazing. For food, I tried the chicken Shwarma and it was perfect! I highly recommend this bar/restaurant to anyone wanting to have a good time. üëç",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114336151538710973844/reviews
