      "text": "I recently dined at this Indian restaurant and was disappointed with the Mutton Biryani. The portion of mutton was extremely small—just two tiny, bony pieces—which did not justify the $16 price tag. The pricing felt excessive, especially given the lack of substantial meat in the dish.\n\nWhen I asked the waiter if this was really the standard portion of mutton, he simply said \"yes\" and walked away without any further explanation or concern. This lack of customer service added to the overall disappointment.\n\nOn a positive note, the ambience was decent, offering an authentic Indian restaurant feel. However, the portion sizes and service definitely need improvement to match the cost and provide better value for customers.",

With a set consisting mostly of different gravies, 1 piece of chapati, 1 piece of papad and vegetables and the thinnest slice of fish I have ever eaten in my life for a price of $21, really disappointing.",

      "text": "Tasty Chettinad food in the West!\n\nHere is a short blurb of the things we had:\n\n- Tandoori Chicken: Smokey and well-marinated. Came with a chutney that could be minty-er, but chicken was flavourful enough nonetheless.\n-  Gobi65: This was actually gobsmacking yummy. Crispy, not oily, soft and tender cauliflower in the inside. Do yourself a favour and order this.\n- Fish Biryani: Came with generous chunks of fish steak. Curry was flavourful.\n- Kadai Chicken: Spicy and creamy. Sauce split a little but that’s fine. Pairs the biryani and naan well.\n- Filter coffee: Absolute must order!\n\nThe only con is that it’s a little expensive. Else, would come again more frequently.\n\nThere’s also handwashing basins for those who wanna eat with your hands (as one should)",

The portions are tiny - vegetable dishes priced at 11$ - 14$ (before GST+ service charges) are served in a tiny bowl barely bigger than a saucer. Half chicken tikka is actually a small plate with 4 pieces. Taste-wise, everything is mediocre at best. Fast service.",
