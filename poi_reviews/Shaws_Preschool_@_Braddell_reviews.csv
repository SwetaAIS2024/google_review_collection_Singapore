Phang Moylin,5,"Shaws Braddell Heights is a very ideal pre-school for kids. It has large playgrounds- spacious running n playing ground for children.

The weekly water activities also provide kids a good opportunity to explore. I love the outdoor activities of this school.

My kids learned a lot here. Teachers are patient and helpful.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100973520386613833660/reviews
Louise Jonegard,5,"My son has a great time at Shaws! The teachers are very welcoming to the kids and parents, they pay attention to each kids needs. Shaws has a play based learning approach and this is a great approach to make sure the kids get to play, be creative and learn at the same time. We have already seen impressive development since our son started just 3 months ago! The school has fun and educational initiatives such as different theme weeks (environment, vegetables, etc), sports days, celebrations of different cultures festivals, etc. The teachers do an amazing job to plan and lead these activities. As a mom, I feel great dropping off at Shaws in the morning knowing that the teachers will take good care of my son.
I highly recommend Shaws!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117287670313514982688/reviews
Benedicta Lee,5,"The principal and teachers at this school are very understanding and supportive. Knowing that my son had a bad first experience at another school, the principal and her team of teachers made an extra effort to help him adjust better. With their help, he took to school very quickly. They also update us parents very frequently which puts us very much at ease.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115387100181603978837/reviews
Felicia Tan,5,"My daughter had a really good experience at Shaws. The school is in a one storey bungalow with a large garden used as a playground and area for the children to do outdoor activities. The curriculum offers a good balance of learning to read/write, social skills and exposure to sports. As my daughter did not nap, their no nap program allowed her to do activities and learn instead of being forced to lie down for two hours. The principal and teachers are all very experienced and caring to the children. My daughter still has very fond memories even after leaving the school.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112845143808757737874/reviews
