Kamal Hakim,2,"Beautiful sunny day but due to â€˜lightning alertâ€™ stated by management, we were all asked to leave the pool. Huh?? Puzzled parents having to explain to kids.

All we see are clear skies ðŸ˜‚",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115257465464597249452/reviews
Gunjan Kanojia,4,Absolute fun to be there with young kids. Spacious enough to accommodate about 25-30 kids at once. Beautiful views around and benches for parents to sit and keep a watch on kids. Life guards were also on duty just in case. Got the washroom and shower area for changing clothes afterwards.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101208388058115814674/reviews
Suria,5,"Free pass water park within a mall. Good enough for kids to splash around and even has a water slide! Itâ€™s wonderful that they have life guards on duty.

Lazy river is ticketed and needs an adult accompaniment. Children need to be at least 1m.

Remember to bring sunblock if you heading here between 10am to 5pm. Weekdays are quieter.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116593782536603970783/reviews
Kelvin Ngo,5,"Had a blast at Stingray! Instructor Ahmad was clear, patient and encouraging. Took leave on a weekday 9.30am slot and had the full one hour to myself for only $30. Pre-booking and payment required. For hygiene and safety reasons, riders must bring your own swimwear and rash guard (specialised attire that fits the top half of the body to prevent abrasion). I got my rash guard from Lazada at about $14. The venue provides the boards and safety helmet. You can try prone, kneeling and standing position on different boards. Great fun!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108938050734323740126/reviews
Ram,5,Kids have a ball here. Water park is a good time pass for kids. It's on the top floor of the Kalang mall. Entry is free and kids have a lot of fun. Walking distance from Stadium MRT in the circle line.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117710503555419294702/reviews
