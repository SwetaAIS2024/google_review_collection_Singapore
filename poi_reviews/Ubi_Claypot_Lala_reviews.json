      "text": "Saw on TikTok and decided to pay a visit. The lala broth is pretty good but feels like the clams are rather small and the shells took up a lot of space in the small pot. The ingredients are fairly fresh and also fairly priced. Beef slices are fatty perfect for hotpot. The prawn paste was also very fresh. Broth is refillable self service so it's good. The environment can be rather stuffy with the hot fire and smoke sometimes get in your face. Maybe sitting in the open will be better. We paid $75 for 2 adults and 1 kid which is alright I think.",
