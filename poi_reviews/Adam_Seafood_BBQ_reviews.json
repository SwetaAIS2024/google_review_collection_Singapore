Would usually order their leather jacket grilled fish and their stir fry Kai Lan.\n\nLove that dried shrimps are added in the stir fry Kai Lan elevating that umami-ness.\n\nOrdered their sambal sotong - excellent doneness; sotong not overly cooked, nice bite to it.\n\nLove their chinchalok which compliments the sambal seafood.",
