WPin P,5,"The food here is yummy & pretty good value too (price & portion wise).
They have quite limited drinks promo/ deals compared to other pubs.
Service is decent too.

The only ‚Äòless than pleasant‚Äô experience is with the Tex Mex Fajitas - it tastes good & the meat portion is quite generous but they only provided 2 small pieces of fajitas wraps, which is clearly insufficient for the portion of meat. So we asked if we can get more wraps & they told us yes, but they would have to charge for them. Happy to pay for it but it would have been nice for them to give 1 or 2 more wraps as part of the meal.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117893368337848889092/reviews

Si Min Hong,5,"Tried the Saturday lunch nasi lemak ala carte buffet. The rice was fragrant and soft, sambal was good and chicken wings were well marinated. However the second round of wings were a little bland compared to the first round. Nonetheless, value for money at $9.9+ per pax. Ivy's service was good and fast.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109424551754504570119/reviews
CK C,4,"Prices of food and beer are probably the most competitive among the Iris pubs in Singapore. Kilkenny on tap was great. Fish and chips, unfortunately, was very mushy (ironically, it was highlighted in the menu to be not mushy). Waitress was welcoming and attentive.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
