NG SIHUI,5,"Always a pleasant experience with Ashford, especially as someone who’s dental-phobic.
Ruby is very friendly and prompt with follow ups.
Dr Cindy is always very assuring and gentle. She’s very fast with her hands, making it fuss free, painless and less daunting. Highly recommend.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105144242760481727027/reviews
E Y,5,"First came to Ashford in 2019 when I was searching for an emergency root canal treatment. Since then, I have did root canal treatment, crowning, wisdom tooth extraction procedures with them. Dr Leon Chen is my dentist and I am very comfortable with his service. His calm and assuring demeanour makes a dentist visit pleasant and non-intimidating. Front desk staff and nurses are also generally service- oriented. I would highly recommend Ashford anytime.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110099189129774169464/reviews

Ajay Kumar,1,"Had my root canal done poorly. Ended up getting an implant from Q&M. Q&M dentist showed me the x ray of the root canal that was done at Ashford and the root were not filled properly. Wasted over 3000$ at Ashford.
Ashford is unnecessarily expensive and I have visited them a few times. They seem more interested in charging you money. One time I went for swollen gum and the dentist took out something stuck in my gum in half a minute. It was supposed to end there but the dentist proceeded to perform regular teeth cleaning without asking my and billed me for it. Just a money hungry unethical practice.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115517469323418411302/reviews
