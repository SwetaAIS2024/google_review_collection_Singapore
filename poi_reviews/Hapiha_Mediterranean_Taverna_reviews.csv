CK C,5,"This restaurant is located just outside a condominium, so it is opened to the public. The pita bread and hummus were heavenly - I would return just for them. The other dishes were delicious too, but nothing exceptional. Staff were friendly, especially the lady who was always smiling. Don’t let the inconvenience deter you from trying out this place.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Shereen Y.,4,"Cozy interior, I love the Mediterranean style tablecloths. The staffs were friendly and attentive.

We ordered hummus and pita bread, which was the highlight of our dinner. The chickpeas were coarsely grounded, not too smooth so there’s texture to it, with a generous amount of olive oil. The handmade pita bread was fluffy and delicious.

The grilled sea bream was deboned in front of us by the boss. It was a delight and thoughtful gesture. The fish itself was fresh, firm and juicy, although we’d prefer if it’s grilled a bit more. There’s only baby potatoes for the sides. It’d be great if they added salad or a mix of grilled vegetables instead of just the potatoes.

Stuffed peppers were average. No distinct or  “burst of flavour”, which they claimed it to be.

Pistachio baklava was a total letdown. It was so underwhelming I even thought of spitting it out. The filo pastry was soggy, there’s hardly any pistachio, it just felt like eating oily wet cardboard. Very unpleasant taste and would not recommend at all. Informed the boss about it but he just said it’s different from those in Turkiye, it’s their own style, so.. *shrugs*",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115562818016091903505/reviews
Tacocat,4,"The place is quite small with limited seating, you should make a reservation if you intend to come here. The hummus and taramasalata were really good with the fresh pita bread. The fries in the meat platter was surprisingly quite good but some of the meats in the meat platter were slightly dry.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108681762797195496703/reviews
Venessa Tan,5,"Pita and taramosalata dip was amazing. I couldn't stop eating and wanted more! Octopus was perfectly grilled and seasoned. Roasted peppers were tender, more of a healthy soft dish. Will definitely be coming back again and highly recommend this place!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109437440124478390416/reviews
Samantha Hong,5,"Hidden gem serving great Mediterranean food! I am a huge fan of hummus and it was done very well here. Ordered the Pork and Chicken Souvlaki, both meat were tender not dry and well seasoned.

Definitely going to be back.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106695520047343464735/reviews
