Kah Wang Tan,4,"Ordered the tomato soup based with dory fish. Soup was on the sweeter side and I really like the noodles (mix between white and purple) which was so chewy. The fish was also very fresh.

The bowl was big and the portion was decent. Use FairPrice app for a 10% off.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117624172714283499367/reviews

Vin W,4,"I opted for dish number 44, which I believe was the sauerkraut fish spicy soup with rice. It was absolutely delicious and extremely appetizing.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109263427873687540100/reviews
Orange,4,"Second time visit, $9.80 for this suan cai fish. Portion is huge. I’ve asked what does it include. They mentioned only fish. But when it came, it came with enoki mush room. I added extra veg.

Request not to have rice and change it to noodles, but they forgotten it. This I went back and they cooked it for me to be added.

Taste is salty and the 酸is there. Pretty shiok for a cold weather. Will definitely come back again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115900498086127531781/reviews
