Sue Asff,5,"Seriously though aone is an underrated chain restaurant they deserve more customers than the one next door. I think it's because they started with the porridge in mind it's hard to change that perception. Anyway this outlet is really nice and spacious with a view of the rain vortex!! The staff were friendly and the prices of food with fair. We ordered the promotion item abalone porridge only for this week $11.90++ and was pleasantly surprised to find 6 abalones even though baby ones in it.

The best part was that the flower tea is made in house and uses up to 7 ingredients !! The taste is really unique with an increasing sweetness as you drink towards the end of the pot",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118063503336419300601/reviews
Jaslyn Lau,4,"I came here on a Saturday evening for dinner with my Hubby and 3 friends using the Eatigo app and enjoyed 50% off (except drinks). The dishes I think are all good. Service can be improved slightly.

Some slight hiccup here. Had told a staff to help me change the plate but I didn't get a new plate, so I just used my bowl till the end of the dinner. A female crew dropped some glass plates near us so it shocked us a little.

Trotting Horse,5,The abalone porridge had a promo at $11.90 and thus decided to have this. Service staff is excellent! The deco of the place is really nice too. Order a small plate of achar to go with the porridge. Hearty and satisfying meal. Comfort food for the tummy,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114960726223703734828/reviews
Ruth Goi,2,"Service was excellent - friendly and efficient service staffs üëçüèª. However, taste of food is so so... fried pumpkin with salted egg is good to try, tofu with salted radish is ok, fried rice is nice (it‚Äôs the best to me). Fried Cod fish is a disappointment - fish is tasteless. Century egg and minced porridge is too thick to my liking. Wasn‚Äôt too excited to take pictures for the rest of dishes.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106470982911064605103/reviews
Edwin S,5,"A-One claypot house specializes in claypot-based dishes. I ordered the porridge which was complete with minced pork, egg, and you tiao. The porridge was really-really tasty.

To complement the porridge, I suggest ordering gong bao chicken. The gong bao chicken is a bit spicy, but the sauce of the gong bao elevates the taste of the porridge.

I also ordered fried pumpkin with salted egg sauce. It was nice, as the pumpkin was sweet and it has the ‚Äútough‚Äù texture, which gives it a good bite.

I really like the food here and will definitely come back!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113192406653516830642/reviews
