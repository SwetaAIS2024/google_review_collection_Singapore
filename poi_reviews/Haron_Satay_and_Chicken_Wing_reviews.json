      "text": "Great satay at East Coast Park Food center.\nHaron Satay is one of my go-to stalls for satay. I will order their chicken and mutton satay. The mutton satay is great tasting! Itâ€™s served with sliced cucumber and red onions.\nI also got the Ketupat (Boiled rice cake) which paired well with the satay peanut sauce.\nThey used to have babat satay (tripe), but no longer sell it.\nPrices are $1 for a stick of satay. Minimum order applies. The ketupat costs $0.50.",

The young person taking the order looked not interested at all. The reason I gave 3 stars is for the mutton satay which is still ok and for the atmosphere by the beach. Next time I will try others.",
