Saveendra Ekanayake,5,"I recently visited Rockafellers Puteri Harbour and had an amazing experience! The atmosphere was lively and vibrant, perfect for a night out with friends or just unwinding after a long week. The pub had a fantastic live band on Saturday night, adding to the upbeat and energetic vibe.

The food was absolutely delicious! We started with the grilled duck breast, which was cooked to perfection - juicy, tender, and full of flavor. The salad on the side was fresh and well-balanced. The Beef Wellington was another standout - beautifully flaky pastry on the outside and tender beef in the center, accompanied by a rich, flavorful gravy.

We also tried the pizza, which had a crispy base and generous toppings - definitely a great choice to pair with drinks. Speaking of drinks, the cocktails were well-made and refreshing, perfect for kicking back and enjoying the music.

Overall, Rockafellers Puteri Harbour is a fantastic spot for great food, drinks, and live music. If you’re looking for a place with a vibrant pub atmosphere and quality dishes, this is the place to be!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112485216419568676213/reviews
tm sii,3,Pasta is fine but Marinara meat is dry. Quiet during daytime and nothing much around apart from yachts and condos nearby. Probably a place for night owls.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104063137357045257769/reviews

Jen Wang,5,"The smoked duck salad, smoked duck and mushroom pasta was great! Pizza dough was a little disappointing though. Fries couldn’t go wrong but serving portion was a little small. The beef nachos was delicious with lots of different sides to go with.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115460499210200573278/reviews
