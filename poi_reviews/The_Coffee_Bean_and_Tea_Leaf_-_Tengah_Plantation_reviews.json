      "text": "I visited The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (CBTL) at Tengah for the first time and took advantage of their 1-for-1 Ice Blended Drinks promotion. I ordered a Green Tea Ice Blended, while my partner had the Dark Chocolate Ice Blended. The drinks were refreshing and well-balanced in flavor. The cafÃ© had a cosy and inviting atmosphere, with warm lighting and comfortable seating, making it a perfect spot to relax. The ambience was pleasant, with a quiet yet lively vibe, ideal for unwinding or having a casual chat. It was an enjoyable experience, and I would definitely visit with my family next time ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’ª",
