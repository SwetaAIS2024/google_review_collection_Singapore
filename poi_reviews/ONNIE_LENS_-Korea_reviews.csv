Jessica,5,"Never expected a lens store to be selling press on nails but I was extremely lucky to find one model of my exact nail size! The nail size runs small, I typically wear XS/S for my press on but for this particular nail shape Iâ€™m wearing M.

Purchased for just $29.90, extremely satisfied with the service and price point.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101155769435742692907/reviews
