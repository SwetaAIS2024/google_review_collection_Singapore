      "text": "Jimmy Monkey @ PLQ2\n\nIs a great place for early playground and breakfast with the kids. The playground is just next to Jimmy monkey so it's easy to keep an eye on the kids but take note the playground can be for bigger kids around 5+ years old\n\nIt's my first time eating their food there but goodness, their fries crunch was spot on, the deep fried pork belly was succulent (nice when paired with their spicy chilli dip)\n\nThe burger was a little too meaty (I will get them to put in more fats ratio) and their cheese toasty was wonderful for me (my kids didn't like it)\n\nOverall, scores really high on a will-we-go-back-again",

Pick any other of the places around.\nThe kids' menu looks interesting until you see what it is. The 4 star rating I saw when I came here is way too generous (perhaps friends and family).\nNot to mention, there is a generous service charge automatically that is absolutely unjustified. The food is mediocre at best. The bread slice you see was supposed to be a pizza.\n\nI would never come here again",

Food was not bad, beer and drinks menu is good too.\nDefinitely 9/10 experience.\nGoing to make this place as my go-to place when I'm near Paya Lebar.",

Eyes on them while I munched my breakie in peace!\n\nWhile the cafe was pretty crowded, the lady boss kindly helped to shuffle some furniture around so I got a decent table. Had a great morning!",
