Joanne Cheng,5,"The roasted delights is a must go place if you like roasted duck, char siew and roasted pork. The price is reasonable, roasted duck rice is $4.50, mixed roasted pork and char siew is $4.50. The soup is $3 and very nice portion. The sauce is superb. Take note that every wed is their off day. I like the fried mee Hoon from another stall, fried Hokkien mee is also nice! Worth the try. There are plenty of open space car parks. There is a famous temple nearby. Atmosphere is so so cause it’s a coffeeshop. But it is spacious and airy. So I find it nice to dine in.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110408957347137900620/reviews
Kesmond Kwek,4,"Since my friend introduced me the Fried Kuey Teow @ Goh Lim Hua, I have heen here many times.. there is always a queue but I'm ok with it until today.. at 11am, the queue already forming and the store messed up customer orders. I have to ask them for my order. Instead of asking the lady who incharge of the order and collect payment, she asked me if I paid. I told her to confirm with the lady who took my order. She impatiently handed me my order and said ""okokok"" push my hands to ask me to leave. Her bad  attitude has made me ""wok hey"", hahaha.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106594644998430315896/reviews

wang woei shuoh,2,Order the mixed fish soup and the portion was so less. Both the soup and fried fish only 3 pcs each !!? I didn't took the photos before ate but you can imagine total of 6 pcs. The taste was actually good but just the portion could be more?? The price is $6 dollars for the mixed fish soup.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110928105518577311781/reviews
Ivan Louis 郭俊安,1,"Bought takeaway mixed veg rice.

2 meats (1 Pork not pork chops and 1 chicken not fish) and 1 regular veg cost $5.30 and for Teh - $1.50.

Very expensive for a coffeeshop standard!! Not even shopping mall yet the prices are overpriced!! First time here and definitely the last time 👎🏼👎🏼",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109015880158217963330/reviews
