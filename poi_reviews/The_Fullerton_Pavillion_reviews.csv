Ben Loy,4,Very uptown and cozy place. Was here for a wedding. Breathtaking scenery of the Singapore dream on the side and the braised beef short ribs is a perfect combination. Separable streaks of meat that melts in ur mouth is truly one of the best I had,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115067595425147527913/reviews
Andrew Hendrickson,3,"The food was pretty good, and the live music was great. The view is really nice as well.

They overcharged us for a drink though and brought us fries we didn't ask for which they charged us for. It was too cold in the restaurant as well.
