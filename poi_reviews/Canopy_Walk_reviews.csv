C,4,"Located along Singapore’s Southern Ridges, this 280-meter elevated boardwalk offers a peaceful stroll through lush greenery, providing opportunities to learn about various tree species, such as Tiup-Tiup and Rubber Wood. Informational panels along the walk share interesting facts about their unique characteristics and uses. While the views are modest, the shaded pathway is pleasant, comfortable, and suitable for all ages. It’s an enjoyable and relaxing part of a leisurely walk between Kent Ridge Park and HortPark.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
Alex G,5,"One of my favourite spots in Singapore, a great hideaway from the urban buildup everywhere else.The entire stretch of the Southern ridges offer plenty: tropical foliage, rare creatures, clean air, a good sweaty hike and lovely food from various F&B establishments, Leave your car and dogs at home. One can easily spend half a day exploring. Highly recommend the cable car ride at Mt Faber nearby,  ending at Vivocity.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108005235749466792614/reviews

Peter,5,"Beautiful place and basically empty! You can have the whole walk for yourself and all you'll hear is the birds! I hiked here from Faber Point and it's a lovely walk (be aware of construction until November, you'll have to walk by the road as the path on the ridges is closed)! Great views and you'll literally be walking in level with the canopies! Cool vegetation and lot of shady spots! Top tourist attraction!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117803073888288445568/reviews
