Vivek Reddy,1,"The food is disgusting, they take too long, they forgot a lot of what we ordered, we waited for almost 2 hours to eat slop on a plate, I wouldn't even feed this to my dog. Horrendous. The seating as well is beyond messed up, unclean. This place looks like a health hazard. Please never come here.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114563990640399742388/reviews
Gideon Miles,4,"1 for 1 lunch deal for the western food extremely worthwhile, cheaper and better tasting than the western food at the hawker center, approximately $6.45 split 2 ways. Food is excellent, chicken chop not overcooked and well marinated/spiced, however the mushroom soup leaves much to be desired.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100629818896481470249/reviews
