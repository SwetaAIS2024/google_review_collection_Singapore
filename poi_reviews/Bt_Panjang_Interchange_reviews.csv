Ethan,4,"(Pls don't mind my bus enthusiast talk) Recently, I took the bus service 975 at around midnight on a Mercedes-Benz OC500LE. Some of my friends say that's its haunted here. Most likely the ghosts from the Lim Chu Kang Cemetery travelled here and haunt the Interchange here. Service was good here. Staff was kind too. When I asked someone where was the toilet, (I think I was blind for a while.)the staff was did not hesitate to help me! And I think that its not haunted.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111515156429765397665/reviews
L Wang,5,I recently rode the 970 bus on 05 Feb afternoon and I am incredibly thankful for the bus driver's exceptional service. They went above and beyond to locate my lost AirPods charging case and I am deeply grateful for their kindness. I highly recommend SMRT and its driver for their reliable and caring service. Thank you!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105541715364082993361/reviews

Ronnie Phay,1,Bus 976 arrival timing for pick up at interchange itself was changed for no reason. I encountered this more than 3 times during the last 3 months.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108457109310583127363/reviews
