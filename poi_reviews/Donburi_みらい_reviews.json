The Chicken Teriyaki was delicious, with tender, juicy chicken paired with a fresh, crisp salad that balanced the meal perfectly. The Mala Pork Don was a pleasant surprise—my first time trying mala, and I loved it! The dish was spicy  and left me wanting more. The gyoza was also a highlight, perfectly cooked and with just the right portion size. Overall, the meal was great value for money, and the staff were super polite and courteous, making the experience even better. I’ll definitely be back!",
