Jaren Koh,4,"SMRT taking over Jurong West Bus Package in a few days (from 1 Sep 2024)

Air conditioned Integrated Transport Hub located next to Boon Lay MRT Station and Jurong Point Shopping Mall.

Lots of feeder services going NTU and around the western area of Singapore.  I find that ITHs are quite dim, especially the bus park. They should make the area more vibrant and play some music.

Quite crowded went there on a Monday around 6pm.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105920623539818036234/reviews

Nope Thanks,2,"An air-conditioned bus hall where you can barely feel the air-conditioning.

But at least there are giant LED screens constantly playing annoying ads.
