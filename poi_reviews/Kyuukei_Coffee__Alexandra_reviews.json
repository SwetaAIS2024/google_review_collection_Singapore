      "text": "Visiting for the first time after hearing great reviews about the coffee here. Ordered an iced latte and banana bread.\n\nIced latte ($6.50)- Tried the Peru beans which promised light, fruity notes, but the taste was really quite bitter and the notes were difficult to make out. However, I'll want to try their hot latte once more given how it might be a bad day.\n\nBanana bread üçå ($4.50) - Was pretty yummy! I love that they heat the bread up for you, and it tastes fresh, moist and chewy. Only wished it was a slightly larger slice!\n\nPapa says: üëçüèº coffee unfortunately didn't serve, but will give it another go next time.",

Service was great as they are very sociable. It is a small outlet and they are lean on manpower so they could be overwhelmed when many orders come in.\n\nIt‚Äôs also cool that they can do a pop-up stall for events too!",
