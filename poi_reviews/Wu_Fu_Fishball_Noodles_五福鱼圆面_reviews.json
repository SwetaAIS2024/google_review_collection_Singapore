      "text": "I had the absolute pleasure of dining at Wu Fu Fishball Noodle in Pasir Ris, Singapore, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The highlight of my visit was their signature Fishball Noodle Soup, which exceeded all my expectations.\n\nThe broth was light yet flavorful, perfectly complementing the generous portions of tender fish balls and minced meat. The noodles were cooked to perfection, with just the right amount of bite. The addition of fresh green onions and a dash of crispy fried onions provided a delightful contrast in texture and taste.\n\nThe presentation was impeccable, with the vibrant colors of the ingredients beautifully arranged in a bright yellow bowl, making the dish as visually appealing as it was delicious. The accompanying condiments added an extra layer of flavor, allowing me to customize my meal to my liking.\n\nThe stall's atmosphere, highlighted by its colorful neon sign, added to the overall enjoyment of the meal. The service was prompt and friendly, making the entire dining experience a pleasure.\n\nOverall, Wu Fu Fishball Noodle is a must-visit for anyone in Singapore's East looking for a hearty, satisfying, and authentically local noodle dish. I will definitely be returning to savor more of their offerings. Highly recommended!",

However, the chilli sauce mix is pretty good so the overall taste is good!",
