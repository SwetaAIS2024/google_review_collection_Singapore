Chinmayi Prasanna,4,"Great place in NTU for beers, probably the cheapest which also stays open until mid night. Buying beer towers to share with friends makes it even more economical. They also have Soju available. Best part they provide chilled glasses for the beer. Ask for big glasses.

I tried their choco lava cake recently on a friends recommendation and absolutely loved it. It is definitely a must try for folks in NTU.

Update: Never have waffles, they are bad",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113262005992138188615/reviews
