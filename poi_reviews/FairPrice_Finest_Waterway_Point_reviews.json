      "text": "For a housing estate supermarket, it‚Äôs stocked with some good imported cheese and good butcher section. Can‚Äôt say the same for the vegetable produce section - some of the vegetables have started to rot and still they are being sold, which is fine but shouldn‚Äôt it be at a discounted pricing? Like maybe they can put some of these vegetables at a section that shoppers don't mind buying at a really low price? So the produce don‚Äôt go to waste and the pricing is fair for customers. Also no stock on bay leaves in the dry herb section - disappointing. Need to mention to the staff - they are really helpful and courteous üíü",

The management should sought alternative solution from HQ before the Lunar New Year promo marketing sets in.\n\nThis is an unacceptable way of management. Please respect your muslim consumers as our trust are apart of your successful sales & marketing.",

They have a good range of fresh produces including Organic and Japanese products. Pricing is cheaper compare to another premium supermarket chain.\n\nThe place is always crowded. Suggest to come during the opening time. As all the items especially the fresh produce had just stock up.",
