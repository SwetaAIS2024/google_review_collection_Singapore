Chui Chin Shopping,5,"We were looking for caterer that offers something different from the usual Asian buffets and we found Pattaya Catering that has Thai dish options!

We ordered the Premium buffet for our companyâ€™s department event for 30 pax with Thai dishes in the menu. The event participants were pleased with the food yesterday, said it was a good choice. I personally loved the Ebi prawn side dish and the pineapple rice.

What Iâ€™m really grateful for is the care and attention to details they have towards my order, as they called to check and recommended some adjustments to my order as I over-ordered the carbs dishes. The serving portion was just right for each of us. Definitely a great choice selecting this Thai catering beyond the usual choices. Looking forward to ordering again.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101632777041171026689/reviews
tay kok kay,1,"Order 35 Pax for house warming.The portion was so small. All the main dishes were all in small stray. Such a small trays couldnâ€™t hold 35 portions unless they are selling very expensive. In the end we had to take 15 people out to eat, which was so embarrassing. The photo shows the left over after 20 people finished eating. Call them up they said itâ€™s impossible the food was not enough for my guests. My suggestion if anyone wants to order catering better look for those caterers that only do catering services and not restaurants plus catering.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110666723241337736906/reviews
