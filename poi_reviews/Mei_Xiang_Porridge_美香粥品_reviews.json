It’s either the cook is having a bad day or I have a lousy taste bud compared to the people who provided the reviews here, the porridge is super salty and the frog sauce was even saltier. The sauce is not the typical frog sauce but just Ma Yu oil which is oily and salty. To be fair, the you tiao was ok.\n\nFirst and last purchase from this place.",
