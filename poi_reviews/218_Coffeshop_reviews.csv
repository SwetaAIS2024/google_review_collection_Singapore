G D,4,"$6 Hokkien mee - yellow noodle sticky when chewing & not soft enough. The taste & wetness was good but no thick mee hoon so kinda affected it. I like the chilli not too spicy or overly salty. There were sotong, pork belly & fried pork lard.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114872363741247701010/reviews
Hrmgr,2,"Ordered Cai Peng from the mixed veg install and a pork stomach soup for the zi char install. Surprised that they served the whole duck drumstick with thigh as it is and not bother to chop into smaller pieces. The duck was not soft enough that you could use fork and spoon on it. The broccoli is tasteless and not soft enough. As for the soup, realized it was not double boiled so can't complain that the pieces were not soft enough.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews

Clement Tan,1,"Previously known as Ho Kee Pau at Geylang, has permanently closed down and changed to this coffee shop.

Ordered the economic rice with one vegetable, one bak chor and tau pok, is S$5 really worth the price? Or is it because it is a 24hr operating coffeeshop?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114848390101103916850/reviews
PS P,5,"Good food. Especially like the hokkien mee, a lot of noodles with 3 big prawns, sotong, pork for $10 a box, operating from 4pm Tue to Sun. Like their Char Siu puff which was often sold out. Egg tart and mango pudding.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102263830463881659284/reviews
