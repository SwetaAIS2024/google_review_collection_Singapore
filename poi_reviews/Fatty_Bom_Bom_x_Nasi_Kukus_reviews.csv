Mandon L.,5,"Great tasting western food! Especially their chicken cutlet. Well fried, seasoned and generous portions for the price too.

Farah JX,4,"UPDATE: Decided to give it a second chance and the staff was friendly! Maybe he was just having a bad day the first time I visited as he seems to be better rested and in a better mood. Shouldn't be faulted for that as we're all humans. Updated the rating :)

Previous entry: Indian (?) staff working was taking his own sweet time and even though I was standing at the counter waiting to order for 10mins, he totally ignored me despite him only dealing with only one plate of food. He only took my order once he finished with the order despite having plenty of time waiting and doing nothing and having no other customers. Food was okay I guess? Bought the Nasi Kari, would order again but would be mindful of these things if in a rush.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113664491701227654286/reviews
