The store is within Takashimaya near the toys section and it's prominently decorated so you can't miss it.\n\nAlthough it can be rather pricey, with a Hello Kitty Face notepad going for $12 and a Cinnamoroll plush the size of a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 costing $54, but it is genuine stuff so I won't be too critical about it.\n\nThere's something for everyone here whether it's for kids to grownups, boys to girls. If you fancy something Sanrio, come here and be delighted with the assortment of Sanrio merchandise, but just be prepared to pay for what you want.",
