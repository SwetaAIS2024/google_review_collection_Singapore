Ariel,1,"Front desk staff has no qualifications to be working customer service whatsoever. When patient missed the number and came up to the desk to ask she said ‚Äúyou should‚Äôve sat at where the screen is‚Äù

Then why did you guys put seats at the side where the tv screen is not facing? So everyone sitting at that side will miss their queue number cos there‚Äôs no tv screen there.

I don‚Äôt understand why the most useless and non empathetic people always choose to work frontline in private healthcare. My god, if you hate people or can‚Äôt be bothered to assist SICK people go and find another job or just sit at home.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114524476190786409617/reviews
Kai Nee Tan,1,Clinic is usually slow. The queue system needs to be improved. Patients are informed verbally on queue number but often times they dont pay attention and missed queue. Causing additional wait time,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115228484365888811648/reviews
Airah Ysf,5,"Today, 17/2:

The clinic was closed earlier as they stated there at the door, overwhelmed with patients, however Staff Fanglei attended to us as my daughter has high fever (she took her temperature outside the clinic we sat, 38.7 and also I was pregnant) to have that q in line. I appreciate her gesture along with her partner who registered my daughter (I didnt catch her name). Its nice to have this two staffs who can actually go beyond their customer service to attend to us eventho‚Äô the clinic was full. Mentioned waiting time was more than 1 hour however they managed to prioritise my daughter eventho i had to wait for quite sometime. Doctor Loh is also nice too, very patient and detailed. I am thankful for these kind soul with the kind gestures and I appreciate it so much.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105449174338634694441/reviews
LIM Michael,5,"Receptionists are friendly and approachable, Dr Tiffany puts in her efforts to perform assessment objectively and subjectively. All of them are greatly appreciated. To share with other clients/patients, as we all know that nothing is perfect, we must appreciate that we have all doctors and nurses in Singapore who are well trained and doing their best, with advanced medical devices as compared to some rural/less developing countries. üôèüòä",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102067530540395725880/reviews
