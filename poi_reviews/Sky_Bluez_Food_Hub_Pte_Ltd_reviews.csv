Jason Ong,3,"Small, unassuming Indian coffee shop next to the Hardware City. We tried it cos the 216 coffee shop next door was closed.
We ordered the roti prata, and since the guy taking our order wasn't very conversant, we went with what was on hand - plain prata and egg prata.
The pratas were chewy and hard, having been there for a while. Fortunately, this was made up for by the curry. Both the mutton and fish curry were thick and bursting with flavour. If you can get them to cook you fresh prata, this will be an excellent breakfast place.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101337983538091125134/reviews

Chan P,3,Food isn't that authentic south Indian but its still better than many shops around teck whye. Spotted rats on 2 different occasions. Cleanliness of food handlers can be much improved. There is 1 foul mouthed man who is the loudest in the shop. Seems like food price is also catching up at this stall.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111481439905251845467/reviews

Jojo N.,4,"our family enjoys the freshly made Pratas and Dosais with the various curries.  today the curries were specifically nice,  may be a different crew in the kitchen.  their Teh halia is also great,  can only recommend.  ask for less sugar,  they will comply.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101011238768211301851/reviews
