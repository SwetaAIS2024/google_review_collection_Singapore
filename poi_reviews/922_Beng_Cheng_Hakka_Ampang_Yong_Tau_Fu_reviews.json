Tried the Ampang Yong Tau Fu which was basically the normal Yong Tau Fu (assorted vegetables with minced meat) in gravy and no soup. The food tasted decent but not exceptional. Worth a try if you are in the area",

Who wants to carry food around while traveling?\n\nIt was our first time here, and definitely the last. The stuffed tofu and kway chap weren’t just bland, they were simply not good. There were no prices displayed anywhere, and the final bill was surprisingly high. It really felt like the owner was just trying to squeeze money out of customers.\n\nThis place isn’t even particularly popular, yet somehow people still go and eat there, we honestly can’t figure out why.\n\nTotally not worth it. Never again.",

The FUCHOK would taste better if you wash them before frying. It is so tasty my hair dropped instantly.\nI added brinjal YTF. Very disappointing, almost couldn’t find the fish paste..\nThe duck was alright. The sauce was quite salty, I can hardly taste any fragrance or herbalish taste..\nIt has definitely lost the fragrance they used to have 10+ years ago. I believe a lot of improvement needs to be done.",
