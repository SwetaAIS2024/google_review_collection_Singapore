The area is a red light district and there are quite a few migrant workers in the area, but that's not too distracting. The yellow metro is 15 minutes away, the green 10. It's quiet, fairly clean and well equipped.",

      "text": "Don’t expect a five star hotel at the Ibis Budget Pearl. There are hundreds of expensive hotels in Singapore.\n\nIf you need a safe, quiet, clean place to stay, and you want to save money, this is it.\n\nThe location is in Geylang, where there are dozens of economical restaurant options, stores, and low prices for the budget traveler. Geylang is also the site for legal prostitution, but it’s not an issue. Keyword: legal.\n\nIf you’re intolerant to other cultures, customs, and people, stay away from Geylang. But if you’re like me, who wants to see, hear, and sense the real Singapore, this is the place to be.\n\nThere are bus stops at either end of the quiet street that get you to everything in Singapore within 15-30 minutes, and a subway station in a 10 minute walk.\n\nSingapore is safe, and nothing happens to anyone here except fun and excitement discovering new things.\n\nAll of the staff at the Ibis was great and helpful, including the night crew, cleaning crew, and day shift Siti and Pang.\n\nThe rooms are simple but totally comfortable. Save your money for the sights and stay at the Ibis Budget!",

We did not know any better. This place is Singapore’s pleasure district, and is filled with men. Had an unpleasant experience along with two females who I was travelling with. We were followed along by a stranger and had to call for help.\n\nDidn’t also felt safe at the hotel. Our room had roaches, and the bathroom had an open ceiling, and we can see through the vents and pipes and we didn’t feel safe. We had to makeshift our shower curtain to cover the ceiling.",
