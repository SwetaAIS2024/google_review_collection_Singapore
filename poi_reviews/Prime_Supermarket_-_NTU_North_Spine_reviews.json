Mostly self check out now. And they also have ready made food which is very needed for students who are studying late and eat supper.",

      "text": "I’m writing to express my concern about a disappointing experience I had at your store recently. While buying groceries, I noticed several promotions in the aisles. However, when I reached the payment counter, I noticed that the discounts were not applied. I brought this to the attention of the cashier, expecting that she would verify the promotion. To my surprise, she asked me to return to the aisle and take a photo of the promotion myself.\n\nHaving worked in retail myself, I was taken aback by how this situation was handled. It’s always been my understanding that it is the cashier’s responsibility to verify such details. I didn’t expect to be asked to do this myself, and it left me feeling quite frustrated.\n\nA few days later, I observed a similar situation with a foreign student at your store. In this case, the cashier was kind enough to check the product for her. This inconsistent treatment is concerning, and it raises questions about the store’s policies and practices regarding customer service.\n\nI’m not usually one to jump to conclusions, but the stark difference in how these two situations were handled has left me wondering if there could be a racial bias at play. I sincerely hope this is not the case, but I would appreciate clarification on your store’s policies to ensure all customers are treated equally.",
