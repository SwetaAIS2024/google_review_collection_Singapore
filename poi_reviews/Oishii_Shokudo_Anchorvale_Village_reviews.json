      "text": "Normally I see such japanese stalls with these kind menu items, I would be skeptical about the taste.\n\nAs it is a new addition to this hawker centre, I just thought I should give it a try. Cos never try never know ma, if not nice then don't return.\n\nLooked through the menu and went with the bento set of teriyaki chicken with wagyu beef patty at $7.50 before discount.\n\nWas given a buzzer and waited about 10mins during weeknight dinner crowd. Quite fast considering there was a constant queue for it.\n\nI went straight for the meats first. Wagyu patty was soft and well-seasoned. This wagyu tasted like a lower grade minced wagyu as expected from the price point. Teriyaki chicken here refers to teriyaki sauce drizzled over a cutlet. Cutlet is crispy on the outside and tender within. Best thing was both served hot.\n\nCorn salad and warm pearl rice accompanied the meats on the bento. Both are as expected in terms of taste. Miso soup tasted quite ok too.\n\nOverall the meats were done well and served hot thus the 5 stars. Many of such japanese stalls that I have tried served their food cold/cooled down.",

It is one of the most value meals at $5.50 for a Teriyaki Chicken Donburi. Of course, to save more, don't forget your Fairprice App (additional 10%).",
