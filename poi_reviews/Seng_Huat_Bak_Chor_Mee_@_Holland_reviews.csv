Pauline Wee,5,"I recently discovered Seng Huat Bak Chor Mee on GrabFood, and it has quickly become my all-time favorite! Every time I crave fishball noodles, this is my go-to spot.

The fishballs and fish cakes are incredibly fresh, and you can really taste the quality. The fishballs are not only big but also perfectly bouncy, making each bite super satisfying. And let’s talk about the chilli—OMG, it’s so good! It packs the right amount of heat and blends perfectly with the noodles.

What I really appreciate is that they actually follow my special requests (more chilli ) when I leave remarks on the app. It shows they care about their customers’ experience. Whether you dine in or order for delivery, their standard remains consistently high.

If you're a fan of authentic, flavorful fishball noodles, Seng Huat Bak Chor Mee at Holland Close is a must-try! Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113442208195765868656/reviews
Daniel Bok,5,"Breakfast here starts pretty early. The coffee and tea are pretty standard. Their toast options are quite varied and is pretty good. Gotta time the eggs yourself if you get the set, approximately 6 minutes for soft boiled.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114835379352368094009/reviews
