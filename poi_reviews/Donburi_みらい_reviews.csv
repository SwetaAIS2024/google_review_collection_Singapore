aydenzedd,5,Nice place to have donburi. But long queues during the weekday peak hours due to office crowd. Their portions are super generous and huge. Price is affordable. Only con is the seating area. You need to “tabao” to somewhere to eat your meal.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115216386767630751463/reviews
Jas,5,"Healthy donburi bowl with salad on the side - went for the oyako don. The taste was okay, felt like comfort food. Was given a zesty, sour salad dressing. Quite budget-friendly at just $8 in the CBD area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113337122584904295969/reviews
PH Ong,5,"Found this stall by chance near basement of CIMB plaza. Ordered teriyaki chicken, the food is prepared after order, salad came with sauce set aside separately. Food is pretty good and value for money in CBD area",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109112821303567874624/reviews
Cheryl Seah,5,"I recently tried the Chicken Teriyaki Don, Mala Pork Don and gyoza, and all were excellent. The Chicken Teriyaki was delicious, with tender, juicy chicken paired with a fresh, crisp salad that balanced the meal perfectly. The Mala Pork Don was a pleasant surprise—my first time trying mala, and I loved it! The dish was spicy  and left me wanting more. The gyoza was also a highlight, perfectly cooked and with just the right portion size. Overall, the meal was great value for money, and the staff were super polite and courteous, making the experience even better. I’ll definitely be back!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101159776293169327475/reviews
