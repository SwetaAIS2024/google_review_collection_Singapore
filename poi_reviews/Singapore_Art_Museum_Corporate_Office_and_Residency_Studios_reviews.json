The Cloud Library has a thoughtfully curated collection of books. Do spend some time reading them. One of the standout exhibits for me is Everyday Practices on Level 3, which offers a poignant exploration of the lives of individuals who have faced significant hardships. It’s an immersive and thoughtful experience that makes the visit worthwhile. Plan to spend at least 2 hours at SAM to fully appreciate everything on offer. Definitely worth a visit!",

Also went into the exhibition inside the building and it was quite normal. I love the scenery behind the building with the giant machinery and tons of containers",
