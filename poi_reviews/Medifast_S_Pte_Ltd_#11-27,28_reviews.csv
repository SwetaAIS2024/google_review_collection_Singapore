E C,5,"I was there for blood test today. Registration was very quick, and I usually feel faint after drawing blood so I informed a young chap who was helping me to draw blood. The whole experience was pain free and he was very very pro. The team made sure I could lie down and checked on me.

Really appreciate this experience! Thank you.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116708864109054866865/reviews
Dhrubajyoti Samanta,1,"I visited this clinic for some screenings. The reception staff were good, and I did not have to wait much beyond the scheduled time. However, surprising enough, the doctor and senior technician were in a big hurry for some reasons. The doctor and the technician, Rudy, were behaving in such a way that they would miss their flight if they would give me one more extra minute by talking or allowing me time to follow their instructions more peacefully. Note that there was just one person waiting after me. The technician, Rudy, was the most rude staff member that I have seen in Singapore clinics.

Unless forced to, I would not recommend anyone visit this clinic.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108679753021092365864/reviews

IloveCayline IloveCayline,1,"Called for inquiry about medical examination for insurance application today. I had not finished the questions, the staff (Rudi) responded. Of course, not answered the questions. I repeated the questions, again she responded before I finished the questions. That happened repeatedly for a few different questions. If the staff doesn't have time to even listen to the questions, we shall also ask ourselves whether the clinic is worth of our time as well.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106133837500747767128/reviews
