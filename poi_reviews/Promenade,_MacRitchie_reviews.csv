Megaworld Asia,5,"The MacRitchie Promenade is the final attraction before arriving at the amenities centre and is the primary reason for the existence of the MacRitchie Reservoir. The promenade (pathway)runs across the top of the dam is approximately 200 meters in length. From the midpoint there are excellent views up the waterway.

Safe travels,

Forest BK,5,"ðŸŒŠThe Promenade overlooks the expansive picturesque Reservoir.
It's a short distance, but somehow the walk is very tranquil and peaceful.
ðŸŒŠThe quiet, clean surrounding and empty of shrubs and trees and people really makes the place therapeutic.
ðŸŒŠEnter thru the iconic Colonial era gate and immerse in the moment of peace and tranquility.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
