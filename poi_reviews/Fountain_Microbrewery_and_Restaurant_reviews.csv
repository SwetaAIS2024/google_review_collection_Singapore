Tracy Tan,5,"We celebrated Valentine's Day here. We had no idea that the Science Centre would have such a treasure.

Around 740 p.m., live music began, and I loved the atmosphere and bright lighting. Air conditioners are also nice. Additionally, patio dining was available outside.

Things to improve: two employees seems like too little, especially on V day. A platter for two to three people, pandan beer, and chamomile tea were ordered. The ribs are tasty and delicate, however the pork shabu smelt so strongly of pork that I only took a bite and didn't touch it. The fish fillet has a somewhat powdery taste. They could improve their sound system, and the singer's voice sounds muffled.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100445277692388196837/reviews
Ramesh Muthusamy,5,"Oh my goodness!!

This plan is incredible!
Phenomenal food. The best chicken chop I have had the whole eat. Crispy, moist, packed with flavour.
The band is damn good as well.

The beer is refined and worth trying.

Will visit again. Fast service. Great for families. Cozy. They got all the key points for a restaurant perfect without any fuss.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114100390194175553403/reviews
Yong Quek,5,"Nice environment and food. Had Cheese Nachos, it was a big portion, with generous serving of salsa and cheese. Do eat while hot. The live band (Char Siew Pao!) was amazing, they sang really well. 5 Stars ü§©. Didn't manage to try the beer though, will try next time when not driving.

YL,4,"Food is average and pricey for the portion. Of the dishes tried, I'd recommend the BBQ ribs.

Service and atmosphere is ok. One issue here is that some Telco (M1 & TPG)  have no signal in the restaurant which means you don't have data to even use WhatsApp in the restaurant and there's no WiFi for customers to use.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107635851269331591315/reviews
