Adam Abdullah,2,"Ordered rice, beef rendang and sambal fish cake. Charged $7.50 for these. Meat was super small. Best part is, staff was literally scooping and choosing the smallest meat to serve the customers. There are not much food options here at West Plaza hence decided to try out. Taste was decent however, there are better nasi padang stalls out there.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104728581246456873199/reviews
KLL 777,1,"Dear Raden Lina Management,

I am writing to share my recent experience at your West Plaza outlet, which unfortunately fell short of expectations. I believe constructive feedback is important, and I hope this will be taken in the spirit of improvement.

On my visit, I ordered three packets of Nasi Padang and was charged $32. There were no visible prices displayed, and the final amount seemed to be quoted arbitrarily. Transparency in pricing is essential for customer trust, and this experience left me feeling overcharged and disappointed.

Additionally, the freshness of the fish served was noticeably lacking. It did not appear to be of good quality, which raises concerns about food safety and standards.

I would also like to highlight the service I received. In particular, a male Malay staff member with blonde hair came across as unfriendly and dismissive, with visible attitude. Courteous and respectful service is a key part of the dining experience, and this behavior was disappointing.

Given the quality of food, lack of clear pricing, and poor service, I do not intend to return to this outlet. There are many other Nasi Padang establishments in the Pasir Ris area that offer better value and customer service.

I wish your team the best, and I hope these issues will be addressed for the benefit of future customers.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110288402362971750312/reviews
Jacob TAN,3,"The food here is above average for nasi padang. However, there is little flexibility to make changes for their set meals. Suggest to have more flexibility to top up to make changes.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews

Adrian Chua,5,"One of the best nasi padang I've tried! Taste is great, authentic, delicious. Price is reasonable for the quality. The portions are generous as well. The owner is very friendly. I strongly recommend this nasi padang stall located in Koufu food court at West Plaza!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104805418112540145105/reviews
