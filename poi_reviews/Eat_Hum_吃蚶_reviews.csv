Hui Min Poon,5,"Purchased on multiple occasions over the years, definitely the best and my go-to for marinated hums üòç never once took a nice shot with the food delivered, always half eaten because cannot wait to dig in haha. Cockles are THE must-try, which sauce can be cooked with noodles of your choice. Crabs and lala soup are also recommended!

Great service from Val too, friendly and always ready to answer all my queries. Thank youuu for the amazing food and service.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106308797945075726271/reviews
Raymond Poh,5,"Not gonna review on the prices, just gonna review on the food.
Bought 450g L hums, mild spicy.
Around 40 hums overall in the plastic container
Marinated Sauce : 10/10. You'll love it if you're a lover of spice and garlic
Spice : 10/10.Mild spicy is 150% which i think is perfect if you can take spicy food for the kick. I should be able to take 200% spice but think 150% is perfect to enjoy the hums without burning your tongue
Freshness of the hums : 8/10. Tasted more fresher hums in Japan and high end restaurants but still good quality hums paired with the sauce and spice to make up for it.
Overall: 9/10. Will definitely order it again once the cravings comes but definitely not healthy food you eat every week. Do not waste the remaining marinade sauce as you can still boil it to use as sauce for your pork belly slices or sauce for your plain porridge which i highly recommend",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116716754517895652644/reviews
Food critic,4,This is a homebased shop where u order and collect. I ordered the L cockles and abalone. Food was very fresh.  Those that like cold dishes will enjoy it alot. For me i prefer my seafood to be hot. But overall it was a nice experience. Price is slightly on the higher end but definitely worth a try since the serving is bigger than normal and definitely worth a try.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105349669551956516114/reviews
Kw Soh,5,"I have tried the hum once previously and was addicted to it. Purchased it myself and sure enough, it was amazing. But perhaps 200% spiciness is really pushing it, will try normal spiciness next time. The chili crab is fresh and big. Worth the money.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114420165073813667193/reviews
Rachel Lee,5,"Bought the hums a few times, the taste and quality always spot on and so consistent! This is the first time purchasing the prawns and it was worth every single cent! How is it that each head is so creamy and the prawns are so fresh! Will definitely recommend them and will be back for more!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103102327827118203502/reviews
