Su Hui,2,"New customer. Went to get new contacts at 9pm, understanding that they close at 9.30. Eye tests shouldn’t take long but the lady who served me did not seem to want to help me with this even though I requested for the eye test and asked if the specific contact lens brand I asked for would fit my eyes. I needed the lenses in a rush so I had no choice but to purchase it. Was a little disappointed. Just a warning to those who are looking to buy contacts, come at a good time so they can serve you properly. Felt like they were just trying to make a quick buck so they can close their store quickly and didn’t provide the full service they should. Nevertheless they still advised that I could come back if it’s not suitable and they would offer other options so I appreciate that. Hope the lens fit well.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101469075736628036421/reviews
