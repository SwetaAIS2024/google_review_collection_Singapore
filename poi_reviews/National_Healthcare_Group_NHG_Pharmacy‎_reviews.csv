Etan (Wandering Bard),1,"1) useless hotline. Nobody picks up and nothing gets done. Claims they can fix nothing cause everything also not their problem.

2) canâ€™t even book in system online. Everything is always after 2pm even if you come in the morning first. Ridiculous.

3) finally saw a doctor, and he told me to come again if any specific signs or symptoms appear, but the system doesnâ€™t even allow rebook, so you have to go through the whole song and dance to wait and wait for hours because if there is a chance they call you early and youâ€™re NOT there, then you restart the waiting game.

4) I tried to explain my case at the front desk, and they relayed the WRONG INFO to the nurse, who passive aggressively said thatâ€™s what I told them at first. How many times do I need to repeat myself???

5) called the number and the line was crackling so bad that Iâ€™ve had better calls in the 1990s. So another sign of Singaporeâ€™s failing infrastructure hidden by useless facades.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102488063181103337016/reviews
