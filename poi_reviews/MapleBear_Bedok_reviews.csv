Caroline Ng,5,"I don’t know why the rating for this school is so low. I sent both my boys here and it’s has been a really great experience. The journey with both boys were with really good teachers especially in kindergarten years where it’s crucial learning time in preparation for primary school too. Yes, there may be teacher turnover issues at some point, but we’ve been in other schools and this issue is everywhere! It’s more important that the school, teachers and non academic staff have the right values, loves children, cares deeply for them, disciplines in the right manner and are super qalified(which they are). They have non academic focuses as well with interesting activities, concerts to bring out their flare for the arts and overcome stage fright, and so many more wonderful things. In my last PTC session, I teared with the teachers as we know our time left together  isn’t much. That’s how much they love the kids. Thank you MapleBear bedok for helping my boys blossom to who they are and loving them so much too.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112466792046488618647/reviews
