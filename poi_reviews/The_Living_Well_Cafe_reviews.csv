J Choo,5,"freshly made soups make this short corridor walk to TTSH smell so good in the morning. The $10 for 3 pastries is a good deal as they taste quite good. Tried the salmon quiche (all pies come with a side of salad with your choice of dressing). Absolutely yummy. The flat white has a nice head of foam, slight caramel taste. Very good. It’s free seating tuckshop style but the calm ambience, spaciousness and low foot traffic makes this corner a nice place to relax if you have family to visit at TTSH or the newly opened Integrated Care Hub (ICH). If you are a repeat customer, you’ll get to enjoy staff rates. Double joy.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103009672461896916742/reviews
Gek Kim Choo,5,"Managed to try two daily specials this week: Masala chicken nasi lemak & Smoked Duck Fried Rice. Add on a daily soup (s) for $2.50 (regular price $3.50).

The Masala chicken was worth the wait, it was so tender with a generous amount of curry. Nasi was lemak with cucumbers, ikan bilis and nuts. Do ask for more sambal as it’s deliciousness cannot be sated by the standard tiny amount. The Tom Yum Soup was so mellow, fragrant and comes with lots of button mushrooms and tender morsels of chicken.

SG is known to be a Fried Rice Paradise and the Smoked Duck Fried Rice is worthy to be one of its stars. The addition if freshly shedded lettuce makes the dish light and cuts the greasiness of the duck (a few more pieces of duck would make it sublime). Paired with Old Melon Soup, it made a very healthy and satisfying meal.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103215362347270452746/reviews
Brendan Chan,5,Great big bowl of salad with ingredients freshly made everyday. Lady boss is also very friendly and nice! Have to try their muffins as well as it is crispy on the outside and very melty on the inside. Overall great experience!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114652855393528764341/reviews
Grace Bu,4,"Taste: Pretty decent bowl of salad for $7! 1 base (veg or pasta or mixed), 4 sides and 1 protein. Just that they tend to run out of ingredients by 1pm so suggest to go earlier if possible.

Cost: $7

Waiting time: 5 minutes

Overall: 8/10",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111891956501988952404/reviews
Ashley K,2,"Vanilla latte cost $6.50, expected a decent size for that pricing but the small cup was only around 200-300ml. I couldn’t even taste the vanilla.

Don’t have a good impression of the atmosphere as well. When ordering I can hear the boss berating one of the staff.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110751114140691269990/reviews
