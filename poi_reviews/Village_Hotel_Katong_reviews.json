Many food shops and bars nearby as well. The staff are all very welcoming. Always smile and greets the guests. Arina did great assisting us during our check in. Answered my queries with smile and confidence. I will definitely come back again.",

      "text": "I stayed here for two nights during a work trip to Singapore and had a good experience. The hotel kindly upgraded me to a room with a bathtub, but I didn’t get to use it because of my busy schedule. The room was clean, big and had everything I needed. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was fine, though it could be better. Location is close to a train station and a bus stop, plus there’s a grocery store downstairs and a few good restaurants. Overall, I enjoyed my stay. ❤️",

      "text": "Booked this on the last day of my business trip since this is located a bit closer to the airport. Nice price to value ratio. Love the balcony! The bed is comfortable. Room is spacious and very clean with thoughtful amenities (towels, hand towels, sanitary bag, shower cap, dental kit, toiletries). Love the accessibility of the toilet as well. The staff are friendly and accommodating. Location is also nice since it’s just a few minutes walk from Bus stops and the Brown Line MRT which leads you to many tourist spots (I recommend to get the Brown line route to Gardens by the bay than the Blue line - more accessible and comfortable route)\n\nI also love the virtual passport / guide they provide (though this is via QR code) which is helpful for tourists. The neighborhood is very cool. Less crowd and I had a peaceful stay. This is my 2nd time in Singapore and I loved the East coast more. Highly recommended for those who want to visit Singapore.",
