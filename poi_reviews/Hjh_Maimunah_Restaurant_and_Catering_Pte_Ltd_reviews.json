The food is best eaten here as compared to their outlets at food court which were already really good! Would definitely come back here again!",

Throat felt like swallowing Malay-oriented food.\n.\nIâ€™m very particular when it comes to breakfast. Has to taste right. Then suddenly craved for the Ayam Goreng Kicap of Hajah Maimunah. So, off we go to their Geylang branch on a weekday. (Best branch. No kidding)\n.\nCame with another person but we ate meals for three. ðŸ«£ðŸ¤£\n.\nLet the pic do the talking. I donâ€™t each veggies but the Pucuk Ubi gravy is always a must.",

My favorites are: yellow curry chicken, rendang, paru (beef lungs), and orek tempe.\n\nThe place can get very crowded during weekends and a few large groups will also book the upper seats. Consider getting here early or with someone to get some seats beforehand.\n\nMeals in the picture costs about S$10. Better to request less sweet for the drinks.",

The sotong was a generous piece but unfortunately extremely overcooked and rubbery. I had to use a knife to saw through it.\n\nThe vegetables in the sayur lodeh were undercooked and hard.\n\nI may return but I definitely will not get sotong again.\n\n$12.60 for this meal though, is a waste of my money.",
