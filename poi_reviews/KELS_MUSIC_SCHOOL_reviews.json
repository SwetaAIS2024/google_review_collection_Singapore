My intention is to let my kids be exposed to music and develop their interest in it so that they will have the motivation to hone their own musical knowledge and skills. Teacher Lynn is patient and kind. My kids are young (5 & 7) and l am happy they are enjoying lessons and looking forward to performing their favourite songs on stage together with other children in the music school.",
