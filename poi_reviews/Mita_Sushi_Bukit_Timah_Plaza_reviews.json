One man show doing cashiering, cooking and clearing of tables and worried that he couldn‚Äôt handle it. Luckily there‚Äôs not much crowd.\n\nOrdered Madai sashimi and it was so fresh! Their sashimi selection was fresh as well.\nFirst time encounter Aburi Mehajiki and it was interesting!\n\nLove the ochazuke! Very flavourful and not stingy with their fish. Recommend to order!!!\n\nTried the dried Japanese sardine (looks like white ikan bilis to me) and reminded me of the cuttlefish snack, just that this taste lighter.\n\nWould definitely go back to try other dishes from them.",

While the atmosphere feels a bit quiet, I happened to pass by and decided to give their buta kakuni (braised pork belly) a shot, priced affordably at $11.90 with no extra charges. The dish exceeded my expectations ‚Äî the meat was tender, flavorful, and cooked perfectly, with a portion size that felt just right. Overall, it‚Äôs a great spot to enjoy a simple yet delicious meal without breaking the bank. Worth checking out if you‚Äôre in the area!",

      "text": "A new spot in Bukit Timah Plaza for chirashi and sashimi, giving the other two Japanese eateries some stiff competition. Although the space is much smaller, with only around five tables, the menu is equally‚Äîif not more‚Äîpricey. However, they offer an extensive selection of alcohol. I ended up at Mita as a spillover guest from the other Japanese restaurant with an overwhelming queue. It has a cozy, family-run vibe, with a young boy helping to serve, with pretty polite service. I tried the gyudon, which was on promotion‚Äîtender beef and perfectly textured rice made it a satisfying dish.",

Decided to try this newly opened restaurant as a nearby popular Japanese restaurant was crowded. Not disappointed at all. Fresh sashimi and well seasoned rice. Proportion is balanced as well.
