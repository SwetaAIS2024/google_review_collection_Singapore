Michi,4,"My little one really enjoyed our time here! The play area was great for kids. However, I did notice that there wasn't much shade available, which could be an issue on hot days. The changing facilities were a bit limited, with only a few rooms (I can't recall the exact number), and they unfortunately lacked hooks or stools for bags. On a positive note, having a cafe right next door was very convenient for grabbing a bite or relaxing.""",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114920634455322009945/reviews

Danial H,4,"The Jacob Ballas Children's Garden is a hidden gem in the heart of Singapore! This beautiful garden is specifically designed for young children, with a focus on exploration, learning, and fun.

The garden is beautifully landscaped, with a variety of plants, flowers, and trees that provide a natural and serene atmosphere. The playground equipment is cleverly designed to blend in with the surroundings, creating a seamless transition between play and exploration.

I was impressed by the attention to detail in the garden's design, from the gentle streams and water features to the interactive exhibits and educational signage.

The garden is well-maintained, with clean and well-maintained facilities, including restrooms and picnic areas. The staff are friendly and helpful, and there are plenty of signs and maps to help visitors navigate the garden.

One of the standout features of the Jacob Ballas Children's Garden is its focus on accessibility and inclusivity. The garden is designed to be accessible to children of all abilities, with wheelchair-accessible paths and play equipment.

Overall, the Jacob Ballas Children's Garden is a must-visit destination for families with young children. It's a place where kids can learn, explore, and have fun in a beautiful and natural setting.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104290919683287390522/reviews
Sarah Sandys,1,"Came here on a sunny day and I can’t believe there’s no built in shade. The kids have to play in the glare of full sun and there’s no shady spots for parents to sit either. This is newly designed, why hasn’t anyone put in proper shade covers? Disappointing lack of health and sun safety. A small thing as well to note that the changing rooms don’t have any benches to put clothes while getting dressed.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117867554509069060119/reviews
Eve C,4,"Very good children themed park in botanic garden. They have playground installation for young and older kids. A pity part of the play garden was closed to renovation during visit. Otherwise, everything else is good.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109756518746414930822/reviews
