Now, they get their orders wrong half the time.\n\nPlain prata: Quality is not up to standard, sometimes not done, semi-cooked.\n\nOnly Kopi drink shop is acceptable standard. Should not have Thai food but maintain Chinese zi char eatery.\n\nThis current Kopitiam is of average standard unlike previous Foodfare.\n\nPlease improve quality standard, not just increase price all the time.",
