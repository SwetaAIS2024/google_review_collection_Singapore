If you have a sweet tooth, small isnt enough for you\n\nThe matcha bingsu was amazing. The matcha powder is thick and the ice cream is amazing. No wonder they sell ice cream only too. The ice was milky and smooth.\n\nHighly recommended and i will travel there to have it again",

      "text": "The large bingsu is priced affordably at $11-$13 (Good for 2-3 pax sharing) and the small one at $7-8 (Max 1 person portion I feel). The ice shavings are rather sweet and not bland unlike some of the bingsu place. Toppings were generous for the pricing as well (See from the pictures) Totally enjoyed both the Mango and Choco banana bingsu I have eaten on 2 separate occasions. Hard to find a nice and affordable bingsu place in Seng kang. Pictured the speculoo ice cream $4.50/scoop (price varies for diff flavours) and Yuzu tea.\n\nI totally recommend this place!",
