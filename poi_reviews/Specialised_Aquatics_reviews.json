Until I visited Specialized Aquatics, Hong (wearing spec guy) attend to me and explain patiently what I need to buy for starter and how to cycle the water. Then I just purchase everything from him.",

      "text": "High quality livestock handling...\n\nThis store always gets a negative perception within the reefer community due to their overpriced livestock. Talk to the staff about their processes and you will know why the prices are slightly on the high side.\n\nFishes imported undergo weeks of careful monitoring in a holding facility before made available to customers. Vials of test bottles can be found as they routinely perform tests on the tanks and logged to maintain optimal tank condition for fishes to thrive while waiting for their new owners.\n\nGenuinely impressed by the exceptional care and thorough procedures setting this store apart in the aquarium industry.\n\nStaff are also generally friendly. Its usual for any staff not being able to entertain you when there's huge crowd but if there's isn't, they are able to provide the best service to you. Would be great if they can start their loyalty programme again to make customers keep coming back.",
