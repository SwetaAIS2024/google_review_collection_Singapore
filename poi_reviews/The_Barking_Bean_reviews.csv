Tan Ming Shuang Cherie,5,"I hardly ever go to cafes but it was my first time here and I really love how the place is so lively and the owner of the shop is so friendly, caring and compassionate. Due to mobility issues we had a huge stroller and she even helped me bring it up. She made sure my fur baby was okay throughout because we sat outside for a period of time and she was so kind with her words to me until I was about to tear and I told her ""okay don't say already"" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹ If I ever do have another dog in future I'll definitely come back and I'll recommend this place to all my furparent friends :)",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107105962567766305947/reviews
illusorydoll Eileen,4,Fries is crispy. Mushroom soup is flavourful and the bread has a nice crunch yet fluffy. The salted speculoos ice cream is great with the waffle. Iced salted caramel latte and iced gula meleka latte is great too! They have menu for furkids too and itâ€™s indoor pet friendly :),3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108751945590041472358/reviews
Patty Palmer,5,"Cafe is pet friendly and serves good food. Sunday can get busier but they have enough tables and seats. The food is good, burgers, egg sandwich and coffee all taste good. Best is the ambience as owner is friendly and nice to patrons and pets.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104267121234826142408/reviews

TT Tem,4,"This place offers a spacious indoor area where dogs can roam freely while their humans enjoy drinks and food. We ordered our food, which was decent, and noticed that most tables were occupied by people enjoying drinks and relaxation. There are toys available for the dogs, and they even offer dog-friendly treats like ice cream and waffles, although we didn't try them this time.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102605946402464634360/reviews
