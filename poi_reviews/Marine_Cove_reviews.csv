CCS,2,"""Found"" the place three years ago, and it was my oasis of peace at the end of a workday. A concept Coffee Bean, unlike any others won my heart. Then, there were a variety of eateries catering to local palates.

Of course, McDonald's new-look restaurant was a deafening success . Happy meals and zappy kids rosters will. Hapless staff were trying to stay cool and obliging, but it was hard.

Slowly, over the years, the whole place declined into yet another East Coast Park where sounds and activities ruled.

But hey, a full carpark and jostling diners say people are happy.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews
