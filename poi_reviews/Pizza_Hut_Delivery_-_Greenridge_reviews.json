Order 2 regular (cheaper in 2s) for 4 pax (2A2C).\n\nService\n- Lady on duty is very friendly and patient.\n\nAtmosphere\n- Clean, small, but cozy.\n\nWorth to revisit again?\n- YES",

The ac is not felt to have a comfortable dining in experience.\n\nAnyway, you cant go wrong with pizzahut!.\nCheers to that.",
