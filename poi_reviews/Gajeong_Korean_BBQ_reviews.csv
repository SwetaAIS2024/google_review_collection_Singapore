Lance Tan,4,"A Korean bbq place found on the second floor of Hougang RiverCourt. We ordered the chicken, beef and lamb set which came with a side of Korean steamed egg as well as a choice of soup, in which we picked the seafood tofu stew. The banchan and lettuce were refillable. The kimchi was spot on for me and it went well with the meat and other condiments. The set was meant for 2-3 people but for us two it was super filling and we did not manage to finish all the food. Although the total bill totalled $70+ , I believe that it was pretty worth the price. Will return with more people in the future.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103171518127946119222/reviews
G G,2,"Quite disappointed with this place. If you look for genuine review please read this.

Overall the meat is ok : 3/5 (fresh yet portions is ok)
Seafood stew: 2/5 (Maggie taste better than this, super light taste like water put seafood only)
Steamed egg: 3/5 (passed )

Not worth the money cause taste like food court Korean food and the meat is the only plus point.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102842156145270474985/reviews
Collin Ng,5,"So surprised to discover there is a korean restaurant here in this local neighbourhood mall!
The food is really good, and there's no crowd so I can enjoy the food in without the heavy noise pollution like in other malls.
I especially love the seafood chigae stew. You can taste the sea! The prawns were big and fresh.
The steam egg surprised me with very nice ""wok hey""! Love it!
The ban chan were lovely too! The kimchi is good here! The kids love the ikan billis.
The spicy chicken rice and bibimbap were not bad too.
The seafood pancake is good!! Crispy at the edge and soft in the middle! I look forward to trying the kimchi pancake next time.
I'll be back!!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100358502333657729087/reviews
Russ TT,5,"I recently visited Gajeong Korean BBQ at the newly opened Hougang Rivercourt and was thoroughly impressed. We ordered two lunch sets: the Kimchi Ramen (beef) and Bulgogi. The Bulgogi came in a surprisingly large portion, and the beef servings in both dishes were very generous. The Kimchi Ramen was flavorful and satisfying, perfectly complemented by the tender beef.

To our delight, the bill came as a pleasant surprise‚Äîboth lunch sets were heavily discounted to just S$8.90 each during the lunch hour. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the restaurant itself was clean and comfortable, making for an enjoyable dining experience. Gajeong Korean BBQ is also Halal-certified, making it an excellent option for Muslim diners. Overall, I highly recommend this place for its delicious food, generous portions, and affordability. Definitely worth a visit!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115991491714980969902/reviews
