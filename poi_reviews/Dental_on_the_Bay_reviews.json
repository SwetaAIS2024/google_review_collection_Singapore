      "text": "Really disappointing. Came for cleaning. It was really fast, but then went to the store with normal mirror and light and it appeared that cleaned really poorly. Had to get back. The dentist was asking me to show what exactly was not cleaned like she was not able to see it herself. Then i had to request to use paste and clean with it as it was not even proposed by the dentist. The usual final stage with nice polishing with good taste paste was not even done. Poor experience.",

      "text": "I have been to 3 different dentists over the last 2 years, and this one really stood out to me! In my previous consults, they seemed to be very clinical and tried to pressure me into signing up for costly treatments. My visit to Dental On the Bay stood out, as the dentist here seemed to genuinely care for my well being rather than just conducting business. The options given to me seemed a lot more logical, and there was no attempt to pressure me into doing any costly treatments like at the other clinics I have been to. Definitely coming back here for all my future dental needs, though I hope I don't have any more tooth problems ðŸ¤£",

Dr Chin is clearly an expert and is meticulous in his treatment processes. He offers sound advise and gentle care, which made my recent surgical treatment experience an easy one.\n\nA high-tech dental practice of experienced dentists combined with a professional clinic staff makes them highly recommended and a clear choice!",

      "text": "We were in Singapore on holiday.  My girlfriend developed an painful abscess in one of her back molars.  We visited the Dental on the Bay clinic in the Vivo City Mall - very easy to find.  The office was very modern and the receptionist was friendly and was able to give us an appointment that day.  Dr. Gillian Yee was great !! Excellent bedside manner, clearly explained the problem and treatment.  We were able to complete our holiday without further interruption and my girlfriend was pain free in a short period of time.  I highly recommend Dental on the Bay and Dr. Yee !!!",
