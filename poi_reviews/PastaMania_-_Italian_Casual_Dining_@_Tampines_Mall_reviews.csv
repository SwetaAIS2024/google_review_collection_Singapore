Deep Thought,1,"Two people ordered:
Cheesy graclic bread: Was just okay
Truffle Mac and cheese baked pasta: It was not baked and was way too salty and watery.
Chicken sausage spaghetti: No salt at all (as per the personnel, no salt is added in pasta) so do it yourself.

Yingying,5,Food was good and it was served within 10 minutes. Their Aligo Olio linguine was well cooked and the cheese stick was hot and crispy. Overall good experience and this restaurant is family friendly since they have a long table that can cater for big groups.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117289079780130956871/reviews
