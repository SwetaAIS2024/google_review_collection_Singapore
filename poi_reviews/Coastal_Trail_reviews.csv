Forest BK,5,"ðŸª¸Coastal Trail runs along the coastline of Keppel Bay at the northern west side of Sentosa Island.
ðŸª¸An easy trail along the Keppel Bay coastline with a winding upslope climb at the ending that works towards Fort Siloso Skywalk.
ðŸª¸Interesting highlights are the remnants of an old Sentosa Pier that had a rich history behind it, and a hidden beach that emerge only during low tide.
ðŸª¸The paved Coastal Trail is well maintained. It has been around since the 1980s and is still looking good.
ðŸª¸The Trail is very seclusive. There is hardly another one around.
So, you may take your time to focus on your ideal photo composition. Lots of photo opportunities.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Bryan Tan,5,"First time to the trail for the Harry Potter: A Forbidden Forest Experience! Was quite surprised to find this trail suitable for families, and easy to find. Also there is a carpark nearby that you can park your car.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103044814566546397817/reviews
Emilie Yeo,5,"Gorgeous and quiet!
This trail has been around but a recent revamp just made it more accessible. Located just off the road to Rasa Sentosa and where you will alight on the bus to Fort Siloso.

This is where to go to get away from the crowds at Labrador Park. It is where to go for a moment to reflect. The trail is in good shape, next to a sandy beach but beware of the currents. I guess it is not for swimming. But the views are wonderful. An old broken siloso jetty will make a great photo opportunity.

The trail is a loop through the secondary forest and to the coast. Wheelchair, pram and stroller friendly.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116887973096497242776/reviews
Lexi Lu,5,"This is a fun and scenary hiking route, you can enjoy the rainforest as well as a less visited beach across from Keppel, and finally end up at the  Siloso Ford appreciating a bit of Singapore history. Highly recommend.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106622858701090809167/reviews
itchylife Life,5,"I stumbled on this costal trail when I was leaving Fort Siloso. It was a quiet and relaxing walk along the seaside ending with a bit uphill into the forest near the elevator of the Fort Siloso Skywalk.

Along the way, there are information boards telling you what are the buildings in front of you, what plants you are looking at, how Sentosa built this costal forest area, and why the air is cooler under the trees. This trail is quite educational when you have time to read.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101945429855310631357/reviews
