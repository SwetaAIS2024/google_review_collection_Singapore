      "text": "Do think twice. Bad experience for my case. Sec 2, joined 1+ term, from always been A to C5. When checked with centre, what are they going to do with her grades, how are they going to help and improved. Both tutors could not give any suggestion. Literally went \"errr...\"\".\n\nMost uncomfortable is the way they charged their fees. They even charged on holidays like National days. They do replacement on the same week, but be careful they might not have the same class in the same week. They don't care, charged first, worse is watch recording.\n\nAnother is their booster lesson, they don't need your consent or check your availability. They just charged and what happens if you can't make it? Recording lor.\n\nIn conclusion, nothing personal, not experience tutor, not engaged, very commercialized centre\n\nI will go for 1 to 1, charges are the same, and you can monitor.  Good luck.",
