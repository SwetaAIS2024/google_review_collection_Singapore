      "text": "Monday special- always loved the fried fish soup. Fish is cooked well, not too oily or salty. Soup is tasty , does not have the preservative taste at all. Set comes with a drink only for $8+, so worthy.\n\nFruits, kuehs & other delicacies can be found here,\n\nThe hot milk tea (teh tarik) is one of the best tea i had.\nTasted like a local coffeeshop.  Please try it :)\n\nGenerous portion and very affordable given it's location.\nThere is also a wide range of daily menu that is updated on their telegram page, reservations of food are allowed as well.\n\nClean dining area, not too crowded, indoor & outdoor seating available. Will always come back here for comfort food, everything here taste home made which is amazing.  Staff are friendly and do not rush us to order.",

      "text": "A true hidden gem of Singapore right inside an expensive neighborhood\n\nCame here while on business to renounce foreign citizenship, a great place with wonderful prices. People say it's probably for the workers nearby since you get additional discount if you have a worker card.\n\nI sometimes order a second serving not because the portion is small but because the food is too powerful. Eat till you explode 11/10. Be aware that menu changes(rotates?) every two weeks so what you see in the pictures may not be there.\n\nOh yes the milk tea is great.",

Almost did not want to recommend as I would like to keep the tranquility to myself. Food reminds me of days gone where my parents brought me to RELC building or Sloane Court Hotel for lunch. I would say,  food is not pretentious and it's hearty. Fills one's stomach and the milk tea is to die for.",

I don't see much review on their breakfast but boy, I am certainly impressed with the breakfast that they serve. Toasted wholemeal bread with loads of vegetables, ham n fried egg and a cup of local kopi. It's nutritious, filling and extremely affordable at only $4.50.. considering the locality!!",

To which I received a very curt response “what do you want ?”\n\nEven the foreign workers who patronise this place is treated with more respect ! Need I say more ???\n\nAs this is a cafe operating in the STPB premises, can we please bring back the “Speak Good English” campaign . Perhaps the young Malay lady is slightly deficient in this area !",
