Jonas Ng,4,"First time at this restaurant and it was a pleasant surprise! The butter chicken is creamy and fragrant. The naan was also great with a healthier wheat option. The chicken briyani was fantastic as the rice is fragrant and the chicken is really tender.

Gotta say the price tag is on the steeper side but the food is definitely quality! The service was also prompt and the male waiter is very friendly and helpful! I’m not the most well versed in Indian cuisine but this is a place I would come back in the future!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101879101765488803530/reviews

Kwan Hui Su,5,"Ordered two Mumbai street food as appetizer, love them so much! Especially the Dahi Puri! So many layer of texture and taste! All the dishes are good, and I think their portion is kinda generous too, the Kashmiri Pulao that is filled to the brim and with so many raisins and nuts!
Service staffs were friendly and attentive, the free pappadum is so tasty, coupled with the mint green sauce.
Will definitely come back again! So glad that the Hillview area has plenty of Indian food option for us to indulge in!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115440088545893845574/reviews
