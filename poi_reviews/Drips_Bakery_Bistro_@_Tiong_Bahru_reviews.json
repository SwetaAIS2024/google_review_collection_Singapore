The sweet potato fries was mediocre but the smoked salmon dill was surprisingly good.\n\nAtmosphere was good. I like to go back and try other kakigoris and pastries.",

      "text": "ðŸ“Œ Highlights: Yuzu matcha + meat quiche\n\nIced yuzu matcha is well balanced with a soothing color and goes well with desserts. Came for the shaved ice, but ended up trying the tempting desserts instead.\n\nâ€¢ Meat quiche (10/10)\nâ€¢ Eggless honey lemon cheesecake (8.5/10) textureâ€™s good as a cheesecake, just a bit pricey\nâ€¢ Avocado tart (8/10) smooth combo, but no lasting impression. Add 0.5 for the light, not-too-heavy cream\nâ€¢ Mac&cheese 7/10 good but just average",

What makes the tarts really good is the crust which is perfectly done to my personal liking, not too soft. Ambience is relaxing, brilliant for personal chilling or hangouts with friends. The tart prices have increased so much over the years but I kept returning because it's that good ha! Having said that, drink prices are pretty reasonable, cappuccino is good. Street parking available but might be challenging during peak hours.",

The inviting and cozy atmosphere makes it a great spot to relax, whether youâ€™re unwinding alone or catching up with friends.\n\nThe pastries here never fail to impress. The pistachio croissant is a standout, with a perfect balance of sweetness and butteriness that enhances the flavors of the dough. The nasi lemak is equally delightfulâ€”fragrant, savory and indulgent from the very first bite. And if youâ€™re a pasta lover, the waguyu beef linguine is a must-tryâ€”deeply rich yet not overly filling, with perfectly textured strands that add to its appeal.\n\nCoffee enthusiasts will appreciate the well-crafted drinks. The flat white delivers a bold, full-bodied flavor that stands out from the watered-down versions found elsewhere. The drink prices are quite reasonable, making it easy to pair your coffee with your delicious food.\n\nIf youâ€™re in the area, this cafÃ© is definitely worth a visitâ€”just keep in mind that parking can be tricky during peak hours!",
