GG K,4,"Nice ice cream and waffles here. The waffles are really not sweet by itself, which goes great with the ice cream! I also appreciate that the ice cream is not as sweet as other shops. Service was good, customers can sample different flavours. Their flavours are also more interesting than the commonly found ones. We got the pistachio and hojicha flavours, both of which were really fragrant and pretty creamy.

However, price was on the high side, which may deter me from returning again.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113182488876013163119/reviews
dorisyong,4,"The weather had been hot recently, so I thought of having ice cream waffle for lunch. As per the norm for me, it was more important to satisfy my curiosity than my stomach, so I ordered two scoops of the strangest ice cream flavours to go with my waffle. A hit and a miss. I really love the Yali Pear and Barrel Aged Oolong. However, the Sakura Smoke, Artichoke and Pear Compote taste weird. I can’t get used to the smoky taste in ice cream.
I returned again a second time with a teenager. She had Brontë Pistachio and pink Himalayan salt while I tried Kyoto Shiso and Yuzu jelly. The teen seem to enjoy her pistachio scoop but I found the Kyoto Shiso bland.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101978539412430365487/reviews

Choon T,5,"Nice little gelato place in this quiet neighbourhood. Great place to satisfy your ice cream craving after a meal.

Tried a few flavours and really like the hazelnut choco flavour.

They shared the same location as Glass Roaster, where they served coffee, tea, soda, beers and wines.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114720035040328969753/reviews
