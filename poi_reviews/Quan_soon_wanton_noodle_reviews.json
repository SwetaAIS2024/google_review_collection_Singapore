Medium size at $4 is reasonable.\n\n06dec24 - back here with my kids today. Looks like the daughter took over. Noodle is still super nice. Best in West",

Noodle was spring and chewy. Cooked almost to perfection. The black sauce and chilli compliment the noodle really well. The wanton was soft and ingredients was fresh and generous.\n\nJust the old school type of breakfast to start off my day.\n\nðŸ“· Follow us for a gastronomic experience and discover the world finest in its purest form",

At first glance, after the noodles were prepared, the noodles didn't look exciting.\n\nHowever, after tossing and mixing the noodles, they appeared to look better.\n\nThe noodles were done just right and they had that springy chew when bitten into.\n\nThe sauce and chilli in the noodles were excellent. The char siew was nicely done, but perhaps it could have some fat on it.\n\nThe wantons were also of good quality. Service staff were polite and efficient.\n\nDefinitely worth another try when I am next in TGFC.",

      "text": "Always see a long queue at this stall so I decided to try their Dry Prawn Noodles. Settled for a mid size bowl of mee pok @ $4.50.  Portion was decent.\n\nThe soup was pretty good however the taste of the noodles wasnâ€™t what I expected. I found the noodles pretty bland, I thought maybe not enough salt so added some soya sauce but still bland. The texture of the noodles was good though, springy and nice. Chili abit spicy but the pork lard, disappointingly chewy and not crispy. Overall I find the dish lacked the umph.\n\nI guess probably their wanton noodles will be better. Will try and update.",

I am not a fan of old sch char siew, But if u donâ€™t mind, itâ€™s really worth your stomach space.\n\nThereâ€™s this super popular wanton mee in pek Kio market at $3.50 per plate, super long queue. So, if this stall is also in pekio market, without any doubt, I will buy this to avoid the queue and yet feeling satisfied.\n\nIn fact, this stall is way better than the other 2 wanton mee stalls in pekio.",
