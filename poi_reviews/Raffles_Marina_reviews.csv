Wei Chen Yeo,5,"Is a beautiful place. Food is great for its value. Elsie have been very helpful and accomdating to our requests. Thank you Elsie and team for ensuring that our wedding ran smoothly. Thank you for all your services.

The 3 hour lighthouse booking that comes with the wedding package is a bonus if you are looking for some nice photoshoot location.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113237247350590671158/reviews
Aaron Ng,4,"One of the quietest places to have a staycation in SG.

I wanted to recee for wedding site, so I stayed for a night.

To be frank, the place have seen better days, some of the furnishings and carpets are showing their age. Can especially be seen in pool with a few broken tiles.

That said, I love the tranquility and the opportunity to visit the famous Raffles lighthouse.

The staff are very super nice especially the staff at the bistro. Views are really nice at sunset as well.

Not much to do but very nice place to chill.

Will return again to lepak.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103942200053255198001/reviews
Prem Gopal,1,"My wife and I, are regulars of the Bistro for both lunch and dinner.

It is quite apparent, how the number of staff, especially in the Bistro, have reduced, over the last several years.

Despite the reduction in staff, the excellent quality of service has been maintained especially during peak hours. However, in the past months, we have noticed that no managers were on duty, especially over the weekends, or public holidays.

We have noticed that when certain matters that require managerial attention, the general staff have to bear the brunt of pacifying unhappy customers.

This is extremely concerning as this will be stressing the ground staff out tremendously, when all of which could have been avoided, if the duty manager were around, during peak periods like weekend dinner.

We sincerely hope, you in senior management, can do something to alleviate the situation, and prevent long term efficient staff from leaving.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105529584231458560334/reviews
Neamul Kabir,4,"Went for a wedding. The venue is quite nice and decorated. But for wedding type celebration it's not so brightened with lighting and all. Good for a birthday or small gathering. Location is a bit far, actually its near the tuas second link, like last point of SG",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110178420873573199712/reviews
Bervyn Mok,5,"Held my solemnisation and a little wedding dinner here. My wife and I had a blast! Elsie was very helpful throughout our whole process and helped us whenever we had issues that we were facing. Sheâ€™s very trust worthy and her team was on the ball. We initially had a lawn solemnisation but due to bad weather, her team had to move everything indoors and it was done quick and managed to make it in time.

We had a blast and I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a beautiful sunset as your backdrop.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111938389237784690762/reviews
