      "text": "I was on bus 13 on Thursday, 29 August when a bunch of first toa payoh primary school kids came on the bus. it was extremely crowded and they were playing around, spilling red bull all on the floor. The bus was then splattered with red bull liquid on the ground and it was everywhere. Not only that, i was standing beside an extremely obese little boy and he stepped on my feet, not once, not twice but 8 times. I counted, 8 times. It was horrendous, the worst public transport bus experience i’ve ever gotten in my life. They were making a ruckus and were being public nuisances. It was extremely painful and I had to apply cream on my feet for those 8 steps on me. I tried to warn him and his friend group to not make a ruckus in public transport but they simply just ignored my remarks. They were soccer boys and i didn’t manage to catch their names. Not to mention, they smelt so bad, like rotten, expired buttered popcorn.They looked like primary 3 and 4 boys and I wish this primary school would reprimand or do something to help these children. Extremely inconsiderate, no sense of personal space students. Thank you.",
