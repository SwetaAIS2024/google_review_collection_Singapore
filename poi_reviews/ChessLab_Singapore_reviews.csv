pui yee chua,5,"My child started out learning chess from another trainer but was getting mixed results. He switched over to ChessLab about 2 months ago and under the guidance of the Grandmaster, his progression is starting to gain traction. The one-on-one sessions allow the Grandmaster to customise my child‚Äôs learning plan to draw on his strengths while working on his weaknesses. My boy looks forward to his chess class and fight night sparring sessions with fellow chess enthusiasts.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113392826366497712360/reviews
Clemence FRIRY,5,"My son is only 6 and only started recently but he loves his chess classes and has made great progresses in very little time. I communicate with Ping on the admin part and she‚Äôs always responsive and understanding. She even sends me pictures of my boy playing, I love seeing him so focused.
The grandmaster sets the bar to a competitive standard early on, my son already takes notes of his moves and presses the clock button whenever he‚Äôs done his move. He‚Äôll soon beat me to the game for sure!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117320797009433391705/reviews
