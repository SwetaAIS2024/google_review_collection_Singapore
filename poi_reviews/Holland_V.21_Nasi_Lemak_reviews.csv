Kai,5,"Chanced upon this nasi lemak stall and was amazed by it. The nasi is fragrant and well seasoned 👍🏻 the chicken wings was fried perfectly 👍🏻👍🏻 the sambal is sweet and a little tad spicy which suit my taste 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 the egg is also cooked perfectly! As it is runny 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 curry veg is well seasoned and very fragrant! Last but not least, what I love most is the free flow batter crumbs! 😋😋😋😋😋

Overall, it is a satisfying meal and will definitely come back again",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117612273412230021726/reviews
CT liaw,3,"Long queue during lunch time, coffee shop a bit small, need to wait for empty table.

Really enjoy their chili.

One thing inconsistent is the staff keep on changing, some staff mention for rice you had to order the set according to their menu, some staff agree for rice can ala carte.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115843697549679461073/reviews
Charles Wong,4,"Very reasonably priced at $4 for a Nasi Lemak set (consisting of egg, chicken wing and a fish fillet)! The rice was fragrant, chilli and serving was good. More importantly,  the chicken wing and fish fillet was crispy and hot. Thi is probably my first time having a hot and crispy fish fillet in all the nasi Lemak (or equivalent) shop I've tried!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101484885002012505986/reviews
Andrew Lee,3,"Ate at this place at 7am on 09 Oct 2024.
Ordered a Set D, fried beehoon, an egg & a chicken wing. Costs $4.10.
Later, I realised that their Set A of Nasi Lemak with the similar added egg, chicken wing costs only $3.
I was babbled...is beehoon more costly than coconut rice?
Moreover, the portion is so small, like 5 mouthfuls for big eaters.
I asked the server for the cost of the items, she replied, ""Yours is a Set D""",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107996012330561968507/reviews
Ac Wl,5,"These chicken wings are nothing short of perfection. From the moment they arrive, the golden-brown exterior gleams with promise, hinting at the crispy bite that awaits. One crunch, and you’re hooked—the skin crackles with a satisfying crisp, revealing succulent, perfectly tender meat inside. Each wing is fried to an impeccable crispness, yet never oily, offering the perfect balance between crunch and juiciness.

The seasoning is masterful. A harmonious blend of spices gives the wings a depth of flavor that’s both bold and nuanced. There’s a subtle heat that builds gently, followed by a hint of garlic and a touch of sweetness that keeps the palate intrigued. It’s a flavor explosion that doesn’t overpower the chicken but elevates it, allowing each bite to shine.

Whether served plain, drenched in a tangy buffalo sauce, or glazed in sweet and spicy honey BBQ, these wings never disappoint. The sauces complement the wings perfectly, offering layers of flavor without masking their natural taste. The meat practically falls off the bone, and each bite is a testament to culinary craftsmanship.

Simply put, these are the best chicken wings you’ll ever taste. They’re more than just a snack—they’re an experience. A dish that turns something simple into something extraordinary, leaving you craving for more with every single bite.

Hope this conveys the top-tier experience you’re looking to express!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104013774275632163653/reviews
