I think they use 3-in-one coffee mix for this.\n\nWonâ€™t be back though Abigail service is very good. Super friendly.",

It was very crispy on the outside and tender in it.\n\nTheir coffee taste really fragrant and has the traditional scent. Not bitter at all.\n\nTheir staffs are very polite and nice too!\n\nDefinitely a place I'll recommend!",

I enjoyed the big eggs and toast is just perfect. Coffee also nicely roasted not too overpowering yet strong enough for me. Without bad aftertaste for a traditional coffee. Love it.",
