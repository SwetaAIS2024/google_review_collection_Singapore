Waw Maw,5,"This is a good shop if you want quick groceries (food, drinks). They also have an IJooz vending machine.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105457037382138762182/reviews
Ptr Sue,1,"If you're doing a business online and uses a drop off point for shipping, do not drop off at this shop. I dropped my parcel on Sunday(6/2/22, 1600hrs) and up till date(8/2/22, 1300hrs), nothing was done.

They did not scan my parcel despite informing that my parcel is for J&T and I need to acknowledge that my parcel is dropped off at their premises. The lady(small & skinny) insisted that I drop off my parcel and it will be handled. Both ladies were so busy with their phones and yet are not able to spare 2 seconds to scan my parcel.

Days passed and my parcel is still not scanned and arranged for shipment. My patience ran out and I went to the shop to retrieve my parcel. I dropped them off at a more reputable shop, and it's arrange for pickup within the hour.

This shows how inefficient this shop is. I no longer trust leaving my business with them.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108801448068574363926/reviews
