Special shout out to Winnie, who was very attentive and takes initiative to make our dining experience more pleasant. Hiring the right people is indeed more important than training them. I believe that's what makes The Spot such a popular and successful spot!\nFood recommendation: Cheese Bread, Crabcake, Lobster Pasta, Scallops.",
