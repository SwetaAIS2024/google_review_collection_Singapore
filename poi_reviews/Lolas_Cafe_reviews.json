      "text": "Off Day Well Spent at Lola’s, Kovan\nTook the day off, and instead of sleeping in, I made my way to Lola’s at Kovan not just for the food, but for the vibe... and yes, to see the friendly (and very pretty) staff I’ve heard about.\nBeen seeing this place pop up on Chris’s feed, so I had to check it out myself. I ordered the Miso Salmon Grain Bowl, and wow every bite felt like a little reset. The miso-glazed salmon was tender and flavourful, resting on a bed of fluffy quinoa. The charred baby corn brought a smoky crunch, and the avocado added that creamy contrast I didn’t know I needed. A perfectly jammy hanjuku egg, a dash of furikake, and that nutty roasted sesame dressing tied it all together.\nWashed it down with a hot matcha latte except… it came out warm. Big sad. But you know what? That was the only miss in an otherwise stellar meal.\nSometimes all you need is a good bowl, good energy, and a smile from the staff to make your day. No regrets, only recharges.\n\nFollow me for more foodie adventures IG @Johnnykuochung",

Thankfully my family shared the food among ourselves, as each main course dish was “too much” for a person. In particular, the bread and the stew complemented each other perfectly. The pasta was too “truffle” though. Overall, the dinner was nice, including the good customer service from the staff who served us.",

The plating of the dishes are nice. The servers are friendly and smiley, but can still be more attentive. A few servers were chatting beside us and and need us to signal vigorous to notice us trying to catch their attention for sharing plates.",
