010 Pixel,4,"This store is mostly near bus stations and mrt stations. They sell candies, mouth fresheners, cold drinks and juices. Having this store here makes it very convenient for anyone to just grab some candy or drinks without going back all the way to vivocity or HarbourFront center mall. Mostly I like to buy my mouth freshener candy from here.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105759984436678631984/reviews
