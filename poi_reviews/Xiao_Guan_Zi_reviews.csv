Kaka 3120,1,"I used to like this restaurant and went there for 10 plus times. However, the new waitress there wearing glasses is basically a fierce monster that yells at everyone ordering there with least politeness and patience.

Will tell friends never eat there again because of her.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115014835413936900378/reviews
