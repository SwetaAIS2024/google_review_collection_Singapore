Merrill Shen,5,"Essentially had the whole restaurant to ourselves on a Wednesday date night. The lamb was exquisite, highly recommend and the beef was incredibly well executed. Both were seasoned perfectly and done perfectly to our preference. Would easily eat up a few more portions! The escargot was is delicious as well with the garlic pesto topping and edible shell!

Excellent service from Muni! Thank you for the wonderful night!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111117190547567237249/reviews
joyee joan,5,"We had our ROM event at Au Balcon at The Garage, and the planning team from 1-host was incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. The venue itself is stunning, requiring minimal decoration, and it looked amazing in the photos. Our guests had a wonderful time, and everything went smoothly. We couldn’t have asked for a better setting for our special day!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105010924327423800529/reviews
Joel I N Lee,4,"Tucked comfortably away in a cozy corner at the Botanical Gardens is Au Balcon at The Garage. After a morning run or an evening stroll, this eatery is a welcoming sight serving hearty breakfast or a great pizza meal. It’s a great stop on a hot day to take a breather and quench one’s thirst.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106577477566107835715/reviews
Valerie Ng,3,"The food was not the best quality, had beef and it was quite difficult to cut or chew - probably a cut at the tendons. Drinks were good though.

But we were sat outdoors and wow the mosquito bites that I sustained swelled up so bad for three to four days at least.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104264956178928554394/reviews
Jeffrey C,4,"The restaurant wasn’t too crowded in a Thursday evening. Love the space (tables here are not placed too close to each other.
The food is rather average though. The steak was good. Duck leg config was abit below par (although we liked the onion sauce). The pastas were average.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106833163410885808643/reviews
