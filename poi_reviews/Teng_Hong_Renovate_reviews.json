      "text": "We contracted Teng Hong to do an overhaul of our 3BR Condominium. It was an old condo with the last renovation done more than 10 years ago. Rayen helped us tremendously from the planning stage till the end. We had no Interior Designer so she literally had to play that part as well, and she offered many practical suggestions which we eventually adopted. I was particularly impressed with her willingness to accompany us to the various shops and offer her professional advice from a practical perspective while retaining aesthetic considerations. Overall, we felt that it was value for money and the pricing was reasonable with very good service offered.",

The entire renovation was smooth with regular updates given by Jun Hao.\nHe made a lot of effort to truly understand what we wanted and gave us helpful and practical suggestions throughout. We added on quite a few things along the way and he always accommodated our requests and more importantly kept everything on schedule despite our short timeline.\nThe quotes provided were reasonable and pricing is competitive.We did the electrical, plumbing, carpentry and redid the entire bathroom including tiling. The quality of the workmanship for everything is good.\nWould highly recommend working with him!",

She also took into account all my specific requests regarding measurements.\n\nThird, we engaged THR for a small project and regardless of that, Rianne and the team did not treat it as such. Other IDs may eschew smaller projects because it may not be worth their time & effort, but I never felt that this was my experience with THR.\n\nLastly, I appreciated that THR was able to install the cabinetry within two days. Super fast & efficient!\n\nOnce again, thanks Rianne and team!",
