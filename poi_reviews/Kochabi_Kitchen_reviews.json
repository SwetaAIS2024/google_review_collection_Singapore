      "text": "What an amazing, delicious place, run by the loveliest people! Every dish was so good, a throwback to nostalgic flavours with twists that renew our fondness for them on our palates.\n\nThe Assam beef cheeks need to be a regular menu item! The seafood congee is a definite must have (fair warning, it's quite a large claypot chock-full of delicious ingredients), and the salted fish prawn curry was so more-ish we couldn't stop eating it with the kochabi rice (if you think rice is just rice, you are wrong!). The desserts were so good as well, that one of our friends practically licked the plate clean!\n\nEverything served up here just made me love Kochabi Kitchen more, and I can't wait to come back again.  Thanks chef Michelle, eating here was such a treat after a long and difficult week. ‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nI don't think anything else I can write, and no photo I can post, is going to adequately describe how wonderful the food was tonight. Worth a visit, best with a group so you can order more items!",

      "text": "Insert *ku za bi* in hokkien. Very pleasant take on familiar tastes. Must order > the rice, don't let anyone or anything deter you from ordering that, very generous big serving of yummy rice that has gone through more thoughts even tho simple.\n\nCrab congee thing was amazing, didn't know there's such a big flower crab that has so much meat in the body. But oh boy the congee, start off eating it normally, but just remember to inhale it at the end when it's cooler, it's a soup then.\n\nTwo other highlights are the beef cheek and prawn, SO GOOD, and yes you should add the sauce onto the rice, COMPLETELY enhanced level of yummy rice.\n\nI enjoyed the starters too, the pork belly and the fritters!!\n\nI ate so much my stomach was hurting me for a good 10minute before I reverted to a \"full\" status. I haven't been so full for AGES and it's really affordable, come before you need to wait 3months for booking.\n\nAnother note the angmoh on the next table inhaled the food.",

      "text": "Bought there by daughter for dinner last night. Very homely n simple setup with only abt 20+ seating. Had foods that you won't find it anywhere else. Loved the Mango cuttlefish kerbau, slightly spicy n sour. Very appetising.  The ulam n Tang oh shrimp n pork fritters is v unique alittle bitter though. Next the Tempoyak curry fish (stringray)does not have a v strong durian, even daughter who don't take durian can accept it. Love their Bacon sardine rolls! Crispy n juicy on the inside. Two flower crabs n prawns cook in porridge was very tasty. BYO drinks as they don't sell liquor. Open only 2 days a week, fri n sat. Price is quite reasonable. Reservation required. Will go back to try other foods as they do change menus quarterly.",

      "text": "I will bring everyone i know here! The food is exceptional!!! I dare say it's nothing you will will find anywhere else. They focus on preserving traditional South East Asian flavours with a modern twist and its the perfect union of nostalgia and inspiration. EVERYTHING on the menu is awesome! We had the Kerabu, a fresh Asian salad even my non-vegetable eating friends enjoyed! My new favourites are the Bacon Sardine Roll (fresh sardines!), Ulam Dang Oh Shrimp Fritters (who knew dang oh can be so crispy) and Sambal Hijau Steak (you can request for your preferred doneness). We LOVED the Singgang Ayam Babi which reminded me of the Filipino Sinigang, it's tart and spicy flavours were so appetizing we had to order extra rice. The Prawn Mee was like Hokkien Mee on steroids - Umami Maximus! I will definitely order this again next time!\n\nI have been following Kochabi Kitchen since their last venue and I so glad they are now in Tanglin Halt. Location is central and accessible, right in the heart of such a quaint and lovely old neighborhood. It's a 2mins walk from Commonwealth MRT/ Sheng Siong Supermarket. It's really a vibe! You can also take the chance to explore the old biscuit shop, general store and florist nearby.\n\nThe Chef Michelle is a one woman show together with her partner so they are operating by bookings only. You can check their IG @kochabi.kitchen for the updated availability and menu. Make sure you booking ahead because they fill up really fast!",
