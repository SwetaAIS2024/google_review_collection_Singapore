Brendan Chong,5,"they do braised pork/rice as their special on thursdays and it's a real treat. not usually a fan of fatty meat/skin but this one really melts in your mouth. the sauce is sweet yet tangy and goes well with the rice, and the chili (somewhat like the chili you get with chicken rice) is also a must-have. they also sell drinks and i enjoy getting ice milo which is so rich yet under $2!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104049319276615552489/reviews

Tony Wong,5,"Specially Thursday for their 卤肉饭. Tender, tasty and goes well with white rice. Chef used to run a zi char stall but decided to opt for less hectic life and work for passion. And the cute bubbly lady boss taking your orders will definitely perk up ur day! Do go early as it is sold out before lunch time is over.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107147206817092861115/reviews
