      "text": "My all time favourite brand of Greek yogurt, Chobani Low fat.  A huge tub of it is packed with an abundance of high protein, calcium, and very low fat content.  My definite substitute for cheese.  I swear by this brand of greek yogurt in my endeavour to improve my gut health, regulate bowel habits and to also maintain my lean physique.  It has a very sour & somewhat unpalatable smell of bile for some who are not tolerant towards such foods.  I would recommend the addition of some fruits and nuts such as walnuts, almonds for those who can't stomach the product on a standalone basis.  Highly recommended product!",

When I arrived at the warehouse to collect my order they told me they had sold out the mooncakes, albeit there was an outstanding order due for collection.\n\nThe only consolation was that the staff were apologetic and sincere. Next year I will just buy from the retail stores.",

His listening skill is ZERO.\nHe promised Otis cookies sample since 21 January 2021 (as per whatsapp). I only sent a reminder yesterday (27 March 2021)he accused me for demanding it to be sent immediately. Horrible attitude! There was once delivery was late and i have left, he puts the blame on me and said that i should have informed him that order was not delivered. Worst sales person ever.",
