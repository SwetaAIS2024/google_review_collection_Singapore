However, I do think it is much more affordable to go there between the time range of 12pm to 6pm as after 6pm or a few mins before 6pm the price would increase and no offers will be availableðŸ¥¹\n\nWill come again on another time",

The room are all nicely decorated with futuristic feel and sound effects isnâ€™t too bad as well. Just lack the standing mike n stage which will otherwise makes it better . Price at $20/pax for 2 hour session",

      "text": "Overall the atmosphere and room are fine. However will advise to eat first beforehand as the food are actually from ordering platform delivered to the venue, all in disposable containers and nothing like what you see on the IG photos which is going around. That was indeed pretty misleading to consumers. Also we booked the place for 4 hours and at 3.5 hrs our system hang and stalled. When we went to the reception, the staff told us it was because one of us went to pay and due to system, it will auto re-boot......I guess they should inform us of that beforehand???\n\nGuess it will be our first and last time there. Price aren't cheap also for weekend so we would spend it at other KTV venue.",

Service is fairly good, nothing to complain about, since it's just singing session, how complicated can it be for services? Atmosphere is great but room has way too much echo to my liking, and it's not something that can be adjusted on systems....Overall is fine, not too bad, but if you want more value for money, look elsewhere. Rates are not cheap!",
