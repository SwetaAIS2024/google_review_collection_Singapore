Yusuf Sabqi,5,"One of the most spacious, cold, and clean musolla/surau I've ever been in Singapore. Men and women prayer rooms are separated, and there is built-in place for wudu'.

It's located at Garden Tower section of Marina One at B2.

If you go down this particular escalator as in the photo, it will lead you straight to the musolla. Hope I've helped you do your solat on time!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111761834570533197264/reviews
meer,5,"Had the best time here because first time ever found a surau, a place to pray in Singapore.

This surau is located in B2 East Tower.
The basement level got a few shops and this building is actually a high-end residential area.

This surau got absolution area and it is air conditioned space. Also got a few wakaf al quran, perfumes, tissue and soap to wash your hands.

I think this is nearest surau within Garden by the Bay. If you are planning to come here, can alight at Downtown MRT and walk to Marina One at B2 East Tower side.

This Marina One is quite famous with stunning art of its architecture design.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106965501845054584952/reviews
Muhammad Za'im,5,"Nice, big and clean surau with wudhu area. Convenient walking from Lau Pa Sat. Find any outdoor escalator facing DBS and go down to B2. It is beside a laundry shop.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108390127164687552671/reviews
MK Farhan,5,"The location is accurate and incredibly convenient. The musolla was spotlessly clean and well-equipped with ablution facilities, separate room for muslimah and mini library. It's the most practical and comfortable option for those attending events at Marina Bay Sands.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111905116241961235655/reviews
INR,5,"Masya Allah. It's very easy to find this mosque, located across from the B2-L1 lift. The mosque's symbol is relatively small, but with careful observation, it's easy to find. Separate prayer spaces for men and women. The prayer area is exceptionally clean, tidy, and certainly comfortable for worship. There are racks providing various necessities, including masks, hand sanitizer, tissues, and more.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107259122173390886588/reviews
