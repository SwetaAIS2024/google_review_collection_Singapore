Alex Lee,1,"If you are sick and working in the area, do not come to this clinic. They allow student check up to enter the consultation room first. Those who reached later than me get to go into consultation room earlier than me. I sat for 30mins with fever cough n flu, but unable to get to consult the doctor. It is not even crowded. When asked, they say cos the students got appointments. If this is the case, you should not do walk in patients, just do appointments. Terrible clinic and i have to cancel my registration after waiting for 45mins. Imaginr a sick man got to cancel clinic registration and find another clinic to seek consultation, not because this clinic is very crowded, but because they simply do not bother much about walk in patient.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104551697831556498614/reviews
Kalebee Yeo,3,"It seems the BYOB (Bring Your Own Bag) policy has made its way from supermarkets to clinics. Over $100 worth of medications were dispensed, but no bags were provided to patients. I hope management will review the service standards and provide a better patient experience.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103081212935721312362/reviews
Xin,1,"Brought my overseas business guests here for a PCR test, but was very disappointed with their service. Rude recept, and they only got swabbed an hour after the appointment time. The guests have a flight to catch on the same night, so they opted for an express test, which supposedly gets your result out within 6 hours. However, it did not!!! They got their results after 8 hours. Was on the edge waiting for the results because their flight requires a negative result before they can board the plane. Overall, an unpleasant experience!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115814112287621479111/reviews
J,1,"My review was deleted. The owner didn't like my review ??

The worst experience. Staff arrived late at 0905 am Mapletree Business City. Opening hours stated 0830am. No apology and informed no doctor on site today 03 May 2023. If there is no doctors on site, then do put up a notice to inform the patients earlier. Let's not waste each other's time!

Frustrated. Went to a different location at Fusionopolis. The staff was kind enough to inform me that their internal system was down. She asked if I wanted to wait. I said no and left. Was the staff at Mapletree Business City aware of the system down ? If she told me at the beginning, I wouldn't have wasted my time coming to Fusionopolis.

In summary, Clinic Group made me wasted 2 trips and more than 1.5 hours. I will NOT recommend anyone visiting this Clinic Group. Do NOT waste your time!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106390772146676479106/reviews
Cheshire,3,Doc was super friendly! Not so sure about one of the receptionists since I was told to head back at 2pm even thou I got there before 11.45am + there's only 2 other patients at the clinic (she told me they can't squeeze me in???) + their lunch time is at 1pm. Go at your own risk or call ahead. I was in too much pain to think ahead then.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111466257026989392358/reviews
