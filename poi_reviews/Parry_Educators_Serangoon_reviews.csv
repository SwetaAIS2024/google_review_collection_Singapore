Hong Ian Lim,5,"Mr Tan is a very patient teacher who is able to teach Mathematics in various methods to ensure the best results for his students. I thoroughly enjoyed my lessons with him. He makes Math easy and fun to learn, different from all other tutors out there.
Mr Ara is a fun and bubbly character that brings the English language to a whole new level. He is knowledgable, charismatic and most importantly, gives his all for his students.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107562371499711541284/reviews
Deepak,5,"I know Mr Aravin from my secondary school days at Just Education when I used to go for his English tuition classes on the weekend. His classes were always insightful and interesting - discussing various topics outside of usual curricula, as we evaluated and built on each other's answers. Certain points highlighted by him still stick with me today when writing an academic essay. As an experienced and down-to-earth tutor for all levels, I'm sure anyone would enjoy his amusing lessons as well!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109780331683703822424/reviews
Lincoln Tan Joo Yong,5,"Mr Aravin is the most patient teacher I have ever met in my life. He would sit down and explain what you have gone wrong until you have completely understood. He always sacrifices his time, effort and energy out of his love and passion for teaching and his students. He always seeks out the potential in every student who is at the lowest point of their life. Also he is an amusing teacher and the life of the party who brightens up your day.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115421788689340383609/reviews
