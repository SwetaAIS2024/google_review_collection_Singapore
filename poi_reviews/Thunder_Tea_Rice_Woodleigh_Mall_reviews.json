In fact rice and veg/tofu is almost half half, very good value I suppose. I ate it over 3 meals. Not greasy. Nice and crunchy. Good option for healthy vegan food.",

      "text": "Food is good but depending on which staff serves you, you will get a good or bad customer experience. I was served by a non local staff who ignored my call a couple of times. Then when she took my order, she didn’t look me in the eyes when she asked if I want white or brown rice. Then she let out a huge yawn while keying in my order on the system. And throughout, not a single acknowledgement or smile. There are somethings called service and basic courtesy. Which she obviously has none. This outlet has a lot of problem with their staffing it seems. Always change staff, and they are never that interested in making sales. Management, if you read this, please hire and teach your staff how to provide basic service.",
