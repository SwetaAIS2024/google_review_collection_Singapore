Swati Jain,5,"I am incredibly impressed with Lorna Whiston Kallang! The school offers a perfect blend of indoor and outdoor learning experiences. My daughter started two months ago and has made amazing progress. The school incorporates nature walks, public water play areas, and the mall environment to teach in real-world environment. These activities are not only fun but educational, helping children grow in a natural and engaging setting. My daughter has already expanded her vocabulary and is becoming so articulate. It’s a fantastic place for young children to learn and develop in a dynamic, hands-on environment.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105518016274863344598/reviews
Amy,5,"Just want to express a big big thank you to Lorna Whiston Ms Mala in Kallang Wave. Class teacher Jamie and Ms Wang also took care of my kid wholeheartedly and even discussed with me on how to ease her into the new school when she first joined.

My kid loves her school so much and looks forward to going to school every day now. All the master classes and fun Friday activities are well planned to make all the kids enjoyable. There are sand play, water play, cookery, dramas class, etc.

Food is great, environment is great and teachers are great also!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114038121637924713824/reviews
Samantha Low,5,"My daughter started preschool here at Lorna Whiston this year and she looks forward to going to school everyday. The curriculum is great with lots of fun activities for the kids. She’s most excited about the fun Friday activities and water play day! I also like that the school involves parents in some of the activities so we get to experience what our kids are up to in school. Thankful to the team, Ms Mala and her playgroup teachers Jish Laoshi and Ms Jane for taking such great care of her.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114092321488052547297/reviews
Nurul Hannah,5,"I've been sending my son to school since he was in N1, and it's hard to believe it's already been over four years. Ensuring that he feels comfortable and happy at school has always been my top priority, and this remains true every morning. Now in class K2 Harmony, he often tells me how much he loves his form teachers and enjoys playing with his friends. I've witnessed tremendous growth in him recently, and I truly attribute that to the school's well-rounded curriculum and the dedicated efforts of his teachers.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101657577153974315409/reviews
Milan Bhavesh,5,"Lorna Whiston has been a family to my first born (graduated 2023) and now to my second son. He loves to go to school and the teachers are very friendly and caring. Special shoutout to my son's teachers, Ms Jane and Jist Loashe. They have created a great bond with my son. Indoor or outdoor, there is always something unique to learn and explore everyday. It really has a very fun and creative environment. May be next time call me to join the fun?! ;)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113131635003181609448/reviews
