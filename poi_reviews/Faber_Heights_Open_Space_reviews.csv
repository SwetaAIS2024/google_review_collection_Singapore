C,5,"Faber Heights Open Space is a peaceful, well-kept park nestled within a private residential estate — a great place to relax, exercise, or spend time outdoors. It’s decently sized and thoughtfully laid out with big mature trees that provide plenty of shade, making it comfortable even on sunny days.

One of its standout features is the basketball court — a rare and welcome amenity in a private estate setting. Whether you’re here for a casual walk or a game with friends, it’s a quiet, shaded, and well-equipped spot. A solid 5 out of 5 — tranquil, functional, and a hidden gem for the neighbourhood.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
