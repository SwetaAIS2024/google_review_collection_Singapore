CA S,3,"Our 3rd time ordering this set when craving kopi/teh around lunch time via deliveroo. As we felt it is more value for money as it comes with 2 slices of banana cake. But this time I was very disappointed with the standard. The size of the banana cakes was so small and one was very thin; you can barely even call it a slice, if you refer to the photos. Laksa noodles was slightly undercooked and sauce too salty. The rice for the curry chicken was browned on one side (which I still can accept) but the value and standard is really dropping, even though prices are going up :( disappointing TGIF lunch",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106382357852771203354/reviews
Candy Goh,4,I'm really glad a Toastbox opened up in Loyang Point (with seats)! Would suggest to put a bell for customers to press because there were several times I found myself having to wait for a while or say something to catch the staff's attention as they are always absorbed in their own work and nobody is ready for customers at the cashier.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115359579617065032965/reviews

koallagom,1,"Very disappointed with the packaging from Toastbox at Loyang Point outlet. This is the 3rd time I ordered deliver from them and 2nd spillage of my drinks! The paper cup is not meant for delivery, the entire ice coffee cannot drink due to the leaking from the bottom of the cup! And this time the curry chicken came cold! The chicken is not tasty!
