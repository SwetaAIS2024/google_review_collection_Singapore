Angelbaby C.T.,1,"Dear Desigual Customer Service Team,

I am writing to express my disappointment with the customer service I received from the Desigual store at Vivo City. As a regular customer, I was shocked when I could not get through the line for more than 1 hour.

I urgently needed to return an item, but unfortunately, no one answered the phone. I then contacted the Desigual store at ION, where I received exceptional service from the staff. Ms. Shafiqua and Ms. Azura were extremely helpful and went above and beyond to resolve my issue within a 5-minute call.

I hope that Desigual HQ will look into the customer service at Vivo City to improve their responsiveness and service quality.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108927075675098555354/reviews

George Chang,1,"Very bad customer service. I was there with my wife and my wife was looking at one of the handbag at the top shelf .. she asked the shop assistant for help to take a look. Instead of willingly showing us, she ‚Äúwarned‚Äù us first that the bag is priced over $100 and no discount given !! Amazing!! Didn‚Äôt realise this time of attitude and service still exists in Singapore.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110277966506437794914/reviews
Colette Tan,4,"I love desigual! It's colourful, different and full of life. Only gripe is that sizes are big and their stuff I'd pricey. But for what it's worth, I feel happy when I walk into the store. üòä Clothes are generally comfortable but require a bit more care - basically, hand-wash instead of dumping them into the washer. DON'T come here because I don't want everyone to start wearing the same brand :( (kidding, please support them!)",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112297245669411174670/reviews
