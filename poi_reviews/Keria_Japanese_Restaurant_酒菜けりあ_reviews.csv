AC,5,"A fantastic izakaya experience! üèÆ

We were seated at the counter, which was exactly what we preferred. The beers were perfectly chilled, and the oysters and sashimi were incredibly fresh. Every dish complemented the drinks, making it a memorable dining experience.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108885915627322554774/reviews
Brandon Wong,5,"This is our second visit, and we realised there is a noisy siam diu(?) beside the restaurant now that just opened, sadly.
You can hear the booming of the loud music reverberating throughout the restaurant space, and there‚Äôs no way to avoid this as this place only opens for dinner.
Food was wonderful as usual! I think over here the sashimi is the highlight and you should really just go for this as one of your dishes, or the main thing. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for special orders, meaning to say for example there was a Tuna set with Maguro, Otoro and the third one which I can‚Äôt remember, but I only wanted Otoro so I asked the waiter and they said yea they could do it which was great ! Their skewers and yakisoba and karaage was quite decent too so I think you should try those as well but go for the sashimi!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115605977232730814612/reviews
Terry Ding,4,"Kinda noisy but food quite yummy.
The deep fried oyster, stir fried beef tongue and the grilled creamy chicken liver is highly recommended to try.
The staff is helpful. Only drawback is the noises from its neighbour. But I am okay with it.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106265589250471004962/reviews
Hamwichh,5,"Recommended by my FFXIV friends to come here and it absolutely didn‚Äôt disappoint! Had some trouble locating because it was hidden behind pillars but it‚Äôs beside a girls bar.

I love how authentic it is with all the regular patrons‚Äô alcohol lining the walls and it was fun to look around while we wait for our food and drinks.

I will definitely need to go back again but this time i will sit on the bar counter instead.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117671339216291743687/reviews
Diana R,5,"Real Japanese taste. It‚Äôs pricey but it‚Äôs really authentic. The place is very popular with Japanese, you need to call to make reservation.

My favorite is the deep fried squid tentacle, oyster butter and mentaiko spaghetti.

Unfortunately they are right beside a disco club so on Sunday, you will hear loud music.

The place is located right in front of the lift.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102157818940506229707/reviews
