Ronald theKoala,5,"My wife has had troubles with her foot for months and tried all the usual treatments.  I suggested we hire a wheelchair as we were going on a 21 day cruise out of Singapore.

An hour and a half before we had to embark she decided she needed a wheelchair!  This service saved us and delivered a folding wheelchair to our hotel within 50 minutes of making payment!

The wheelchair was perfect for our needs and meant we got to do things and go places we otherwise would not have been able to.

The whole booking, delivery and pick up arrangements were super fast, efficient and the cost was reasonable as well!

I would highly recommend this service to anyone.

Thanks",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114172071007672918581/reviews
Esther Lai,5,"At first my grandpa not sure whether to buy wheelchair or not. He don't want, but he really needs it. So we rent the wheelchair first for a few days. We are happy then we buy.

kerry taylor,1,"I travelled to Singapore from Australia on Aug 12 with my 92 yo mother who requires a wheelchair for a 6 day holiday,on previous trip to Singapore we have always travelled with a wheelchair but on this occasion decided to either hire or buy a chair whilst there,two weeks prior to leaving I contacted this company and was told that they had the chairs in stock, either new to purchase or hire chairs, approx. 7 days before our departure I notified Luci and stated I would purchase a particular model chair they stated they were available at $295 and a delivery to our Hotel for a further $30, I agreed to this and was looking forward to the delivery on our arrival,
Only hours before our departure I was notified by this company they did not have the chairs in stock and that I would have to hire a chair at a cost of $10 a day and a delivery and pickup fee of $60 plus a deposit of $200, it looks to me that as though they had no intention of selling me a chair as there is more money for them in renting, this left my 92 yo mother in some distress,fortunately because I travel to Singapore on a regular basis at the last minute I was able to hire a chair from a location near our Hotel at a total cost of $25,
