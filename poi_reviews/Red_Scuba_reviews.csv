low kok yuan,5,"Instructor - Jimmy Choo ( Beyond 5 star instructor)
There is a saying in diving industry, CHOOSE YOUR INSTRUCTOR , NOT AGENCY . And yes , I believe I found one. My mentor , my inspiration and the role model for me in diving.
And I am glad that he teaches GUE courses ! Kill two bird in one stone. Good instructor and good agency .
Jimmy Choo carry out every single skills and teaching professionally. He know what his student will face along the training and let us know how to handle it precisely.
He always put safety as his first priority. We feel safe to have him around.
I got thousand of reason to say why we choose Jimmy Choo as our instructor , it would be too plenty to list it out here one by one .
And again , thanks Jimmy Choo for letting us be part of your diving career and I hope you can always be with us as well

GUE and my instructor , Jimmy Choo, as always never failed to surprise me on how organise and well thought GUE can be .

GUE system
Organise and well thought on every skills we need and situation that we need to handle. The more we understand the system , we more we are convince that  GUE system will bring us to where we want to go in diving , recreational-ly or professionally

I appreciate every single training material from GUE. All training material are informative and well organized.
I can see that , GUE is not selfies to teach and pass on their knowledge to the public or their student.
GUE don't bait u with little info to lure you into another similar course. They give beyond what you need to know.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117683979451749496799/reviews
Mythili Pandi,5,"Jimmy was super professional and took safety as the ultimate priority during training. He cared for our well-being and ensured that we were comfortable during the training.

When I developed ear discomfort during one of the open water dives, he made sure the team ascended slowly and waited till I climbed aboard the boat before bringing the team down again.

He was gentle and yet thorough with my tweenager! Totally recommend Jimmy as a dive instructor. Best in the industry!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107040760414098354412/reviews
Hansen Ng,5,"Jimmy's vast experience, knowledge, unwavering dedication and outstanding teaching skills have greatly enhanced my understanding of drysuit diving.

With great care and patience, Jimmy mentored my buddy and I through competent drysuit diving skills & techniques, always prioritizing safety and creating an environment of encouragement and exploration.

Jimmy's ability to explain concepts in a clear and concise manner has given me more assurance to dive drysuit confidently.

Looking forward to more dry dives.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114870339904736746977/reviews
