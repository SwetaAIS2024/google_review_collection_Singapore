Wiz Kem,1,"Terrible food.
Tomato chutney was spoiled.
Idli was tough and microwaved.
Paneer kadai was so salty I had to dilute with water and even then had to throw it away because still too salty.

Ordered via grab but kitchen took one entire hour to prepare even though I asked for fast delivery.

Extremely incompetent, got my order wrong and sent me matar masala instead of matar pulao.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103920764371597912089/reviews
anil kumar,5,"I ordered six different biryanis and some starters for a dinner party. The food was delivered on time, and we received extra starters as part of the combo. We enjoyed all six biryanis, each with a unique taste. I highly recommend the Mysore mutton biryani; the mutton biryani is a must-try. The spice levels were just right, and the portions were generous. Overall, it was an absolute biryani party. Thanks to the restaurant for the great food!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110613922155902613268/reviews
