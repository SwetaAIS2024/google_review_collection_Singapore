Gina Joy,5,"Our 1st time trying this zichar place at jurong west, surprisingly all the dishes was good 👍🏼👍🏼 especially the curry fish head and salted egg sotong. Can say this is one of the better zichar 💟🤗 The guy who attended to us was friendly, we didn’t have to wait long maybe was still early at 5:30pm, it’s also not exp at all. Will definitely dine here again!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115387000622241024039/reviews
AC Chan,5,"Absolutely ❤️ this zi char dish — Amazingly tender venison slices sizzling on a hot plate, infused with an addictive and savoury gravy that goes so well with white rice 🍚!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
Chao Lin Tay (nubduck),4,"The quality of the food seems to have fallen over the years, still edible but I won't order anything in ""large size"" for awhile. Superior Soup Young Chinese Spinach was overcooked, vegetable was too old to be called ""young chinese spinach"". Curry fish head was good, but can see that inflation got to it, fried tofu/brinjal/lady's finger quantity dropped significantly.

Dined in for 7, fortunately my grandma still likes the taste.

I lived nearby and have been eating here on and off, would suggest looking at other table's orders before committing because their waiters tend to recommend the most expensive items on their menu (and that may not actually taste good!).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107495349648235983851/reviews
Warren Ong,3,"Not bad for a zichar place with a good variety of shared and individual dishes. I’ve to say that the prices are very reasonable and portions served are just nice. Staff are nice and friendly, food was served quite fast and there was a good crowd at the restaurant even though it wasn’t peak meal period. Good ample seating areas inside and out.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100105413429653445829/reviews
juliana lim,5,"Went there to try the chicken rice ball. It is good that the rice is not oily though not as fragrant as others I have tried. The white chicken and the chilli are both good too . Overall very good and worth another visit.

The boss is friendly and courteous, and invited us to return in the evening to try the zhi char dishes.

I am impressed that they open at 5am.  Such hardworking people! 👍",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117223327058609968328/reviews
