The staff are so amiable‚Äîwhen we asked for chilli oil, they responded with such a friendly and demure tone, and even said to feel free to call out if we needed anything else.\n\nWe also noticed someone behind us couldn‚Äôt finish her drink, and the staff kindly gave her a bottle of ice to take away so she could keep her drink cold.\n\nReally great experience here at Jewel! Will definitely come back üëçüëçüëçüëç",

The prawn broth is very rich and flavourful and definitely worth a try if you haven‚Äôt done so. Service is also excellent with staff being attentive and not much of a wait time although it was slightly busy.",

Unfortunately, there was an extremely pungent awful taste from the greens and I realised the chef put corianders with spring onions.\nIt really distroyed the meal to be honest.\nCorianders taste disgusting. Am glad that the soup did not have coriander smell or taste.",

We both chose the braised tofu.\nBig portion. Pretty good value to get the set menu for that price in Changi Airport Singapore. Because it will get you a VERY full stomach afterwards.",
