D L,5,"Mee pok is cooked nicely, not too hard not too soft. Chilli is ok. The nice part is the tender lean pork and fluffy minced pork. Soup is also not bad
$5. Good bowl, will eat again",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104966613744701231932/reviews
Wilson Foo,4,"With a name like that, one would not have guessed that this is a noodle stall. But it is. One of the newest in Clementi West Coast area, this new stall is located at the newest Kopitiam, Foodland 713.

And it sells all sorts of noodles. Bak Chor Mee, Fishball Noodles, Ban Mian, Laksa, Kolo Mee and even fish soup!

Ordered their Fishball Noodles, Mee Kia dry with chilli for $4.30. The noodles were cooked right, but not the round thin noodles variety but the thin but flat type. The specialty chilli was good. Savoury with dried prawns, it made up for the otherwise unimpressive fishballs and the equally bland soup.

New stall still getting the hang of things as the boss lady is seen continuously coaching the two employees from how to cook the noodles to how to fry an egg.

Will come back to review their other items some other day.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114263857328212431619/reviews
