R T,5,"I’m angry I didn’t know about this place sooner! Even though I live in the area, I never knew about this cafe because it’s tucked into a narrow passage right next to the Viva Vista mall sign. They do both matcha and coffee so well - haven’t had such a good cup of each in a while. The coffee is very well-balanced with a silky foam top, and the matcha is creamy and rich.

The place is so cozy and quaint, and the couple running the cafe are very friendly. Prices are also very reasonable. Can’t wait to go again!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112881779382390197806/reviews
Brandon,5,"Such a charming cozy cafe! Loved the lighting and decor. Owners were EXTREMELY nice and welcoming, they were incredibly accommodating despite the crowd as well. The coffee (we got the iced full moon) was great, although the matcha latte was a tad bit too mild for our taste.

The banana cake was also packed full of banana flavour and incredibly moist. Will definitely be back here to try the milk toast that I was eyeing!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106931953984099118905/reviews
CHARISSE NEO,5,"A cozy and warm inviting space. Soft background music and a pleasant layout. Perfect for a relaxing cuppa of specialty coffee & matcha options. They serve some bakes that are freshly baked in-house too. A hidden gem cafe run by a couple, driven by a shared passion for coffee and community. Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110735222692780073992/reviews
Valeriy Ivanov,5,"This coffee shop is a true gem for coffee lovers.
The white coffee here is simply incredible – smooth, silky, and perfectly balanced.
Beyond the exceptional coffee, the atmosphere is incredibly calming and inviting. The vintage decor, eclectic art pieces, creates a cozy and nostalgic feel. It's the perfect place to relax and enjoy a quiet moment with a cup of coffee.
Highly recommended!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104006855575499071878/reviews
Beau Blasé,5,"Best cafe in Singapore. Amazing coffee (highly recommend iced full moon), and delicious and refreshing matcha latte. If you are looking for a quiet, and cozy cafe to read a book or work and enjoy some coffee or matcha, you won’t find a better spot in all of Singapore. And the staff is great as well!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107156971758650069241/reviews
