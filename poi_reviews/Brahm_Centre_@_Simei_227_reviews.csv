Steve Deng,5,"I was here today for a student camp on building physical and mental resilience and learning mindfulness. The centre itself consists of a front entrance, and a desk reception to the left, which has a few work stations behind it. In front is a pantry, which is stocked with nuts, packets and utensils.

After turning left and walking straight, you'll enter the Activity Room. The Activity Room has a projector and tables and chairs. To the right is a male and female toilet. Inside the male toilet is a toilet for people with disabilities.

The toilet is very well maintained. I would say that the toilet is very clean and can be compared to the ones in Marina Bay Sands. The floor is dry and is not wet, unlike many public toilets. Unfortunately, the toilets in Brahm Centre @ Simei are not for public use.

Behind the Activity Room is the Mindfulness Room. The Mindfulness Room has lockers, a projector, and extra chairs. It is mostly used for yoga or mindfulness class sessions. The projector is also working fine, and the floor is very clean.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100579565676475213285/reviews
