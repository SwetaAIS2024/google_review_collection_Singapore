Tan. W,3,"It offers great value for money with every item priced at $1.50. The Big Bao, which typically costs $2 at most places, including well-known brands like Nam Kee Pau, is only $1.50 here and it's not dry at all—it's juicy! I had a messy time eating it as the sauce gushed out.

The har gow might resemble those from frozen packets sold in supermarkets, but I'm certain it isn't. It tastes good too!",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103022836553318535151/reviews
Chuah Chun Kit,5,"For $1.50 per dish, with non regrettable dim sum such as the Taro Dumpling, it’s always a joy to eat with family members from young to old. Special mention to also try their prawn Chee Cheong Fun!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114655883592012245617/reviews

"Kok Wai , Sin",3,"Went at around 415pm, and off peak period. The place was empty.
Yam cake was fine. Custard bun too.
Char siew Chee Cheong fun portion is small and seems like reheat from an earlier prep portion, porridge is a tad watery for this version.
But hey, at $1.50 per dish, any dish, and just wanting a quick snack-and-go, this is fine.
Atmosphere 3 star because it's a HDB coffeeshop, and a strong stench at the toilet.
The stall person served fast and good, thus a full 5 star",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111749165083442677661/reviews
Song Play,5,Taman jurong has nice and affordable food. This is another coffee shop with nice and reasonable price dim sum. I like most of the dishes here and alway take away due to Covid safety.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107413852001563893356/reviews
