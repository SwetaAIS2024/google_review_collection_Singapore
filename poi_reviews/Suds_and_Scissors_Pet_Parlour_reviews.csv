Zhaopeng Luan,5,"Suds & Scissors has become our go-to grooming spot ever since our last visit. The groomers are not only skilful and gentle, but also incredibly knowledgeable—especially when it comes to breeds like our Scottish Terrier, Luna. Their expertise really shows in how they handle her specific grooming needs, and the results speak for themselves. Luna has never looked better. The team always makes the experience peaceful and stress-free for both her and us. Highly recommended!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109126400472614115757/reviews

vijaya esuvaranathan,5,"I’ve known the lovely sisters at Suds & Sisters from the very year they opened their doors at Bukit Timah. They helped groom my 2 Pomeranian brothers, Kye & Kori over the course of 15 years until they passed away last year. Now they look after Talia who was quite difficult to groom when she was a puppy. She’s thankfully since improved.
Adele, Daphne & their team are professional, meticulous, friendly & wise. They shower their doggy clients with lots of love & cuddles & provide very personalized service. Kye, Kori & now Talia always look & smell fabulous after their grooming. They genuinely care for their clients & that shines through in the accolades they receive from happy, satisfied clients. So please book your appointments in advance as they are very popular!
On a personal note, I always feel happy browsing around their clean, organized treasure cove of a shop & invariably walk out with lots of goodies for my fur babies! I love my chats with Adele & Daphne & couldn’t recommend their excellent services more highly. Thank you so much for having been such kind angels to my Pomeranians.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110512705711316766547/reviews
