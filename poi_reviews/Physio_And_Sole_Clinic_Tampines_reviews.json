She took time to assess my conditions in the first session, explained to me the issue & how to prevent it in the future.  Felicia helped me to relax the muscle in each session, I feel a lot better after each visit.   The exercises she taught me are very useful and I could see consistent improvement on my hip pain. After 5 sessions, together with practising the exercises, my pain is gone!\n\nApart from that, counter staff are very friendly, patient & quick to respond to chat.  Clinic is neat and clean, a very pleasant environment.",
