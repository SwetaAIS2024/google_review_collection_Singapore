      "text": "During 1600hrs no crowd and comfortable on a weekday. I had late lunch and early dinner(I suppose). I ordered a chicken chop and add on spaghetti(option) side order (either coleslaw or French Fried) is included beside spaghetti $1, total :$8. Tiger beer $8( weather so warm need to cool down). This eatery coffee shop have 5 Chinese stalls, one Japanese food, one Muslim food and  one western food. If you using NTUC apps,  you will be given 10 per cent discount.  Payment on app. Cash no discount. The western food i had was good, Japanese not bad(but fried stuff can be oily). Washroom one entry for lady and man (one standing cubicle one room). Washroom avg clean. Evening dinner can be crowded, especially weekend. Most stall food will sold out around 8pm. Well ventilated and two Hugh fans(nice). Table are clean too. Economical rice reasonable rice and friendly servers. Noticed the roasted Chinese stall price doesn't goes with the quantity of food orders few pieces of pathetic meats. The only stall that have very few customers",
