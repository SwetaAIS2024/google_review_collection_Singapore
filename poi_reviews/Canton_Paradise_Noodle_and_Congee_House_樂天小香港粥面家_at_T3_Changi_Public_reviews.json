Wait time could be 45 mins to an hour. Food was fantastic but staff did not pay attention upon requesting for no spring onions in the dishes.\n\nEasily overlooked on such a minor issue. Would come back again for the fantastic service and food.",

Only the side dish fried beancurd filled with fish paste was tasty and not overly greasy.\n\nService - lots of area to improve on efficiency. We came during dinner crowd, didn‚Äôt feel the sense of urgency from the serving crew to handle the crowd. Kitchen staff were very active and very busy preparing food for the busy crowd.\n\nNot worth the 15 mins waiting time in line.",
