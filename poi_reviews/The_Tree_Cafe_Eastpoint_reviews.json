      "text": "Nice looking cafe but horrible drinks.. we ordered three drinks and all were bad. Barely drank the drinks and left. A shame cos the drinks were decently priced ~$5 range.\n\nMatcha Latte: Milk was over-frothed and wayyyyy too sweet. 150% sugar?? Tasted like 3-in-1 plus more sugar.\n\nLeft 2 stars instead of 1 star cos we didn’t try their food so we’re not sure if they are good or bad. It’s a waste as the cafe has good ambience with cute swings.",

Just a normal customer which is sooo kind of him omfg he should deserve to get a raise I ordered the gay rainbow cake and the chicken chop and the food I nice too but gotta be honest the meals are quite expensive like what’s up with halal restaurants being so expensive? Do people not know how to do business is it. If the food is cheap people would want to come here every single day compared to price so damn expensive and little to no people coming here",
