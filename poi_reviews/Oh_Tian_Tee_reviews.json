      "text": "First of all, Oh Tain Tee is not the name of this coffeeshop. It’s name is actually Coffee Sense (咖啡鄉）initial post got it wrong.\n\nStrange that such a small little ulu coffeeshop in AMK can gather so many reviews.\n\nNon the less, I feel that this place is a hidden Jem. With good variety of food, clean and cooling natural wind even though it’s sunny right now.\n\nThe stalls mainly are: Indian food, porridge, carrot cake, roasted, fish soup, fish ball noodle, mix veg rice, seafood zhi char, claypot delights and western food. Not bad.",

Nice.There is a grilled store that sells Western food , a noodle, a woonton Mee store and a zi Cha store that fry vegetables or pork or fish items upon ordering. Moderate crowd on days, more crowded during weekends.",

As for breakfast you can have fried hokkian mie, minched pork noodle and simple porridge. A must try drink is lemon tea here. Simple coffee shop",
