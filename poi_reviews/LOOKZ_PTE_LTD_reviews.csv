Hong Boom,5,Irene was very prompt in replying and sharing products specifications. She was patient when I went over the shop to choose and test out their lightings. She also assisted in requesting for official supplier's plumber when there's a problem with my installation. Prices are reasonable for their items and I recommend buyers to went down and have a look.
