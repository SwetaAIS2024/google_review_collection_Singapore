Only to realize the mistake when I reached Northpoint for pick up. The lady at Northpoint was so kind and helpful to communicate with her ITE colleague. They agreed to let me pick up from Northpoint instead. So touched by her kind gesture!  Couldn‚Äôt thanks them enough for the flexibility and convenience rendered to me. üòç",
