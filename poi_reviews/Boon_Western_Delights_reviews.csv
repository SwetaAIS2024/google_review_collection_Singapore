Besharps,5,"One of the best grilled fish 🐟 I've eaten, I ordered the grilled fish for only 7 FREAKING dollars 💵, it's such a cheap price for a delicious meal. It's the stall's must try top meal and it did not disappoint. 🙂

The food was cooked fast and meal was filled with many items. 💬

The fish was soft and soaked in sour cream. It tasted really delicious and with a great mix of flavors. The fries 🍟 were crispy and the portions were just right, not too much or too little. The baked beans 🫘 were nice and hot. The coleslaw 🥗 was cold but added some nice vegetables to the meal. There are also some lettuce 🥬 hidden under the fish too.

With its fantastic price compared to other western food stalls in Singapore, I would highly recommend people to come and try the dishes especially the grilled fish. 👍

Chris Tan,4,"Have ordered on 3 different occasions and their food is pretty decent and affordable. I like the pork chop cos it’s well marinated, well cooked yet tender. You don’t have to saw the meat or chew till the cows come home (you get the idea). Fish & Chips and chicken wings were pretty decent too.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103463791737805347871/reviews

Matthew Phang,3,"Your daily neighbourhood western food stall that offers a decent variety of dishes on their menu. Ordered the lamb chop, chicken cutlet and pork chop to takeaway. Food is well cooked and tasty. Only down side is slightly overpowered by their oyster sauce marination. It would be alot better if its lighter so that we can enjoy it with the sauce, coleslaw and fries. Price is reasonable for the portion served.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116828649080542336777/reviews
Princess Mania,4,Not sure why this place was said to be permanently  closed. Ordered 2 chicken wings for $1.50 each. Fragrant with the right amount of seasoning. Enjoyed my little indulgence of fried food.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107320587807657797918/reviews
