There are too many customers here and the experience is sort of heavily dented due to the slow serving. Plus sitting at the non Aircon area while waiting for your meals is really not a good one, sweating profusely though due to the weather. Another reason why there are so many people here is because this branch is kid friendly with an indoor playground. Staff over the counter are not friendly as well. Tried to seek her service why it took more than 30 minutes for an order to be served, she brushed me off by saying there's a lot of staff who are not at work today.\n\nGo to another branch to enjoy a better McDonald's experience, this branch obviously can't handle the customer load, experience sucks to the max, Fast Food becomes SLOW food.",
