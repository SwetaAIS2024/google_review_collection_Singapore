Noor HezAin,4,"My 1st visit to Daiso (IMM) after the change of pricing. I must say, some items are still around $2 or more. Bought these 5 items for $10.90. Worth it? Yup, for SURE!
Its worth my trip here. Will definitely shop again!ðŸ¤­",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105492715591728697755/reviews

Seems like that got diff variety including camping stuff too. A bit like Korea Daiso but moreso Japan Daiso ....,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118119525043286062929/reviews
Sam Goh SE,3,"I am very disappointed with Daisol lately. Over my 5 visits, I was failed to find the item I was looking for because they no longer carry these products. Many item were suddenly discontinued. Bad shopping experience. I would rather shop at neighborhoodthan wasting my time visiting Daiso. Will not go there again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106612410197389118139/reviews
lagan chhabra,5,"I feel very happy whenever i shop at daiso. It gives me liberty to buy many things at an affordable price. For me it's atleast one time visit every months. Highly recommended.
It has an excellent collection for Christmas.

It's little different from daiso japan in terms of items and price. Buying something at 100 yen and here at $2 is itself a big transition

Must go",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104843875330849755740/reviews
GH T,1,"Bad experience with your staff Yasmine with a bad service attitude. I was there today 8 Dec at 2pm. I accidentally bought the wrong flavor of peas and just paid. I asked to change, she just say no physical receipt no way. She doesn't even try and her sulking face doesn't help. If she was friendly helpful at least I won't be as upset. Plus since people do self checkout these days and if physical receipt is needed  for exchange then shouldn't receipt be automatically dispensed?

Anyway bad experience, won't be back.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113559740409317738333/reviews
