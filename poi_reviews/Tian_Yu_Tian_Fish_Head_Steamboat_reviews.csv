just Wai,5,"Been here like almost 20times? Is in a coffee shop. When any of my familys' birthday come, we always come here to eat. The boss and head chef is from Malaysia and their Zichar is very nice compare to alot of other Zizhar place. PRICE IS CHEAPER TOO. Crowd is always there even when is late 8pm. Their cooking style is mostly Teochew.

I would recommend you all to try their Curry Fish Head. This the besr Curry Fish Head I ever eat. 10/10 must try.

Aside from Curry Fush Head, we always order their Oyster egg, Pork Rib King, Sambal Kamkong. Is all very satisfying with rice. 9/10. For all together.

Service is good and fast for a Zichar, take ard 5-10 minutes depends on the crowd. We dine in, the place is quite big, maybe like 40 to 50+ tables there.

The store receive alot of achievement too. Total is 84.40 with 4 rices.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113857140644341643606/reviews
jpm,4,"This week wife was craving for fish head steamboat so after some searching online we ended up here.

Our $40 meal for two consisted of red grouper fish steamboat, furong egg, and fried rice. Portion was quite generous as our stomach was near bursting after the meal.

This was our first time here, and we both agreed the taste was above average. Service was friendly as well. If we're in the area and craving for stir fries, this would be a place we'd come back to.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107587473700248132752/reviews
Jacelyn S,2,"Food is good, not too salty but yet still flavorful, but let me minus some stars cos of the service. Had to wait at least 1 hour for zi char which was my first time experiencing this, we could see many other customers getting frustrated as well. Staff don't seemed to be very happy working there, we could hear people in the kitchen arguing and when we asked how long would our dishes be served, one lady decided to be nasty and said ""only if they bring to me then I can serve you"". I mean, there could be a better way to say that? Don't force your unhappiness to customers just because of your internal issues.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114769422218664614069/reviews
Louise,5,"Good place to have zichar and fish head steamboat. The fish meat was tender with many cabbages and yams in the steamboat. Soup was tasty and refillable once. Price was reasonable and the service was good. The Ha Cheong Gai (prawn paste chicken) was very crispy. They gave us ice cream after dinner.

Also visited during lunch and it was till 2pm. I liked the San Lau Hor Fun (Three-tossed Flat Rice Noodles) and it was very filling.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117093153718443163460/reviews
xy S,4,"Ordered the cereal prawns, it’s uniquely flavorful, must order!  Ordered the claypot noodle, it’s ok!Chose the red grouper for the fish head steamboat, generous portions of yam, big pieces of fish, the soups gets tastier towards the end and pretty affordable for dinner!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106466641600537075664/reviews
