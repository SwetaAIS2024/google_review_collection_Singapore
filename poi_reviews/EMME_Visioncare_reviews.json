After service is really great. They gladly change the whole lens for me when I told them the vision wasn't very clear to me. Highly recommended. Will definitely go back to them if need another pair of glasses again.",

They also provide annual follow-up checks which was unheard of.\n\nFrom eyes checks to frame and lenses selection. The staff was very professional and patient. The glasses fitted very well on me. I'm very happy with the experience and purchase.\n\nThanks and keep up the good service! You deserve 5 stars.",

      "text": "Dropped by EMME recently, thinking I’d walk out with a pair of Oliver Peoples sunglasses. But after chatting with Jaycob and trying a few pairs, I ended up going with Maui Jim instead—and honestly, no regrets at all. The lens clarity is easily the best amongst other brands that I’ve tried. Jaycob was super helpful, honest with his recommendations, and didn’t really catered to my needs. I really appreciated that. Also, they’ve got a really solid range of brands. Definitely worth checking out if you’re in the market for new eyewear!",

From the moment I walked in, the staff was friendly and professional and took the time to thoroughly explain my eye health, answered all of my questions, and ensure I understood my options for corrective lenses. I felt very comfortable throughout the entire process. I also appreciated the wide selection of frames available. Overall, I highly recommend this practice for anyone in need of top-notch eye care",
