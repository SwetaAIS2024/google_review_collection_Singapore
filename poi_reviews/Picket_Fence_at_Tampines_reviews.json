No regrets sending my son to Picket Fence at all. Admin wise there was some small hiccups at the start but it was resolved professionally. Teaching and childcare wise is excellent. The teachers had big loving hearts, patience and understands children. I truly respect childcare teachers for their dedication and hard work amidst the challenges they face. Thank you Picket Fence, teachers and staff, for making my son's preschool journey an amazing one.",
