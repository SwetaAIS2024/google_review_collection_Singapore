Andreas Kevin,5,"A must try nasi lemak stall. Its quite a line, but worth it. A set cost $4, and sausage + luncheon becomes $5.4.
The crispy roasted pork rice is nice! The sauce makes it much more fragrant in terms of taste and smell. It costs $4.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106039451675387626591/reviews
Matthew Lee,3,"Mee pok was over cooked. Chilli sauce vinegar oil concoction was uninspiring. Fishballs were huge. Springy and puts up quite a fight as you sink your teeth into then. Just unfortunate that these probably been sitting in the pot for too long and has lost all that beautiful fresh fish juices and flavors.I enjoyed the soup that's been lightly sweetened by the poached fishballs.

I'd suggest, stick to noodle soup.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102172941439658597090/reviews
Hao J Y,1,"How can wanton mee taste so bad, to the extent that you put it in your mouth and say ‚Äúwhat?!‚Äù,. The vegetables taste like detergent and the chilli contains sand. There are also tiny insects flying all over your food while you are eating. Simply horrible dining experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112797272633121590228/reviews
Men Shiang Loh,4,Ate the fishball noodle. Fishballs tasted fresh n nice. Think best to order the $4 of fishballs n fish cake slices.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114090353214327272847/reviews
Jie Ying,3,"The economic beehoon stall here has a long standing queue but if you see a queue you know the food is good.

The fried chicken wing is a must to order and they also have really fragrant ikan bilis and peanut.

Their sambal chili üå∂Ô∏è is also top notch, but it‚Äôs a bit too little for me as I like my noodles super spicy.

For fried beehoon + chicken wings + ikan bilis it‚Äôs $3.50

Add one fried egg it becomes $4.90 so the pricing can be a little confusing

Teh bing + kopi bing both siew dai $3.80

Affordable and hearty breakfast!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100764552532273352219/reviews
