The pork liver was cooked perfectly and marinated very well. Soup was good too. Prices are reasonable. The coffee shop is clean as well. This is my to-go place for BCM.",

For some background, I enjoy flavourful food and this doesn‚Äôt fall short of flavourful.\n\nOrdered the Promo Set (BCM + Liver) with top up of abalone slices. Wasn‚Äôt expecting liver in the original BCM set so I ended up with A LOT of liver.\n\nFor the noodles, I got meepok. Texture was great and chewy. Sauce is flavourful; sufficiently spicy and definitely on the saltier end. The noodles and sauce on its own were so goooood. Liver in the soup was cooked to a good texture, not overcooked either. The liver dish itself was also well cooked, and the sauce is the ultimate winner!!! Albeit a tad too flavourful, I find myself enjoying this dish because of the sauce.\n\nDefinitely one of the best BCMs I‚Äôve had!",

If you add ingredients which cost $1, there will be a complimentary top-up and upsize of noodles, which I think is really a great deal. A nice surprise, the meatballs and fish balls are all handmade, it didn't taste like factory mass production. Highly recommended. Don't miss this if you are here.",

      "text": "@ Choa chu kang Blk 429 coffeeshop -\nOrdered 2 bowls of laksa, it came in small portion of white noodle, 3 pieces of fish cake, 2 really small prawns. What was terrible was the gravy which was supposed to be reasonably thick and fragrant like laksa should have, it was disappointingly diluted which affected the taste of it thereby affected my enjoyment of the noodle.\n\nEach bowl of laksa cost $4.80 which is expensive by coffeeshop standard.\n\nManagement must conduct QC periodically.\n\nSo far, E. A. T has the best laksa and it cost less per bowl.\n\nSorry that I could not help but feedback to you because I was upset with my pathetic dinner hoping that I can have a better dining experience with Chao Yuan noodle in the far future.",
