My favourite ❤️ BBQ Stingray fish

Stall : ADIMANN SEAFOCD & SATAY SPECIALIST #01-56
Opens daily and advanced ordering of Seafood/ Satay (Halal) via
Deen’s mobile : 9650 6640

Alighted a pax here and he shared that he is Chef 🧑‍🍳 working for this stall; a friend of Mr Deen, owner-brother of this friendly Halal stall that sells BBQ Seafood/ ZiChar styled of Wok Hei cooking + Satay (Chicken/ Mutton/ Beef) and I can sensed his passion of culinary … 😃😅

Parked my car in the nearest lot and located the stall and decided to have a go at their BBQ Stingray @ $18.00 c/w Rice 🍚 (for me) … 😃😅

Waited about 15-20 mins and ready served to the table as dinner crowd come in later, else it shall be buzzer/ DIY.

Well plated ! as I received my food from Mr Deen, in his tender age of 24 yrs old, whom had helped his brother 4yrs ago and had put his Culinary education on hold; this stall was originally helmed by their late Dad for more than 20yrs and now 2nd G had come on board to rein and grow the established business … 🙏🏻 😊

What’s so good 😊?
1. The powerful sweetened sambalised chillies 🌶️ had caught my taste bud 👅 in good tandem ! Hit my sweet spot hard ! Love ❤️ it ! Perfected via brother-hood rigorous R&D and even to the extend of selecting the lime 🍋‍🟩that for the bill of the spicy 🌶️, delectably great sambalised chillies 🌶️ ever ! 🥵😍 … 😯 🤩 👍 ⭐️

2. Freshness of its Stingray (careful selection of a “aged” Stingray with good thicker flesh ; the meaty  fish simply tear off easily and tasted succulent, moist freshness and spiciness all round as I squeezed the calamansi lime 🍋‍🟩 onto it + the “chin-chak-lok” with minced onions 🧅 (purple ones better and raw shall made it great 👍) … one of the good ones ! 😮 🤩 👍 ⭐️

Deen came forward to ask on their cooking and I was delighted to share my take + various pointers to make the business tick faster, better and to gain higher mindshares and the accelerated business potential ! 😃😅

Preview the curated unedited video clip + photos collage to whet your appetite and imagination !

Seeing is part of the equation, eat to believe what I have said and written !
Its repertoire Menu is aplenty ! Some signatures including Nasi Goreng + It’s delectable Satay too !

Shall come back for more in the near future ! 🙏🏻 😊

Cheers 🥂 @everyone

Fadhilah Muhamad,5,"Bought 2 set of satay from 2 different stall tonight,  just to see which one hit our taste bud 😉  in term of prices both are more or less the same.But We're definitely in loveeeee with Adimann Satay!
We reached East Coast Lagoon food Village  at almost 11pm,but impressively their satay taste fresh ,juicy and perfectly grilled!
And the best part there's lemak aka fat  in between the mutton satay. That's an absolute syioook!
The peanut sauce is a lil more to the spicy side and the peanut are more blended. Nevertheless it goes well with the chicken & mutton satay that we bought.
Thou, its late night but they still smiled and were friendly to customers 👍",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110625970072686667075/reviews

Ahmad Shahih,1,"Ordered salted fish fried rice. Rice was clumpy and cooked unevenly. The taste is off and to make it worst, it cost $8. Not worth the price. Avoid such expensive stall.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109143435444534807847/reviews
Pamela Leong,5,"Ordered an assortment of seafood and satays for a party of 16. Deen advised me on the menu and even wrapped up the food in foil to keep them warm. The portions are generous and the flavours are superb. My guests were so impressed that they asked me to recommend his stall. Will definitely patronise him again. Highly recommended! Thank you, Deen and chefs!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104238177719224967556/reviews
