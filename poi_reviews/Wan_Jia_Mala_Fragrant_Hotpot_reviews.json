      "text": "Pioneer Mall location - Bad customer service. A cashier chinese lady staff at Pioneer Mall (Koufu foodcourt) on 19/10/2024, Saturday (12:00 to 1:00 pm), I chose mala items and 1 stick of fried 3 pcs small tofu cost $1.5, with GST it will cost more. I ordered all the items with less spicy. I just asked her politely ‚Äúsorry, I don‚Äôt want only this tofu‚Äù while she‚Äôs weighing the items. Then she rudely took it out with bad attitude, shouted and complained to her kitchen chef. She acted very rude with rough manner, made it look like I‚Äôm stealing. But I buy and pay money for the food politely. Not many customers at that time. Only 2 customers including me. No respect, very rudely manner and talked to the customer. Thanks management if you can take action to that cashier staff to treat nicely to the customer and not rude.",
