Darren Cheong,3,"The mutton served in big chunks.

Surprisingly, the meat is not as hard as you would think. Very flavorful and tasty, the mutton. Hopefully I will request mutton curry sauce next time.

However, the biryani rice is not as fragrant as I expected. Its good not oily and the masala not too ""overpowering""

It's still good to pair with the mutton.

The given sauce is very ordinary, not my favorite.

The price and portion are okay - $7 SGD for mutton biryani.

Overall, I will patronize it again if I come to Farrer Road, but it's not the best biryani mutton in my book, just slightly above average.""

2nd visit is a nightmare..

The briyani rice disappointed..

The worst chicken I ever had (tasteless) .. the portion disappointed.. they use the biryani to cover the chicken to make it look bulky or a lot..",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111136407063098297690/reviews
Saifu Angto,4,"I really like the prata here.  The curry sauce is very tasty, and I usually order the plain prata which is nice and a bit crispy but they have lots of choices with the fillings for the prata.  Also serverd briyani rice, either with chicken or mutton.

Usually has a short line for breakfast but otherwise quick service.  Very reasonable price.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101827544393066516766/reviews
Ananth Pillai,5,"One of the best mutton briyani I have ever tasted. Its ranks pretty high of No.2 in my list. The rice is great, moist and fragrant. Mutton is very tender and juicy. It's simply amazing. Glad I tried it after reading other's review.
You definitely have to try this if you are in the neighborhood.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102479686734587194442/reviews

Winnie Tan,5,"I am surprised by how yummy this is!

Caveat - it is not spicy type, tho super flavourful. You literally do not need the curry gravy, tho u can save it for another day.

I ordered a lamb and chix briyani, and 3 of us had a great meal. Love how the rice is just perfectly cooked and so flavorful. I actually do not need the curry gravy or meat. Pricing is a steal.

Service is functional and it is a clean hawker centre. All good, in my books.

I do wish they have papadum. That wld make perfection.

Thank you. I will be back.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102285679136362045695/reviews
