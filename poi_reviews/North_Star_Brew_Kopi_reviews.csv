Siah Hx,4,"Visited this coffeeshop for the first time. Spacious and well ventilated. Evening time might be warm due to sun set shinning into the place. Good variety or non-muslim food and only 1 -2 stall serving muslim options.

Note the this coffeeshop is located right inside Northstar Industrial building, so yes you need to drive in, drive around (pass rows of pre-school on ur left) and you will see a coffeeshop facing AMK Ave 5.

The Carpark cost me $4.55 for about 3 hours of parking.

Washroom available on site.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103944670556353820143/reviews
Lena Ong,5,"I work in the building. Canteen is much nicer after the revamp. So patronise almost everyday for my favourite teh-O.
Some of the food that I like:
1) Malay stall Lontong
2) Lor Mee
3) Prata & Briyani
4) Hokkien Mee from the Tze char stall ( they are famous for their claypot crab noodles)

Drinks stall currently having promo. $0.80 drink for Sunday 5am-5pm for dining in only. Good deal. So I normally sit there to drink one teh-o before I go back office.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116538563501118620322/reviews
