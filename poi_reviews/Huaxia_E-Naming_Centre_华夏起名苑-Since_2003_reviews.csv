CH,1,"Engaged them for my child’s full month haircut and decided to also preserve my kid’s hair into a maobi. Haircut was done by Gracee in my home and my newborn’s head had multiple balding spots.

I thought it wasn’t too much of an issue so i just head over to their office to get it shaved once more and this time it is shaved by Monica. This time she shaved my child’s hair and left wound cuts over my child’s head. Whenever i touch my child’s head she will cry so badly in pain.

How would a mother feel about that? I then had to bring my child to see the PD. Told them
about the incident but the boss told Gracee to reply me that they can only say “sorry”. LOL

My advice is not to engage their haircut services as they don’t take any RESPONSIBILITY.
Please also maintain PDPA at all times as your staff Gracee gave my number to Monica to contact me, either that she is not allowed to go through my details as she wasn’t my salesperson that went to my house.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118099789300422933288/reviews

Abigail Kyna,1,"Its our second time there for hair cut for the second child. But the experience was so bad. Our baby wasnt asleep when the lady shaved her head, baby was turning her head to see the lady. In order to get the job done, the lady was rough and unfriendly. The first shave has left a swell mark on baby head and i briefly asked if she was putting too much pressure. She asked in returned, ""u mean i'm too rough?""
So to not worsen the experience for my baby, i allow her to finish shaving. Guess what, baby is now 9 months old with a bald spot where the swell was. After this incidenct, I will never recommended their service fo4 hair shaving anymore.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115842008807414528847/reviews
