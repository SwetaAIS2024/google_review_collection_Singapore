Recently, we are all force to convert to e-statement, i.e., every so often they will reset to e-statement and customers have to waste time resetting  it back. Looks like citi is increasingly anti-business. Since citi has sold the retail business, you might as well close you credit card business. There is no short of credit card alternatives in Singapore.",
