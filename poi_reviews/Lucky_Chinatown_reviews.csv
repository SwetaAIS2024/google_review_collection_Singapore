Ken Peh,3,"Pleasantly surprised to see that it's still here after so many decades. Used to come here during the 90s to play snooker at level 2, although right now it's already defunct and no longer there. Overall the shops are those non managed types, so keep your expectations low. Surprisingly enough, the building is very dated but internally is still very well kept and maintained, almost like the previous Peace Centre vibes.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113975004215945002265/reviews

Bear Jin,5,"As this building is part of Far East establisment, Fun Toast can collect points if minimum $20 is spent using their app. You can also use the vouchers here.
