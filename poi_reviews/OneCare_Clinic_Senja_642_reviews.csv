Sara D,1,"Been a regular at this clinic for a while. Most of the time, the doctors and staff are professional ‚Äî but once in a while, they really pull out all the stops to make sure you never forget the experience.

Incident 1:
Went in feeling a bit feverish before an overseas trip. Barely finished explaining my symptoms before the doctor, using powers unseen since biblical times, immediately declared loudly (inside the consultation room) that I must have COVID. No tests, no stethoscope, not even a thermometer glance ‚Äî just pure third-eye medical vision.
The nurse had earlier claimed my temperature was ‚Äúsuper high.‚Äù Trusting my instincts (and not the spirit medium in the white coat), I ran to another clinic. Surprise: no fever, no COVID. 10/10 diagnostic skills ‚Äî if the goal was to cause unnecessary stress.

Incident 2:
Fast forward to today ‚Äî went back to ask about wound dressing costs after neck surgery which is foreseen to takes 4-7 weeks to heal. Got quoted over $100 per session (consultation + dressing). Explained nicely that it‚Äôs out of my budget since daily dressing would easily snowball into a $4000‚Äì$5000 bill.
Instead of basic human decency, I got a smirk and a sarcastic ‚ÄúOh, is it?‚Äù followed by intimidation about how even polyclinics would ‚Äúturn me away‚Äù without an appointment. This, after I explained (and showed my hospital memo) that hospital nurses had advised me to visit clinics if polyclinics aren‚Äôt open.

Moral of the story:
‚Ä¢	Diagnoses based on gut feeling? Check.
‚Ä¢	Quoting luxury hotel rates for wound dressing? Check.
‚Ä¢	Condescending staff trained at the Ministry of Mockery? Check.

If you enjoy high prices, wrong medical calls, and being looked down on when you‚Äôre already vulnerable, this place will absolutely exceed your expectations.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114777855304153790882/reviews
