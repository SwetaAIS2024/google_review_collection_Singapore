Zuriel Mamba,3,"Gotten the deep dish pizza which was a collab with Gino's east of Chicago. I would think the flavour was decent. Also had their pasta, which seemed to be better than what Tenderfresh was offering. The pasta however were too soft to our likings.

Service team was great, apart from been prompt, they were always on a lookout to attend any query by customers.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100097027827819745483/reviews
Desmond Ling,3,"I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken Chop Sedap, mushroom soup, and the Lucky Set (fried chicken with fries). The chicken chop was decent, though I wish the rice had more flavour. The chilli sauce was a letdown. It lacked spiciness and that extra kick. On the bright side, the mushroom soup came with plenty of mushrooms, so it didnâ€™t taste like the typical canned version. The fried chicken was alright, but I remember it being crispier and better in the past. One thing I appreciated was the spacious seating, which is great for dining in large groups.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118122593035844072843/reviews
Jack,4,"Of all the chicken we had here, Best chicken is the teriyaki really tender and well seasoned. The roasted spring chicken is 2nd best, very savoury as well. Fried chicken is a bit dry and the portion is quite small. The mushroom soup pasta are quite average though. Overall is quite good, though it may not be the most healthy ðŸ˜†",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288565584051666357/reviews
Dexter Tan,5,"Come here for the Deep Dish Pizza! It is a standout in terms of crust and taste. Rich fresh tomato paste with thick fillings of cheese and a thick crispy crust which is baked to perfection. Definitely one of the best pizzas I have tried, would rate this as one of the top two pizza places in Singapore. There is a 20-30 cooking time but it's worth the wait!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112720249848826724900/reviews
nathaniel shi,1,The bbq wings ordered are soggy. Noticed the chef simply placed the bbq wings that were prepared into the microwave oven to heat up. Will not recommend anyone.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104065005689649707079/reviews
