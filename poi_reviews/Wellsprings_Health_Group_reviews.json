He gives pretty accurate diagnosis and some of his remedies are unconventional but works.  For eg, I could not lift up my arm for months after one accident and surgery.  He just told me to do cardio exercises and strangely enough, I was able to lift up after that.  He does not seems to be after money as well as he sometimes consult for free if he sees no further intervention needed during the consultation.",

The first time I came, I had some sport injury and could barely walk. I literally limped here after I was given some recommendation from a friend. A few (albeit very painful!) minutes later, I was walking perfectly normally! His magic hands restored my legs, really made the $60 (which included medication) seemed like the best money I've ever spent.\n\nHighly recommended!",

      "text": "Been seeing him for sometime now and he has become our family physican. We brought staff, colleagues and relatives as well as guests from overseas to see him too. He is not a simple tcm but he is the real deal. He can take your pulse and tell you what is wrong with you. We have a staff who went to see him due to very bad swollen ankle and he took her pulse and told her it was an old knee injury that caused that, fixed a 7 year old problem in half a minute, finally can walk. He is a very good doctor who doesn't need a long time to fix an issue. He is a tad expensive but he works. No point paying $15-30 each session to see a tcm 20 times and still not solved and requires long term treatment. I rather pay $25-35 to fix it (do note that if you buy his medical creams and medication it is expensive BUT it works for those treatment we spend $40-90 but his medical creams are very good that we bought a large jar for few hundred dollars and it still lasting and fixed many pains from an accident. Even give away to a cleaner some creams because of swollen foot which we gave her money to see him but she pocketed the money and didn't show up for appointment sigh) We used to have long term pains and sprains and muscles issues that no other tcm doctor could do for us over the yearsssss trust us we saw alot of tcm and many bascially give us weekly needle poking which helps for awhile and comes back again but going to Dr Wong for years old problem is being fixed in seconds. I have food allergies problem and sinus problems that he is fixing because i am a snorer and so far my volume and frequency has been reduced. Had a few times due to water retention (from whiplash accident) was unable to walk and last month went to see him once as had very painful knees and was diagnose due to exhaustion (for the exhaustion consultation he didnt charge me) Very thankful for this doctor",
