Jolene,3,"poor service in the day, fast service at night. food is good.
Be wary of bait and switch, the prices charged do not match what is shown on the menu, and they mysteriously cannot ""find"" an itemized receipt when i requested for it immediately after making payment. portions are small. expect to be ignored and treated like an afterthought when you dine in, in the afternoon. pratas are made fresh and not too oily. order of butter chicken is meager and you get charged a lot more despite getting a small saucer.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100232303880929998347/reviews
Loki,5,"Nice little eatery serving affordable and good Indian Muslim food. Love their pratas, soft and not too crispy / dry. Their chicken and fish curry are both pretty good as well.

Do note that they actually close the kitchen at 10pm, though youâ€™re welcome to sit there while they clean up.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101937176024039442948/reviews
