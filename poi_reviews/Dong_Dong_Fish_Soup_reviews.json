      "text": "The worst sliced fish I ever had in Singapore.\nWe ordered Double Fish Thin Bee Hoon with milk and Fresh Fish Thick Bee Hoon without milk.\n1) The cook was looking around for 3 mins before telling us he does not know where the thin bee hoon is. We changed the order to noodles instead.\n2) The portion given to us looks little. We gave our feedback to the aunty, only to be told it was instructions from their boss.\n3) They forgotten to add milk even after repeated for 3 times. It was only added after it was served in the bowl.\nWill never patronize this stall again.",
