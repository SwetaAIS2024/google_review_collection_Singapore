M *,3,"Nestled in Asia Square Food Court, the Vietnamese food stall has a simple ordering system. The rice with grilled pork and the dry noodles with chicken were just average. They didn‚Äôt taste as authentic as other Vietnamese restaurants. The pork didn‚Äôt look very appealing in one look. Considering the price is higher because of the location, expected it to be better. It still tasted good, but it was just ordinary. Lots room for improvement",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103330821176864508073/reviews
Potato Head,3,"I don‚Äôt expect Pho here was good but surprisingly pretty good and price was acceptable.
Quite a lot of beef , well blanched noodle and light but flavourful soup.
But service was nothing I think they trained not to talk to customers even not busy.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113658781384736931614/reviews
T Ng,5,"Pretty authentic southern Vietnamese food, the availability of chili-oli sauce (Sa T·∫ø) is a good indicator. Besides well-known beef noodle (a.k.a Ph·ªü), I‚Äôd highly recommend to try crispy chicken noodle dry as video attached.
Self-order, the queue is always long but service is pretty efficient.
The only downside is the order machine is often out of paper, so no receipt. You better take a picture of your order number after making payment. I almost collected a wrong order as the other one looked so yummy than mine üòÅ",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109937259740657468638/reviews
felfelfel,5,Highly recommend the five spice chicken vermicelli!! Very flavorful and yummy. The chicken ratio to the vermicelli is perfect & spring roll is very yummy too.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100140753618832548593/reviews
Yingying,4,Huge bowl of chicken pho - Waited almost 30 minutes for this. Their queue system was abit confusing for me. The soup was good but not worth the wait tbh. Would try out something else in the menu when there‚Äôs a shorter queue.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117289079780130956871/reviews
