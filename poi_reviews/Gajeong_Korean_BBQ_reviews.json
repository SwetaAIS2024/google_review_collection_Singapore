      "text": "A Korean bbq place found on the second floor of Hougang RiverCourt. We ordered the chicken, beef and lamb set which came with a side of Korean steamed egg as well as a choice of soup, in which we picked the seafood tofu stew. The banchan and lettuce were refillable. The kimchi was spot on for me and it went well with the meat and other condiments. The set was meant for 2-3 people but for us two it was super filling and we did not manage to finish all the food. Although the total bill totalled $70+ , I believe that it was pretty worth the price. Will return with more people in the future.",

If you look for genuine review please read this.\n\nOverall the meat is ok : 3/5 (fresh yet portions is ok)\nSeafood stew: 2/5 (Maggie taste better than this, super light taste like water put seafood only)\nSteamed egg: 3/5 (passed )\n\nNot worth the money cause taste like food court Korean food and the meat is the only plus point.",

You can taste the sea! The prawns were big and fresh.\nThe steam egg surprised me with very nice \"wok hey\"! Love it!\nThe ban chan were lovely too! The kimchi is good here! The kids love the ikan billis.\nThe spicy chicken rice and bibimbap were not bad too.\nThe seafood pancake is good!! Crispy at the edge and soft in the middle! I look forward to trying the kimchi pancake next time.\nI'll be back!!",

      "text": "I recently visited Gajeong Korean BBQ at the newly opened Hougang Rivercourt and was thoroughly impressed. We ordered two lunch sets: the Kimchi Ramen (beef) and Bulgogi. The Bulgogi came in a surprisingly large portion, and the beef servings in both dishes were very generous. The Kimchi Ramen was flavorful and satisfying, perfectly complemented by the tender beef.\n\nTo our delight, the bill came as a pleasant surprise‚Äîboth lunch sets were heavily discounted to just S$8.90 each during the lunch hour. The staff were friendly and helpful, and the restaurant itself was clean and comfortable, making for an enjoyable dining experience. Gajeong Korean BBQ is also Halal-certified, making it an excellent option for Muslim diners. Overall, I highly recommend this place for its delicious food, generous portions, and affordability. Definitely worth a visit!",
