      "text": "The restaurant's beginnings of Sunday afternoon was slow, with only one table occupies. We were greeted and seated immediately with the accomodating server.\n\nWe ordered two of their 10 SGD Sunday Promo Pizzas: one 4 Cheese Pizza and the other Chilli & Sausage Pizza. Total came to 24 SGD (inclusive of 10% service charge and 9% G.S.T.). Serving time was eighteen minutes from the moment we placed our order.\n\nBoth pizzas taste great, with the Chilli & Sausage Pizza having a kick in spice, but I would call this expensive, as all the restaurants in the area.",

It‚Äôs got cold beer at reasonable price for orchard, it‚Äôs got a fairly quiet and comfortable environment, it‚Äôs got a decent selection of hard liquor (not expansive), it‚Äôs got izakaya food???? That‚Äôs weird for a pub. But it does checks all the marks for neighbourhood watering hole. The beer is poured well and cold.",
