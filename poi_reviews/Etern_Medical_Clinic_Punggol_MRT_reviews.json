      "text": "I had an appointment for my second vaccine dose and arrived 5 minutes early. After informing the front desk, I was simply told to 'take a seat.' I assumed everything was in order, but after waiting for 40 minutes, I checked again‚Äîonly to find out that my registration was never processed.\n\nThe first staff member who initially attended to me was more focused on chatting with a colleague than ensuring proper registration. This oversight caused an unnecessary delay and wasted my time. Thankfully, another staff member quickly assisted me once the mistake was realized, and I received my vaccine within 5 minutes.\n\nWhile I appreciate the efficiency of the second staff member, I‚Äôm disappointed by the lack of professionalism from the first. I hope the clinic improves its procedures to ensure patients with appointments don‚Äôt face such delays due to staff negligence.",

      "text": "I have had mixed experiences with this clinic. In times of urgency, we have sought their care, but after several visits, I find myself hesitant to return. Recently, I called the clinic to clarify a matter that I was frustrated with myself about.\n\nI took my six-year-old child to the clinic, hoping to get clearance from a possible HFMD case, unaware of a single ulcer at the back of his throat. The doctor I saw (I don‚Äôt recall his name) explained the possibility of HFMD before examining my child. At that moment, I was ready to leave rather than incur a significant fee unnecessarily. I believe it would have been helpful if the doctor had informed me upfront that as long as symptoms were present, clearance wouldn‚Äôt be possible. That way, I could have simply taken my son home to wait it out instead of proceeding with the consultation.\n\nAfter the consultation which went on without a choice since I did not speak up, the doctor asked if I needed any medication, and I declined. At the nurse's counter, I was asked again, but it was not explained that declining medication would result in a minimum charge of $10. Had I known, I could have chosen a medication costing $5 and avoided that extra fee. While the clinic is not obligated to explain this, a simple clarification would have been helpful. In the end, I paid an additional $10 on top of the consultation fee, which totaled $49.50.\n\nI take responsibility for my own decision, but I do feel the doctor could have advised me to wait and return only if symptoms persisted. Clearer communication from both the doctor and the staff would have made for a much better experience.\n\nI have spoken with one of the nurses when I called in few weeks back.",

And I decided to take up the Health Screening Package. He did an excellent job during the blood taking. No pain at all.\nDr Tim Hart is so nice, patient and has a sense of humour too! It is so comfortable talking to him during the visit. And all the staff there are friendly and polite too.\nNow I know why all the reviews are good here at this clinic.\nThank you again üòä",
