Dominic Koh,5,"Love to swim at the hotel pool and dine beside Restaurant Pool Grill located Level 5. And the Gym at Level 4 with all range of workout equipments including a basketball court.  As for dining,  love the buffet from breakfast,  lunch high tea to dinner. Especially on Thursday with free flow of house wine. After mid-night if you are hungry,  Crossroad Cafe is the best restaurant for all. With wide variety of dishes and drinks. Love their welcome bread served before meals. Best bread ever tasted.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100009389345810354694/reviews
Anne Dcruz,5,"Why would you shop online only when you have the pleasure of seeing beautiful merchandise in a beautiful store?

I  would definitely recommend a visit to Tangs.

For ladies, you will be spoilt for choice among the aisles of dresses. And of course lots of cosmetic brands to choose from.

I was also impressed with the Kids Department.

As for the Household Department, it  has always been famous at Tangs.

You will be able to admire all the beautiful merchandise even if you are only window shopping. Enjoy!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101409446439811298104/reviews
