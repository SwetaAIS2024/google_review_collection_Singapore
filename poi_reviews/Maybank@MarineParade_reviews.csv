Connie Koh,1,Service here is really bad. Queue no says no customer in front but I have already waited more than half hour. Donâ€™t know how the queue system works.

Ram Ramchandani,4,"The bank is not so crowded unlike the local banks. I read negative reviews about the bank. My my experience was good - within one hour and 15 minutes of taking a queue number, i got my account opened, got an ATM debit card and was assisted in downloading the APP and setting up and given basic briefing on using the App. It was unusually fast and with good friendly service.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102886607939996688677/reviews
