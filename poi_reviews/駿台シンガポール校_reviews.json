      "text": "I am a graduate. I attended Sundai Singapore School for six years in middle and high school. I was particularly impressed by the extensive study rooms. The study rooms were available from morning to night, and were quiet and well-equipped to help me concentrate, allowing me to study efficiently. The instructors were always kind and answered my questions accurately, so I felt reassured knowing that I could solve my doubts on the spot. They also provided thorough support for career guidance and mock exams, clearly showing me the path to passing the school of my choice. The six years I spent studying hard with friends who shared the same goal were an irreplaceable experience for me. I wholeheartedly recommend Sundai Singapore School to anyone who wants to receive high-quality Japanese-style education overseas!",
