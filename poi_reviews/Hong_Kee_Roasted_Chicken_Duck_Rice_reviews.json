      "text": "Chance upon this stall selling roast meat in a coffeeshop at sims drive. Initially came to this area to try other food but stall was closed upon reaching. Walked around and found this roast meat joint at the coffeeshop. Realised that they are in the same coffeeshop as the very popular stall selling laksa.  From their display, they sell a variety of items such as roast duck, charsiew, roast pork and chicken rice as well.\n\nHad the combination of roast duck and charsiew (SGD$5) and it comes with a bowl of soup. Both the charsiew and the roast duck wasnâ€™t dry nor tough and was flavorful. Portion considered quite generous.\n\nSeems like a popular stall, noticed many people takeaway from their shop. Overall, food was decent and would recommend.",
