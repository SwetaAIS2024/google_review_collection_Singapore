You could spice it up with their chili flakes and pretty generous chunks of beef given. Friendly service and food was served super quick! Satisfied my cravings.",

Choice of yellow noodles, bee hoon or kway teow, I had a choice of just plain beef or mixes with offal. Of course, I chose mixed. Beef was nice and tender, although not melt in your mouth. The offal was well done too. Don't forget the condiments to enhance your flavour!",

But the soup was pretty tasty.\n\nThe price was also on the high side at SGD8 per bowl.",

I first tried this place over a decade ago, and let me tell you, their commitment to quality hasn’t aged a day. It’s like a time capsule of deliciousness that keeps delivering, year after year. Whether you're a loyal fan or a first-timer, this spot knows how to keep your taste buds coming back for more.",
