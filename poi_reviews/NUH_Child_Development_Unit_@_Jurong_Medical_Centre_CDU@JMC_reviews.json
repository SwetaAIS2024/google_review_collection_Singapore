      "text": "I am writing to share feedback about a recent experience at your clinic with Dr. Mulay Kalyani Vijaykumar. While I understand that dealing with young, uncooperative children can be challenging, I was disappointed by the unprofessional behavior displayed during the consultation.\n\nSarcastic Remarks: Dr. Mulay made inappropriate and sarcastic comments in front of me as a parent, which was both unprofessional and disheartening.\nInaccurate Diagnosis: The diagnosis given appeared to be made without thorough consideration and was later confirmed to be incorrect. This led to unnecessary stress and wasted time seeking additional medical opinions.\n\nI believe that healthcare professionals should approach patients and their families with empathy and professionalism, regardless of the challenges presented. I am sharing this feedback in the hope that it helps improve the quality of care provided to other patients in the future.",
