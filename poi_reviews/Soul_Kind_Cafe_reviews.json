      "text": "Some incredible Japanese movies and anime show the detailed cooking process and baking simple things in the kitchen! For whatever reason, curry-based chicken rice has always stood out to me!\n\nSpotting that particular option on the cafe's menu nearby left me with no choice but to take it immediately. I didn't regret the outcome since it was delicious paired with the lemon tea!\n\nThe local Asian delights section also has some cool stuff, and I hope to choose those items later! Kudos to the friendly personnel and team behind the simple magic experience!",

      "text": "Yummy veg/ vegan food in this cafe. Like that it’s in the west & pretty affordable!\n\nFor 2 people, we shared the healthy miso hotpot ($18.90) and the butter cream mushrooms ($13.90). Hotpot soup was yummy and wholesome. Would totally get again. Mushroom portion was huge and a bit heavy after a while, need to share with perhaps more than 2 people. Ambience is p good, their staff, Ling, is also kind and helpful.",

Seated on a baby seat, eating her food, the lady flipped at my child making a mess. My helper offered to clean up however that didn’t please them.\nUpon completion of our dinner, the lady in the picture went ahead to whine and complain of how the baby chair was. The service staff went ahead to slam the baby chair and was angrily cleaning it.\nIf you don’t want children dining in, indicate at your webpage or your front door.\nDon’t provide subpar food and tsk at my kids.\n\nFood was not great and will never return.",
