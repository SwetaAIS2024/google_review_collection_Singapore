      "text": "If Justice is best served cold, then this fried rice is best served hot. Because the juiciness and tenderness of the pork chop only last while it is hot. So do eat the fried rice here fresh and hot, instead of take away and enjoy its special chili that charges extra if you want more. It is a special chili made of fried garlic with chili sauce which is not found elsewhere and makes you crave for more. Truly a store that deserves a 5 star for its food.",

      "text": "Fried rice with pork chop at $7.2.\n\nGenerous portion of pork chop. Pork chop is tender and juicy. Very well marinated.\n\nEgg fried rice taste is average, less fragrant.\n\nChilli adds some kick to the dish, especially to the fried rice to enhance the lack of fragrance.\n\nOverall, I find the rice and pork chop a little oily. But still this fried rice is above average and serve relatively fast after order.",
