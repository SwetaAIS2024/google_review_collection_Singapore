She will suggest the most basic steps needed for your skincare routine, and if you stick to it, you will see your results. Also, the best part is, she doesn't sell any of her expensive treatments or products unless you ask for it, or if it's absolutely necessary. My acne and old acne spots have healed tremendously with some basic products.",
