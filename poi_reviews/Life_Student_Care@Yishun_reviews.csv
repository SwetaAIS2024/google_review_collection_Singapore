Jin Hoe Lian,5,"What initially appealed to me about Life Student Care was its spacious layout compared to other student care facilities in shophouses or malls. I wanted my son to have a comfortable environment after a long day at school. However, it was the teachers who became the deciding factor. I found them to be sincere and friendly. If you don't believe me, just strike up a conversation with any one of them! After my son was enrolled, I realized that there were volunteers conducting lessons and organizing activities for the kids frequently, which I found to be amazing. I'm glad we made the right choice; the teachers exceeded our expectations. Thank you, teachers and volunteers! üôèüèª",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105444787182175150524/reviews
