For example, one section of the rooms has been experiencing frequent MCB tripping during peak hours — more than 50 times a day for the past 3 months — and it is still not fixed. The toilet seats are extremely stained and unusable. The rooms lack proper ventilation, resulting in high humidity levels (over 90%), which is causing health issues for the occupants.",

They are under renovation. I think after they made changes then it will be better. At least the shower and toilet is new. But the piping not good. As we are staying ground floor, upper floor water in the shower came to our floor. Can sighted the foam and water.",

Didn't have a bad experience at all thankfully.",
