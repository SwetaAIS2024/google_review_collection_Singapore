I traveled all the way here specifically to meet a human teller because the staff at the Bangkit branch previously informed me that I needed an ATM card, which I do not possess. When I called the hotline, I was advised to visit the counter directly, but upon arriving here, I was told to schedule an appointment.\n\nPlease work on bringing human back to neighbourhood branch so I do not have to spent money to travel to another place to get rejected.",

Fast forwarding currently after festive season, the queue is not heavy. Thus depending on when you came down, I did the transactions in less than 10mins. So people, be appreciative",

When we reached home and tried to apply online, only opening of joint-alternate account option given. No joint-all account option. Asked chatGPT and they mentioned to visit the bank branch to open a joint-all account. So what now??? Wasted my leave just for all this shit and ended up not opening any joint account at all. I will go for other banks instead.",

I came from bukit panjang branch an hour ago before heading to cck cause what i needed wasn’t available there since that branch doesn’t have any over the counter service/ printing what i needed. I rushed to the cck branch and expected to wait like 30 mins-1 hour. When i arrived, your employee Seow woah yun, attended to me and she knew what i needed based on my explanation and she printed and gave me what i need, all in less than 5 mins. I would recommend going to this branch with the good customer service i have experienced :) thank you so much!!",
