Dr Tan was very thorough and detailed in his examination. The nurse who took my ECG was also very patient, helpful and kind.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100017293759804919287/reviews

Kenny Lim,1,"I accompanied my wife to this clinic, served by a male doctor. Very bad service, don’t even greet and look at the patient while diagnosing. TBH, not professional at all. The female counter assistant quite unprofessional, bad sitting posture and ‘ bo chup’ attitude.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107865876508803658380/reviews
Ain Hussin,3,"For 3 years I’ve been seeing Dr Winston. He’s been nice and attentive towards my needs. However, today I brought my helper to the clinic. She was seen by Dr See Shean Yaw. He is one of the rudest Dr with lack of mannerism I have seen in any clinic I’ve been to. He is totally not attentive towards all concerns raise. He raised his voice towards us when we asked question. He frowns a lot and keep passing remarks each time we answer his question. I seriously do not want to see him if he ever run the clinic again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103959205220520545558/reviews
Chin Chu Bin,1,"My helper went to this clinic for the regular checkup by MOM on 27 March 2pm.
Need to draw my helpers blood and is at first done by the 2 assistant at the counter .
They tried TWICE and failed .
After which they called the doc n made my helper quene AGAIN to wait for the doc .

The doc also need to try TWICE before successfully draw her blood .
I can’t believe a simple blood drawing needs 4 attempt .

Pls do avoid . Thanks .",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113866973931710344484/reviews
