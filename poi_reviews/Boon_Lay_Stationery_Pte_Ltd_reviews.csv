Timoteus 28,1,"TLDR: They sent a cheaper item without my consent because the item I ordered is out of stock

1. Seller did not update the stock accordingly and thus told me stock was unavailable AFTER I placed the order.

2. Seller offered to change the brand of the item but DID NOT WAIT FOR MY REPLY and went ahead to change the brand WITHOUT MY CONSENT.Â  There is a late shipment rate and I believe they were more concerned about the seller penalties for not shipping the order or time or cancelling the order from their end.

3. Seller claimed that the other brand was more expensive and did not charge me more, but a search on other sellers show that the other brand was cheaper by 40 cents per ream. If other sellers are able to sell it cheaper, it means that the cost price would have been cheaper. It is not a matter of authorised seller. And now, they have a discount where each ream is $4.20 (min order 5 reams, I ordered 8) as compared to the price of $4.50 I paid.

4. I did not refund it because it is too bulky. It was 8 reams of 500pages of paper that is extremely heavy, possibly >15kg.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117891905623186748081/reviews

Alan Koek,5,"The corporate office here sells wide range of stationery in Tuas. Quite a strategic location amongst industrial area and next to Gul Circle MRT, especially when your office runs out of papers etc. Lifesaver!
