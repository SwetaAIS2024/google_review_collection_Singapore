Her hospitality was unmatched, and she went above and beyond to help me understand the perfect mix of sauces, meats, and toppings to elevate my order. If you’re ever unsure what to get, Nancy’s your go-to. She doesn’t just serve food—she serves an experience!",

Usually we go to the one near our house.\nOrdered our fave & the servings with sauces & sides were generous here & the lady staff Nancy was friendly and very fast in preparing my order. Yummy pulled lamb burrito & daily bowl! Will definitely come to this branch whenever possible!",

This outlet always gives very little portion, and inconsistent. Very disappointed. The staffs dont look inviting either, sometimes when i am thinking of what ingredients to get because the ones that i want are sold out, they will give the unhappy look.",

I’ve always been approached with unfriendly staff and the portion given today was so little compared to usual. I ordered a daily bowl chicken and she didn’t asked what I wanted and straightaway took the veggies and put into my bowl. I was frustrated because she didn’t asked me what I wanted and spoke in an unfriendly manner. It just seemed like she didn’t want to work there. The previous time I told myself not to buy from this outlet again but I wanted to give a try once more to see if they made any changes but no, it gone from bad to worse. This is just my personal experience, I wouldn’t come back to the store again.",
