Jaziz V,1,"Very unhygienic. The shop is filled by pigeons by day that are allowed to stay all over the provisions . When the shop closes by night, the vegetable section outside the store is a haven for rats and other vermin. They have recently worsened the billing experience by segregating their products which is highly disorganized and inconvenient. The staff have poor service etiquette resulting in a poor customer experience.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106008127377502960817/reviews
