There is an air conditioned area.\nService 3.8/5. Staff were friendly and attentive. Ordering system needs to be updated.\nPrice 3/5. Breakfast promo is a good deal. Ala carte is a bit pricey as expected for restaurants.",

However, food preparation was slow. My chicken murtabak was only served at 2.40pm. Took photo of all the food menu while waiting for the food. Need some patience if want to dine in here. Overall the food is nice.",

Asked them to redo for me...they do mushroom prata only so funny. Then the new auntie staff still say she asked if they can redo mushroom prata only. Mushroom prata without cheese is disgusting. She even tried to convince me that mushrooms prata itself is yummy that she likes too. Omg until I spat out and left me with no appetite. Paid 9.40 and left the place without eating much. Boss not in that's why. Not the first time they screw up orders but definitely the most disappointing experience.",

Ordered Briyani, and it came with a huge \"mountain\" of rice, and instead of chicken on the rice,  the chicken was served in a separate bowl and was soaked with curry to the brim of the bowl. It is heavenly for curry lovers. Recommended.",

Service staff also angry with each other. Rather choose another place to eat. Their chapati wasn't heated up hot. Channa was nice.",
