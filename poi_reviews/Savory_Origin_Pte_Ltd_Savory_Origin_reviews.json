      "text": "Best otah. It’s ‘bouncy’ characteristic makes it a rare find. Most otah is ‘flat’ and hardened and taste of too much coconut milk.  Lim Luan Seng otah really tastes just like...old school otah. Especially fresh from the grill... sedap! You can order freshly grilled otah directly from the factory at defu Lane for minimum 10 sticks (for a quick snack), at a good price, and pick up within 10min.",

      "text": "Will be moving to Bedok in 2019. Incase the new address is not reflected, please call to ask. Their actual opening hours are Mon-Sat 0700-1800hrs. However as the first hour is dedicated to sorting out truck deliveries, they request that Public comes at 8am, or at least wait till 7:30am. Out-of-office hours e.g. wee hours of the morning, can be arranged. Just call.\n\nFood is affordable and convenient. Takes all the hassle out of preparing a feast. Prices are available online so no 'shocks' and disappointments after ordering. I have been buying for years.",
