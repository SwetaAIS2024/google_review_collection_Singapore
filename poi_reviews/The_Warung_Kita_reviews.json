The service was excellent as well.\n\nWe visited for lunch and ordered the Kambing rendang, Ayam Rendang, and Korean Cheese Noodles. We enjoyed all the dishes, though the lamb was a bit tough. However, the flavors were delicious!",

      "text": "We decided to visit this restaurant after seeing their paid collaboration with a KOL on TikTok. The place itself is undeniably pretty‚Äîcozy interior, aesthetic setup‚Äîso we were a little surprised to see how quiet it was when we walked in.\n\nWe ordered a Spaghetti Carbonara for me, and my husband went for the Fried Chicken Chop with Truffle Fries. For drinks, we had Orange Juice and Apple Asam Boi. It took around 15‚Äì20 minutes just for the drinks to arrive, even though the restaurant wasn‚Äôt busy.\n\nWhen the drinks came, my husband‚Äôs orange juice tasted like watered-down Tropicana Twister‚Äîlike it had been diluted two or three times. Not ideal.\n\nThe food came out in parts. My Carbonara arrived first. It was okay‚Äînothing special, just decent comfort food. But my husband had to wait another 20‚Äì30 minutes for his meal, which unfortunately came burnt. The lighting inside was dim, but even the camera picked up how charred the food looked. The truffle fries were overly oily and lacked the flavor we‚Äôve come to expect from similar dishes elsewhere.\n\nOur bill came to RM77 for two. For the tastewise, wait time, and overall experience, we left feeling disappointed. Unfortunately, we won‚Äôt be returning.",

Surprisingly, even a simple dish like carbonara exceeds our expectations. Shiny, creamy, al dente well seasoned pasta. One of the best place to have assam pedas too. Service people are excellent, attentive to our needs. Beautiful aesthetic insta-worthy decor, nice music, kid-friendly, ample carpark, clean. Menu does not have overwhelming variety but they keep updating their menu which is refreshing! Drinks here are good too! Would love to gatekeep, but here‚Äôs the review.",

      "text": "Brought my family to The Warung Kita for breakfast, and it turned out to be a great start to the day! They offer a breakfast buffet at RM24, but it‚Äôs not your typical self-service style. Instead, you order your dishes, and they‚Äôre freshly prepared and served to your table‚Äîa nice touch that keeps the experience more personal.\n\nThe food? Simply delicious, especially the sambal, which really stood out. Every bite was packed with flavor, and I couldn‚Äôt resist ordering more after every dish. Let‚Äôs just say my wife wasn‚Äôt too amused by my endless stream of orders‚Äîshe gave me that look. Hahaha!\n\nThe in-laws were happy, which is always a win. They enjoyed the food and the overall atmosphere. It‚Äôs safe to say this place has earned a spot on our ‚Äúmust revisit‚Äù list.",
