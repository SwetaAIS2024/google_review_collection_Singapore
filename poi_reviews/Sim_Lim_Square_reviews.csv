Mart,5,"A tech nerds MUST destination! If your into Tech. Gaming,computers,MAC, iPhones, projectors, laptops, speakers, headphones, SSD,HDD’s,NAS, AV amps, gadgets in general, or simply need your device repaired on the quick this place is for you ! 6 floors of tech shops catering to all, you could spend a fortune in here if you were inclined, I personally found prices varied but generally were 5/10% below RRP and I didn’t find any counterfeit items but then again I wasn’t looking for them. They had big worldwide brands in abundance, even had on the shelf stock of the 5000 series graphics cards reasonably priced too !, some second hand devices in bulk could be purchased too like commercial grade printers, screens, empty shells of what was working iMacs etc for spares…Not the place at all for your “average joe” non tech guy at all! this isn’t by any means a normal commercial shopping centre.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104198879117472291826/reviews
Jason Ho,5,"I didn't visit sim lim square for more than 6 months, went there to purchase a dvd karaoke player, ended up shopping for a laptop and other accessories. Most of the shop staff are helpful and doesn't push sales, business was quiet. Managed to brought a laptop hp elite book at a good price, went down to the food court, lots of nice food, there's also subway and Vietnamese food. Hope to visit there again this week to get more great deal. Its time to help the business there. Lots of great deal on the poster as well.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100671609464746874118/reviews
usman shaikh,3,"Spacious multistory mall that brings almost all peripherals and new articles about electronic gadgets.
Clean neat and AC is also good. Prices are not competitive. If you are going for window shopping, remember eateries are not nearby, you have to walk Infront of street and go to Bugis market for proper food.
And if you are really willing to buy something go prepared n study the rates before going.
Going there is very easy and approachable if you are willing to walk, the nearest is Jalan Besar MRT on blue track, otherwise Bugis MRT on green track is also nearby. People coming from Bencoolen on blue track can also reach there.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112757541418460251428/reviews
CK C,4,"This shopping mall is probably the largest congregation of computer shops (for used and new, computers and parts) in Singapore. There are also shops selling cameras and other electronics, especially at the ground floor, but they have a reputation of scamming tourists. Eateries are available at the second floor and basement.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
