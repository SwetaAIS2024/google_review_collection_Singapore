Wilbur Lim,5,The roasted duck is seriously the best i had in at least 5 years. Its tender and the danggui flavour is spot on. They allow you to take the “meat drippings’ sauce too!!! Excellent!,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114395265825574258547/reviews
Ribeye,5,"Hidden gem towards the back of an unassuming coffeeshop away from the main road.
Well known for their Dang gui (Chinese herb) seasoned roast duck. The beautifully roasted duck comes ladled with a sweet noxious herbal concoction of a sauce which elevates the richness of the fatty duck meat.
Their roast pork is also crispy and worth trying.
Got there around their close of business hours so the meats were understandably a little dried out and noodles weren't available.
Will better plan the revisit to enjoy the duck at its finest.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108129213100021627372/reviews
Choon T,5,"Rather old school kind of coffee in this area. Uncle has operated here for a long time. It gets busy during lunchtime.

Roasted 当归 duck was delicious and not overpowering the flavours of the duck. The roasted pork belly skin was super crispy and overall the meats here were fantastic!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114720035040328969753/reviews
Benjamin T P Tan (btptan),4,"Excellent Dang Gui roasted duck. Good Sio Bak. Not bad char siew but sausage was of the ""healthier choice"" variety. We would have preferred it to be the #HappierChoice type - i.e. unabashedly MORE FAT!

The hor fun (""ipoh kway teow"" version as is the norm for roast meat stalls) was excellent too in that it was done still stretchy with some bite as opposed to boiled till a mushy texture that rivals mee sua in some other stalls.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102383274760996797437/reviews
Yu-Ming,5,"Opposite the chi-chi Mondrian and surrounded by Michelin-star restaurants is a modest coffee shop with good duck rice, Thai mookata (hot plate/hot pot) and a new Thai zi char stall with affordable and tasty Thai stir fry. If you prefer less spicy Tom Yum, the Thai zi char does one that even children can enjoy. The deep fried sea bass with mango salad is fresh and has no odor (for those with sense palates). The service is warm; the chef came out to chat with us. He said they serve local stir fry on request. We will come again, with friends and family.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107190010094503178371/reviews
