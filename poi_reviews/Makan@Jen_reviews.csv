Lam Tan,4,"Came for the 1 for 1 dinner promo....
Hotel and restaurant atmosphere is good...clean...
Dining time from 6.30pm to 9.30pm...
Staffs are friendly and nice...especially Charlene...
Buffet spread is not so wide....
Cordial fruit drinks are available at the dispenser machine...
Starting with some fried rice, noodles, etc...
The grilled fish sambal seabass with acar is nice...
Then the next section is the chilli crab, prawns and clams mix with mantou buns on the side.
Crabs are limited. Refilled but not that many crabs available....
Next is some pasta...soup and breads section.
Moving on next is the pork knuckles and Angus beef Rump.... you need to carve it yourself.
Next is the live BBQ section....with scallops, bug head river prawns and Angus beef patty to choose from.
Other sections are the norm...cold dishes with some snow crabs legs...sashimi and sushi and cold soba....some fried drummets and onion rings.
Lastly are the dessert and fruits.
Food tasted ok and not too bad...worth the 1 for 1 but not worth the full price for 1 pax.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105799201839089842941/reviews
Xin Hao,4,"Visited them for their weekend lunch CNY buffet as there was a 25% off. Pretty decent range of choices as it was CNY specials, including a DIY Yu Sheng area which was quite unique. The chinese roasted duck,bak kwa pasta, collagen soup (although abit salty), kueh pie ti, dim sum, were all really good too. Salmon sashimi and assorted seafood selection is fresh. The chefs work hard to top up each item as readily as possible and are all freshly prepared. Deserts station is average in my opinion with a couple of sweet cakes and ice cream. Very standard and nothing really stood out. Service was otherwise efficient - they cleared our plates quickly and always ensured requests are attended to. Washroom is not too far away as well and dining area on overall is spacious and conducive. Very suitable for large groups or families.

Charis Koh,5,Seafood was fresh. Loved the crab. We got a 1 for 1 so it was very worth it. Might not be worth full price for the selection available. Food was pretty yummy. The grilled food takes awhile to cook so the refill rate wasn't fast enough to keep up with the demand but other cooked food was fine. They clear your plates really quickly too.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111661568119533771765/reviews
