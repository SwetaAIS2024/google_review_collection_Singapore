Hana Ivashkov,5,"We will really miss YAA so much!!! It had been such a fun and fulfilling 2.5 yrs for my little girl!!! Never once had I have to worry about my girl's well-being while under the teachers' care at school, never once had my girl ever come back home with any complains about school. YAA inculcate the love for school in my little girl - she started off crying, but now, always so happy and eager to go to school and be with her teachers. Thank you to Ms Renu, Ms Nisha, and Ms Yati for the wonderful memories!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112805494734389542192/reviews
Sunil Kumar,1,"IF YOU LOVE YOUR CHILD, PLEASE DO NOT SEND THEM HERE.
On 30 Jun 2021, my wife was walking by the class to check on our 27 month old son. She heard Nisha shouting at our son, and then saw her brutally shoving him into a chair when he tried to get down and go to where the other children were. We immediately withdrew him from the class after my wife called me; she was crying hysterically on the phone. Nisha flat out denied she manhandled the child.

We send an email to Renu right away and asked her to investigate on the animalistic behaviour. Till date, she has not given us concrete evidence that the child was not manhandled, instead questioning us why we don't want to come to meet her, when she can interview my wife on phone. She has postponed one face to face meeting and one phone call interview. I have all email correspondences and willing to share them.

A few days after the incident, my son started sobbing when he caught notice of the school's uniform in a closet. My wife is still traumatized from the incident, and we would not set foot in such a mockery of a playgroup ever again.

For all those who are praising Nisha's handling of the children, I sincerely hope your child never has/had to go through this. The few times I visited the center myself, I've seen the children are sitting spiritless even during activities. This is not something normal for children of ages 2-3 years old. Not one day throughout he period he attended did our child was not cry or whimper when he left the class. Seeing his uniform when getting ready for school was enough to put an end to his cheerful nature.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105109467621263011221/reviews
Siti J,1,"This place is very weird. I wish i had read the negative reviews earlier. My child went there for around 2 months, made zero progress. They would not let me sit in the corner or even stand outside, as if they were hiding something. One day i managed to somehow to see and noticed that the teacher was busy with her phone and would in-between respond very rudely to kids. When i spoke with Renu, the owner, she defended the behaviour, probably Renu is herself like that. I regret send my child there! I wish i could go back in time and correct my mistake. Generally my child tells me about what happens in other classes but always refuses to say anything about this class- i think the teacher/Renu threatened kids to tell anything to parents. I wonder what all wrong they did to my toddler....",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108170028210204011454/reviews
