Helen Ng,5,"I have no hesitation in recommending Dr. Catherine Lee. She was referred to me, as a highly skilled orthodontist specializing in tooth and jaw adjustments. Dr. Lee is dedicated and strives to provide the best care for her patients. My experience with Dr. Lee has been nothing short of exceptional!

To begin with, my case was extremely challenging when I first consulted Dr. Lee in early 2021. I had a complex situation, needing correction for the damage caused by another orthodontist who had previously treated my teeth. My teeth were severely misaligned, particularly my molars and premolars, which were slanted.

Right from the start, Dr. Lee empathized with the emotional distress I had endured at the previous orthodontist’s clinic. She displayed professionalism in explaining the realignment treatment, the cost, and the timeline required to rectify the damage. Throughout the two years under Dr. Lee’s care, she consistently took the time to listen attentively and was stringent in ensuring I followed her treatment instructions. She always prioritized the functionality of my teeth while straightening them.

Today, I am proud to say that my teeth are perfectly straight! Dr. Lee even performed the final touch-up by filling all cavities and ensuring my teeth are well-levelled. I am now embarking on the next phase of teeth whitening with Dr. Lee.

While her specialist expertise comes at a higher cost, you truly get what you pay for. I may have paid half the price to the other orthodontist at the Orchard clinic, but I not only endured emotional distress but also experienced the unfortunate consequence of being wrongfully advised to remove four teeth and having my molars and premolars severely misaligned after over 5 years of treatment.

Thank you, Dr. Lee, for the realignment treatment.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113353190891945604991/reviews

She has looked after my smile perfectly and professionally unlike the others who are irresponsible with their work despite of their charges and claims. Highly Recommended!

Ved,5,"Doc Lee has been my dentist for almost 8 years. She's done an amazing job and I really appreciate all the work it has taken to get me where I am today. She is firm, but not unfair, and does her best to accommodate patients where she can but she has no tolerance for people who waste time, which I admire. She's the expert and delivers the results she promises. Clinic staff are also extremely professional and capable and do a great job. Overall, I would recommend her to anybody thinking about dental treatment.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105618728405030882024/reviews
Oceanus Pacific,5,"My experience with Dr. Lee is great. She is transparent with her fees. The fees were spelt out to me on my first visit before any treatment starts. She has provided me a package where I can pay in installments, according to the stages of my treatment. She is sensitive to my concerns and makes my visits delightful. I trust her and believe that I am in good hands for my treatment.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109281889599353675096/reviews
Paul Scanlan,5,Dr. Lee has been my family dentist for 6 years.  Over this time she has preformed realignment treatment to my children and to myself.   She always suggested optional treatments including many lower cost options that have the same outcome.  She never over charged or asked for additional payments.  The end results are excellent and my kids and I are very pleased with the results.  I cannot recommend her highly enough for her skill and professionalism.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105342989086883063794/reviews
