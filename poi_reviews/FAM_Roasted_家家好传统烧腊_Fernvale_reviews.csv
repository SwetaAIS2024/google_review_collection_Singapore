Bryan Fang,4,"New roasted delights at this coffeeshop. Try try.

Ordered a chicken curry mee, 3 combination platter for 1 and plate of dry mee.
They served a good chicken curry mee at $5 albeit slightly oily as you can see from picture. The white chicken served in curry mee was really good and tender.
All 3 roasted meats in the platter was good. Char siew had that slight char which I prefer in my char siews. The sweet caramelisation is there as well. Sauce complimented it.
Roast duck is a herbal one which when bitten into, you can totally taste the herbal flavours. Duck meat was tender as well.
Roast pork was chopped in bigger than average pieces. There was a good ratio of fats and meat. Skin was crispy good. Will order the roast pork again on my next visit.

The separate noodles had a nice sauce but felt that it was slightly dry. Maybe can ask for more sauce next time.

Overall good stall, will eat again.

3 star for service because I get the feeling the guy whom took my order dint felt like serving at all.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114490699769830179262/reviews
