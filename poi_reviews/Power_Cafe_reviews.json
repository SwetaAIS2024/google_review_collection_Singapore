Hence the long morning and lunch queues.  I noticed that some have complained of the so-called 'bad' service here which I had never experienced.  I kinda think it's reciprocal.  If you're polite, they're polite too :)",

Was at the shop in the evening and wasnt sure if they closed, the lady just ignored me and when i walked away, she shouted at me asking what i want while giving a really dull face. It was not just one staff but most times visited with different staffs, they were impolite and disrespectful despite me being polite, which i hope to see an improvement. I would avoid purchasing mainly due to the terrible service.",
