You never do the same workout and all the sessions are uniquely tailored to suit the various needs of the people. Awesome group of people to train with, and i have a fantastic time working out at the gardens. Highly highly recommended to try it out!!!",

      "text": "Fantastic workout in great outdoor locations, mostly at the beautiful Botanic Gardens.  Toni takes care to mix things up in each class, be it HIIT, weights, stretching, etc.  The routine is never the same, so you never get bored.  Plus, the company is great!!!  I love that it's all-comers, and geared towards both men and women.  Beginners have the option of a lighter version of the exercises, but most people are able to complete the class and have lots of fun.",

I love that we do this in the beauty of the Botanic Gardens. Toni’s classes extend to all fitness levels and everyone I know who has attended has improved over time. Additionally it’s a great social group, everyone is always laughing. Best BootCamp I’ve very experienced.",

They have to be certified, knowledgeable, caring, dedicated n fun and Toni is all that and more. She plans her workouts different every time and it's never boring. Her years of experience and expertise in this field is why I'm still with her. Be assured that when you are working out with Toni, you are in good hands. She makes sure you're doing it correctly and have fun while exercising.",
