NonoP,4,"First visit to Amber West for lunch. Located within the ITE college West campus in Choa Chu Kang, it's a 'fine-dining' restaurant where students are trained and supervised by mentors by their side. They had just revamped their set lunch menu at the start of the new term. They offer a 2-course meal at $18 and a 3-course meal at $20 which comes with an appetizer (soup or salad), Mocktail, Main Course, Tea/Coffee and Dessert. It is certainly not the best of quality given the affordable cost but it's gratifying seeing the students giving their best trying to serve the customers. Well done 👍🏾😊",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107997277420460971232/reviews
MNG,5,"A training restaurant for the campus' students. Located on the 4th level overseeing the estate.

A conducive environment with students who are eager to please. Students are competent to their tasks.

There are options of 2 or 3 courses which are priced reasonably which includes a mocktail.

Quality of food is excellent.

Reservation highly recommended.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews
ching,3,"A good find in the west. Would say that the food is value for money, not so much as a high end restaurant standard/quality. Had the Asian menu. Things are on the salty side. The  crackers are free flow, dessert is nice and hot chocolate is a hidden menu! Would come back again to try the western menu. :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108455921592010836339/reviews
Amanda Tan,5,"Went back again after 1 year to experience the good food with a good price tag.

Love the hospitality and atmosphere here.

Encountered a funny guy student who served us. He was super nervous and took our orders 2 times but it was still wrong. 🤣🤣🤣 Ended up another lady student did our orders again.

Accepts credit card payment. We also kena the system break down.

Very lucky indeed. 🤣🤣🤣🤣",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118151158455216779709/reviews
ZHANG HAO DONG,5,"Pretty decent training restaurant, food was brilliant! Note that as of writing this review they are serving the ASIAN menu. According to the staff, they switch between the WESTERN and the ASIAN menus between holidays. This is even stated on the menu (which you can find online) when the menu is in effect.

Furthermore, I did feel like I was in a formal restaurant, so I had to make myself presentable.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110584688628315376856/reviews
