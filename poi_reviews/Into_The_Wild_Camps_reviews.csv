PeiRu Ng,5,"Best camp ever!
Truly the best camp ever, especially for city kids. Amazing programme delivered by passionate instructors. Faith had so much fun and learnt so much, she can't wait for the second day of the camp and also asked for a third. Her little brother is gathering friends for his turn next. It looks so fun that I was asking if the team can organise one for adults too!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102279217848171255009/reviews
Sophie Mathur,5,"My children have done multiple ITW birthday parties (as birthday child and as guest)  over the years and this is one party that NEVER disappoints. Most recently my son had his 11th birthday with the ITW team and it was epic. The night survival adventure got the most jaded tween excited. Educational , character building and most of all super fun, this is a super birthday party option.
The ITW team are friendly, expert and great with kids of many ages.
I canâ€™t say enough what a super offering this is.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101048271737465608541/reviews
Jaclyn Lim,5,"Our six-year-old was really proud that she got to climb a big tree. She cried when she felt it was too tough, but with encouragement, she actually completed the challenge. She was so proud of herself that she didn't give up. And she's really glad to have hung out with other big strong girls in Girl Squad. She couldn't stop talking about the giant centipede for days! Thanks for having her, and we're looking forward for her to attend more camps!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117796651395190593090/reviews

Sally Chew,5,Sam has so much fun in the girls squad camp and she learnt how to do first aid and guide the younger girls in obstacle fun and play.
