Karim A,5,"Good option for halal western fusion.
They have not failed like many halal western wannabes.
Food has remained consistently good over the last few years.
Highly recommend halal hunters to come and try üëçüëçüëç",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114600593307754653829/reviews
Gideon Low,3,"Been here a few times, food is generally okay. Tried the gino pizza but its far from expectations. Crust taste like toast bread and the filling is lukewarm at best. The pizza is also ‚Äúwatery‚Äù. Must say it looks nice on the outside but its the inside that counts. Onion blossoms is nice",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112171375157174977623/reviews
TTT,4,"Ordered via Grab delivery, and the taste of the food was consistent and familiar. It was my first time trying the barbecue spring chicken, and it was excellently marinated. The chili pairing was just as impressive, super spicy with a strong kick!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117174446031825028588/reviews
Zafirah Akhbar,3,"Ordered their Christmas menu beef. The meat was COLD, like got out of the fridge cold.

However, truffle mash and cheese sticks were nice.. but my entire experience was ruined due to the main.

Apart from that, wanted to order dessert but staff said kitchen was closed. I feel like they should have basic courtesy to let those in the restaurant know that it was going to be last order.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103328607514908411446/reviews
Sunesh John,2,"I recently visited this restaurant and found the overall experience quite disappointing. The food I received looked completely different from the pictures on the menu. While I understand that photos are for illustration purposes, the difference was significant. When I asked the staff if what I received was correct, they confidently assured me it was.

Additionally, the setup was quite inconvenient. While I don‚Äôt mind going to the counter to place an order, having to collect the food myself was challenging, especially as I was with my 2-year-old child. This made the experience far from pleasant.

Overall, the lack of convenience and the mismatch between expectations and reality left me dissatisfied. I hope the management considers improving both the service and the clarity in their menu presentation.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100675758332191524240/reviews
