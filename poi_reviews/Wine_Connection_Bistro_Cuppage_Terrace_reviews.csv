Ars 3276,4,"Had some friends visiting from overseas and glad i chose this place.
Great environment with Superb service from the team.
Very attentive and prompt, top Notch service.

Food was excellent as well and pairs with solid wine makes it a wonderful evening.

The only sad part was the early closing as we needed to leave around 10:45. Would be so much better if they close much later.
There was quite a good crowd as well but based on my checks, they are only open till late on Fri n Sat.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114029124935079806014/reviews
Flo Yeow,4,"This is an excellent choice for after-work drinks. Among the many bars, restaurants, and bistros in the Cuppage area, this one stands out for its impressive wine selection.

What's even better is that they offer these wines at reasonable prices. The service is also top-notch, especially the store manager who provided a fantastic wine recommendation and ensured our glasses were always full.

We enjoyed a bottle of Saint-Julien red wine for a very reasonable SGD 85, taxes included.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews

Add on mash potatoe $7, potatoe isn't smooth enough. Wished the gravy could be more.

Fish and chip was good, crispy and fish is nice. French fries is on point, portion is good for $26.
