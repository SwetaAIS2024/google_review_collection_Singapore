Mineno san kept us entertained and well fed throughout the night it was good vibes all the way! Favourites of the night were the Bafun Uni and Aka Ebi they were so sweet! üòã",

      "text": "Enjoyed a really cozy dinner at Katachi. We went quite hungry and had the Fuji set which is so reasonably priced and left us feeling very satisfied. Consistently good quality and decent variety throughout the courses. Also appreciated the chef‚Äôs quiet observations of us and timely interjections on how to consume each course as we were clearly inexperienced omakase diners üòÇ Thank you so much for the complimentary birthday dessert as well, it was a sweet gesture!\n\nIt was also a rather quiet evening with only two parties before us (left shortly after we arrived) and one after us (we left shortly after they arrived). The privacy and lack of time limit was great so I‚Äôm torn between gatekeeping this gem and hoping more people would find out about them. Would definitely recommend.",

      "text": "Disclaimer: I am a very very picky eater yet somehow katachi sushi bar had me eating every single thing they served!!\n\nThe shop is a small and quaint 11 seater sushi bar tucked in a cozy corner of Orchard Plaza.  (Didn‚Äôt manage to get pics bcos I was too hungry and focused on foodüòÖ)\n\nThe food was super super super goodü§§ the sashimi was fresh and the sushis were super well paired with little toppings like the Japanese pepper or yuzu. I think I missed out  some dishes because they just looked too good that I only remembered to take pics after I had finished themüòÖ the whole menu reminded me a lot of Japanüíñ\n\nIf the food doesn‚Äôt already win you over, then the service definitely will! The chef is super friendly, welcome and knowledgeable about the products. He is also very observant and detail oriented. I told him that I don‚Äôt eat spring onions and he was able to remember and follow through by not including spring onions in anything he served me (any spring onions in the photos was because I was taking a picture of someone else‚Äôs food for aesthetic purposesüòÖ). He is also really astute. He bases the portion sizes off how full you seem to ensure you can make it through the 12 rounds of sushi and are able to try everything! (We only found this out because we asked). The amount of care and detail really tied together and elevated the whole dining experience.\n\nIt was also my friend‚Äôs birthday so we got a free dessert (matcha ice cream in a wafer!)üç® I love the playlist and the ambience too! It was young, on trend and very vibesüòé\n\nTLDR: overall a really lovely place to dine at, especially if you are celebrating a milestone! Food and service are incredible and I highly recommend this placeü©∑",

Sushi was fresh.\n\nChef Bryan was really dedicated, constantly looking at our facial expressions each time we eat, but since it‚Äôs so good our expression stayed the same. Tried his sake he produced as well\n\n8/10\n\nIG: @melvineateat",
