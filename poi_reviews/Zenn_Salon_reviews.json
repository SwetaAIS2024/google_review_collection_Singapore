And hair cut was Super uneven. Usually prior to cutting the stylist would spray some water to wet the hair but they did not even do so. Just started sniping away immediately. And when I complained the stylist said nobody cuts so even. üò°",

      "text": "my worst experience with this place by far. DO NOT LOOK FOR ‚ÄúKELLY‚Äù cause she is absolutely atrocious. Explicitly told her to cut my fringe till the mid of my eyebrow length and even SHOWED her photos of how I want it done. After completely botching the hairstyle and making my hair look like a complete coconut. She still has the audacity to tell me it looks nice and this is how the haircut should be done and proceeded to charge me $23 dollars. Absolutely ridiculous",

      "text": "Saw one of their own stylist with a nice haircut so I approached her to ask who cut her hair for her. She said it's by their lady boss Susan. Confident that she can deliver the same (a good hair cut) for me, I booked her at 6.50pm. She confidently told me she would definitely be ready when I reached. Ended up I waited until 7.15pm. This is not a very key issue, if her skills are good. I showed her couple of pics that I shortlisted...Susan sounded like \"there's nothing to cut at all if I had to follow those styles I had chosen.\" So I seek her advice.... She showed me some shots and we agree to go for one of them. Ended up what she cut is far from what the pic was. And my sides also not balanced. The worse is most stylist would cut the sides for pixie look....she uses a shaver. She should go back to school and relearn everything.\nI go to QB before....even QB stylist did a better job than Susan and she charge $23 for a cut while QB only $12.",
