The clinic has upgraded to having AC. And though it is a slower clinic as we need to wait 30min to 1 hr on average to see the doctor. The clinic has put in place workaround such as having a WhatsApp contact to inform you that your Q  is approaching so you can do other things or wait at home before your turn comes.",

She's a very patient person and conducted a thorough check for my condition.\n\nWhen I asked her for a referral letter to a specialist, she was attentive enough to note which insurance company I came under so she could recommend a specialist that's covered under the insurance plan.\n\nWhile I had to wait pretty long before my turn (1 hour), it was because there were 5-6 people in front of me.\n\nDefinitely a slower paced clinic but I did not feel it's because of their attitude but more because the clinic is run by 2 experienced nurses who are a little more senior as compared to some other clinics.",
