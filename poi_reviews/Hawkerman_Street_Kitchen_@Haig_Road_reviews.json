It‚Äôs amazing they‚Äôre not declaring this as fusion Singaporean rubbish and tooting it at a fancy shophouse and slapping on high prices. It‚Äôs our new favourite local joint at Malay quarters of Haig Road / Joo Chiat. #eatstylishtravelstylish",

      "text": "I‚Äôve eaten this for breakfast and dinner, my most fave stall in the area! But i have a critic for Mee goreng jawa. The dish that this stall makes is more leaning to tangy-like pad-thai flavor rather than how mee goreng jawa is supposed to taste like (sweet and savory, no tangyness) (im from indo and javanese so i know how it shouldve tasted like). I think the char kwe teow is already the perfect flavor for mee goreng jawa so the chef could make 2 dish with the same sauces. If u still want to keep the flavor then theres a similar indonesian mee brand called ‚ÄúMie gacoan.‚Äù",

The service was good, I received my meal fast üëç The food tasted delicious, the combination of the noodles, egg, prawn and anchovies created a scrumptious meal. There was also a good portion spread across the plate, making it quite worth the relatively low price. üëç",

The Chye Pok (preserved radish) flavor stands out, and the crispy chicken skin garnish adds a delightful crunch.\n‚Ä¢\nDry Laksa\n- Decent dish with a good balance of laksa spices and curry leaf aroma.\n‚Ä¢\nDry Mee Siam\n- Sweeter than expected; could use a touch more sourness. I liked its slightly wet texture.\n‚Ä¢\nAssam Laksa\n- The Assam flavor isn‚Äôt very strong or thick compared to Penang-style laksa.\n‚Ä¢\nMee Jawa Goreng\n- Enjoyable but would be better with more eggs.\n‚Ä¢\nOyster Omelette\n- Average. Doesn‚Äôt quite match up to traditional hawker-style oyster omelettes.\n‚Ä¢\nAll these dishes are incredibly affordable, priced at just $5 each!",
