han han,5,"Despite the canteen setting, the pomfret steamboat surpassed my expectations. The fresh pomfret, seafood and flavorful broth made it a standout. A 5 star in an unexpected location. Now they are having a mid-year promo set at $69.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111708685919406471089/reviews
Clifford Yeo,2,"Tried the steamboat and enjoyed it twice previously. So, tried other zi zhar items at my 3rd visit, as steamboat would only be available in the evening. Sotong was good. Bean dish was bad as overfried, but the hae-bee in it was crispy and nice. Venison item was just OK. But I am utterly disappointed with the Teochew style steamed promfret as the fish itself wasn't fresh at all. The waitress billed me $80 for that stale promfret fish. Luckily, I told her to check as I earlier saw it at $51.80 promotional price. Even at that price, it was still exp for a small fish.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112710052515501603525/reviews
Esther K,4,"The broth of the Hotpot is tasty.
Good service too. We were the only one left before their closing time. They patiently waited for us.

Thank you.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117620932784332029283/reviews
kaiwen yeo,3,"the fishhead hotpot was fresh and generous, however the rest of the tzechar dishes really need to be improved. We didnâ€™t take photos but the 3egg spinach dish looked unappetizing. Cai pu beancurd had a very strong and unpleasant margarine taste to the whole dish as well.
Also to note, their fish soup is pepperish so the kids in our family(>7) found it spicy.

Service staff was super friendly and attentive! (Receipt time was wrong, we dined in on 28 March around 7pm :) )",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110582380985384628414/reviews
Stefanie,5,The white pomfret is big and fleshy. The broth is very tasty. A must try for pomfret steamboat lovers.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100862467160814904704/reviews
