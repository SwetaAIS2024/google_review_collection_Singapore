Flo Yeow,5,"If you're halfway through the trail, or made a wrong right/left turn, you may end up back on the tarmac roads where Costus Trail ends. Fret not, they're all connected and very scenic anyways. Just go back to the cross roads, make the relevant turns, and continue. You'll be able to get back to where your car is, where food is, or where the toilet is.

Nearest toilet from here is back at the carpark, behind where the petrol kiosks are all at. Come out of the trail and head right-wards.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
