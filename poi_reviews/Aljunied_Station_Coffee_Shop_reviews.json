      "text": "Second time having a meal at this coffeshop. It is brightly lit and many ceiling fans to ventilate the spaces. Many patrons were having Mala bowls, but I was tempted by the freshly handmade noodle at the Chinese Mala store this round. The fried beef noodles has superb value. Unique noodle blend had good bite, texture and minimal or no unwanted additives(scents). Noodles came littered with beef slices, big onions and vegetables in thick brown sauce. I added chilli and fresh whole garlic from the collection counter. Considering that its a single bowl, it is filling and satisfying. Especially if you are a fresh garlic person.",
