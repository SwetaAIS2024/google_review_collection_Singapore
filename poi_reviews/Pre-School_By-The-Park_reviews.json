Big thanks to the teachers for making sure they learn the right values and to find ways to make lessons engaging!\n\nVery thankful to the teachers and staff of the school - for having the kids interests as priority and for encouraging them to grow in their own ways at their own pace as much as possible. It is a VERY wholesome experience for us and i would highly recommend BTP LiHwan!",
