      "text": "Even if you’re a meat-eater, go here. The food’s more delicious than most omnivore fare. Prices are reasonable, and you get a decent discount for ordering a set meal that’s more than enough food—we couldn’t finish it! I enjoyed the meal more than some tasting menus 4-5x the price.\n\nThe beauty soup was savory and slightly sweet, maybe a bit too much umami, with a dozen ingredients like papaya, konnyaku, snow fungus, and jujube for fun variations on texture.\n\nThe olive fried rice was impressively infused with wok hei and had a slightly chewy texture that can only come from using a jet burner. You MUST order some kind of fried rice here! It’s my platonic ideal of fried rice.\n\nEnchanted forest dressed hearty chunks of monkeyhead mushrooms with a goji berry and angelica sauce. Angelica might be an acquired taste due to its strong strong medicinal aroma, like something you’d put on bandages. Personally, it’s one of my favorite spices.\n\nThe sambal king stir fry remains a mystery to me. How did they get that funk and aroma without using fermented shrimp? The vegetable medley was well-chosen with texture gradation from firm stinky beans to slimy okra. Eggplants were not mushy in the slightest bit. Loved it!\n\nStrong recommend. One of the best meals of the trip.",
