Mark Koh,4,First time coming to this coffee shop. Saw quite a lot of people though is already 8.30pm. Decided to order a kuey teow from Zhi char stall. Also noticed that the Teochew porridge stall has a queue. The food looks good. Will be back next time to try.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104379740216436886242/reviews

Wah Seng Phang,1,Ridiculous price to pay for a take away steam egg dish ($3.00) compare to their economy rice with one meat and two veg that cost $3.50 as published.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114829489385221919980/reviews
Kelvin Chye,5,"My family comes here often for the teochew porridge with dishes. Not only they have a large selection of different dishes to choose from, the dishes taste good and very reasonable pricing. You can tell this stall is good by the constant queue even till late night.
Do note this coffeeshop tends to be quite crowded during dinner time, with lots of beer drinking uncles occupying quite a number of tables, so it may be hard to find available tables during peak timing.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117999709976505884094/reviews
Wesley Xu,4,"Tried the dim sum at Clementi House of Bao in this coffee shop and it was pretty good and value for money. Ordered chee cheong fan, porridge, siew mai, century egg siew mai, har kaw, chicken feet as well as char siew bao and salted egg custard bao. The porridge, chee cheong fan and chicken feet really impressed while the buns were pretty good too. Prices were wallet friendly and the auntie at the stall was really friendly, even telling us not to buy too many buns for takeaway as they should be eaten within 2 days at most. Definitely returning again üëçüèª",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116507817542057576800/reviews
