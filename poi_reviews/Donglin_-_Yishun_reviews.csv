cjhj,2,"Like what most reviews here said, pricing is really attractive. I was introduced to this place by my cousin who tried their tampines outlet.

Massage was very average, specifically told massuer which areas and yet he gave excuses not to massage the shoulders. He also continuously dose off while massaging my feet.

While I do pity him, who pity me spending 60 to recieve nothing in return.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111224150201496471349/reviews
Christine Khoo,1,"As a client, my slippers got stolen at their shopfront and they told me it is my fault. Not even apologetic. They just said ‘oh other clients slippers also got stolen before and not their problem.’ They continued with their meals and all, like nothing happened. If they can’t look after our shoes because it is outside their shop then freaking put the shoe rack in the shop? The store manager’s attitude is the worst, he went like there is nothing I can. What a lousy customer service and experience.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103283377233971088370/reviews

Yappy Happy,5,"Latest price rate on 4 Oct 2023. Adjusted $2-$3 and is still reasonable price comparison to the rest on other area.

Been here for 5times. Today decided to go down my Blk and try out (the shop is located 2 Blk away from my house)

Did a 30min shoulder $20 and 30min foot $15.
I prefer softer massage and strength. The massage adjust accordingly to my requirements.

Overall is very good experience for this time by ah May.

Good job!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102733383135938157275/reviews
