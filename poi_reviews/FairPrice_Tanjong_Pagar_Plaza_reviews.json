Although the display was slightly difficult to locate the staff who was manning the nearby counter really made my night! She was proactive and suggested if we helped lift the display case, she could help retrieve the only remaining pooh umbrella in the outlet! She even reminded us to check the product before we left! Thank you for your service, Auntie ‰∏áÂ≤Å!üòÄ\n\n(I had since been to other outlets hoping to get another umbrella for my dad and was given the reason if the display is lifted the case will spoil.)",
