Chong Chong Lim,5,"Our boy has been attending classes at Writing Sprouts since 2020 when he was 5 years old. It has been a fantastic learning journey for him. When he was 5, he enjoyed books when I read to him, but we realised he couldn’t read basic words on his own. After attending classes at Writing Sprouts, he was able to start reading on his own within a very short period of time.

He has since graduated to primary school, and he has continued at Writing Sprouts. He loves his classes there. The small class size enables the students to have an enriching and interactive learning experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114746570218057691518/reviews

Lilian Chee,5,"Our kids have been with Writing Sprouts since they were 5 years old. They have since graduated to upper primary and lower secondary. They love WS, enjoy their lessons and holiday programmes, and they adore their super dedicated teachers. In class, they are introduced to new authors; their lessons are fresh, fun and innovative. Learning is a true pleasure. We hope they go on to become independent readers and thinkers. Recently, WS started a new initiative - an e-bookshop with really great books for kids of different levels. We ordered 2 books with rebates from vouchers given to WS students. The books were enjoyed by all - kids and adults alike!! Look up the e-store, fantastic recommendations and hard-to-find titles are stocked!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115408208319504971682/reviews
