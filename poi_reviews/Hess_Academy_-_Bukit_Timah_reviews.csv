Az HD,5,"My son recently attended the English Composition Workshop at HESS, and I’m very impressed with the experience. The workshop was well-organized and structured, focusing on equipping students with the skills and strategies needed to improve their writing.

The instructor, Lin Tze is knowledgeable and engaging, making the lessons interactive and enjoyable. She provided clear guidance on how to structure essays, use descriptive language, and develop creative ideas. My son found the feedback session particularly helpful, as they highlighted his strengths while giving practical advice on areas to improve. The English Composition Workshop was an invaluable experience for my son, and we’re looking forward to enrolling in more programs in the future.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241362752752826770/reviews

Jin Rong Tan,5,"Unlike other students, I only joined Hess academy during the final lap prior to O levels in September, which meant my time spent at Hess academy was not as lengthy compared to others.

Nevertheless, when I attended Teacher Alison's English lessons, I was able to quickly grasp the writing technique for narrative, recount, expository and hybrid essays. Additionally, the answering methods for English comprehension question types such as Literal, Inferential, Referential were very effective in helping me deliver near perfect answers in English paper 2 (although they were abit hard to understand, but I managed that issue by staying back after class to ask Tcr Alison and clarify my doubts with her).

Having gotten B4 (64%) for my English, I initially found it slightly difficult to catch up in class, but everything turned out fine. Through Hess academy, I managed to improve my English Language by 3 grades from B4 in prelims to A1 in O levels :D.

special thanks to my family, teacher alison and hess academy.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107321639191405285663/reviews
Vanessa De Silva,5,"My PSLE son did an online English course and it was truly an amazing and worthwhile experience. Having had previous experience with online sessions, I must say I didn’t expect much but when my son, Lucas, was placed in Teacher Naga’s class for the trial session, he was impressed and so was I. From then onwards, everything went as smoothly as could be expected. Teacher Naga was able to capture the respect and attention of his class. The course work is also impressive and well researched and complied. We are truly grateful to Teacher Naga and Sean who helped with all admin matters. Thank you for the AL2 in English that Lucas secured, it is a far cry from the previous AL3-4.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110804723562687568749/reviews
