Shirlin Tan,5,"My great experience with Dr Roy & nurses.
Dr Roy is a very professional doctor. He is quick to diagnose and explained my dental issues in details and also provided options for my consideration. Hence, under his care, I have resolved all my dental issues. I am so proud of him and I have referred my nephew to him too. My nephew was also very impressed with his service and quick diagnosis!
The nurses are also attentive and helpful, always contacted me timely for checks up and always welcomed me with a friendly smile!
The team has gone the extra mile to provide such a Great Service!

Vera C,5,Needed a last minute appointment today and my usual Q&M outlet didn‚Äôt have availability so I called Eunos instead. They were able to fit me in and Dr Lee was very patient and professional. I felt at ease throughout and he was clear with his explanations. His assistant was also very helpful. Everything was relatively painless thanks to his efficient strategies when injecting the anaesthetic. Thank you!,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109923240889410695247/reviews
Mina Slamet,5,"I brought my mum come to Eunos dental Q &M for her denture which is made from Indonesia. Because so long already and have some problem with her denture so I bring my mum to see Dr. Roy Ng Jian Tong. Doctor helped my mum to check her problem. Advise my mum to come double check her denture if any problem. For this visit, doctor waived my mum bill. So kind this doctor. Great service for him.

S L,5,Visited this clinic a while back and had Dr Karan work on my tooth filling. It was a relatively painless procedure and he was detailed in explaining when I had questions on dental care. Definitely recommended and hope he keeps up the good work.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111338337566232239656/reviews
