Belle Tan,4,"For the location, would be nice if the food menu items were more affordable. 2 burgers with sweet potato fries and a milkshake almost added up to $50 for 2 pax. Milkshake quantity is small too for the price ($7), but to be fair, it did taste premium.

Would highly recommend the 2280 over the basic burger, they taste almost identical and we are not the real connoisseur who could tell the both apart. Adding an egg really elevated the experience, it is worth the calories and cholesterol.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111871902098879786966/reviews
Tan Yuefung,5,"One of the better, beefy tasting burger in Singapore!

We ordered:
Basic + Smash Patty + Egg
and 2280 burger + Smash Patty
+ shoestring fries.

A little pricy, but worth it. Nice portion for the burgers.

Would come back again.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105782472127211703207/reviews
Sue,4,"Lunch on a Saturday and it’s almost full house. Self order at the 2 machines, the interface is not so user friendly if you are trying to edit options after going into cart.
Food is decent, the burger patty is cooked to perfection but not much ingredients if you don’t add any extras.
Iced tea has option of no sugar.
Overall an enjoyable experience, and will
come if in the vicinity.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109030078087160231223/reviews
Sophia Marani,4,"2280 Beef Burger - double $14.30 had patties which were beefy and juicy with some hardness on the outside. Buns were too soft for my liking. Overall, it was a decently greasy burger! Too pricey for a work lunch though…

I came back again for dinner and got the Smash Burger which was quite dry and had a charred taste.

I also tried the burger with black pepper sauce and caramelized onions which was not bad.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115227533033003450123/reviews
Benjamin Wang,5,Very decadent and delicious burgers and fries. I ordered a smash burger and it was oily and rich. The first few bites were great but it got a cloying towards the end of the meal. I would recommend the truffle fries as well if you are a fan of truffle. The price is on the steeper side for burgers and fries.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105523111879457156478/reviews
