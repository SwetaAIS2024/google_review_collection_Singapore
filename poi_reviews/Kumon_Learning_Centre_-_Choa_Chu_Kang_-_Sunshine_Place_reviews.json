      "text": "The terrible customer service at Kumon@SunshinePlace(CCK) is shocking. Its franchisee operator, Mrs Goh, only cares about the revenue that each kid brings in for her. When we whatsapped inquiries of our request to sit in when she assesses our kid’s math ability prior to actually attending Kumon math classes, she was noncommittal and even replied us to GO TO ANOTHER OUTLET” and that she is “FINE” with it. How arrogant is that? As if the kids that visit her Kumon centre owe her a living. The Kumon method may be known worldwide, but different franchisee operators vary greatly in their effectiveness. Needless to say, I will warn everyone in my various social networks from wasting their children’s time attending this Sunshine Place outlet. I heard from other parents that she used to operate in Choa Chu Kang South View, but packed up and relocated to Sunshine Place due to similar complaints from other parents at her old South View location. I post this so that all parents can exercise vigilance when enrolling, that’s all. Thx.",
