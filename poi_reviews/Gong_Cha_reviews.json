No cash accepted. No other customer support nor help and the lady on duty that day just rudely mentioned \"we could not help\" and I left angrily. Honestly, please train your staff to have better customer service, or you would only expect bad customer reviews coming.",

The tea is freshly brewed from a tea bag, and depending on your order, milk will be added to it.\n\nI have tried both the Osmanthus Honey Oolong Milk Tea and the Buckwheat Green Milk Tea, both with no sugar. The tea flavor itself is quite strong and is quite fragrant.",
