David Wong,5,"A new look n feel of the renovation with dimmer yellow light since my last visit a year ago.

Service staff had increased as more people strolled in during the lunch peak hour after 12noon.

Had upped n improved their customers' service as plates were frequently cleared with clean ones compared with my previous visits.  Very attentive service!!

New dishes were created like oyster omelette n a few others.  More diverse items now featured in their menu

Taste of food standard remain consistently high.  Very much home tasted feeling of the food served.  Like these very much!!  My must ordered fav include lou mee, fried tenggiri slice, sweet sour pork, ....fresh prawn soup served in bamboo but the taste now a little less sweet n herbal but Still good n acceptable!

Also prices are reasonable n now no service charge and GST absorbed by Putien

Enjoyed the complimentary lime juice near the cashier station.

Down side is many children in this restaurant n can be noisy if their family don't manage these young kids

Notwithstanding, still Highly recommend this place for casual dining n really value for money.

Kudos to Putien management for their commitment n continued presence to serve good food (home cooked style) n such reasonable price for so many years in Singapore.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107910285093716374068/reviews
Quing_ÂàòÂ¶àÂ¶à,5,"Putien@JP is a delightful spot we tried on a Sunday with my family (2 adults and 1 young kid). My son loved the lor mee, calling it ‚Äúyummy,‚Äù while my husband enjoyed the fish, though I wasn‚Äôt a fan of fish with bones in soup. However, the soup had a delicious peppery flavor with a slight heat. My favorite dish was the crispy fried chicken‚Äîa nostalgic favorite from my pregnancy days. The sweet and sour pork was juicy and flavorful, another highlight of the meal.

The service was excellent, with staff frequently checking on our orders and keeping the table clean. The warm lights above each table beautifully illuminated the dishes, making them look even more appetizing. The restaurant‚Äôs decor, especially the fresh flowers on each table, added a lovely touch.

This newly renovated branch at Jurong Point even has a private room for families who prefer a more intimate dining experience for celebrations or gatherings. We spent $101 on the meal, and it was well worth it. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and we‚Äôll definitely be back to try more dishes. Overall, an excellent dining experience!

Si Lei Agnes Goh,3,"It‚Äôs been a long time since I ate at Putien and I was craving for some specific dishes. Stir fried yam was still as good, one of their yummiest dishes. I liked the 100s yellow croaker too, just be careful of fine bones.  However, dishes like white cabbage with beancurd (soup-based) and noodles (soup-based) were far from good, pales in comparison to my previous experience. I noticed there was some element of inaccurate marketing as well (the little pop-up for membership sign up included a free fruit sampling of some sort) but I checked with the staff and that‚Äôs non-existent. They have indeed waived off service charge but GST is still included, so the label that says ‚ÄúNo service charge. No GST.‚Äù could be confusing. Good service though.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116102026795437651477/reviews

Catherine Lim,4,Delicious food as always. Dine here with my younger sister. The fried oysters are a bit over fried though and very hard to bite into it. The rest of the food is good.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102942221625028900513/reviews
