Nuve SV,4,"Food was good but not unforgettable. Service was very good, especially the guy who attended to us. Probably one of the best service staff I have ever met. This place is expensive.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107273778459951335127/reviews
Rajan Soni,5,"Delicious Indian food. Punctual staff. Soothing ambience.

I went for a casual dining experience, but wow! Food top notch chef, classy presentations, everything healthy. I ordered chaat, achari tikka, veg biryani (nawabi one), and rabdi jalebi (which was okayish 3.5/5), were amazingly delicious. If you are in Singapore and wish to go for a fine dine experience with Indian taste and great hospitality, Yantra is a must visit. I found it a bit pricy but looking at the quality of food, I think it’s worth.

Great experience, wish to visit again!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106717752616192965866/reviews

Martin Peter-Marcus,5,My wife and I recently had dinner at Yantra. And it was AMAZING. This is not your usual Indian restaurant. It’s a carefully curated menu representing dishes from different regions of India. What was fascinating was the history and cultural significance behind each dish. The food and service were simply outstanding and the ambience very cosy. Big thanks to Tim and the team who attended to us. We had a delightful evening.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100671855257643145445/reviews
