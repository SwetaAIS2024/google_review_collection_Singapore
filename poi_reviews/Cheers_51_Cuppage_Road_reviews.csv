Yunn,1,"Rude staff. Was here at 23 Nov 2024 around 9.30AM and the Chinese lady with a short haircut was very rude in telling me I can't scan at the machine. How would we know? There are no labels whatsoever, it looks like a self service machine but it actually still needs the cashier to scan and process payment.

No point adding all these new machines when it's not user friendly or intuitive.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106684114461666590026/reviews

Scarlette Homan,1,"If there is a 0 to score your staff Nanthini i would rather give her, instead of giving you 1 star. Shes rude! Her facial expression, gestures and tone of voice is sooo sarcastic.
I usually buy my food from ur outlet and sitdown there..but today id rather step out of ur store.
Kindly send her to workshop that will improve her customer service.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103061767185449253672/reviews
