      "text": "I have two daughters and they have been practicing here for almost 6 years, started as kid now became teenager. Kids are sometimes challenging to parents as they routinely say they want to stop sports, and this also happened to me several times too. But they continued taekwondo constantly- probably they enjoy the classes and I believe they like the teachers. Transparently said as a mum, One of the reason for consideration to continue a session is whether the center has good teachers, and from that perspectives I feel safe with this place. I plan to send my kids until they get their black belt and continue further according to their will to continue.",
