Freddy Kua,4,"Please support this APSN centre near Eunos MRT at Jalan Ubi (between Sims Avenue and Changi Road), opposite Kampong Ubi CC. It is located inside a gated compound just next to Willing Hearts where volunteers prepare and cook food for the less fortunate.

APSN is a collaboration with Aston‚Äôs, the Western food chain. They serve Western food and provides training jobs for the disabled. I find the quality of food here excellent üëçüèº!  Love their char-grilled chicken chop. The manager and trainees are very courteous and friendly, making me feel welcome very time.

Due to Covid, they are only catering for take away now on weekdays. The traffic has also come down drastically and at most times when I visit now, it‚Äôs either I don‚Äôt see other customers or just one other customer buying take away. Due to Low traffic, they are reducing the choice of sides and I can see the operations is struggling.

I greatly admire this meaningful place that helps the mildly disabled bros and sis appreciate their self worth and grow their confidence to live a normal life. Please support with your take away and/or donation at their donation box! Thank you üôèüèº.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112928888531363475275/reviews

George Gavrilita,5,"One of the spaces has been rented out for a conference I attended. Quite good spaces for that, plenty of chair and tables, a whole wall just covered in whiteboard, and great staff: when I asked where I can buy a bottle of water, they said they didn't sell any inside, but they gave me a sealed bottle from their own reserve.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105973898112298954138/reviews
