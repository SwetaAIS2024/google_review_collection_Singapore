      "text": "Affordable cafe foods with big portion and actually delicious!\n\nPulled Pork Eggs Benedict - one perfect runny egg & one slightly overcooked. Very soft brioche bread as the based, topped with fresh & not bitter avocado and lots of pulled pork.\n\nShakshuka with Sourdough & Meatballs - portion is crazily big, balanced sourness with great hint from basil pesto sauce & cheese blocks. Generous meatball that's perfectly seasoned & cooked.\n\nTheir coffee is not acidic and good balance with the milk. Salted Caramel Latte was great!\n\nQuite packed on the weekend but they serve the food quite fast with good quality!",

      "text": "My family and I have been to Bread Yard a few times as we like the food. The service staff has no smile and emotions on their faces but the food was good that‚Äôs why we went there for a few times.\nToday there was a promotion for free 2 cruffins with $50 spending. After our meal, I approached a young male staff who told us that they ran out of cruffins as they had many orders and told us to try on our next visit. This wasn‚Äôt our first time to be told that their freebies were not available. We felt cheated and told him it‚Äôs not right and it happened to us 3 times. It‚Äôs only when I complained, they agreed to replace with 2 pastries. Their apologies (including a senior staff) were so soft and felt insincere.\n5 stars for food\n4 stars for atmosphere\n1 star for service\n\nRemove your promotion if you can fulfill it.",

      "text": "This review is for their $8++ lunch pastas. I ordered their pesto pasta which was ok... Portion was big but not much flavour. and it's $8++ for a reason because there's no other sides with it, must add $$. Then you might as well go to a more expensive but better tasting pasta place right imo.\n\nI do like that the free membership comes with a free drink. Had their hot chocolate which tasted like diluted milo üëç My friend's blue pea yuan yang also wasn't tasty. Imagine if you paid $6++ for each LOL.\n\nTheir toastie was not bad, crispy and flavourful. but abit pricey ah like $8 for a small toast.\n\nI also don't like their ordering system lol. They have this NFC scanning thing but my phone cannot. I turn the NFC upside down then got QR code on the bottom LOL.",
