Muhammad Zulfiqar,1,"Damn slow. Took 30mins to get my order and i order tom yam fried rice. Cashier and cook can be seen taking their own sweet time, no urgency hehe-haha when there are many orders to fulfill. Frequented this place a few times for lunch, cashier no sense of awareness. If you have abundance of time to spare the food is alright but otherwise better not if you want efficient service.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102925266114032720998/reviews
