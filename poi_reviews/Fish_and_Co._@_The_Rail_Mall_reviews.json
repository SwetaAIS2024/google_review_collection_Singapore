      "text": "Iâ€™ve always enjoyed Fish & Co. and had great experiences at other outlets, but this visit was really disappointing.\n\nFirst, the prawns were overcooked to the point that the meat was completely stuck to the shell. Anyone who has eaten at other Fish & Co. locations knows that their prawns are usually fresh and well-cooked, sliding right out of the shellâ€”but not here. When I pointed it out, they offered to remake the dish, but even the second batch had the same issue. It really made me wonder if the prawns were even fresh to begin with.\n\nThen there was the squid. Almost a third of the pieces were still translucent instead of properly cooked. It was clear that not enough attention was given to preparing the dish correctly.\n\nThe worst part, however, was the dessert. When the ice cream arrived, there were ants crawling all over the bowl. It takes time for ants to gather, which raises serious concerns about how the food is being handled in the kitchen.\n\nI still think Fish & Co. is a great brand, but I canâ€™t recommend this outlet. The lack of consistency in cooking and the hygiene issues were really disappointing, and I hope they take steps to improve.",
