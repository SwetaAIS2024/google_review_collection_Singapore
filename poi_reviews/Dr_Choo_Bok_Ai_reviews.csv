Novi Yenti,5,"A Doctor with a Heart of Gold â€“ Truly One in a Million

I have met many doctors, but none quite like Dr. Choo. He is more than just a doctorâ€”he is a rare gem who truly works with his heart. Warm, attentive, and incredibly caring, he treats every patient with genuine compassion and dedication.

At first, I brought a few friends to see him, not realizing that one day, I would be bringing my own father to him. Now, as my dadâ€™s oncologist, Dr. Choo has given us something pricelessâ€”hope, reassurance, and peace of mind. In a time when fear and uncertainty cloud our days, he makes us feel safe and assured, knowing that my father is in the best hands possible.

What sets Dr. Choo apart is his unwavering passion for helping others. This is not just a profession for himâ€”itâ€™s a calling. He is not in it for the money but for the lives he touches and the hearts he heals. His kindness and sincerity are truly rare, and we are beyond grateful for his care.

If you or your loved one needs a doctor who treats not just the illness but the person behind it, look no further than Dr. Choo. He is a true blessing, and the world needs more doctors like him. Thank you, Dr. Choo, for all that you do!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114223864879883477136/reviews

ivanny margita,5,"Came here to share my experience with Dr.Choo and did not find it surprise that He is indeed like what others say about him. Super caring, super supportive and super nice person. He truly has touched many hearts (include myself) with his kindness and thoughtfulness.
Throughout the duration of therapy, he consistently follows up patient's condition with me and shares tips for managing the affected area and minimalizing discomforts. Not only that, when i have concerns or questions i can call or text him and he responds promptly and explains in details.
Dr. Choo also listens to his patients complain and always extend his hand to help. Like in my case he remembered my mom's complaint about her skin itchiness and gave her cream to soothe the skin. This small thing matters most because even though the rash is from the oral medication not from the therapy but he still cares about it. His action speaks for itself.
I could write more about Dr. Choo but i think its better for others to get to know Dr.Choo in person. Thank you Dr.Choo! I couldn't ask for a better doctor.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115377539954815593586/reviews
Samuel ewitrapratomo,5,"Dr. Choo is one of a kind.

Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine being diagnosed with a rare cancer, ACC (Sublingual Gland Cancer), in my late 20s. Because of its rarity, it was difficult to find the right doctor. Itâ€™s only by the grace of God, I was referred to Dr. Choo Bok Ai by my surgical oncologist, Prof. Soo Khee Chee.

From the first moment I met Dr. Choo, I felt reassured. He is knowledgeable, calm, and warm, which gave me confidence that I was in good hands. Throughout the difficult process, including 35 rounds of radiation, he consistently showed care and concern, always checking on my condition and ensuring I was okay between cycles. Even after the treatment ended, Dr. Choo continued to follow up with me, asking how I was doing.

I know he doesnâ€™t do this work for the money, but out of a deep desire to serve others. He has been more than a doctor to me â€“ he has become my role model.

One day, I hope to treat others with the same care and compassion that Dr. Choo has shown me.

Dr. Choo didnâ€™t just change my life; he also changed my heart.

He is truly one of a kind.

P.S. To all the wonderful staff at ICON Cancer Centre â€“ Joline, Mabel, Nadine, Ramiza, and last but not least, Sophie â€“ you all hold a special place in my life, and I will be forever grateful for it.

God bless you.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114571980134319602597/reviews
Sheena Ooi,5,"I was referred to Dr Choo Bok Ai by my breast surgeon doctor to continue with the next stage of treatment after my surgery. Dr Choo is very kind, compassionate,  experienced and caring. He patiently explained the process of my radiation treatment and answer to all my concerns abd queries that I had during the first consultation. Dr Choo even shared Physio exercise videos that helped me to cope even before starting of the radiation treatment journey. Dr Choo showed concern and care during my 15 sessions of treatment journey and often checked on my condition after my treatment. He is truly remarkable and his professionalism is well respectable. He even shared with me the super food that is good for my daily consumption.
His radiation therapists team is also very kind, patient, understanding and always tried to make me feel comfortable when I am going through the radiotherapy treatment.
I am very thankful and grateful to Dr Choo and his team for the great care and support!

Wishing you and all your loved ones healthy, blessed with good fortune and abundance of happiness ðŸ˜Š

Best regards
