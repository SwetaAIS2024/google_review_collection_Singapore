Count my blessings, for $12.90, I ordered Fish and Chips and the Chicken Chop set meal which offers salad free-flow and mushroom soup free-flow.\n\nThe mushroom soup was delicious, better than some restaurants out there.\n\nChicken chop was fragrant and flavourful, really delicious. Fish and chips, the fish was soft, batter was not too thick and was easy on the palate.\n\nOn top of both salad and mushroom soup, there was ice cream free flow.\n\nReally worth coming here when you're nearby and looking for something value for money.",

Considering all are refillable except for main dish, it is worth the price tag. Portion is good also.\n\nRecommend to try out for a lunch if one is working near by.",
