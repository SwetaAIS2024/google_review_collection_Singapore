C G,5,"First time trying lemon acai. Quite Unique since this is my first time trying lemon acai. The taste is 100% elevated today because the bananas were green, but I’m biased because I prefer bananas slightly unriped!! I appreciate a good seating place at any acai store, but I feel a little bad because the store was full, and the only table left was a 4 seater.

YT,5,"I was craving acai and decided to try this store nearby, and it completely exceeded my expectations! The acai tasted amazing—smooth, flavorful, and perfectly balanced with the ingredients. Everything paired so well together, making it the best acai I’ve had so far.

If you’re an acai lover, this place is a must-visit. Highly recommended for a satisfying and refreshing treat!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116335289933602715039/reviews
William Lee,5,"Satisfy your sweet tooth with healthier Açai. Love the concoctions here.

Their recipe is not too sweet so it’s enjoyable for me. I usually just go for default options.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108142416745967711790/reviews
Bimbles,5,"I eat here weekly for a light lunch or tea break snack. i love both the flower fruit bowl and nut bowl, so normally i get both and share with my friend.

Personally feel this brand's Acai taste less sweet. I still prefer the original default granola tho (30cents top-up), because the new default which is cocoa, i tried a few times and it was always not crunchy in texture.

I have always bought takeaway, first time sitting in and it was a comfortable tea break. Acai bowls were made swiftly and prettily! It was a good break in-between work, will continue to support~",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114946881428760024234/reviews
Elaine Quek,4,"Reasonably priced, healthy desserts. Lots of fruit and nuts. Acai yogurt is a bit too sweet. $15+ for a large was ok. Very few seats and somewhat cramp. Staff are friendly.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103201350123704289751/reviews
