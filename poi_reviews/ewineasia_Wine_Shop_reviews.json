The wine samples got delivered a few hours before the class. The class was very informative and well executed (through zoom) and the wines was so good I had to buy 2 bottles. Signed up for their next class too!",

I was fortunate to meet Melvin, who was very helpful and knowledgeable and also kind enough to help expand my horizons with some excellent recommendations. It was a great experience also because of the friendly staff and owner, Susy. Excellent way to spend a sunday!",

I really like discovering new ones  which is pretty easy with Ewine Asia as they deals with small vineries who treat their production with true love. We keep discovering gems to enjoy.  Great value for money. The staff is very insightful and go les out of their way to help. Agnes and Daniel specially.",
