Damcho Tshering,5,"Took a peaceful stroll through Coney Island, just a 10-minute walk from Punggol Coast MRT. The place is incredibly calm and rejuvenating‚Äîperfect for nature lovers and birdwatchers. The rustic trails, lush greenery, and the soothing sounds of chirping birds make it a great escape from the city's hustle.

However, nature had its own surprise in store‚Äîa sudden heavy downpour! Thankfully, the island has well-placed shelters to take cover until the rain passed. In a way, it made the experience even better, listening to the rain amidst the tranquility of the forest.

If you're looking for a peaceful retreat in Singapore, Coney Island is definitely worth exploring!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116833702802756994837/reviews
Grik Chai,5,"It‚Äôs a very relaxing place where you can sit peacefully, enjoy the sea breeze, and listen to the sound of the waves. There‚Äôs a forest right behind you. Sometimes you might spot some fish, but be careful not to walk down as the area below is very slippery due to moss.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106151419257453329636/reviews

Leng K (B),5,"Coney island is a great quiet place. There are birds, flora and dogs. Unfortunately the cow died otherwise it will be nice to spot it from a distance. You can see the neighbouring country from Coney Island easily. Near the island bridge you can see many swifts flying around and usually you can spot an eagle circling the skies as well.
A fantastic place for nature lovers",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110260119307195197554/reviews
