      "text": "Food and service were great!! Atmosphere definitely needs some \"improvement\" since it's just a small start-up business/venture and the space to eat-in is really limited. So come early and be kind + considerate to others who would also like to have their delicious treats there! Everyone's looking to have a pleasant time, so don't be a prick 😊\n\nThere were 2 available seatings indoors when we went (1 long seat for 2 pax with a crate at a suitable height as the table, a cushioned seat and a wooden stool with someone stealing the crate meant to be the table🤨). There were 2 available seatings outdoors (2 long seat suitable for 2 pax each with crates as tables). Two girls immediately hogged the table when my boyfriend and I wanted to take the outdoor seat, but left soon when we were placing our order (which is not the owners' fault at all!) 🙄 Just hope that they'll get a bigger space eventually to accommodate a bigger crowd as we saw a snaking queue while enjoying our treats there 🤗\n\nThe lady who was whisking all the matcha drinks by hand manually (might be the lady boss) was hard at work throughout the whole time we were there. So kudos to that!! Definitely not easy whipping up drinks quickly by hand manually, so do be a little patient for the drinks! 😊\n\nWould definitely come back to try their seasonal bakes and the Chaspanner next time. This time we bought the London Fog chiffon and matcha strawberry to share because we were really full after a heavy meal and were about to visit a friend nearby for more food. Also recommended this place to my friends that I'd visited after 🤭",

      "text": "Chanced upon Cheeky Cuppas when I was running errands around the area, and decided to check them out on a weekday for a better experience.\nA cozy space with only a couple of seats, love the little details around the shop and most importantly, something different to offer in their menu. Apart from the usual black and white coffee, Cheeky Cuppas serves a number of tea based drinks.\nI got myself a cup of \"Chaspanner\", a rich and creamy matcha latte with homemade sweet cream, it tasted very good as the matcha latte wasn't sweetened (unless upon request for some sweetness) and it was a pretty good drink on a humid afternoon.\nWill definitely be back for their Otah toast, they named it \"Otah pei ah som\" which is a callback to our childhood game.\nHighly recommend this place for some caffeine fix!",

      "text": "located at the foot of a hdb block in sin ming is cheeky cuppas, a recently new and trending matcha and coffee place!\n\nthe genmaicha latte had a slightly duller green compared to their matcha, but had a strong roasted taste and taste of rice. there were also pungent notes of seaweed which weren't bitter and was just wheaty. the whole texture was a little grainy, which was new for me. i would've liked this abit sweeter but this would suit those who like more vegetal kinds of matchas!\n\nfor the hojicha, the sweetness in this was just right, and the hojicha was thick and smooth. i added on $1.50 for 𝒔𝒑𝒂𝒏𝒏𝒆𝒓 𝒄𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒎 for this drink as recommended by the staff, and it turned out to be a good recommendation as the extra cream really helped to make the tea a lot smoother. it also contributed some added sweetness to the drink! i enjoyed the fragrant roasted notes too. i liked this more.\n\nseats are limited here, but understandable as they operate mainly as a takeaway joint. can sit 4-7 people at max.",
