Jon Oh,4,"We had some skewers and the sauerkraut fish. Skewers are competitively priced and nothing to really wow about similar to most shops. The pig intestines on skewer was not good as it was not well cleaned.

The fish was a very decent serving of the price, nice and neat place and service was decent. Has a large selection of alcoholic beverages.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111905269642120764199/reviews

Mark Koh,5,"My second visiting. First time was in the evening, didnâ€™t mange to get the promo price but still find the price is reasonable. This time round came for lunch. Got the grilled fish at $14.40 and chilli chicken for $1.99. Really value for money. Food portion is reasonable and taste is good.
