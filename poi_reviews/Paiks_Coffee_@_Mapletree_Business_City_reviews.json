I would say the food is not too bad but it would really be just for quick lunch. Not like something that will blow you away. Instead it would be the coffee beside the food area that is more interesting.",

Remember to ask them donâ€™t put sugar syrup unless you like it very very sweet (they put 2 pumps syrup by default!). I was there during off peak hour, so thereâ€™s 50 cents off the coffee. Staffs are friendly. Will visit again to try other stuffs. ðŸ˜Š",

Pretty quiet spot thatâ€™s only busy during morning rush or lunch hour.\n\nWeirdly, their original Paikâ€™s Iced Coffee wasnâ€™t available at this branch. Got their Iced Caramel Macchiato instead and it was too sweet for my liking. ðŸ˜£ But otherwise, nice spot for a quick coffee session.",
