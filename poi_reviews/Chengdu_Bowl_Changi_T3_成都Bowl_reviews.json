      "text": "Enjoyed their affordable Chinese-style dishes!\n\nSichuan Green Pepper Fish (S$27.80) - I enjoyed this, the dory fish was tender and delicious with the green pepper sauce (which wasn‚Äôt too spicy). I especially liked the bean sprouts and yuba for some vegetables with the dish, there were also enoki mushrooms.\n\nJuewei Spicy Hotpot with Mixed Vegetables (S$27.80) - we also enjoyed this, which wasn‚Äôt too spicy. Other than the beef omasum (which 2 of us don‚Äôt eat), this dish also had lotus root, yuba, potato noodles, potato, enoki mushrooms and peanuts. A nice dish for those who enjoy Sichuan flavours!\n\nFragrant Sesame Oil Chicken Claypot (S$19.80) - a nice classic dish for those who enjoy È∫ªÊ≤πÈ∏°, this came with plenty of chicken pieces and a nice sesame oil sauce. A good option for those who prefer a non-spicy dish.\n\nSichuan-Style Beef Claypot (S$23.80) - came with a generous serving of beef chunks and potatoes, this was a bit spicy but also a nice dish for sharing with the table. The Sichuan sauce was flavourful and the beef chunks were tender.\n\nTraditional Curry Chicken Claypot (S$19.80) - a nice curry dish with plenty of chicken chunks, as well as potato. Not overly spicy and good for those who like curry.\n\nTomato Beef Brisket Claypot (S$23.80) - a good non-spicy option for those who can‚Äôt take chilli, this had a nice tomato broth and came with plenty of beef chunks and tomato chunks. Enjoyed this as well!\n\nPork Intestines with Tofu and Sichuan Pickles Claypot (S$22.80) - enjoyed this dish with the flavourful intestines and tofu, although it was quite spicy.\n\nPan Fried Golden Tofu Cubes (S$10.80) - recommended by their staff, this was really addictive and we downed all of it! Also topped with sesame and served with Thai chilli sauce, this is a nice vegetarian option for sharing with your friends.\n\nHoney Yuzu Tea (S$3.80) - it was sweet and refreshing to have with the meal!\n\nFor more food reviews, check out my IG @foodlesstravelled!",
