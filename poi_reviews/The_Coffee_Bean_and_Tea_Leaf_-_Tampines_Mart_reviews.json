      "text": "Dear Coffee Bean Team,\n\nI usually donâ€™t leave feedback, but I wanted to share my experience at Tampines mart at 12.38 today. A customer in front of me was having trouble with the app and spent over five minutes getting assistance from the staff. While I understand the need to help customers, the staff seemed completely focused on troubleshooting the app with her, without acknowledging other customers waiting in line.\n\nIt would be great if the team could be trained to balance helping customers with keeping the queue moving. A simple suggestion to let the next person order while resolving app issues would have made the experience much smoother.",

      "text": "The counter staff Siti did a terrible job. The moment is step in, I can hear her shouting and talking loudly to customers when it wasn't busy at all. Took a a few minutes to turn around to serve customers while customers stood at the counter. I ordered an iced latte and was given a beeper to wait for my order, after 10mins of waiting I got impatient and went to check on my order as there was no order customers waiting for their orders. It turns out she's chatting loudly with another filipino staff in the kitchen. She actually forgot she took my order when there's only 1 order in progress. Terrible. The whole coffeebean is noisy filled with the staff siti talking only.",

Lets dive in ya..\n\nFood & Drinks:\nIts d same..so no need review la ehðŸ¤£.\n\nService:\nThe staff is rather attentive and is quick on the hands. This then resulted in lesser need of time for items to be ready. The equation fits for us and we would definitely come here again for the personal touch..\n\nAtmosphere:\nThe place is rather small but adequate for breaks if u need time for urself. There maybe at times others who hog d table but well, jz make do la eh. But the place is really cosy if u do have a seat to urself.\n\nOverall:\nWe will invite you to enjoy a short time to pamper yourself with coffee n cake. So ya, cheers!!!!",
