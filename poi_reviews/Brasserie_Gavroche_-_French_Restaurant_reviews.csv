Christopher Ong,5,"Lovely Brasserie that transported us to Paris and back. Food was sumptuous and service attentive. All the dishes were memorable but the 2 stand out for me was the Prawn & Avocado salad, with the prawns grilled to perfection and the Duck Confit with duck skin that was crisp and yet melted in my mouth with each bite.

Definitely a place for a special occasion!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105817850083065830780/reviews
Wyman Kok,5,"Truly amazing experience! The food is delicious and service was warm and friendly.
The restaurant look really beautiful with a bar attached.

As we were sharing main courses, warm plates were placed without requesting. And the same for our dessert, but with a cold plate. Amazing.

Also, I really like the side salad on my duck confit main course. Have a nice and fresh lemon scent to it, maybe fresh lemon juice used in the dressing.

Hope to return soon for more food and wine. Thank you team Gavroche!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102822772566179787488/reviews
Betty Dharmadi,3,"I have high expectations of this place based on the review of others, but my experience fell short of my expectation.  Service was okay (standard) but the let down was probably the food.  We ordered the escargot (pretty good), the pork terrine (dry and rather bland),  duck confit (good), Rib-eye steak (dry and over priced to me for the quality and portion) and Lobster & scallop (average/standard).  With a bottle of wine, we spent more than $500 and left feeling under impressed.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102526104383422110469/reviews
M Rabbat,3,"One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore - I had not been yet to the new location so was very curious to try
Very nice place close to mrt and quite large
Appetisers were good and goat salad as delicious as always - my husband took the steak plat du jour which was very good - was a bit disappointed that the artichokes were traded with mushrooms… not really the same kind of a downgrade -
I was quite disappointed with my 68$ steak frites and did mention it to the staff but I don’t he cared much…
The steak was dry, hard and not great at all
The profiteroles were very  good
Overall disappointing as when you pay this amount of money you could at least have a decent steaks …
So it seems it’s not the same standard as in the past :(",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113195629136056720674/reviews
Kwong Chee Choo,2,"Disappointingly mediocre.

I fondly remember eating at Brasserie Gavroche when it was at Tras st. Been there a few times and  always exquisite

Unfortunately, my experience at their new home at mohd sultan was truly lacking

Onion soup - diluted.  Good stock, but watery.

Duck confit - excellent crispy skin. But the meat was very dry, no rich savoury flavour.

Rump steak - this was ok.

Crepe suzette - the crepe was done well, but the sauce was so overpowering and acidic I couldn't even finish

Service - robotically polite, disappointingly mediocre.
Zero customer awareness.

a) no observation that water glasses was empty even though they are pouring water for tables just beside us. Had to prompt them multiple times .

b) any good restaurant would check in on the guest, ask how is the food.  No one bothered. I only ate 20% of my crepe. No one bothered to ask.   No one bothered to clear our plates.  so when I asked for bill , they just brought the machine. This would have been an opportune time to ask how was everything or even notice untiuched food, but guy just stared vacantly into space while waiting for me to tap my card

Atmosphere, kind feel like Tras street. So 4 stars for that.

But the rest is really meh",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100810638807264550691/reviews
