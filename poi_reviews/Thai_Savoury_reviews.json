Price is a bit on the high side, portion needs to be more generous.",

We want to try the grill pork or pork jowl but both unavailable except fried stuff.\n\nPotion are huge compare to Nakhon and taste good. It's a self service and need to return plates after finish your meal hence no service charge or GST. Recommend to try Tom yum seafood red as its cone with lots of ingredients although prawns seem to be slightly overcooked. It's a basic small eating place and its not suitable for family with kids.\n\ncan drive down or order take away if nearby üëç",
