WILBUR,4,"Food is good, although pretty pricey.
Place is open air so there's no air-conditioning. Large ceiling fans keep the place reasonably cool but also turns your food cold really fast.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100648315462691595880/reviews
Jasmine Koh,3,"It's OK. Came here with my bf. We bought the fave voucher as we didn't know this place had existed even though we go to the nearby ntuc very often. The chicken wings were good. We ordered the steak for the main course. Ordered medium rare but one came more medium well than medium rare and as a result was quite tough and dry. The chocolate lava cake was nice, but did not look and taste handmade. Service was quite slow. For three courses, we took 1.5 hours. Staff was friendly. Overall it was an OK experience.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101976024307295989214/reviews
Xavier Tan,4,Food is decent but the portion is a little small.  Service is ok too. Location is a little off. Restaurant is located near the entrance of the hotel. Overall not bad.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106885978605096751111/reviews
Zess Lim,2,"Very slow service. Visited during lunch with chope deal on Mother's Day
Understaffed yet there is no urgency in the service staff at all. Mushroom soup is tasty, rich in flavour and is thick and creamy, drizzle of truffle oil into soup as well. Truffle fries, Cali tandorri chicken pizza soso only, 5/10.
The crab meat pasta is bad, nothing special, taste like dry Chinese friedb noodles:(",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103459838876266736987/reviews
Thomas Lew,3,Came here for dinner. There's a 50%  promotion of you dine at a certain time. It is located next to a hotel however it is alfresco style. Ordered the baby back ribs and the fish and chips. The ribs are good and the meat came off the ribs easily. However the fish is a bit dry. The staff are friendly and helpful.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116412495384406242557/reviews
