Frank Young,3,Ordered the tahu telor. Tahu was a bit hard. Overall a bit dry and the kecap manis was too much and too watery. Hard to find shiok tahu telor outside of kampong glam. So okay lah. But the stall had other interesting things which sadly i didnt try.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117671743754148796213/reviews
Sophian Yusi (SpyUC),5,"Tucked away in a quiet secluded coffee shop is Mardiana’s Corner. They sell a wide variety of food from Shabsuka to their awesome Satay!

The Laksa Assam is out of this world! The Satay is nicely marinated the traditional way. NOT how everyone else is doing it with lots of sugar. Theirs is NOT. Please try it and you’ll want more. They also have Satay Kicap which was made famous in JB, Malaysia. Satay Kicap only comes with mutton. Try it if you want something different. They only sell Satay in the evenings.

The staff are nice and friendly and it’s never overcrowded.

Highly recommended!!!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100350655223015107511/reviews
Huda Yusof,1,Visited for dinner on 28/11. Very upset when my dinner order of Kacang Pool tasted ‘burnt’. No wonder I saw another patron leaving his order of kacang pool unfinished.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111832851305407027452/reviews
