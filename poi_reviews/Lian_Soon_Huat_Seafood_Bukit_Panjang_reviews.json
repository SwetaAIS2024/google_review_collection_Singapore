The staff are friendly and helpful, making the experience even better. I also appreciate that they value their customers—during Chinese New Year, they even gave out free red packets as a nice festive touch. Highly recommended, and I’ll definitely be back!",

The food options are pretty wide and they always come piping hot and quick.\n\nThe location is very convenient, just 3 mins walk from Pending LRT. The aunties at the ordering side are very versatile to accommodate my requests for food options that aren’t on the menu, and payment method as I’m not used to carrying cash around.",

Quite clean and crowded on a Sunday evening.\n\nWhite rice is okay, nicely cooked.\nSalted egg pork is nice, slightly salty and meat is tender.\nMinced meat tofu - tofu skin is a little thick, tofu itself is not silky.\nCurry fish head is a no go - too much curry powder, not worth your calories. Fish is okay.\nKang Kong- most of it is the stalks, very little leaf. Won’t order again.\nCereal prawn- cereal could have been more spicy.\nPrawn paste chicken taste just like normal fried chicken wings you can get from any fried chicken stalls.",
