Handicraft,5,"I am admitted on 20th Feb until 22nd March. During my stay here, I witnessed the nurses here worked very hard. Their patience towards confused and demented patients deserved optimal recommendation. No matter how verbally abusive the patients are towards them, they remained composed and professional especially nurse Elva, who  ran after the demented patient who was trying to run to another ward. I witnessed with my own eyes how verbally abusive patient was to her, with all her might she still show a bright smile to this patient and to other patients like us. She showed her love and tender care to all her patients equally. Since I am a diabetic patient, Elva made sure my insulin timing is accurate, and my food was served timely, to prevent me from having hypoglycaemia, this i really appreciate . Not forgetting Dr Gerald, Dr Ang who provide good medical advice and guidance during my stay. Last but not least the night nurses who looked after me while i sleep like nurse Nakiah, Nurse Rubina, Staff Lilik and Staff Norashima. U guys make me feel at home. Ur warmth and smile make my day. ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ I am going to miss you guys",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105992332041105720473/reviews

William Goh,5,"My mum was transferred to TCF@west 2 weeks ago. She has been taken care of by different team of nurses . And I would like to emphasise that nurse Elva is the one who is very patient, caring and always carry a warm and friendly approach to mum‚Äôs needs.
Bear in mind she also takes care of the other patients with the same care and love she has given to my mum.
She is very passionate ,skilful and knowledgeable in her work.
If I were to be given a chance to recommend for any nurses‚Äô promotion, I will without hesitation put nurse Elva my first choice.
Thank you nurse Elva for your truthful care towards my mum.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100457715054506575553/reviews
Brenden Gurusamy,5,"My brother in law was admitted to TCF @ West on 31st Jan 2025 pending his transfer to a Nursing Home. The facility is fabulous - big, spacious, super clean and all the staff from security, reception and medical staff were professional, very polite and friendly. My BIL was well cared for and was happy.

The communication between the MSWs and me was excellent and timely and very clear.

My BIL subsequently transferred to a Nursing Home today.

I want to sincerely thank everyone at TCF @ West for looking after my BIL so well. God Bless.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116630796924404301038/reviews
Vincent Lee,5,"I was transferred from NUH to TCF west from November 2nd and the staff helped me to settle in as soon as arrived. They were all very attentive and assist the less mobile in many ways. I may not be able to mention all the staff that I came across but the few that do their best for the patients there especially the HCAs Farhan, Ken, James, and the staff nurses Andrew ,Nicholas. Towards the night before my discharge, the Management arranged  a campfire by ACS Independent students to bring joy and laughter to the many patients in this facility.
Great effort by all and here's wishing one and all a Blessed Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
Best Wishes,
Vincent Lee",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103965282326468911373/reviews
