      "text": "I didn’t take a picture of katong dog run because as soon as me and my dog got near it, the dogs inside it flew at the fence and started aggressively barking at my dog. It wasn’t out of excitement, their hackles were up and they chased him all down the fence, throwing themselves at it, making it perfectly clear to my dog that he had no business coming into the run. The dog owners just stood about doing nothing. Another example of Singapore’s dog runs, aka, “Gladiatorial Arenas”, where badly socialised, untrained dogs meet regularly, form packs and run wild. At least they are contained in there and not running free in the main park. My dog is capable of behaving himself in public so thankfully it is not my only option to take him to one of these places. It’s a rubbish dog run anyway. A small patch of grass with no amenities and a fence round it. I’d give it a miss unless you own a large dog with a penchant for fighting.",

Owners basically know each other since most dogs come here regularly. Not as clean as the East Coast Park dog run (food plastic, soda cans, etc. can be found near seats from time to time, wonder who's so careless?!)",
