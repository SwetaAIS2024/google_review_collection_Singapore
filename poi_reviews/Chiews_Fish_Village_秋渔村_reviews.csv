PA Lim,1,"your stall don't even deserve 1star from me (but no choice for writing review). Regardless of old or new customers, amount spent, treat your customers equally and fairly. I hates jump queue even issuing a Q number tag. when questions, the ""elderly"" man show me the number tag behind my basket (???? how can a smaller Q number behind my basket) whereas the chopper is serving a basket no. 28. my Q number is 18. looking at my turn will be another 4 more basket I came back within 5mins notice my basket is gone. Again I check with the ""elderman"" and he ignored my query. Very Bad experience, Good Business with jump Q services. ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105246161563161786970/reviews

Derrick Tan,4,The fish prices here are definitely cheaper. Worth buying. The only star missing is that the stall is very busy especially at the weekend and you have to wait very long for fish cleaning. Sometime more than 1 hour.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112069874072960419898/reviews

BIRFwrites Info,2,fishes are fresh and look reasonably priced (i say looked because most are sold by whole piece for a fixed price and not weighed). i asked for the fish that i wanted to be weighed but was ignored. they have a good system of 1) pick the fish you want and it wil be placed in a basket; 2) queue to pay; 3) specify how you want the fish to be dressed and the fish will be tagged accordingly; 4) take your queue number that corresponds to the number on the basket; 5) wait while your fish joins its own queue for dressing; 6) collect your fish at packing station. it's a good system but the service delivery and customer relations are below par. was ignored when i requested for the fish to be packed 2 pieces per bag before the young man said without even looking up at me that he can pack the whole fish in 2 bags at most. he then yelled at the old man at the packing station to pick up the fish for packing. on the whole it was about the whole team yelling at each other to do their part of the job. very toxic environment. think i'll go back to sheng siong where one staff happily does everything for the customer.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114925944832725355697/reviews
