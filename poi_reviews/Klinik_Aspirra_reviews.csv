Annam Raman,5,"I went on holiday to JB last week, and unfortunately, my newborn baby had a high fever. I took him to a clinic referred by my sister, where a doctor named Sayi treated my son. He explained everything in detail regarding other health issues as well. The best part is that he charged a really reasonable price compared to other places. Thank you so much, Doctor!
