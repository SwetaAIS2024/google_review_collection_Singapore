Benedict Correya,5,"Dropped by for breakfast at McDonald's Marine Cove. The place is spacious, clean, and well-lit, with plenty of seating both indoors and outdoors. It’s right next to East Coast Park, so it’s a chill spot to enjoy your meal with a nice breeze. Breakfast was the usual McD's standard – fast, tasty, and satisfying. Great location for a pit stop before or after a beach stroll.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113292377967743781974/reviews

Happy Bird,5,"One of the more pleasant Macdonald's in Singapore with both indoor and outdoor seating. Wonderfully peaceful on a weekday morning but I suspect not so  during the weekends. Lots of active fitness people sitting outdoors while the less active ones take the interior seating. The food is typically Macdonald's, familiar and addictive. My go to Macdonald's whenever I need a french fries and burger fix.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108716533290322327726/reviews

Tinker Bell,4,"Here’s a refined version of your review:

“Redeemed an apple pie using points from the McDonald’s app. Also tried the pineapple cone—it’s more like frozen ice cream rather than a soft-serve cone.”",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114236124440744178084/reviews
