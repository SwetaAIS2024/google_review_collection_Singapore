Total was around $48 including 2 takeaway boxes as we couldnt finish some food, had to takeaway. Every thing was very good, even the coffee was so fragrant w notes of pandan leaves. Perhaps can skip garlic cockles to be really picky..a tad too oily & shells were hard to open, I tabao home to fry w char kway teow ðŸ˜‚",

No way u can miss it. Parking is very convenient coz a public carpark is just beside it. The food is at affordable price & taste, very authentic. Am here to takeaway today. Just randomly take some picts from the menu for sharing. Trust me, a no regrets place for a true Vietnamese crusine.",
