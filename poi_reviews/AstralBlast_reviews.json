      "text": "We had 2 birthday functions at AstralBlast. The kids enjoyed so much that we spent the whole day there.\n\nIt‚Äôs the biggest indoor laser tag in Malaysia! 2 storey of playground. The system is very advance to capture shooter‚Äôs handicap and various simulation of scenario for games. We never tired of the games, team play, multi team play, solo and missions. Suitable for kids 9 years old onwards and adults of all age.\n\nThere are party rooms for food and gatherings for rental. The equipment is new and well maintained! Kudos to the management and team!\n\nSpecial thanks to Satish and Carson! You guys rock! Taking care of kids and parents. And making reservations and games interesting!",

It was definitely the highlight of the party!\n\nDuring the celebration, there was an unfortunate incident where one of the guests accidentally damaged a facility itemüò±üò±üò±. However, the owner (or at least someone who seemed to be in charge) was incredibly understanding and kind about itüôèüôèüôè. They even used Google Translate to communicate with me, knowing that English might not be my first languageüëçüëç. I really appreciated their patience and professionalism.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful experience, and I would highly recommend this place for a fun and memorable party!",
