Zhenxi Ong,4,Food is good. Not among the best in Singapore but quite nice. The soup is quite nice but not the best. The style is a mix between modern and traditional prawn soup. So you may like it or hate it. I find it nice. The noodle is good. Sauce is also good. Sweet. The prawns is good but not sweet. The most expensive prawns will have sweet taste.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115603941718627345391/reviews
Super Fragrance,2,"Ordered big prawn noodle for $17. Wait was 25min.

TL'DR
Soup : poor
Prawn : poor
Noodle : great
Pork rib : average
Pig skin : average

Details
Soup was disappointingly diluted. Not much umami. Can taste the water. Can salvage a bit when down with flavorful noodle.

Prawn wasn't fresh. You can see from the pale colour. Largely easy to deshell but not all nor were was the prawn devein. Came with 2.5 prawn. Doesn't have that sweet prawn taste.

Noodle was great though. Very flavorful and q was just right. But might have too much msg, feel so thirsty after it.

Pork rib was quite tough with porky taste. Just a big rib. Pretty meh.

Pig skin was just pig skin doesn't standout nor do I feel offended by it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105892392413528737906/reviews
Bli Leong,5,"Olden days taste that is hard to come by nowadays. Noodles coated with rich pork lard and sambal chilli formula which I tasted includes fried shallot, prawn paste and tomato sauce. The soup portion is generous and tasty. Overall small portion @ $7 with one piece of pork ribs and few slices of halved prawn I think portion should be more generous.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118197187270625470744/reviews
larry lai,2,"1st time trying this prawn noodle.  Tbh, nothing very unique about it.  Started queueing before the stall open. Waited 30mins from 11.15am. Portion(no. 3, pork belly w prawn) is small even for $11, can't imagine for $8.....6 half prawns given, not really big prawn imo, about 7-8pcs of pork belly.  Prawn not really that fresh but still ok.  The only best part was the soup, sweet and savory to my liking, but I believe I had tasted better one before.  Won't be back again.  Not value for money & my time imo.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101502016326548593561/reviews
Nigel Doraemon,4,"After 20 over years, came back to this market to re-try the so called famous Michelin star Prawn noodle. Size is of course smaller now though itâ€™s pricier - all from the support of the current MiW rich men policies. Food wise is more oily now compared to the past, taste is still good. May not worth the price given that there are several good prawn noodle around SG like Jln Sultan Prawn Mee. Still worth a try for a Michelin Star local delights!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113562548797877291108/reviews
