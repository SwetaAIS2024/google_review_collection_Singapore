      "text": "Let me introduce you to Anderson's ice cream, a delightful treat that brings joy to my taste buds on a regular basis.\n\nWhile your wallet might suffer some bruises after ordering, but the ice cream itself has magical properties that can turn even the saddest frown into a sugary smile. It's a budget-friendly indulgence that will melt away your financial worries, especially when enjoyed with your beloved family members.\n\nThe taste is like a harmonious symphony of flavors that dance gracefully on your tongue. Not too sweet, not too bland, it hits that sweet spot of perfection.\n\nTry their bingsu too! It's a glorious mountain of icy goodness that's fully loaded and ready to be conquered. It's so generous in size that you can share it with your significant other and still have enough to satisfy your sweet tooth.",

      "text": "The Black Forest waffle was delicious. It’s crunchy with a rich texture. Choice of ice cream was chocolate rum (alcoholic) and blueberry which helped to satisfy my craving for wanting something that’s not so sweet, yet rich and has a contrast in the taste (trying to fulfil my tastebud from the 2 scoops of ice-cream :p). The freakrainbow drink is a milkshake with 3 types of ice cream that you can choose from. It looked so pretty and has an interesting taste. It takes time to prepare though and can be challenging to remove the chocolate off the glass. Mocha was great: liked that it was not sweet. Overall, enjoyed the dining experience.",

Then she just stand at the cashier counter whithout asking or ever initiative to serve us.\nThe family then walked away.\nAfter we had chosen and made payment we sat, then she on the lights…time 11.50am, which shop i guess open at 11am.\nShe seems foreigner, not local.\nVery but customer service.\nManagement should monitor and observe as she the only staff at the time.",

The ice cream ofcourse is deeelicious!! I’ve tried dine-in and the cafe is pretty good with waffle combos and many other options. The staff are rather patient and helpful. They make the experience worthy of appreciation.",
