      "text": "Would like to provide my honest feedback on my experience with Jazz Bar on 5 April at 10pm.\n\nWe have ordered the truffle fries but we do not like the sour cream or mayonnaise. The truffle fries has no tinge of truffle oil taste and we have highlighted to your service crew but he replied that the truffle oil is added in the sauce which we totally dislike the taste. We left the fries untouched till the end.\n\nThe burger was another tragic, the beef patty was bland and tough. We ate one piece and dared not try more. The food served was a total disappointment. After making payment, we did not even receive any receipt on our spending.\n\nThe only thing we find acceptable was the live band.\nWe have written feedback to the manager in email but to no avail. Therefore, we decided to write it here to remind future customers to think twice before patronizing! The photo taken with food and beverage already cost 650 yuan! I ordered another apple juice at 70 yuan to meet the cover charge at 700 yuan(2 pax)!",
