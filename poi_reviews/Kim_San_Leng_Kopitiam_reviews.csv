Priscilla Yeo,5,"Don‚Äôt let the run-down coffeeshop fool you üòâ, this humble spot is home to one of the best Mee Hoon Kueh I‚Äôve had in a long time. Despite the limited number of stalls, this particular vendor truly stands out with his authentic, handmade kueh that‚Äôs cooked to perfection.

The broth itself is a throwback to old-school flavors‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs comforting, rich, and full of that nostalgic, homely taste you just don‚Äôt come by easily anymore. You can tell a lot of heart and effort goes into every bowl.

It‚Äôs rare to find Mee Hoon Kueh that reminds you of the ones our elders used to make, and this stall really nails it. A true hidden gem that‚Äôs worth the visit if you‚Äôre craving something honest, simple, and absolutely delicious.

Highly recommend supporting this hardworking vendor!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105121579671399385873/reviews

Ivan Teh,4,"Lontong Sayur Lodeh (SGD $4) @ S.S.G. Barokah.
.
Established in October 2020, this stall is operated by Abdul Rahman Bin Aziz and family, who also owns the adjacent Aziz Goreng Pisang Salai stall. Completely off the radar, with no online presence.
.
Their unique rendition feels like a Thai green curry, with a creamy thick texture to the sweet savoury spice broth, and the use of pea egglants, tender with vegetal earthy sweet flavour.
.
The dense compressed rice cakes are firm chewy with grainy sweet flavour, while the stewed vegetables (cabbage, string breans, carrots, jicama turnip) are soft with vegetal sweet spice earthy flavour.
.
A bouncy hard boiled egg with eggy sweet flavour, spongy tofu bean curd with grainy sweet flavour, and crumbly kerisik / toasted grated coconut with earthy nutty sweet flavour, completes.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114332345573544911646/reviews
Dennis N,5,"Pancakes here are so professional and well made! Toppings are sure to be filled to the brim and the pancakes itself is also large, soft and fluffy enough to counter the large overflowing amount of peanuts!

Do get the peanut butter one if you are a fan of peanut butter, it‚Äôs in good quality and goes really well with the regular powered peanuts. Damn amazing ü§©üëçüèª",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104988888938292694772/reviews
