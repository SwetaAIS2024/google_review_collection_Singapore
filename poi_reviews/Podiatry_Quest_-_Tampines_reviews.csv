JY,5,"Aaron is well versed and knowledgeable in the medical field of the foot, literally. He is patient in his diagnosis and does not rely on purely eye power; he'll actually feel for the injured part and recommend relevant treatment. After two weeks and only two sessions with him, I feel better on my achilles tendon already. He also gives advice within and out of scope, such as when I can start training again, if I can do pilates to strengthen my muscles and even suggesting a ""Return to Run"" plan once he seems fit. Highly recommend to anyone who requires any medical attention to their legs!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107038317864141396219/reviews
WILLIAM-MYLES TAN GUO LIANG @ TAN YI CANG _,5,Went to Aaron for jumpers knee and he immediately knew that my old shoes were worn out causing stress on my knee. He recommended the hoka arahi 7s which help provide the stability for my training. Would recommend the shoes and Aaron.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116300073156385540599/reviews

Jo Y,5,"I met Aaron due to pain on my left foot. During the session, Aaron was meticulous in forming and explaining the diagnosis (plantar fasciitis). He taught me some at-home exercises and stretches, which have helped my condition. He also recommended insoles to provide additional support for my feet. I’m looking forward to making a full recovery!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103309829488743749623/reviews
