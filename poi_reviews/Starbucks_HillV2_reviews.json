When I asked the counter where is our order ...and the guy was surprised.  And ask the malay lady.. what is our order. As a customer they must be aware and  attentive to all customers.. Please inform them be more attentive and don't give excuses that they throw the receipt.  It's not acceptable as a customer.",

Interior decor is simple, nothing spectacular likely due to its neighborhood location.",

The baristas are helpful and maintain a pretty calm demeanor towards the guests. I can spend time in meetings and discussions, too.",
