JJ D'Aurora,5,"An excellent eye clinic. I was having some issues with floaters obstructing my vision, which were making me quite nervous. Both the staff and doctors helped to diagnose my issues and give me the confidence that I'd be okay. Their explanations of the issue were clear and concise. I definitely feel better in their care.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104582997574142895216/reviews
Kenan Monteiro,5,"Underwent the Trans-PRK surgery for both my eyes with W Eye Clinic, and received stellar service from start to finish! Dr Nah and all his staff were professional, warm and helpful throughout the experience, and the results speak for itself. My eyes have recovered extremely well, and I owe them all a great deal of gratitude for it. Trips to their clinic at Suntec were always quick and efficient, overall a superb experience.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100924509146312204349/reviews
R,5,"I did my vision correction in this clinic 3 months ago. I think it's a best decision I've ever made! Dr Nah and his team are very professional.

And I agree that Dr Nah's voice is very calming, it helped to stay focus during the surgery",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115528137312741284444/reviews
Zhi Kuang Thong,5,"Did my Trans PRK with Dr. Nah here, whom genuinely cares for his patients' well being.
He persuaded me to stop pursuing the surgery the moment he found out my cornea was drooping out of the norm, which means losing a potential customer when he could just went ahead with it as I was bent on getting it done.
Lucky for me it was temporary and i got the surgery done in good hands.
The staffs were very friendly and helpful as well.

Highly recommended to get your vision correction done here!",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105677738924848051165/reviews
Eunice Law,5,"Did lazic surgery to correct my vision last month. I tend to get very nervous when something touches my eye, but staff was very friendly and assured me lots with the whole procedure - pre surg, surg and post surg consultation. The staff for the surgery even let me hold a stress ball and her hand during the surgery because of how nervous/anxious I was ðŸ˜…. My vision is perfect now, thank you Dr. Nah and team!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113560861296406256175/reviews
