Adeline Lim,3,"The steakhouse offers a nice interior design with a cozy, casual dining vibe. However, it’s not ideal for date nights but works for gatherings with friends due to its slightly noisy atmosphere. The steak was expertly prepared and tasted great, but the overall experience didn’t feel worth the price.

One downside was the limited selection of accompaniments for the steak—only one type of sauce was provided. The chef recommended the Daily Baked Bread Selection ($14), which I feel there’s nothing to shout about. Additionally, as my partner and I don’t drink alcohol, we clearly stated this while ordering, yet we were repeatedly asked if we’d like wine with each course. This persistent offer felt a bit intrusive and detracted from the experience.

Another issue was the presence of houseflies near the entrance where we were seated. It was quite unpleasant and disrupted the dining ambiance.

Overall, while the food was of good quality, the lack of a premium atmosphere, combined with service and environmental issues, makes it unlikely we will return. There are other steakhouses offering comparable food with a better ambiance and attention to detail. This place is best suited for casual dinners or informal gatherings.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115027007743436619320/reviews
Andre Lim,3,Underwhelming dining experience considering how highly rated this restaurant is. Food is okay; only 1 dish stood out to be excellent. Atmosphere is not good because there is only 1 main dining section and it becomes very loud. Price of dining is overpriced. Would not be visiting again.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103568059360862508887/reviews
Vin W,5,"Great set lunch with a good variety of options. Rib eye was cooked perfectly, but a bit too thin to my liking.
Excellent service and lovely ambience made for a wonderful dining experience.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109263427873687540100/reviews
Aaron Liew,5,"It was an amazing experience last night!

Great selections of wine especially from Argentina to complete your dining experience.

Perfect doneness of our “Robbins Island” wagyu bone in striploin and smartly executed side dishes. Getting a ‘Tres Leche’ milk cake IS A MUST.

Attentive and warm-welcoming service was another highlight of the night.

Thanks chef and team. You guys are amazing!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113947692696505113564/reviews
vanessac,4,"Beautiful team and atmosphere. We felt very welcoming.

Food was executed well but somehow didnt quite hit the spot for the premium price.

We requested our steak medium well but it came out quite rare. Chef was nice to grill it again for us :)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107668680752316098987/reviews
