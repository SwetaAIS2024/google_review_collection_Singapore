      "text": "Stayed at Bungalow B in June 2024. There are four parking lots next to the chalet, shared btn Bungalow A and B (two assigned lots each). Overall a great place and it was well-equipped with coffee machine, water dispenser, fridge, another chest freezer, 4 rooms (for 9 pax) and 4 toilets. Toiletries and towels are provided too. it was mostly comfortable if not for the living room which was hot as hell. bring your own additional stand fan; it will be well worth it. Mosquitoes are expected since this is ulu Changi, so keep the main door closed as much as you can... Otherwise great service as they will always be prompt to reply to Whatsapp if you face any issues. Photos and video for your consideration, if you're deciding to book.",

The service was good as they called to check in with us on how we were settling into the rooms and also had a staff did the inventory checking for us which gave us a hassle free check in.",
