Lady Morpheus,5,"I was recommended to Dr. Nic by a friend in 2022 and has been seeing him ever since. He's knowledgeable, and Apex has reasonable prices. All my 3 cats see him! :)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100314224516003808214/reviews
Rachel Ong,5,"We visited this vet clinic today with my beloved dog and I cannot speak highly enough of our experience. Receptionists were very welcoming! Everyone was friendly & service was good! They ensured that both our pet and we felt comfortable throughout our visit. They handled my dog with care and gentleness which instantly reassured us that my dog will be in good hands. My dog usually shivers when she visits the clinic but this time she was pretty well behaved because of the staffs!

Doctor Anise is highly skilled and knowledgeable. She also took time to explain my dog’s condition and treatment options after the blood test. Patiently answering all of our questions and addressing any concerns we had.

What truly sets this vet clinic apart is the level of compassion and dedication they demonstrate towards their furry patients and their owners. If you’re looking for a vet clinic where your pet will receive top notch care in a welcoming and compassionate environment, this is the best place! We are incredibly grateful to have found a wonderful place & wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it to anyone in need of veterinary services!

Thank you Mag, Piya, Zuzu & Doctor Anise!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115481134868942091384/reviews
Camille Yeo,5,"Apex Vet is my three dogs’ to-go-to vet clinic (I had dogs for 22 years and tried many vet clinics).

Dr Nicholas is amazing- he is extremely accurate in diagnosis. On top of that, he is meticulous, patient and takes time to listen to our concerns.

Dr Melissa even went the extra mile to give me a call upon learning my puppy did not respond well to medication for kennel cough, although she was not my puppy’s attending doctor. She provided advice over the phone and my puppy got better.

The nurses/ receptionists are extremely efficient. I can simply book an appointment or ask questions via WhatsApp and get a response within minutes.

Thank you Dr Nicholas, Dr Melissa and Team!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108925691334810272359/reviews
John Kuek,1,"I'm extremely disappointed with the counter staff at this establishment.

Despite informing them beforehand of my late arrival (15 minutes), I was forced to wait for so long without any notification or update.

The staff, particularly Madeline, were inconsiderate and rude when I inquired about the wait. I was shocked to learn that I had to wait until all other customers had completed their appointments before being served.

The lack of communication and poor customer service was appalling. I feel sorry for the doctor, who deserves better support staff. Based on my experience, I would strongly advise against visiting this place.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101907752793889500527/reviews
Syarah Shahlan,5,"Wanted to put in a good word for them. Apex was quick with picking up my calls, finding a time slot for me & also allowing me to drop down earlier if my cat’s symptoms got worse which is comforting. Front desk receptionist is super sweet, the vet was detailed and quick with diagnosis. They were thorough and overall very pleasant experience. Would come again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100565754107326426805/reviews
