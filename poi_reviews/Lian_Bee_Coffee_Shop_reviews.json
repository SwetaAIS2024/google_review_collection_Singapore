Have been eating there for 6 years and they operate there for almost 15 years.\n\nWhat so special is their chilli which is their own recipe. Freshly make every day for the soup and the ingredients. Very old school type of food.\n\nBecause of their popularity now, their shop closed very early like before 12pm. Their actual operating hours are 6 am to 2 pm. Highly recommended!!",

Reasonable price, and she was nice. But it’s all self serve.\nOutdoor seating with many fans so it wasn’t that hot. But with many smokers, so if you are like me as a non smoker you’ll find that annoying.",

The latter is being operated by Vietnamese. They are all worth a try.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the stalls are moving elsewhere soon because of the higher rent.\n\nThere are very limited parking space by the road but one can park at the residential carpark nearby.",
