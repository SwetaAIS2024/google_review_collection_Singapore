punyshark,5,"Aji Ichi Sushi Bar is conveniently located on the second level of Changi Airportâ€™s Terminal 4 Hall, right next to the food court.

We just had an incredibly pleasant and mouth-watering dining experience here. The level of service, especially from Ms. Aiyun, was outstanding. She ensured we were well taken care of every step of the way!

The food presentation felt like something out of a Japanese Masterchef Competition and the flavors were just as impressive. The grilled fish head and uni lobster sushi were the star of the show, fresh, flavorful, and simply amazing, even included some fermented ginger and authentic wasabi to cleanse the palette.

Highly recommend for anyone craving high-quality sushi and excellent service at Changi Airport!

We tried the soft shell crab maki, lobster maki, spicy salmon maki and salmon teriyaki donburi and every dish was 10/10.

Alex Kay,5,"The food was gorgeous. Very reasonably priced (depending on what youâ€™re getting, of course).
The quality of sashimi was high and fresh with good flavour.
Lobster Truffle (cold) pasta was FABULOUS, what an incredibly indulgent experience.

The staff and service were delightful, friendly, funny and super accomodating and patient with our large group of 8 diners.

One of my favourite and one of the top dining experiences I had in my 3 weeks of Singapore.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115307901145306877998/reviews
xiaobabiie Tan,5,"Having just returned from an overseas trip, we were craving for something soupy. So the clam rice soup immediate caught our eyes. It was a  delicious comfort food. Soft shell crab rolls were on point as well. My son loved the noodle train. Service was fantastic - sweet and attentive.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109002043293444243386/reviews
