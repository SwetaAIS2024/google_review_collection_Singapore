      "text": "In October 2023, I learned about this community from a stranger. Initially, I went to see the teacher with a mixture of skepticism and curiosity.\n\nWhen I met teacher John, I was not only struggling with my mental and physical health but also dealing with long-term anxiety due to business worries. I was overweight and bloated, and the aftermath of COVID left me with a persistent cough and hoarse voice. These problems had caused me to lose confidence and gradually distance myself from friends over the past few years.\n\nThrough the teacher's natural therapies, all these issues were resolved. In just four months, I lost 10 kg so far and I have regained my confidence and self-esteem.\nMy gratitude to teacher John and the whole community support to make a stronger person and highly recommended this community to everyone.",

      "text": "Lessons conducted, whether online or in-person, has helped me to understand how to use the oils in a useful way in terms of its quality and quantity. John has the wisdom to put the oils together for the study in the improvement of physical and emotional health. The ecology of natural earth is also an important element in the human survival. How it affects the sea and the soil environment affects the end product - the plants and sea animals. These are crucial survival, and the end result is the production of the quality of oils and the continued existence of the sea animals and its in the ocean. The sea animals should not be made to suffer because of our oblivious negligence.We are what we eat and use. The intake of toxins poison us, the natural food intake build strong tissues in us as we \"eat clean and use clean\". John's lessons have led me into this knowledge.",
