Had nasi lemak ($4.50) for breakfast, was normal. Rice was nice with presence of nice coconut milk. Chilli on the sweeter side, can be spicier.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102107525471936198024/reviews
king dex,1,"Was charged $7.50 for  a serving of eggplants, sambal goreng and fried chicken (breast). Very overpriced! Used CDC to pay $8 and the cashier didn't bother to return me $0.50 change.
