Kai,2,"Dudes, you are over extending your menu. If you guys can't handle the vast amount of dishes, cut down your menu.

It's unacceptable that everyone is waiting around for your food. We waited 1hr and 15mins for a breakfast. Had to chase you guys 3 times and you didn't even know where the order was.

I was just one out of the many angry customers.

In the end, my sando was delayed even later than the breakfast and still got the wrong sando I ordered.

Breakfast was super oily, you paper below was not suitable and tore together with the bread. Its not pleasant. Taste was alright.

Taste
Breakfast 2.5/5 (prawn version. Too oily, paper tore.)
Sando 2/5 (2 slices of bread with meat ain't worth 10.90)

Won't be back. Wish yall the best though.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103961412486889059100/reviews
Edwina Pariwono,4,"We had the American Big Breakfast, Sausage and Bacon Rosti, Beef Sando, Smoked Salmon Benedict, and Beef Galbi Tacos. The standout dish was definitely the Beef Galbi Tacos â€“ a must-try! I also really enjoyed the scrambled eggs from the American Big Breakfast. Overall, it was a good experience, enhanced by the lovely vibes and charming pink decor.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110865738734976473001/reviews
Gasper Chan,2,"Very disappointing lobster roll.

The lobster roll basically tasted like garlic bread with tartar sauce. You will be hard-pressed to find and lobster meat in it. The oysters they sold were relatively fresh which saved it from a 1 star rating.

Would not recommend the lobster roll at all.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116187504655013802323/reviews

AllenChin,1,"Your rosti is trash. Go touch,taste and review your rosti. Its thin.. flat.. burnt and tasteless. Your sour cream sauce is.... tasteless.. please.. give some respect to honest customers. Even a instant rosti taste much better. Can't do it right then don't sell rosti please.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914453152482586048/reviews
