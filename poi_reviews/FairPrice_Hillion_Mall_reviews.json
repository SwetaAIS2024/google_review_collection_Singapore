      "text": "Bought two packs of rice in store (by 榮记) S$4.95 + S$3.80.  Packings looked nice, portions normal, some bones 鸡肉和鸭肉很多骨，义烧蛮硬，chicken not tender compared to 榮记own store at 680143,  if compared to the store at 680016.... good to try for this first time only.   A little bit warm,  store did not provide heating when asked. Tried to make hot at home, chilli and sauces provided are good though.  Overall,  can only say, lacklustre.  Hope to see some improvements.   18/09/2023 Mon 1400 Singapore",

She rudely with her high tone voice mentioned you're not member mah, got write there for members. She was literally shouting till other customers also looked at us. I felt really embarrassed getting shouted by her. I've seen her doing the same thing when someone stucked at self check out counter. We're paying money for the goods, but the attitude given by the staff is really unacceptable.",
