      "text": "Referring to the only Indian Stall and Thai Food joint (Alisa Mahal Indian food) —\n\nOrdered hokkien mee and had to wait for 30mins but when we got home 5 mins later ,what we got was bland fried mee hoon mixed with yellow mee. Came back to the shop to ask for a refund but the cook became defensive and angry, even shouted across while cooking saying that the soup of the hokkien mee is already soaked. Indian ladyboss wasn’t willing to hear out my feedback and walked away with a sour face. I overheard the ladyboss told the cook to not entertain me if I were to patronise again. I understand that there is only 1 person cooking and it was really busy with a long queue, but it definitely is not fair to cook like rubbish! We are equally paying for the food and waited patiently but only made me lost appetite when I open the food box. Will never return and will never recommend because both boss and staff attitude is VERY BAD.",
