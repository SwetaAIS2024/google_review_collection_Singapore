Janice Tan,5,"My Art Space studio, easily accessible by both bus and MRT and surrounded by calming greenery and glass walls, created a truly inspiring environment for learning.
I joined a one-day sketching workshop that provided a foundation in basic watercolour washes and sketching, as well as a full-day Malaysia art excursion. This included fully guided sketching sessions at scenic locations such as charcoal factory, Kukup fishing village, and a fruit farm.
Mr. Chankerk, our patient trainer, provided clear guidance, encouraging us to sketch what we saw and felt in the moment, revealing hidden beauty and making the learning process enjoyable. It was also great to meet new friends who share the same interests.
The double rainbow and sunset was beautiful and this trip brought us precious memories.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107393156709282041384/reviews
Val Kwan,5,"Attended a sketching workshop with Chankerk, followed by a 1 day sketching tour to Kukup. Thoroughly enjoyed this:) What I liked best was that besides teaching techniques, Chankerk shares with us the spirit and emotions behind art and sketching, something I haven't experienced with other sketching classes or YouTube videos. He also respectfully challenges the way we think, which impacts the way we see and do art, this was interesting and intriguing. The immersive experience of sketching on the spot was also really unique and I can't wait to sketch in my holiday next month:)",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109787746822284352374/reviews
Allison Teo,5,"I started my journey with My Art Space in February 2024 after being inspired by two friends who coincidentally attended lessons at My Art Space. It’s been my hope to be able to try oil and acrylic after using poster colours during school days decades ago, but I didn’t know where and how to begin. At My Art Space, I was taught to use monochromatic approach to develop the painting. From a single warm or cool colour to get the undertones and shades developed before adding colours. It’s a useful study for you to appreciate the depth and space of the work. The last one year has been an exciting and fulfilling journey rolled into one as each painting is venturing into an unknown where you will not be able to predict the outcome. Yet there is certain amount of control as you chip at your masterpiece and moulding it in the way that you appreciate it. I truly appreciated the space to connect with like-minded friends and a space to connect with myself at My Art Space.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103528808734086955745/reviews
Daphne Ang,5,"I joined a sketching workshop and art excursion with Chankerk and Kelvin. It was perspective-changing and impactful. I thoroughly enjoyed myself.

Over the years, I have sporadically signed up for various art classes around Singapore as a leisure activity. Typically, I would follow what the instructor told me to do—a technique would be taught, and the class would follow along. At the end of the day, it was a nice experience, but I moved on with my busy life and never really revisited it again.

But this art excursion was truly eye-opening for me. I kept having lightbulb moments, thinking, “Oh yeah, this is what art should be about!” Words can’t fully describe the value this class has brought me. I found that I looked at things differently after the class.

Although I haven’t had a chance to sketch on my own yet, I find myself really looking forward to it. I now enjoy the process itself, unlike before when I was more obsessed with the outcome in other classes. Back then, it sometimes started to feel like work. But after this art excursion, I found myself looking at things differently—feeling more curious and eager to explore.

I think this is a highly valuable and enriching experience that’s rare to find in Singapore. Besides that, I found the lesson and the entire Malaysia day trip to be very well-organized - involving good food, fruits and great company. I can’t recommend it enough—5 stars!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102256918954594909450/reviews
Gitika Masand,5,"A hidden gem in the heart of the city! This art studio is nestled amidst lush greenery, with glass walls that create a beautiful sense of openness and connection with nature. What truly sets this space apart is the diverse teaching approach—each instructor brings their own unique style of guidance, knowing when to lean in and when to step back, allowing you to fully immerse and evolve as an artist. Highly recommend it to anyone on a journey of artistic growth and self-discovery!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100731179744416746033/reviews
