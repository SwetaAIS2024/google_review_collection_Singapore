      "text": "Atmospheric coffee bar; they even capitalized on actual rust for the front facade. If I am not mistaken this used to be an actual retro Chye Seng Huat Hardware store which has been preserved. I tried their cappuccino Throwback (House blend) with notes of caramel and hazlenut which was creamy and lovely - I loved that they don't charge more for oat milk option -- and a pistachio lemon loaf which is not what I would normally have for breakfast. I ordered some takeaway croissants and pain au chocolat, a milky way croissant with white chocolate and chocolate dusting, and some muffins that came with a cute paperbag for an extra 30cents.\n\nThe waitstaff are attentive and efficient. The vibe feels like Brooklyn hipster industrial with a moody warmth from edison light bulbs splashes of chrome and steel and wood barstools and midcentury style chairbacks. There is outdoor seating as well which I think would be especially lovely at night. I included screenshots from their ordering site, as it was well designed and user friendly.",

The service reminds me of a chain store experience, the ambiance more than makes up for it. The location is stunningly beautiful, uniquely charming, and perfect for anyone seeking photogenic spots to enjoy a cup of coffee.",

We came here after a heavy dinner, so we didn't try other food.\n\nThe seating is limited for big group, and outside seats are not sheltered, so overall, it is a small cafe.",

I liked it. The barista who prepared my coffee looked very professional and skilled.\n\nYou have the option to seat inside or outside. Because of the summer heat, I stayed inside.\n\nThey encourage to order via the QR code that leads you to their website where you can order and pay.\n\nSmooth and informative service. Not too crowded too.\n\nHighly recommend.",
