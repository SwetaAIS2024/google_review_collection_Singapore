      "text": "I had a late check-in on March 31, 2025. It took a bit of extra time to locate the property, as the hotel's name differed from what was listed on Tiket.com and the signage was not very clear. Clearer identification would be helpful, especially for first-time guests.\n\nThe room and bathroom were clean and generally comfortable. However, throughout the stay, housekeeping service was minimal. Towels were replaced, but the room was not cleaned, and the bed was left unmade, which was a little disappointing.\n\nThe reception staffâ€™s demeanor felt rather reserved, and a more welcoming attitude would have improved the overall experience.\n\nOn a positive note, the hotel is located in a quiet area, which is suitable for rest and relaxation. It may also be a convenient choice for Muslim travelers due to the surrounding amenities. However, for tourists new to Singapore, the location might be slightly less ideal as it is a bit removed from the city center and major attractions.\n\nWhile there are some strengths, particularly in cleanliness and peacefulness, there is room for improvement in terms of service and guest communication.",
