Coffee is served in generously sized cups.\n\nI tried the green tea latte and americano, but they weren‚Äôt particularly impressive. However, I wouldn‚Äôt mind returning if I‚Äôm in the area.\n\nThe net pricing is a great bonus, though seating is quite limited.",

Cake taste good & coffee decent and portion is generous Prices are similar with most cafe out there. Next time should try out their bread as I saw there were lots of orders of the pastries while queuing.\n\nI would like to visit the cafe more often.\n\nThe cashier lady compliment to my favourite skirt really cheer my day up. :)",
