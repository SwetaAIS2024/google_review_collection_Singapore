Eunice Mok,5,"I had an exceptional experience with Dr Wong. From my first consultation to post-op care, I felt informed, supported, and in the hands of a truly skilled professional. Dr. Wong explained everything clearly, answered all my questions, and never made me feel rushed.
The surgery went smoothly, and my recovery has been better than expected. I felt listened to and cared for every step of the way.
If you're looking for a surgeon who combines expertise with compassion, I can’t recommend Dr Wong enough.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113547789416422804483/reviews
serene,5,"Dr Wong is an exceptional colon surgeon!
My colonoscopy and gastrointestinal check-ups were completely painless, thanks to his expertise and advanced technology.
He explained everything clearly, easing my anxiety, and the sedation was smooth—I woke up feeling great.
Dr Wong is compassionate, thorough, and takes time to discuss results and provide actionable advice. His team is professional and friendly, and the clinic is well-organized.
If you need gastrointestinal care, I highly recommend Dr Wong  for a stress-free, painless experience.
Thank you for such outstanding care!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105701763791186828595/reviews

liping,5,"My GP referred me to Dr Wong on 4-Jan. I called Dr Wong’s clinic on 6-Jan morning and was lucky to get a first consult on same day morning. Within the same week we completed my endoscopy and colonoscopy. I have high anxiety when it comes to doctors appointments regardless of specialty. Dr Wong is the first doctor of such seniority who managed to ease my anxiety from Day 1 until the day I was discharged. During the entire 2-week journey with Dr Wong, I always felt that I am in good hands, he knows what he’s doing, he is confident while at the same time speak to me in layman terms that I can connect with as a human who knows nothing about endoscopy and colonoscopy. In 2 weeks I managed to gain assurance about my stomach/intestine health and the appropriate nutritional needs. Thank you Dr Wong!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111485291801515720530/reviews
