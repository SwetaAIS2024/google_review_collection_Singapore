      "text": "This stall is located inside the Kopitiam on the 2nd floor of Yew Tee place, right opposite the drinks stall.\nFirst off I was expecting really horrible inedible food considering the abysmal 1 star reviews - so having tasted their Hokkien Mee I can say it's honestly quite OK. Yes prices are quite high considering the portion and location, and yes the guy working there looks like he hates his job and can't be bothered when cooking, but the taste is actually quite decent and in line with other Old Hup Kees.\nFrom the other reviewers it seems like the quality depends on who is working that day, so for reference this was based on an order at Saturday lunchtime.",

      "text": "Their FRIED KWAY TEOW is nicely cooked and flavored. Balanced sweetness and spiciness. Less cockles but I noticed that there is a considerable amount of thinly sliced lap cheong (Chinese sausage) and thin slices of fish cake. I liked it that there is generous amount of mung bean sprouts which definitely adds crunch and texture to the dish. There is a help yourself different types sambal chilies and a tub of lime (calamansi) should you fancy adding more to suit your taste.\n\nFRIED OYSTER is cooked according to my liking. The oysters are well-cooked yet retain their juiciness.",
