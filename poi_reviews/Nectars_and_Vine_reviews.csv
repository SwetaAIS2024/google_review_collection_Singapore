Matthew Hood,3,"I first went to Nectars and Vine around 9 years ago. One of the great things about the place back then was the wide range of beers and wines  available from around the world. It has recently changed management and now has less than half of the beers and wines available. Prices seem to have increased significantly also. They now do their own bar food and luckily you can still bring in food from outside. Despite these changes, the atmosphere was still decent on the Saturday evening I attended.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115202189198812557587/reviews
Keane Ang,2,This place has seen better days. Craft beer selection is very limited and the fridges are stocked very slowly. Aircon is not strong enough sometimes. Prices have also increased but still patronise this with my friends because the atmosphere is relaxed and is one of the few limited options around the neighbourhood.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116693435658232805445/reviews
Jamie [JKBS],3,"Hope to visit this place when it’s fully refurbished & renovated. Previous there was a lot of selections for the beers.
Currently must be the upcoming changes the beer selections were lesser. But no worries as it’s still a great hang out place with friends for drinks .",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107954436929098254033/reviews
