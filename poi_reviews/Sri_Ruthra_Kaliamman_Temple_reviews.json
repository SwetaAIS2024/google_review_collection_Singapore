      "text": "Singapore is heaven on earth where all races live in unison under the magical spell of Almighty God. Singapore history is amazing how it has emerged from British colony to modern smart city without loosing the Asian Culture Heritage. The Tamils who contributed for Singapore growth is rooted deeply on worshiping Goddess supreme Mother who has incarnates in various forms. Kali is the form of divine Mother who intercedes in the devotees life to bestow best gifts for righteous people. Ruthira Kaliamman founded by humble labourers who were doing brick works in JLN Bukit Merah now emerged as a spiritual community emanating divine aura in Depot Road vicinity. It is a must visit place for those who would like to experience the divine within our hearts. The temple band team Natheswaram player Vinod will mend our mind to steadfast in spritual path through his tunes. Best time to visit during closing prayers at 8:30 PM to 9:00 PM and rest assured Vinodh will make us spell bound with his music emanating the vibration of Ustadh Bismillah Khan‚Äôs Shenoy Ragas. Yaman is called Kalyani and Vinodh plays Hindustani version of Hamir Kalyani to melt our hearts to surrender to Almighty. Om Sakthi. Ranga Ranga Ranga.",
