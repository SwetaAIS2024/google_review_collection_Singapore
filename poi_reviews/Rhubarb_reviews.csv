Jeffrey Yeo,5,"We had a great time with all the good food and service. Really worth coming especially for special events.

Love the bread, the soup, scallop, veal and portion, especially for the starters, were generous.

Also love the lovely gesture by the team to prepare nice birthday surprise for my partner :)

This restaurant really prides herself on great food as the chef took great attention to guests’ feedback and experience in the restaurant. Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105265990653234543998/reviews
Sharon Chan,1,"One of the worst meals I’ve ever had – and I’m still haunted by the experience two years later.

From the plating to the actual flavours, everything fell flat. The starter featured raw fish that was overly fishy and unbearably salty. The scallop tasted like it had been simply boiled, then topped with some caviar and a strange popcorn foam – it felt random and unrefined. The beef course was bizarre, paired with a sweet raspberry foam that completely clashed with the meat. As for dessert, it was nothing more than ice cream with some fruits and nata de coco – unimaginative and lazy.

The only redeeming part of the meal? The bread.

Unfortunately, this was one of my most memorable birthday meals for all the wrong reasons. I would not recommend Rhubarb to anyone – it’s baffling how this place holds a Michelin star.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103378126368300989537/reviews
Little Cato,5,"For an elegant French dining experience, Rhubarb Le Restaurant is a very lovely place. Its refined dishes, personalized service, and cozy atmosphere make it a standout.

Eileen Lee,4,"The food is very salty to me and my husband. Especially the monkfish. Good starter and bread. A bit disappointing on the dessert and cheese. If you are looking for French cuisine fine dining, There are better choices in this area. Atmosphere is good but normal service. Can see the difference when the waiter is treating regular customers and the new customers. One good thing is free corkage on Tuesday, it’s good value to bring your own wine.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109671306650676166348/reviews
Richard,4,"The food is excellent, and the chef is very attentive. Our favourite was the emulsion with black truffle and rhubarb bits

The service crew tried their best, but felt under-polished for a 1-Michelin star establishment

A wine-pairing would be welcome especially given the omekase style menu.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104670179118295119042/reviews
