      "text": "Rating: 4/5\n\nOverview: Tucked inside a boutique clothing store at Orchard, Plain Vanilla offers a cozy hideaway from the busy retail scene. It’s a charming, minimalist space that blends fashion and café culture into one understated experience.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat coffee & pastries: The quality lives up to Plain Vanilla’s reputation—smooth, well-brewed coffee and a small but delightful selection of pastries and baked goods.\n\nChic ambiance: Stylish and thoughtfully designed, the space feels intimate, with a warm blend of natural wood and soft lighting that matches the boutique setting.\n\nHidden gem vibe: Being part of a clothing shop makes it feel like a secret spot—perfect for a quick, quiet break.\n\nCons:\n\nVery limited seating: Only around 4–5 small tables, typically for two people. It’s not ideal for groups or long stays, and seating might not always be available.\n\nCompact layout: While cozy, the limited space means it's more suitable for a short visit than a full sit-down café experience.\n\nConclusion: Plain Vanilla at Orchard is a lovely, curated spot for a quality coffee and pastry break, especially if you enjoy quiet, well-designed spaces. Just be prepared for limited seating and a quick stop rather than a full café session.",

The friendly staff made me feel welcome right away.\n\nI tried the strawberry white chocolate cupcake, and it was absolutely delicious ,perfectly sweet and rich. Paired with a cappuccino that was equally amazing, it was the perfect treat.\n\nWith a great variety of cupcakes as well as proper meals to have a nice brunch to pair with the drinks, I can’t wait to go back! Highly recommend!",
