I had the Mentaiko Fries, Rib Eye, and Samyang Prawn Pasta‚Äîall were super shiok!\n\nThe Mentaiko Fries were crispy and loaded with flavour, the Rib Eye was juicy and tender, and the Samyang Prawn Pasta had a nice spicy kick with fresh, juicy prawns * perfect if you are samyang ramyeon lover üòç\n\nAffordable, delicious, and so worth it. Definitely one of the best hawker stalls I‚Äôve been to. Will be back for more!",

There was a weird aftertaste from the patty as well.\n\nThe pulled beef fries tasted decent, but the beef was slightly tough and the amount of meat on the fries was very little.\n\nWould not recommend this particular meal combo.",
