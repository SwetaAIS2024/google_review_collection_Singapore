I would highly recommend for South indian meal, Kothu chicken, Tandoori chicken, Kothu Partha, Murtabak.\n\n29 Apr 2025:\nI just want to comment again,indeed a hidden gem. Veg south indian meals and boneless chicken and mutton is awesome. Honestly you don't need more that for good lunch.",

Personally I really liked the taste, flavour and quality. Also, tried chicken fry, which is also very good. Menu is limited, because of their new setup, hope they come up many items soon.\n\nGood service and will look to visit again.",

Not only were the pratas crispy, but they were also more aromatic than the ones in the neighbourhood. For an extra $1, you can get their freshly brewed masala milk tea, which we enjoyed as well. The owners were friendly, inquired about our preferred sugar level for the drink, and also sought feedback on their food. We definitely see ourselves coming back for more.",
