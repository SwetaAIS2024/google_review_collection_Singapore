SZ Lim,3,"Super duper traditional kind of western food. It has those old school taste that you rarely find nowadays.

Ordered the chicken cutlet at 8.50, got fries, coleslaw, red beans, a huge slab of cutlet, and 2 packets of chilli sauce.

Personally, I found the cutlet to be huge, but unfortunately there was no sauce to complement it. Some stalls will provide tartar / mayo sauce.

Taste wise was so so. Red beans are chilled, which is something new to me as usually they are served hot. But I kind of liked it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114108831723577323443/reviews
Sharon Wee,3,"Came across this stall and supported the old couples. Their food I would say are fresh and old school kind. I feel the price not worth as both fish and chip are very thin. Payment only by cash.
Fish and chip: crispy, ginger taste abit strong
Chicken cutlets: crispy and good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100495807246222479325/reviews

Sylver Mini,5,"Look at size of the pork chop slab! Would consider it reasonable value for money at $7.50. It was cooked just right, tender & juicy. The fries are freshly deep-fried, & coleslaw has a slight tangy-ness to it, yummy! Friendly stallholders, offering old school style dishes. Service is considered fast as dish is only cooked upon order. Came at off-peak hours post lunch, no crowd or queue. Do support them when in the area!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118352199448385101725/reviews
