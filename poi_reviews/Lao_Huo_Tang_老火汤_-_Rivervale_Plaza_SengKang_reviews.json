      "text": "I am really hesitant to leave this review but I had to. I am a frequent customer, been served by a lady who always wears a black mask and never greeted customer, wait for customer greets her instead and always frowned when I was just ordering my food. Once she rejected my coins and took my big note, just to return me with even more coins and waved angrily wanted me to leave.\nMy pig stomach soup only had one gingko today. While when I was served by another lady, I got a very satisfying amount of gingko. If I had not been served by other people, I would assume the food is always so pathetic. Really ruins my appetite sometimes because of this.\nLove the service by laobanniang though whenever she's around. But I dread ordering from the stall because of this staff.",
