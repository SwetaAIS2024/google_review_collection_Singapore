      "text": "I visited this place on a Friday evening during peak hours, and I was pleasantly surprised to find plenty of seating available. Here‚Äôs my breakdown:\n\nüçΩÔ∏è  Taste:\nAll the dishes were incredibly delicious. My personal favorites were the Chao Ta Mee Hoon and Clams with Garlic ‚Äì both were bursting with flavor and expertly prepared. I genuinely enjoyed every bite.\n\nüí≤ Prices:\nFor an airport dining spot, the prices are quite reasonable. They‚Äôre just slightly more expensive than what you‚Äôd pay at a typical Ze Char stall in local coffeeshops. Considering the cosy, air-conditioned setting, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs great value for money.\n\n‚≠êÔ∏è Service:\nThe staff were polite and friendly, making the experience even more pleasant. I also appreciated that there was no hard selling ‚Äì just genuine, warm service.\n\nüòä Ambience:\nThe restaurant is quiet, clean, and cosy. It‚Äôs a perfect spot to relax and enjoy a meal without the usual hustle and bustle of airport dining areas.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for tasty food at reasonable prices with great service and a comfortable atmosphere. I‚Äôll definitely be back!",

Bright and clean. The staff will inform you that the noodle and rice portion are meant for single pax but is good enough for 2 small eaters. I like the fried rice, tasty and favorful.  Decent for the taizi bee hoon. Rest of dishes are decent too. A decent and quiet place for chinese food. Price is reasonable in airport context. Overall a pleasant dining experience.",

The restaurant has received positive reviews for its delicious food.\n\nWhile the restaurant currently accepts cash and credit card payments, one suggestion for a better payment method is to implement a mobile payment system and could order via scanning the QR code.\n\nThis would offer customers a more convenient and secure way to pay, especially in today's digital age. Additionally, it could help streamline the payment process and reduce wait times, improving the overall dining experience.",
