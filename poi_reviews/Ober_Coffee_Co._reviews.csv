Samantha,5,"Dropped by this cafe for a small lunch as I wasnâ€™t that hungry. Ordered a fizzy lemonade and tuna sandwich which came up to $7.20. Not too bad considering the location. The fizzy lemonade was refreshing. The tuna sandwich had a moderate amount of tuna - so good overall.

Environment is peaceful with warm sunlight (place is air-conditioned). Very comfortable. Seats are nicely spaced so it doesnâ€™t feel crowded. Staff are friendly and patient.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105796657891882724192/reviews
LC Lim,5,"Coffee isn't half bad, but the fact that there's a quiet space to pull out my laptop and type away in the ever so hectic Harbourfront is enough for me to leave a 5-star rating ðŸ« ",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101932894013527297653/reviews
Emily Woo,4,"I discovered this cafÃ© only this morning totally by chance. Ober Coffee Co serves nice coffee,teas,juices and also pastries. I like the vibe. Nice piped-in music amidst a cosy setting on the ground level of  Harbourfront Tower One next to FDC Family Dental Clinic.

Unfortunately,today,28/6/23,is their last day in business till 14h00 so drop by to grab your coffee(they offer 1 for 1 today!)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111609423484046239616/reviews
Yiyang Yuan,5,"I chanced upon this place while waiting for my dentist next door. The people running it seem glad about what they do.
I had a cup of flat white. It's above average. The place is clean, air-conditioned. The seat at the corner has power sockets available below.
It's sadly empty on Friday 1:45pm. The folks probably hadn't advertised it enough.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105498104027717607708/reviews
EarthlingA,4,Good coffee. Had an Americano as they don't offer any drip coffee. I like the sleek and clean design. Quiet and conducive for reading/quiet time with a good enough cup of machine coffee. :),2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113151778954839386324/reviews
