BuB,5,"Experience that I have not had for so long visiting an optician.  I went back to Optical 88 after recommendation (although I don't stay in the area). Ms.Joey Teoh took the time to understand purpose of use and requirement. Within minutes she had laid out about ten frames in various style, type and price that perfectly matched my tastes

The eye and sight tests were impressively efficient, yet thorough. Joey demonstrated the differences between “progressive lifestyle” and “progressive work” lenses so clearly that I felt confident with the right option for my daily routine. She handled every technical requirement measurements, fitting considerations, lens coatings and patiently explained before I approved and made payment.

Now I’m already looking forward for the collection day.  Will update again once I’ve tested them in real life, but based on Joey's expertise, I’m confident my vision needs will be perfectly met. Highly recommend!

Pat Lau,5,"I had a very pleasant experience making my new specs here. I was served by Raymond Wang, who has solid experience as an optometrist. He is also very patient and helpful. After going through the available options, I chose a comfortable EGG frame with Zeiss progressive lenses. I just collected my specs today and I'm glad I decided to get them done here at Optical 88 Jurong Point! Kudos to Raymond and team!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108902245326044435574/reviews
Nicholas Yeow,5,"I had the pleasure of meeting Raymond Wang, his service was top notch and his knowledge on glasses and experience with different lens were outstanding.

He took his time to allow me to try on different combinations. I have experienced such great service in my time at optical 88 and I will be back again.

I had made a pair of sunglasses with prescription, and the lens coloured was customised tint and it fitted my sunglasses designs well.

I totally loved it! Thank you! Will recommend to come back for any eyeglasses and lens concerns!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108190772611522474303/reviews
