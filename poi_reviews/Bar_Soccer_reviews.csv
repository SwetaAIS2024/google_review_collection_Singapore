Lego Youen,5,"Found this gem at Kallang Wave Mall today. I was looking for restaurant with outdoor seating.
This is definitely a kid friendly restaurant where a lot of kid activities can be found in the restaurant for free. They have a giant billiard for football playing (quite interesting), TV games street flight (my old school type but very nice), dart.
The staff are very friendly and even teach my son how to play dart. The service is good.
The food is nice and value for money. We ordered lunch set, it came with drink and dessert.
Though it’s lunch time, but not crowded. Probably due to the location is quite hidden, not facing to Mall but outside. We will definitely come back to visit again. Highly recommended!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110504912448898586092/reviews

LameCarrot,1,"I am a frequent bar goer but this is worst bar I have ever been to.

The place was cramp without much seats. I had pasta which made me miss the pasta I had in Italy even more. It was so bland and far from the authentic version.

We had a group of 11 people. We were there for almost an hour supporting our friend’s gig/performance but was forced to move out of the bar because they have another 11 pax coming in. It was not like we have stopped ordering food/drinks, occupying seats.

Would never come back unless my friend really have to gig there again.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116795131383853594631/reviews
Angela Lim,5,"My company had booked Bar Soccer for our anniversary event. The Bar Soccer Team had provided all the support we needed for our company event from planning till the event day and a big shoutout to Lina, the Bar Manager for accommodating to all our needs on the day itself.

The food is delicious and there is a karaoke system. Our members had fun throughout the event with a cute pool table stage and also dart machine.

Will come back casually for a drink and have fun.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116073207382993378102/reviews
