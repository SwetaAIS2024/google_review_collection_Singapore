Mayumi Honma,5,"This is a beautiful corner forest with a variety of tree species.

The balance is figurative like a painting,
I thought it was planted with great thought.

I looked for a path that I could walk inside.
Just enough to see the cobblestones
It didn't feel like anyone was inside.

I'm afraid of small animals, including snakes.
I couldn't walk inside.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109106734958622485229/reviews
