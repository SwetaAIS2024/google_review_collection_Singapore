      "text": "Came here on a Friday afternoon and had the ‚ÄúSicilian Journey‚Äù 5 course taster menu and was thoroughly impressed. I try not to give too many 5 star reviews but my lunch was faultless. Service was very attentive and ambience was great.\n\nRegarding the food, the highlight for me from the menu in my opinion was the prawn and truffle ravioli, which was creamy without being overpoweringly rich (I could have drunk the sauce like a soup it was so tasty). Also the dessert was an  amazing finish to the meal, the tart having a perfect texture to it providing just the right amount of bite and complementing the other textures on the plate including the beautifully constructed mini Italian meringues which I loved. Also the red berry sauce giving a perfect offset to the nuttiness of the pistachio cream.\n\nSurprised that this place was not so busy given the quality of the food and without naming any names the offering here is far superior than other comparable restaurants in the area. Will for sure come back again with another group and this time try the wine pairing.",

      "text": "The Mister brought me here for my birthday treat. Very friendly service team. Food was tasty. I especially enjoyed the scallop carpaccio and pumpkin flan. Swapped the tagliatelle for an uni pasta for an additional 18$. I preferred the la Norma (husband had that instead; but he preferred the uni!) Found the uni pasta a little too heavy and rich. Wagyu short ribs was melt-in-your-mouth perfect. Worth coming for special occasions. üòä\n\nI wish they had more reasonable prices for their wine. The bottle we had, we found online for a third of the price. üòì will avoid ordering alcohol next time!",

Not Sicilian, though, cause I have never been there before.\nThe pistachio tart was so ‚Äòpistachio‚Äô, love it.",

The crew in Gattopardo was lovely and friendly. Loved every course that I had. They were tasty! The wine was lovely as well. They have a great selection of Sicilian wines. Had such a wonderful time dining, I would definitely come back to try different set menu‚Äôs next time.",
