Teresa Lu,5,"I purchased a luggage from TangsVivo (Atrium) today, and I found the products offered there to be highly worthwhile and durable.

The prices on the brand items were very reasonable, making the shopping experience even more enjoyable.

I was particularly impressed by the significant discount available at the store. Additionally, the excellent customer service and attentiveness of the staff member really stood out; provided thorough explanations of the product, which greatly enhanced my understanding of the brand and its offerings.

Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience, and I look forward to returning in the future!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114688705357908585581/reviews
Yellow Bear,5,"Went to TANGS for some window shopping as my friend was late again as usual. I totally had no intention to buy anything since I don’t need anything.

Was browsing the accessories section and was approached by the Retail Staff Tan Chin Yean, who was friendly and gave me excellent service. I was happy with her service and bought a nice looking ring from her.
The cashier Noor Ain Hafizah who served me was friendly and efficient as well.

Happy for TANGS Department Store to have such great employees, who are well trained in their jobs and provide great customer service.

** the names are found on the receipt, I hope the names are correct.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489311735261065689/reviews

Scribbling Geek,5,"Shopped for shirts here last week and it was a great experience. The promoter was extremely helpful and quick, without ever being pushy. Loved the new layout too. It’s airier and brighter, with a wide entrance that allows you to see many of the brands TANGS is carrying. Would definitely come here again to shop; by the way, I got two Cote Opera shirts for a great price. Believe young families would enjoy shopping here too. There’s quite a lot of kids’ brands and apparel, like Miffy and Hegen.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111562642484326521942/reviews
shukery96,1,"As usual and same with Tangs at Tang Plaza, the middle age salesperson aunties manning the brands selection were very pushy and almost rude. They have the audacity to treat their customers without any respect or space – just pushing to hit their KPI sales I guess.

The only saving grace for Tang's customer services are the fragrances and perfumes section at Tang Plaza that have YOUNGER brand and sales associates.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104253389705343385643/reviews
