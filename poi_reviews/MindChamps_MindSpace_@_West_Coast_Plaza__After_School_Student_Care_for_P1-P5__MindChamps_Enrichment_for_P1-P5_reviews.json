The Centre Director, Ms Jas, is compassionate and able to manage the teachers and centre well. Teachers, Ms Siti and Ms Husna, are capable and passionate in teaching. I see improvement in my child's both academic and holistic development. Its a good learning and safe space for kids to be in after school. Dont need additional tuition. ðŸ™‚ Even the cleaning auntie has amazing personality and kind to the kids. Always tirelessly cleaning the centre. Very dedicated. The centre is very clean. Good hygiene level.",
