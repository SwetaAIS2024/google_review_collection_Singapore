Annie Chow,5,"New: Korean Food stall. I tried Army Stew today. It was delicious but pricey at $18.80 by coffeeshop standards. I would like to taste kimbap and their other menu items.

You must try chicken bolognese and mushroom aglio olio of TenderBest. You can alternate this western food choice with Chinese econ rice, northern chinese style steamed / fried dumplings with plenty of nittrr gourds n spinach for healthier choice, and treat yourself to delicious lontong & mee sam at the Halal stall. Don't expect good service at drink stall but their black coffee is quite okay. Long queue at drink stall and econ rice during meal peak hours.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107925600854655654898/reviews
H Y,1,"Malay food is very nice and affordable. However, the indian lady at the drink stall have trouble making drinks correctly, as many customers come back to get their drinks adjusted.

MC SM,4,"Tried 2 stalls here. AL AMEEN KAMPUNG for beehoon goreng and prata bomb, quite good.. the beehoon goreng average but the prata bomb was super shiok. Came in a set of 2 prata and the sugar filling was very evenly distributed, super sinful but damn good.
Also tried the FISH SOUP stall and it tasted very healthy. Less saltier than other fish soup places and fish was fresh.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110245550123443528486/reviews

Erick Chng,2,"This kopitiam corner coffeeshop stalls most of it closed between 830pm to 9pm. Don't bother to come after 830pm, as food stall usually in closing state, even those which were operating were have very very limited food left to serve, example is the Tender Best stall. Full menu with limited choices for order.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111018897216751106113/reviews
