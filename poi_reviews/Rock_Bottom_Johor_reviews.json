The ambiance is a perfect blend of cozy lighting and energetic vibes, especially with the live music that adds a magical touch. The menu is diverse ‚Äì I enjoyed both the Western steak and the Indian curry, and both were cooked to perfection. The service by the staff was warm and attentive, hospitality. Highly recommended for anyone looking to chill with good food, great music, and friendly faces. Definitely coming back again!",
