I stayed here between 5:30 to 7:30pm, while there are always quite a few free seats, so this is a quite ideal place for everyone who wants to study/work in a cafe. Staff are friendly and efficient, the coffee they prepared are quite nice. The location is also fantastic, just the first store to see after walking out of mrt, or one level up from the bus interchange",
