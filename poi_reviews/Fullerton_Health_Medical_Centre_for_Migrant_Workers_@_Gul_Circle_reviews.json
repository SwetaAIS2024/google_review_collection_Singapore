      "text": "I am writing to express my disappointment with the service I received during my visit to your facility on 10/Mar/2025. I arrived at 5:00 PM, well before your advertised closing time of 5:30 PM, only to be informed that registration had already closed at 4:30 PM. This crucial information was not mentioned on Google or any of your public platforms, which led to confusion and wasted time.\n\nAdditionally, the receptionistâ€™s manner of communication was unprofessional and dismissive. Rather than offering assistance or understanding, I felt disregarded and unwelcome. Clear, respectful communication is fundamental to good service, and unfortunately, that standard was not met.\n\nTo avoid future misunderstandings, I strongly recommend updating your public information to clearly state the registration cut-off time. I also hope you will address customer service standards with your staff to ensure visitors are treated with respect and courtesy.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing how you plan to improve this experience for future customers.",

According to her, if a patient smiles, it means theyâ€™re not in pain and are perfectly fine. I seriously question whether sheâ€™s even a qualified doctor. This was my first visit to this clinic, and it was by far the worst experience I've ever had. Avoid this place at all costs!",

The health professional assigned to conduct blood tests was using his phone to watch shows while performing the task.\n\nThis is one of the official channels appointed by MOM for all migrants in the construction sector to visit regarding health and medical issues.\n\nI urge MOM to review and conduct mystery spot checks on them. It is a shame that Singapore is treating these workers with such inadequate medical facilities. I will write to MOM and provide feedback on this matter as well.",
