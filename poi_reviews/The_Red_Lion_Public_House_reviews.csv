Ice Qu,4,"You know what? Pretty good. Seems they just expanded and updated this spot so it's more cosy for patrons to enjoy a pint and some fish & chips. I liked the battered fish but the fries were wimpy and cold. And the salt shaker was wet so no salt. A wee bit sad, that was. Yet the service is friendly and fast and the atmosphere congenial and relaxing, so I will definitely return.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112472682452415767759/reviews

Mal N,4,All round good with a personality of it's own. Owners and staff are friendly and engaging. Only negative is that they ran out of draft beer at their inaugural quiz!!!! And then tried to charge $11 a bottle instead of $12 a pint. Owner sorted but had to rant a bit beforehand for it to get resolved. This place should last. It has been well done and thought through,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105473659523304272415/reviews
Ben Turner,5,"Great food, great beers selection, great atmosphere! You can also order from Smith's Fish and Chip shop and eat at the pub, while watching the sport on one of the large screen TV's. Child friendly during the day. Both indoor and outdoor seating is available.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114034529450683469973/reviews
