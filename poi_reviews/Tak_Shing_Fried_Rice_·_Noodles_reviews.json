      "text": "I went to the Terminal 3 Foodcourt in the transit area, as it has been more than 3 years since my last visit. The Foodcourt does seem to be a bit run down and the air-conditioning was also not working too well.\n\nI ordered a plate of fried rice with sweet sour pork.\n\nThe fried rice was a disappointment as it in no way looked or tasted like fried rice. The sweet sour pork was not too bad, but the meat was a bit tough in certain pieces. The stall doesn't provide any condiments like soy sauce , red chillies etc. which would have made the meal more tolerable.\n\nOverall the meal was mediocre and it would be safe to say that I will never purchase food from this stall the next time.",

      "text": "This is the first time in have ever had Lemon Chicken for breakfast and I loved it!\n\nTak Shing is a Hawker style stall in Food Street on Level on T3 in Changi Airport.\n\nThere are plenty of dishes to choose from but this one was a winner for me. The chicken was crispy and had a very subtle lemon flavour. It was served with rice and topped with a fried egg.\n\nThis is a great little area to eat, there are about 11 stalls in total all offering Asian specials, a nice change from the normal airport choices.",

And, he forgot the egg.\n\nWhen asked, the worker was like \"what egg?\". When I showed him the receipt (clearly showed that I paid for an egg), he just turned around, grabbed a fried egg from a container (cold) and threw it on top of the noodle dish. No apology, not a word.\nWill never look at this stall again.",

The salesman ignored me while I was trying to ask for a fork. Finally, he told me to go and get it from some other shop!! Apart from the rude behaviour and delay, the food did not taste good at all. The extra fried egg that I ordered with the dish looked old and grey and cold. It did not even look like a fried egg but a hard boiled egg in circular shape. Highly disappointed!!",
