      "text": "This bus stop is located at the main Geylang road, which is after Geylang Lor 10. This is a non sheltered bus stop due to the space constraint. A lot of bus services are passing through this stop so commuters may easily travel to other parts of Singapore or just hop on the bus to reach the nearest MRT station. The nearest MRT station from this bus stop is around 10-15 minutes walkaway so this bus stop serves the neighborhood as well as tourists who stay at nearby hotels.\n\nThe bus stops provides clear information of bus numbers and routes on the small information pole. No electronic bus arrival timing so travellers may need to refer to app for the bus arrival timing.",
