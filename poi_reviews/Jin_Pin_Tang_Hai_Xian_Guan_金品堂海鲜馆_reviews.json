The fried prawn noodles had little bits of salted fish in it which was very delightful.\n\nThe pork two ways which we ordered was odd, but I‚Äôd still come here for the noodles. Easy to find a seat during a Friday lunch time",

The sauce is has a very savory taste profile, and not overly flat or just looks brown and black. Serves as a good dish and main on its own with the family or even alone. Its Dad's fave and he'll drive down from Hougang just for this.\n\nThe potato leaves are well cooked and even though its not spicy the taste was so on point. The rest of the dishes are standard, quality zichar items and definitely all good.\n\nWill come back again to try their Moonlight Horfan and Signature Tofu!",
