C T,4,"I was surprised to find Sarawak noodles at the airport, as I’ve been wanting to try Sarawak laksa for a long time. The kolomee was a little overcooked, but the laksa gravy was flavorful, with a nice balance of spices.

It’s hard to get a seat in the morning, so you have to walk around and wait",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113390811001221493323/reviews
WL Wong,3,"Had sarawak laksa and 3 layer tea. Laksa was not bad and would be slightly below your average hawker in Kuching. Broth could be more flavourful.

Tea was way too sweet... But texture was good.

Edit: 2nd try of laksa and this time too much oil. I think the broth is not mixed properly. Kolo mee worth trying",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113591707127098196404/reviews
