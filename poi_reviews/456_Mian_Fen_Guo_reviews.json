Price starts from SGD$4 for all types of noodle. They served both the dry and soup version. Dried noodle are tossed in dark soya sauce and comes with a bowl of soup.\n\nHad the mee hoon kway dry, portion seems a little small. Texture of noodle was great, it was perfectly cooked and still retains the good texture.",

Homemade broth is superbly tasty with tangy noodle texture filled with aromatic minced pork and well seasoned mushroom in dark sauce.\nThe dry version is authentically tasty too.\nCan’t deny further on how this stall upkeep it’s dish with consistency and added with pleasant service rendered.\nFor me rainy and cooling days - savoy in the soup version",
