Piano Music,1,"I had the worst crab ever in my life time. This chi liu xiang seafood they had a stall newly open at jln pari burong area. Ordered a å’¸è›‹èžƒèŸ¹and requested them to make it dry and not those sticky creamy kind.  I repeated 3 times and in the end I bring back a super over deep fried crab with sticky salted egg paste! Yucks!! The meat was all stuck to the shell!!!! I wasted $36 on this crab and In the end ruin my dinner. I had tried their other dishes as well, it's not good either. Worst restaurant ever.

Jao CK,1,"Worst CUSTOMER SERVICE AND food. They scam you by changing price from the display price. The lady at the counter was very rude attitude (20 Oct around 12pm). She refused to give chilli and utilities even large order. Very rude attitude, spoil the shop reputation. The food was not so great. Paid for large size but got it way lesser. I will look NOT forward this shop until they rectify the issue.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107407909419486935253/reviews
