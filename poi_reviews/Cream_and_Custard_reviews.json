(Lychee Rose and Strawberry Watermelon) Both times, the customer service was amazing, the cake came on time, in perfect condition and tasted absolutely incredible. The cakes were light and refreshing. My family and friends enjoyed it so much that there were no leftovers. Iâ€™ve recommended Cream and Custard to my friends and they too have enjoyed their experiences. The Strawberry Watermelon cake is definitely a MUST TRY! Will definitely be coming back for all my cake -needs!",

Our family members (kids and adults alike!) enjoyed their lychee rose cake and variety of hot dogs, which have a good bite, fresh and generous toppings, and are presented in a moreish brioche bun! The fruit iced tea was also very refreshing.\n\nLooking forward to trying more of their bakes and celebrating more birthdays with their beautiful cakes.",

The galaxy cake is rich in chocolate and a kids favourite too. Visited their new store recently and delighted to know they serve small slices and drinks too! Service is great. Highly recommended to try :)",

The generous alcohol cherries took the flavours to the next level. And the cake itself is an artwork to marvel at! The marble glaze is amazing! Definitely ordering my next cake here.",
