Mustafa Makkiyah,4,"One of the best biryanis I have tasted in Singapore! The rice is soft, juiced up by the base of the meat, and the meat is soft cooked it falls off the bone. I have had it 3 times so far, and I still love it. I was hoping to try the Mandi and Maqluba but it is always sold out.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100561142968150496433/reviews

Daryl Nonis,5,Classic biryani. We had both the chicken and mutton options. Both were so good. Chicken was blow torched and rice was fragrant with spices. Comes with the green chillies and yogurt. Mutton was soft and tender. They ran out of spoons but I got one after a quick wait. Will consider this a hidden gem for where it is located.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108166350271261484467/reviews

Lemmy Lamb,5,"Fizi Mandy offers the best taste of Dum Biryani! Their briyani is a harmonious blend of flavours and textures where the fragrance hits you even before you take your first bite! The rice is fluffy and light, each grain separate, having absorbed the flavours of the spices and the marinated meat it was cooked with, usually chicken, lamb or beef. I got the chicken one as I love the flavour!

The meat, having been slow-cooked, is tender and infused with spices, melting in your mouth, of course! The layering of the Biryani ensures that every bite has a perfect balance of rice, meat and spices!

I really love their dum briyani as it offers a multi-sensory experience that is not just about the taste but also the aroma, texture and the joy of uncovering different layers of flavours with each bite. The generous sprinkle of fried onions on top provides a delightful crunch.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106750842167260589965/reviews
