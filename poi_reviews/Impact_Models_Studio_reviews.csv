G G,1,"This felt more like a money grab than a genuine talent search. An Instagram ad promoted what seemed like a free modeling workshop, but after clicking the link (which led to a WhatsApp chat), they pushed hard for me to bring my child without ever mentioning a fee. Once we arrived, they suddenly asked for over $50. If theyâ€™d been upfront about the cost, I wouldnâ€™t have wasted our time. It seems the lack of transparency is intentional to get more clicks.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107592875745793334810/reviews
Anonymous,1,"It's not a genuine modeling school for kids; it's more like a place for them to play. They don't receive proper catwalk training, and the agency seems focused on convincing parents to sign up $398 each time for unlimited in-house events. I wonder how many kids actually get jobs after signing up with Impact Model. We signed up for two years, but it feels like we're just paying for the in-house events.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112255109258245822607/reviews
