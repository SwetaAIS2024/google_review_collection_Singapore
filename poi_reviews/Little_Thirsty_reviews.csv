Shawn Chua,4,"I recently visited Little Thirsty at Changi Road, and it was a great experience overall! The ambiance was cozy and inviting, perfect for a casual hangout. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the service was quick. I tried their fried pork and was impressed by the unique flavors and quality making it the best pairing complement the drinks.

During the happy hour the Guinness is going for 2 for $24 as well.

Overall, a solid spot for anyone looking to unwind with great drinks and a chill vibe. Will definitely return!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110148836935463026308/reviews

Food was great! Do try the satays with your drinks

Owner Kenny was really friendly and very well versed in Whisky’s. He shared his vast knowledge with us, and kindly showed us some of the store’s prized possessions (see pictures)

Your hospitality and friendliness will never be forgotten. A breath of fresh air to receive the service we experienced tonight. In addition to Kenny’s top notch service service, the food was incredible! Highly recommend the bangers n mash and the fish and chips along with the platters! My husband also loved his smash burger!
