It is so inconvenient for us to \"free\" our hand, especially when we have some trash / a cup of drink that wasn't allowed to bring along and we have got no place to throw away. This is just a simple facilities yet so hard for Singapore government to provide, will you allow us to throw on the floor ?!!!!ðŸ™„\nNext, there is no public facilities like toilet in the transit itself, so if you are travelling for far distance, make sure you empty your bladder before get yourself onboard.\nSingapore is a developed nation, with world class public transportation and punctuality on public transportation, however, there is still a medium for improvement.",
