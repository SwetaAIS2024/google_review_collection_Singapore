      "text": "Exceptional Experience with Mitcher!!!\n\nI recently purchased a used car from pang’s motor  and I couldn’t be happier with the service! A huge thanks to Mitcher! who made the entire process smooth, transparent, and stress-free. He was extremely knowledgeable, patient, and never pressured me into a decision. Mitcher took the time to understand my needs and found the perfect vehicle for my budget.\n\nThe dealership itself was professional, with a great selection of well-maintained cars. The paperwork was handled efficiently, and I felt confident in my purchase. If you're looking for a trustworthy salesman, I highly recommend Mitcher —he truly goes above and beyond for his customers!\n\nWill definitely return for my next car and refer friends and family. Thanks again!",

I was quite skeptical about second hand car dealers but Micheal & Mitcher were extremely attentive to me, despite me asking a series of questions. I finally bought my bmw from them. 5/5! I may pay a higher price but I’m happy to do so because I feel the service & most importantly the health of the car that was hand over to me was in extremely good condition!!!!",
