      "text": "Atlas has been my go-to for a few years because of their consistency in service, food and always having the most wonderful atmosphere to dine in. üôåüèª Tried their steak hash today and was pleasantly surprised with how the meat was soo tender and juicy! It was complimented well with the potatoes, onions, greens and sauces as well. Other dishes that I would recommend are the Salmon Soba bowl, Gentleman‚Äôs Relish, Wurst Rosti, desserts and coffee. The internet-popular carbonara tends to be slightly too jelat and creamy without much taste for me, but maybe it‚Äôs because I haven‚Äôt tried it in a long time. Will always be a loyal customer!!",

Menu text was tiny and packed‚Äîhonestly tiring to read.\nFood came fast. French toast was okay, but the Gentleman‚Äôs Relish was the standout with its trio of spreads.\nOverall, pricey for the experience. Definitely places out there with better food and atmosphere.",

Dinner wasn‚Äôt relaxing at all‚Äîeven though we arrived at 5 PM, they kept reminding us they close at 7 PM for more than 3 times. The food was bad. The bread/scones/croissants seemed half-cooked, but they insisted they were meant to be soft. I bake often, and to me, they felt undercooked. The chicken wings tasted like frozen ones. The mini hashbrowns were nice but overpriced. The waffles and ice cream were good, but you can find them at other caf√©s too.\n\nOverall, not recommended to spend money here. Expensive, food was not nice, and not good in service.",
