Dan Phillips,5,"Just bought one of the MTG Strats here. Plays great for a budget guitar (actually just plays great!). Pleasant hour in the shop ..friendly service and tried out the Luthier 'own brand' acoustic .. Which seemed like a lot of guitar for not much money. Would reccommend the shop and product.
