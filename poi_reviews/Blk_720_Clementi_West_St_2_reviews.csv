Ex-colleague KELVINLAU invited me for lunch at the pretty new stall near his home at Clementi West - IPOH EASTERN TRADITIONAL CLAYPOT CHICKEN RICE.

When Kelvin mentioned Claypot Rice, I said nice but how could two of us finish the order (I had assumed that the usual Claypot Rice which serves 5-6 people at least). Kelvin assured me that the pot was individual serving.

The stall served 3 types of Claypot Rice but as it was my first time there, I opted for their traditional Claypot Chicken Rice. The rice was cooked only upon order (unlike some places where they scooped cooked rice into the Claypot and then cooked again). Hence I was prepared to wait for at least half an hour as the coffee shop was pretty full then.

Realized the stall had at least 12 cookers operating simultaneously behind the stall and in about 15 minutes, our Order Buzzer came on. Well great!

Knowing that I liked soup, Kelvin threw in an additional Watercress Pork rib soup for me.

The Claypot Rice was delicious, sufficient sauce and the layer of burnt crust covered the entire bottom of the Claypot. Yet the chicken (boneless) were tender and rice was soft. There were few slices of lap cheong too. At $6 per serving, pretty good deal.

The pork rib in the watercress soup was tender and the cartilages literally melted in the mouth. I think very little MSG.

It was a delicious and healthy meal. Thank you Kelvin and great catching up indeed.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118416171152567325758/reviews
