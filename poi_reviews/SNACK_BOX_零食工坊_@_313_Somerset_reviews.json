      "text": "They have a wide variety of dried snacks, besides fruits, they also selling dried vege and nuts. I highly recommend the dried strawberry, each piece is plump, tangy, sweet and crispy. I couldn't resist putting them in my shopping basket after trying them! Initially, I wasn't fond of vegetables, but the staff recommended I try the okra and mushrooms, and I instantly fell in love. They didn't have the usual vegetable taste, and they were so crispy and delicious! The mushroom flavor even had a hint of saltiness, which is perfect for those who prefer savory snacks.",
