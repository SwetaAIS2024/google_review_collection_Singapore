      "text": "I am having lunch at Guzman @ Guoco Tower today. I will usually visit this place for lunch at least 3 times a week for over a year. I am so far happy with the food and place. The staff are polite and friendly. However, today i met the worst staff over my past 1 year of visit here. I placed my order over the counter and the staff ask me a question. I could not really hear it and i said \"sorry?\". He replied me with his voice raised. That i can understand as i was the one that couldn't hear his question. BUT!!!!.The face expression was impatient and frustrated. So i paid my bill and sat down. A while later, he brought the food to me with a not so well mannered gesture. Anyway, whatever it is. He is the black sheep.of the team. I am also in service line. He is definitely not suitable to be put at the front to serve paying customer. We don't beg for our food nor do I ask for super service. Just be polite. I am not coming back to this place anymore. To me,  i love the food. But too bad, i think i will find another place where i can find nice, polite staff. I think he needs more training.",

I ordered the California burrito and nachos with ground beef, both of which were fantastic. I loved the flavors so much that I returned the very next day. If you‚Äôre in the area, this place is definitely worth a visit!",

No lie, ask my kids, just don‚Äôt tell my boyfriend.\nSo, of course the Universe leads me to Guzman Y Gomez. What is this place??? OMG the bowls are amazing, the nachos are amazing‚Ä¶but hold my beer‚Ä¶the staff are AMAZING!\nIt‚Äôs pretty cool to chill, have great food, and watch the incredible team who make it have fun and support each other.\nThis is what Kerri‚Äôs version of heaven is. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\nI get the mini versions of the menu items because I don‚Äôt trust myself to not eat the entire larger size. It is sooo good.",

As paying customers, we expect honesty and integrity in what‚Äôs being served. I‚Äôve raised this issue multiple times with the staff, yet no action has been taken. It‚Äôs frustrating to see the same problem happening again.",

It was nice with every bite!\n\nLoved that they have a very accessible condiment area! U can grab all their delicious sauce that fits greatly with the food\n\nA satisfying and worthy meal! The staff was friendly and service was super fast as well",
