Ze wei Tay,5,"We really love the environment and curriculum in The School House Sembawang country club. They have their own playground, water play park and an artificial grass area that is both children and family friendly. The teachers and staffs in the school are absolutely lovely and you can feel their love and passion towards the children. The bus driver and bus auntie are patient and careful with the kids. The parents of our kid’s classmates are so helpful and friendly when it comes to community events. Really a blessing to have met the team from The School House Sembawang and the parents from The School House.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113853271253637304390/reviews
Claire Chong,5,"Our experience with The Schoolhouse Sembawang has been nothing short of exceptional.

The Schoolhouse Sembawang prides itself on creating a nurturing environment where children can thrive, and they certainly deliver on that promise. The dedicated staff goes above and beyond to ensure that each child feels valued, supported, and encouraged to explore their potential.

One aspect that stands out is the comprehensive curriculum tailored to suit the developmental needs of toddlers. Through a blend of structured learning activities and hands-on experiences, our child has blossomed both academically and socially. From learning basic concepts like colors and shapes to developing essential life skills such as communication and problem-solving, we have witnessed remarkable progress in our little one.

Moreover, the facilities at The Schoolhouse Sembawang are top-notch, providing a safe and stimulating environment for children to learn and play. The classrooms are bright, spacious, and thoughtfully designed to promote creativity and exploration. Outdoor play areas are abundant, allowing kids to engage in physical activities and connect with nature.

Communication between the school and parents is excellent. We appreciate the regular updates, progress reports, and opportunities to participate in school events and activities. It's reassuring to know that our child is in capable hands and that we are always kept informed about their development.

Overall, we couldn't be happier with our decision to enroll our child at The Schoolhouse Sembawang. It's more than just a school; it's a community where children are encouraged to dream, explore, and succeed. We wholeheartedly recommend it to any parent seeking a nurturing and enriching environment for their little one's early years.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108765279833407575830/reviews
Sneha Dubey,5,"Schoolhouse at Sembawang provided our child's inaugural day care/school experience. After thorough research, we confidently selected this institution due to its child-friendly and hygienic atmosphere, dedicated and compassionate educators and principal, and the provision of fresh, in-house meals. Despite offering classes for ages 18 months to pre-primary, every teacher knows each child by name, fostering a warm and welcoming environment where children feel comfortable greeting their instructors. The school's inclusive approach to celebrating various festivals helps children develop cultural awareness. Additionally, their music program not only introduces songs but also educates children about different musical instruments. Six months into our child's enrollment, we are convinced that choosing Schoolhouse at Sembawang was the right decision. We extend our gratitude to Principal Jerine, Miss KC, Jiang Laoshi, Miss Huda, Miss Celest, Song Laoshi, Aunty Hei Seng, and Cleaner Aunty for ensuring our child receives a nurturing environment, allowing us as parents to feel connected and confident in our decision to send our child to school. Thank you!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106669837710154963575/reviews
Jade Foo,5,"Our elder two have grown and matured under the wonderful and nurturing care of the school’s principal, teachers and staff who have a genuine passion and love for the kids, who are like a huge extended family to them and our family. The classrooms are well equipped with plenty of learning aids and the constant bilingual exposure has improved their language skills, especially in Chinese. The curriculum is well thought through and focuses on literacy, numeracy and STEM while they use various mediums to encourage learning through outdoor play, music, learning journeys amongst many others . Our children have cultivated a curious mindset with the habit of asking questions and a true love for learning. It’s been a wonderful journey with Pat’s Sembawang so far .",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108423550399207699919/reviews
