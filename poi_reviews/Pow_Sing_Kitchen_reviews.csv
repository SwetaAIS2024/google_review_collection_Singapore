Rebecca Maki,4,"I used to come here often when I was younger. My last visit before today was in 2015. Today I visit with my family and kids.
They have renovated and become smaller, but still comfortable. The only problem is, the chicken becomes..... Very bloody looking. Abit scary. The rest, still yummy as usual.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102254124714897790924/reviews
Gargleblaster,3,"Many customers who have been coming here for decades. I remember when he had one stall at the corner and a restaurant at the other end each selling one type of chicken. The pow sing chicken taste to me is special. So I’m a bit saddened at what happened. Basically there was a sharp plastic in the sambal kang Kong and my friend had bitten into it. We wanted to nudge the service staff to take more care but it was bizarre. She didn’t even blink twice to enquire and straight up offered to refund or fry a new dish. We were blur. We didn’t need a new dish but wanted to tell them to be careful but once we said we didn’t need a new dish, she whisked away the vegetables and disappeared! And the remaining dish we ordered never appeared also!! So my once a year visit was disappointing. I really hope the business continues but I guess it’s hard to keep up good standards",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106969202599971461073/reviews
Kian Yong,3,"Steamed chicken lacks flavour nor is the rice aromatic. Still decent, but I wouldn’t return for it. Ironically, the best thing from this chicken rice stall isn’t the chicken but its Nonya dishes, which are worth a try. On a positive note, the staff are friendly!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100397776802769895381/reviews
Lance Tan,4,"A specialty chicken rice restaurant that also serves other local dishes such as curry fish head. Good for family meals. We ordered the roasted chicken rice, steamed chicken rice and also the stir fried garlic Kai lan vegetable for our side. The rice was really fragrant and delicious, but I feel that the chicken tasted pretty average though it was very tender. We preferred the roasted chicken over the steamed one as the roasted skin added more flavour to the chicken. The stir fried vegetable was pretty good too. The chilli is amazing as it really amplified the taste of the meat. Would return again to try the other dishes.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103171518127946119222/reviews
Rachel B,3,"Visited on a Sunday evening and it was half packed. Ordered their white chicken for 3-4 pax, assam fish curry head, chap chye pot and nyonya tofu. Their chicken was good and tender. Assam fish curry was surprisingly tasteful (lightly sour) with generous serving. Chap Chye fell out of expectations, it wasnt as good and the cabbage were quite hard. Nyonya tofu was ok but lack the nyonya taste.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110690712679218277883/reviews
