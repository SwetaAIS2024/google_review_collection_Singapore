J.D ‚ÄúJ.W‚Äù Wee,1,"Wrong choice ordering risotto while the entire restaurant customers are having their pasta.

Had a few bites and the rice was hard.  The rice is definitely undercooked as I took a few grains out to press it and can still see raw rice.  Not Al dente standard . Service staff said it is normal as for their restaurant standard.

Nice enough, she requested to change a new plate for me. To my horror, the replacement is worst, while the texture of the rice is softer but the taste lacks flavours.  It was served with a pool of oil or sticky liquid (there is no raw egg served as compared to the initial plate). I have no appetite to finish it.

During payment, I told the service staff to have it checked if it is normal again? She doesn't bother to check the issue and say it is normal. Just try another dish next time.

Seriously? I'm amazed !
The owner or manager of this restaurant, please tell me this is your restaurant standard and I hope to promote such an unique dish for you. ü§Æ",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114245845077174292963/reviews

Stephan,5,"Pasta was wonderful and mushroom soup was amazing. Ordered the Linguine Alfungi and would like to try the Pesto pasta the next time! Would like to mention that Sarah was super attentive and made the effort to shift diners around so we could get a sit for me and my colleagues, and her energy level was top notch, running the service and handling the payments.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100556106622752797000/reviews
Wei Yang,5,"Had a super pleasant dinner at this outlet at 6:30pm on 05/03/25. Was amazed by the atmosphere and definitely the fantastic service by the waiter on shift. Last but not least, super thankful for the chef who made such a delicious gnocchi dish without missing the special request that i asked for. Thanks for the great service and food!  Definitely recommending it to anyone who is into gnocchi to pop by ü•∞",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116697925857076682972/reviews
Gp Tan,5,"Lovely little place
Went for dinner & I would think that during lunch time in CBD would be packed to the brim.  Glad to be there for dinner where seats are available.  As this is a small outlet with max capacity of 20+, it can be expected that tables and chairs are very closely seated.
Food is an absolute delight with choice of classic pasta, pizza & risotto with some unique fusion flavour of curry chicken pizza
Price is definitely wallet friendly for an establishment in CBD
Love the cosy little place.  Feels so welcoming like visiting a regular restaurant",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118374574110035569614/reviews
