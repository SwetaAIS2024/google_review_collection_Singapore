      "text": "Great value wagyu omakase with good varieties of cut. Was here for wife's birthday and tried the most expensive wagyu omakase. We love the charcoal grilled Matsusaka A5 steak the most, followed by sous vide carpacio, and Akune gold wagyu soup (naturally sweet beef with crunchy leeks). I personally like the Akaushi sukiyaki (great sauce albeit sweet tasting) and you can see some molecular gastronomy technique thrown into the mix (smoked Ohmu wagyu). The service was top-notch, the crew (sommelier) who attended to us was very polite and attentive. She was knowledgeable and recommended a good pairing for our meal. Thank you for a good memory.  While not Michelin level, this is a place I would recommend if you want a great wagyu dining experience.",

The recommendations of sake pairing for the meal was very good too. We enjoyed our meal very much and will come back again! Thanks Agnes for your dedication and authenticity of your recommendation!",

      "text": "Delicious Japanese wagyu beef properly prepared. Can get the beef many different ways from a steak, donburi, shabu shabu, cold, etc. I went for the donburi with beef, foie gras, egg, caviar and truffle rice. It was fantastic. I also had some sushi and a teapot wagyu soup which was quite delicious as well. There was a great wine list with many options by the glass and some great coctails. Service was excellent and attentive. The space is very cool and modern inside with all eyes on the chefs. Front entrance was a little hard to find from the way we approached...but we got there. Definitely expensive...so be prepared to spend. Highly recommend when you are in the mood for a high end wagyu dinner.",

We were attended by Agnes and her service was impeccable. From food recommendation to membership rewards, beverage refills, Agnes was knowledgeable and passionate.\n\nI even got a happy birthday card with hand written message from the service crew. Great and personable service is hard to get these days and kudos to the service team.",
