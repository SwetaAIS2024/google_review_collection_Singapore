Radhi Razali,3,"Food is very good. Sambal perfect blend of sweet and spicy, chicken is flavourful. Nasi is fragrant, expected of nasi lemak. Egg cooked well.

Problem is management of the shop. Looks like only one or two worker for 3 stalls. Felt very bad for the indonesian kakak while she was being swamped with Grabfood orders.

Reflects badly on whoever owns and run this branch. Nonetheless, food was v good and price is ok lah.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103140407781053446536/reviews
Mohamed Haniffa,3,"Besides Lau Pa Sat, another outlet. Suited beside Keat Hong CC. If Exit from the overhead bridge can be noticed. Few stalls share the place. Saw in the post abt it being 24hrs but i didn't see any signs. Food was good. Price was cheaper the the Lau Pa Sat outlet. Takeaway still charge 30cents per set.hmm.. staff was friendly.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106001901776455159598/reviews

Gilbert Darmawan,1,"The staffs need to wake up, couple of times we went there to order 2 nos. of the same dishes the staff only gave us 1 dish and pretend they forgot the other, happened more than 3 times, and service is extremely slow from taking orders to preparation. The only things they need to cook upon order are the chicken and egg, the anchovies, peanuts, and sambal should be ready and yet the staffs are taking so much time just for 1 dish. When they forgot the other one that we ordered we have to wait again. Please train the staffs, the foods are ok but the service and waiting time is horrible.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106438863073448127565/reviews
J,2,"Came around 11:30am and the stall looked barely open. Placed my order and was given an oily beeper. Waited for around 20 minutes for my food to be ready. Itâ€™s probably slow because thereâ€™s only 1 staff working and loads of delivery food orders piling up. Seen a lot of delivery riders come and go but only a few dine in customers picked up their food.

If youâ€™re not dining in, the plastic utensils are above the high counter, right side of the stall.

Ordered the hainanese chicken chop curry rice. The quality of food is not bad.

-1 star due to the long wait time.

Update in 2024. Wait time is still very long. After we placed our orders, Other customers came in after us, found a seat, placed their order, collected our food from other stalls and we were still waiting. And thereâ€™s a huge egg shell on my egg. Cooking time is so long but they couldnâ€™t prepare an egg properly.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113966954151240288230/reviews
