Lesley Holmes,5,"I really liked this place.
I read that it would take about 2 hours but I ended up staying for 6 hours.  It's just to peaceful.  The orchid garden is well worth the small charge. I spent 2 hours in there alone.
If you have the time, take your time,  there are places to stop and listen and also to get coffee and cake (if needed 😋)
Highly recommended",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100925501546850540517/reviews
Petae86,5,"Beautiful botanical garden. You can spend several hours here among the trees and gardens and walkways with different atmospheres. The orchid garden is unmissable. The garden is well signposted as to what is where. There are a reasonable number of toilets, which are free, always clean and there are drinking fountains.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111001584445847751341/reviews
Leia,5,"Singapore boasts one of the finest parks!  To ensure everyone's safety, cycling and rollerblading are not permitted. Dogs are generally leashed and there are plenty of space for a nice picnic. It's wonderful to see so many people enjoying the outdoors. I thoroughly enjoy this location. 😍🌳🐕‍🦺☀️",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107339312369387349595/reviews
Lam Phung Le Quynh,5,"This place is beautiful with lots of plants and flowers! You can go by MRT there and the garden is free. Everyone seems very happy there. You could see beautiful plants and flowers, orchids and even animals like birds, swans, fish, turtles,….. .If you are lucky, you could see an otter passing the road! This place should be best in the afternoon. When I visited this place, it was in the morning so it was kind of hot. Lovely lace for a picnic or a walk. 5 star🤩🤩🤩🤩",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110501513341102559851/reviews
Nguyen Thanh Tam,5,"A pleasant place to visit.

It feels so peaceful to see many people walking their pets, children playing, and families exploring nature together.

There is plenty of space for walking, giving the feeling of strolling through a forest. The park also features a lake, a small decorative waterfall, and a wide variety of tropical plants.

Although I didn’t see anyone actively trimming or maintaining the greenery, everything looked well cared for.

Entrance is free, but if you want to visit the orchid garden, there is an admission fee",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106677702654127833585/reviews
