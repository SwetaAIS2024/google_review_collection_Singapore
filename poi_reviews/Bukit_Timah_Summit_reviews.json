There are also benches at the summit and rest stops. The rest stops are also shaded and there are a lot of plants that I have never seen before.",

      "text": "Bukit Timah Peak is the highest summit in Singapore. At just over 163 meters above sea level, it may seem insignificant to mountains in neighboring countries, but this summit played a significant role in Singapore’s WW 2 history. The peak is a popular hiking destination for locals looking to work on their fitness. There are several hiking trails which run up to the peak, from the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve Entrance, or from the Dairy Farm Area on the northern side. The area around the peak is covered in thick rain forest and, on any given day, there’s plenty of wildlife to be seen. For wildlife enthusiasts, Monkey’s, Squirrels, and Monitor Lizards are in abundance in the area.\n\nSafe travels,\n\nMega.",

Once that is done, it's a gentler slope climb to the Summit.\n⛰️A large sculptured stone at the summit marks the hill's height and location. Next to it, is a Summit Hut shelter where visitors can take a break before going down.\n⛰️There are telecom relay towers and also a storyboard detailing the history of the hill.\n⛰️A great place to hike in a nature setting.",
