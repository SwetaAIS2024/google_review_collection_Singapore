WILLIAM JIANG,1,food is coffee shop standard.taste also. 1st time to see that the staff use finger to clean the porridge spilled out of bowl in front of customer. Price consider cheap as a shop standard. But over price if you consider this is coffee shop standard.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116361452725511911957/reviews
just Wai,5,"The restaurant vibe is fresh, air conditioned. Service is good and clear. The food come fresh hot, standard is there. Portion is also pretty generous.
I have tried their big mentaiko prawn, is very grill-ly taste with good prawn juice.
Their big bau is very satisfying and big.
Bailey water is cooling and sweet, i love it.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113857140644341643606/reviews
Arunima K,5,"The revamped store has nostalgic and soft vibes. Great that they are open till late. Trying crab vermicelli for the first time and totally loved it.

The Shanghai dimsums are oozing broth and satisfying. Nor to forget the porridge. Will definitely visit them again",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111144253974847738344/reviews
William Tan,3,"Another victim to Modernism! Sigh…
Newly revamp eatery is clean and bright which is a “great” departure from their old setup? Sadly, it means it loses the rawness, tussle and craziness which makes eating uniquely different in my opinion.
Food and quality still maintain but cannot remember if there is a price increment ?!?
Food were served hot and well flavoured.
We had several fried items and as my mom cannot take chilli (mild or spicy), I asked for a small dish of mayo to go with the food ordered for her…
To my surprise, I was told that I would have to pay for it????? Since when do I have to pay for condiments (not even in 5stars restaurants)
I was greatly disappointed by such service… what’s next?!?
Sad that our lunch were dampen but such a petty issue…
Not the best Tim sum and definitely not the cheapest, should I return when there are more option elsewhere?
Boils down to details…..",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103389283139442298438/reviews
Cynthia (Cynful Recommends),4,"I still remember the rustic, charming interior from years back but did you know that they’ve recently changed management and renovated their entire space? The interior is now cleaner, brighter and more inviting.

While it’s kinda sad that they’ve decided to get rid of their rustic interior for something more modern, I get that it’s to appeal to more people and to leave a better impression.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117939952431403093458/reviews
