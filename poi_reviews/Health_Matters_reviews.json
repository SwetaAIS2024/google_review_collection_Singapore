Doctor diagnosed as viral infection Gave medication for runny nose but not for sore throat and had to ask. After 6 days, the situation worsen and chest became flammy. Throat and runny nose were also worse off. Went to my regular doctor who diagnosed a  baterial infection and NO a  viral infection. Now on a course of antibiotics. Question the Poor Quality of Doctor from Health Matters and a serious error of judgement. Would not recommend.",

      "text": "I have been visiting this clinic for my daughter’s immunisations. Dr Khairian is a patient and friendly lady. Called in yesterday to make\nappointment for my helper’s 6 months checkup.\n\nThis lady Irene assisted me on the phone. She was purely rude, not willing to listen and while I was asking a few questions she disrupted by saying “ok bye, ok bye, ya ya just come later Dr check, ok bye”. This was not the first time she was rude and not willing to assist. This lady Irene shouldn’t work as a patient service representative.\n\nI am definitely thinking twice if I should continue my daughter’s immunisation at this clinic.",

      "text": "Am writing to express my heartfelt appreciation & admiration for the exceptional medical care & service provided by Health Matters. My family and I have been loyal patients of this clinic since 2005 & have been consistently received outstanding treatment from Dr. Khairian.\n\nDr. Khairian's empathetic approach, coupled with her expert medical advice & medication, has earned our trust & gratitude. Her dedication to delivering top-notch care is truly commendable.\n\nI'd also like to commend your front counter staffs for their exemplary service. Despite the clinic's busy nature, they remain patient, composed and welcoming. Their professionalism & kindness have not gone unnoticed. I understand that wait times can be unpredictable & may sometimes be lengthy. However, I firmly believe that this is beyond our control & does not justify mistreating or being disrespectful to the front counter staffs. They work as equally hard to ensure our needs are met, and it's essential we treat them with kindness & respect too. I have had worst experience at the 24 Hour clinic over at the Pasir ris market, their front counter staffs are far more unpleasant.\n\nOver my 13 years of visiting this clinic, I have never experienced any issues with the medical service. Each visit leaves me feeling satisfied, relieved, and grateful for the peace of mind that comes with knowing I'm in good hands.\n\nPlease extend my sincerest appreciation to Dr. Khairian & the entire team for their tireless effort in providing exceptional medical care throughout these years. Your clinic is shining example of what healthcare should be.\n\nThank you for all that you do.",
