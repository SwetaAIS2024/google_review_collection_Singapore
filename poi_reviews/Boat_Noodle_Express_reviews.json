Tom yam doesnâ€™t taste like tom yam sadly.\n\nSpring rolls are good though, can recommend that.",

      "text": "I enjoyed the Beef Soup Noodle (#4) here very much. Kway teow was nicely cooked and springy. Broth was flavourful, had garlic oil in it, and there was a slight acidity which delightfully cut through the richness of the broth. Noodles very generously and vibrantly topped with fresh kangkong & parsley. Good portion of beef as well.\n\nFor just $5.30, this is a steal. I'd gladly pay $10 for a bowl like this. Recommended. Favepay available.",
