      "text": "This is our second visit, and we realised there is a noisy siam diu(?) beside the restaurant now that just opened, sadly.\nYou can hear the booming of the loud music reverberating throughout the restaurant space, and there‚Äôs no way to avoid this as this place only opens for dinner.\nFood was wonderful as usual! I think over here the sashimi is the highlight and you should really just go for this as one of your dishes, or the main thing. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for special orders, meaning to say for example there was a Tuna set with Maguro, Otoro and the third one which I can‚Äôt remember, but I only wanted Otoro so I asked the waiter and they said yea they could do it which was great ! Their skewers and yakisoba and karaage was quite decent too so I think you should try those as well but go for the sashimi!",

The place is very popular with Japanese, you need to call to make reservation.\n\nMy favorite is the deep fried squid tentacle, oyster butter and mentaiko spaghetti.\n\nUnfortunately they are right beside a disco club so on Sunday, you will hear loud music.\n\nThe place is located right in front of the lift.",
