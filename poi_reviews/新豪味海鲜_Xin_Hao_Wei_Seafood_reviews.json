The gravy is very soupy, feels like eating Mui Fan. Flavoring and taste is below average. Cost $10 before adding a sunny side up that taste better than the dish. Not sure of the other dishes.",

Sad to see that it disappeared, but satisfied by the quality of food from this new stall.\n\nPrices are reasonable and we didn’t have to wait long. Definitely can compete with the other 2 zichar stalls nearby. Recommend the minced pork fried tofu (not pictured). It’s so good we gobbled it up immediately and forgot to take pic.",

Dine-in customers who arrived much later than us received their food first. When enquiring about our order several times, we were just asked to wait. Final time we asked the status of our order, they had not even cooked it yet. When we asked to cancel and requested for our money back, they refused. Parents with kids would understand how frustrating this is.  Food was ready only after an hour plus. A lady who placed her order before us still had not received hers. Never experienced such long waiting times when it was under the previous management. Quality of food has dropped as well.",
