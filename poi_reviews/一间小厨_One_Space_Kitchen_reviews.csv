Poh Soh Lee,4,"Value for money Chinese kitchen with an extensive menu, including BBQ sticks.

Limited air conditioned dinning area, but plenty of non-air conditioned seatings available too.

BBQ sticks are definitely the highlights here. Other dishes pretty decent too.

A great place to have evening dinners with large groups.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107301070285258783270/reviews

2nd visit on 23Mar, 545pm
No much customers as it’s still early.
Order a few dishes. Serving the first dish around 10- 15mins later. Serving was slow even though not much customers. During ordering, I have stressed that we want all dishes to be less oily, salty and spicy. Turn out to be total opposite of what I have requested for. After 40mins, the 酸辣粉 is still not served. Reminded the lady! 1 hour later, still not served. Only when I went to counter and asked for refund then they get to kitchen to cook. Disappointed with the food, purposely went back as the first experience was great. Only 1 month, standard dropped drastically.

1 of the better 烤鱼. At least better than the shop CHONG QIN 烤鱼. Price is almost 40% cheaper and taste better n the side dishes are so generous!
Awesome 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106525701257052342880/reviews
Empowering Mindset,4,Personally I felt they served chinese food under quite competitive price especially those fish and meat. We tried their vegetable dishes and quite fair tasted. This area is good place for gathering as they serve beers and wide variety meat bbq dishes. They have air conditioned room as well as open air area for dinning but do avoid open air area if you do not like smoking smell.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113009080732159136694/reviews
K Peng,4,Good value. In general food tastes great but a tad too salty. Very generous portion!,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115743825219778582563/reviews
Lee Jia Sheng,4,"A busy and authentically loud chinese restaurant.
I ordered 酸辣土豆丝，蒜泥白肉，pork/beef/lamb skewers and all of them have good flavours, above average for sure.
The price is pretty reasonable as well.
Downside is the waiting time to get a seat and getting your food served.
You should probably visit the shop during non peak hours/day to avoid having long waiting time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118317192168151606174/reviews
