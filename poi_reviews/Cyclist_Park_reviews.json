      "text": "It's quite a small park for cyclist but i guess mainly its for kids to learn how to cycle. There's 2 areas with bumps if the kids are looking for some challenge. But my girl manage to learn how to turn while cycling as there's some areas with sharp turns. So overall it's quite ok but do note that some areas are quite narrow so if there's a lot of cyclists, it may not be so convenient.",
