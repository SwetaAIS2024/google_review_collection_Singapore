Yuyu Kk,5,"This school is amazing. Teachers are great, they are friendly and we can feel that they really care for children. And also the curriculum is fantastic lots of activities with project  based, very low ratio 1:5. Clean environment. The fees are reasonable. My daughter likes go to school everyday and being active and happy everyday. In addition, they are keeping the most safe distancing and hygiene levels I guess. everyone wears the masks on even in the indoor playground and always safe guards on the table.  Some of the schools just let the children take off the mask and play in and no safe guards. So I feel safe.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116255574180716506597/reviews
