      "text": "Really good chicken rice here. Popular stall in the area.\n\nAppreciated that the soy seasoning was light which allowed the natural flavours of the kampong chicken to shine. Chicken was smooth but retained a good bite, not falling apart tender.\n\nThe rice was fluffy and aromatic with a clean chicken stock flavour without being oily. The soup was the same, not just msg water.\n\nChili was fresh, like a puree. Not cutting corners with the watery stuff.\n\nOnly small negative was that beansprouts ($5) were a  bit overcooked for my taste. Prefer them slightly crunchy.\n\nThe coffee shop was small but airy, only half full on a Sat 11.30am. A lot of people buying takeaway too tho.\n\nPaid $19.50 for 2 pax portion, 2 rice and beansprouts. Not the cheapest but worth the quality in my view.",

      "text": "Excellent chicken rice offering kampung version. The bird is on a smaller size as compared to farm bred ones. Its color is of a distinct yellow hue.\n\nIts meat is tender enough and provided a good bite. The flavor of the chicken was evident.\n\nRice is mildly fragrant of chicken oil and stock.\n\nMinced chili, ginger, black soy and a light soy mix to dress the chicken.\nAll of these are flavorful and went well as a whole.\n\nHighly recommended.",

I am a big fan of chicken rice, and this is almost (one of) the best chicken rice spots in my mind.\n\nThe taste is really good, very similar to another famous chicken house in Outram Park, but cheaper and (for me) closer.\n\nAsked for one portion of breast and one thigh, $10.5 together served with rice and soup. Kailan for another $4.\n\nThe vibe is so relaxing during the day time, with breezy wind and sufficient sunlight. Feel delighted enjoying my meal :) Tables are clean too.\n\nDefinitely will recommend to everyone ü•∞",
