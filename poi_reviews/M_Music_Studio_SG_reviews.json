Is it quite a surprised for me. ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„\n\nThe teachers are all passionate in teaching and willing to share all the details or technique to you, just to want you to keep improving a little by little in every single class.\n\nOf course, you might think that learning music is boring unless you really like it. But I would say, learning music could be fun and enjoyable. Because the teachers at here are all have the  experience to make it fun and use a simple way to make it easier to understand. This really help me to get understand faster and easier.\n\nFurthermore, they are also ok a good observer and good listener to me. Example like when some of the part which is I can't do it well after few try, they will tell me why I can't do well, after that they will show me the correct way and then practice with me together step by step until you can do it correctly.\n\nI really appreciate that's the way their teaching and passionate on me and I will keep learning just wanted to make it better and better on my music instruments.\n\nThank you M Music Studio SgðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š",
