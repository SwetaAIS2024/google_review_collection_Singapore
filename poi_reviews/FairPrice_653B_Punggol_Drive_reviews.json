Very new and well equipped, the space is very well utilised to stock up on a variety of frozen, fresh, and household needs.\n\nThere is even a hot water station and quick bites for instant noodles consumption, and also a elderly help station for those who may have difficulty shopping.",

When ask, staff said not stock up yet. Looks full of item but when you want to get things you want, it does not sell here. Even salt only sell many brands but all fine salt! Worst Fairprice store!! Still need to go Oasis branch to get salt(course/normal), 10kg rice of Jasmin fairprice brand etc.",
