Sharmain S,5,"The staff are great, I really appreciate their service! This is a quieter Starbucks at lunchtime, no queue at 12.30pm, so itâ€™s a relaxed atmosphere (maybe contributes to the good service lol). Best Starbucks to go to during lunch on a workday or get delivery from since thereâ€™s not many people.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104458278532609737064/reviews
Bay Yong Sheng,1,"Ordered a venti Pure Matcha Latte, paid extra for Paper bag, yet the guy that serve me say need to pay extra 10cents more and insisted thatâ€¦ and the pure matcha latte is 40% liquid 30% Ice 30% foam. I literally saw him poured the matcha latte only till less than half of the cup and put ice and top it off with Foam, to make the cup looks full.

Dan Freeman,1,Asked for a Flat white in a mug and he prepared crap in a paper cup. Asked him for a mug and he poured the crap into a mug. Asked him to remake it and it was still crap.

mtml,1,"Staff are more interested in chatting with each other than taking your order, and they don't bother taking your name for the drinks or telling you when the POS payment clears.

The only benefit to this Starbucks is that it's usually quite empty (cause no aircon and probably because of the service). But if you want an actual normal staff interaction, try the 313 Starbucks lol the staff there are quite lovely.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115046503281791430051/reviews
K H,3,"The atmosphere here is truly a 0/10, besides being outdoors thereâ€™s a constant flock of pigeons and birds coming in and trampling everywhere - on tables chairs and pooping on the floor too. Not as conducive and nice as other bucks outlets ðŸ¥º Cruffins were good but the pain is keeping birds away.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107810340858049600968/reviews
