Christopher Wong,5,"Brother from this stall is absolutely helpful. Although on google map it says close at 7:30pm, but i still tried to call at around 6:45pm. Told brother i can only reach around 7:25pm, he told me usually they close at 7pm. I asked if he can wait for me, i think he said no promise but tell me try to come as fast as possible. Now i just reached and although the shop is closed (lights out) but he is still inside doing some stuff, he opened the door and allow me to collect my parcel. Thank you for being so kind and helpful, if i don't collect today, the parcel will be sent back to Shopee so i really appreciate his help. 100/100 ‚ò∫Ô∏èüôèüèª‚ú®",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103327378980221636441/reviews
