We checked in using the Priority Pass App. The food is okay, the menu is more Arabic style menu. There were only few toilets that we can use, so we have to queue for maybe about 30 minutes. They had quite comfortable sofa so we can rest a bit.",

      "text": "We came to this lounge because we had a Priority Pass App, and I think the food here is pretty good, and the atmosphere as well. This is a rather well-equipped airport lounge that seems to focus on Indian food.\n\nThere are a number of seats for guests to sit at. There are also a lot of chargers and USB sockets. Travelers can have their meetings at the table or charge their devices. Some of the seats are by the window, offering views of the planes, and some of them are in dining table styles of 4.\n\nüçõüçùüçò Buffet Options\nThe food options are not very generous but enough to feed and cater to different kinds of diets.\n\nAt the initial start of the table, there are breakfast items such as salads and cereals, and there's a coffee machine that can make multiple types of hot beverages.\n\nThe next middle section is the main area, where they offer noodles, rice, and soups for you to take. There are also some alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and snacks and sandwiches in the middle.\n\nI think this place is quite well-equipped, and since it's an Indian-centric lounge, they did the Indian food really well, especially the Biryani and the chicken, which is very well seasoned with different spices in the curry.\n\nOverall verdict?\nI think overall, this lounge exceeded my expectations of an entry-level lounge!",

It‚Äôs true that this is not a fancy decor lounge for business class passengers but it‚Äôs ample for a couple of hours layover. There‚Äôs three showers in the lounge and they will give you a buzzer to call you when the shower is ready. Towel, body wash, shampoo and hair dryer are provided. Staffs were also friendly. Food ranges are limited but still acceptable. Atmosphere is not a top notch but clean enough. If comparing to hotel, this lounge is a business hotel.",
