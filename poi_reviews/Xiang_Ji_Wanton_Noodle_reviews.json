Their taste didn't change. Their dumpling is filled with an actual prawn and not just mince prawn filling, giving that mouthful taste in every bite. As I see the stallholder ageing with passing time, I wonder how long more can  keep this tasteful memories. In this photo, I ordered a $5 bowl and you can actually see the 3 dumplings taking up the entire bowl space! Worthy for money and taste. These days, it is hard to find such gemful taste in Singapore!",

      "text": "Traditional wanton mee. Pretty average tasting (this is a good thing). Nothing really spectacular about their sauce, wanton nor char siew, but it just works.\n\nNoodles are cooked al dente and QQ. Generous serving of noodles for the $5 portion. I would recommend to get the dry version with green chilli, as the broth is also very ok-ok tasting.\n\nOne of the “healthier” stalls here at Bedok corner, can consider this if you’re looking for something that tastes good but isn’t fried or drenched in oil. Unfortunately it’s not halal though.",
