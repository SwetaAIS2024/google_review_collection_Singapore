We are very happy with how she turned out - could see that she enjoyed school and her teachers (special shout out to Sing Mei Lao Shi and Teacher Sam) also provided a warm and loving environment which allowed her to thrive. We could feel the love for my girl and she keeps talking about them at home! Ms Angi is also a great administrative staff who helps us with the paperwork - she is very detailed and love her post its and little reminders. Thank you Twinklekidz @ Bendemeer for this great start to her schooling life!",

I was fortunate to have both my children schooled in an environment where there is strengthened positive learning, putting in effort to ensure young children is always engaged with outdoor activities, library trips, and even overnight camp. Being art based school, I have seen my children blossomed and developed art interest in various genres. Truly a holistic experience.",

A BIG thank you to the principal and teachers for making this happen. You go all the way out to help our children by being patient and gentle with them. Every child is different and it's not an easy job handling them. Kudos to you for the great job you are doing.",

I think the kids are the best spokesperson for the teachers. The best thing about the place is that there is a see-through glass so you can see your baby interact with teachers and other babies before picking up. Full transparency.\nThey provide weekly photos of the babies doing different activities too! Thank you teachers for loving the babies!",
