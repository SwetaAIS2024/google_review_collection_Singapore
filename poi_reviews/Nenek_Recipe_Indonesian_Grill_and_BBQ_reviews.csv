Derrick Lin,1,"Ordered Yam Penyet….The chicken is older than my grandmother and harder than the metal utensils. $6.80 for this Ayam penyet and my teeth nearly dropped when biting the meat. They are pre-fried and left there for ages, maybe since dinosaurs roam the earth. Very very bad…very very depressed after this meal…how can they do this to me….",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105989843156970934066/reviews
Wenxi Chua (wenxi),3,"Heading down to this corner of the food court after learning from a friend that this Indonesian Grill & BBQ serves a good bowl of Mee Soto.

Besides the lighted menu that was displayed on the stall, they have a paper menu on the ordering counter too.

While my friends had introduced the noodles dishes we somehow got carried away from the Nasi Set and ordered their Ayam Penyet and Ayam Penggang. Each plate comes with meat, raw vegetables, Tempeh and a small piece of Tau Gua. The Ayam Penyet was big, meaty and crispy.

Ayam Penyet - $6.80

The chilli is the bomb and elevates the dish giving a fiery kick to it. Ayam Penggang was sweet and delightful coated in the dark sauce.

Ayam Penggang - $6.80

We added Bagedil on top of the $4 bowl of Mee Rebus. Their style of Mee Rebus was decent with hard-boiled egg, beansprouts and chopped Tau Gua. The gravy was more an orange color. Overall, this bowl of Mee Rebus was not too bad too.

Mee Rebus - $4

A stomach-comforting bowl of Mee Soto was recommended. It was pretty decent with a handful of shredded chicken meat, not too bad but I'm still searching for a good bowl of Mee Soto.

Mee Soto - $4

Food is pretty decent and there were also a long queue during lunch hours. I do not mind going back again for other dishes.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103653090717736591201/reviews
Debbie Rahim,5,"I ordered nasi padang wth rendang beef,sambal paru,bergedil,salted egg and sambal belacan. Total was $13.50.

Beef rendang i give 5/5. So yummy and the meat is tender.Paru is 3/5. Some parts are tougher and it taste mid in my opinion. Sambal belacan is 5/5. Spicy and so syiok. The spiciness linger on your fingera if you use your hand to eat. So you know it is legit spicy. Bergedil is 5/5 too. Real mash potato unlike some which uses powdered potato.

Overall taste is delicious and even better than some other well establish nasi padang stall.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113754854608099662492/reviews
Ng Wei Meng,5,"I bought ayam penyet from this stall at 6.00 (price@2023). The size of the chicken meat is big. The meat are soft and easy to remove from the bones.

The taste of the chicken is more of an average ayam goreng. What I like is the chilli sambal they made. The taste is really unique, very nice Indonesian sambal.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103072959491907955597/reviews
