patrick przybylski,5,"Nice food and unique taste and worthwhile to try. Second time we go and this time took the kids along and they even loved it more than us. Price is reasonable and so are the portions. For sure recommend.
We ordered the beef fresh noodles and beef dumplings and beef skewers. Also their coffee and homemade tea has a unique taste.
Went again with kids for lunch. Tried potato slices and beef soup with bamboo shoots. See photos. We all enjoyed the food, especially the kids.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102555680847577191499/reviews
LEGO Knight12,5,"Was recommended by a colleague to try this newly open restaurant. The place is nice and clean. The service is fast and friendly. The cutleries and bowls are kept in sanitized cabinet with temperature controlled. The food are fresh and the portions are generous. I love the cooked lamb, so soft and succulent. The beef is amazingly soft and tender. I noticed lots of malay muslims patronised the restaurant. The home-made yogurt is incredibly delicious that you’ll want more than one cup! Definitely worth it and value for money! Wish the restaurant more success! Will definitely becoming again to be our favourite place for halal chinese muslim steamboat.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111399907907699475307/reviews
