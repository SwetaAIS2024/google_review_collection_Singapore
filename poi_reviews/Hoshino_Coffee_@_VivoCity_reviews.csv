Matthew Lee,2,"QR ordering system was a challenge. Menu and electronic versions were in a different sequence, as well as items being called different names or placed in a different category.

Plain boiled beef, cubed, served with a watered down demi-glaze poured over. Meat still tough and tastes irony.

Souffle Egg Katsu Curry though beautiful to look at, the group agrees that a runny egg omelette in the dish will look just as amazing and score much better in the taste department.

The number of desserts ordered by other table around us, made us wonder if Hoshino is better known for their coffees and desserts???

Given the quality of food... pricey.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102172941439658597090/reviews
jayjaytruviews,3,"Quite an average experience at Hoshino Coffee located in Singapore, Vivocity.

The coffee here was not bad but for the price we paid, we don’t think it was worth it.

It also took a while for them to make when it wasn’t too busy.

Worse off, they charged us for wet wipes which we didn’t even ask for?",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107406779507889233689/reviews
Sarah Tan,2,"Overcooked omu and overcooked soufle pancake.

Other items were nice though..

Female servers (Indian and Chinese) were abrasive and kept approaching us with ""YES?!"" Pls guide them on the proper way of greeting customers.

Male server was hardworking though.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112541724626371495294/reviews

PP T,1,"I’ll give ZERO STAR if I can. This place sucks do not come. The whole place was empty and I asked for a sofa seat and was rejected, yet they gave the sofa seats to others...who are foreigners caucasian?? And the reason staff gave was: IT IS LUNCH TIME. The nerve! Not only that, staff purposely placed a RESERVED SIGNAGE after I was being rudely declined for that sofa seat when it was clearly not reserved and the whole place was EMPTY! Pictures dont lie… So rude! This is the last time I am coming. Good luck to your business",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111324896424324216509/reviews
