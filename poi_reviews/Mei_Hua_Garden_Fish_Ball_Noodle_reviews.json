      "text": "Homely bowl of dry Fishball noodles.\n\nThis stall is run by an old couple. One of the more popular stalls at Jalan Batu Hawker Centre.\n\nThere was a line of 4-5 people, some of whom had multiple orders. Total wait time on a weekend morning was around 20-25 minutes as uncle prepares each dish freshly from scratch.\n\nAsked for Mee pok, which was nice and chewy. Chilli was good, not overpowering.\n\nFishballs are not handmade, but nice. Comes with generous amounts of fish cake and sliced pork. Generous with the spring onions too!\n\nShiok!",

This stall is run by elderly couple, there was a small queue formed when I was there. Noodle was alright but have a slight alkaline to it. It comes with the standard ingredient of fishcake, fishball and lean meat. Overall, it a decent bowl of noodle.",

Very affordable at 2.50 plus additional $0.50 for extra fishballs although it was factory supplied; not many places in Singapore where you can find such prices these days!",
