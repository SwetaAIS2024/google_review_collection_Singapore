randall,4,"First time trying kenangan coffee at this new outlet. Was pleasantly surprised at the flavors. The iced latte was pretty deep and tasty.
Place wasn't crowded and a lot of people seemed to be ordering to go or ordering online.

eggs,3,"as a non-coffee person (but occasional latte enjoyer) the coffee was too strong and bitter / rough for me idk if that’s normal. has a few seats but is uncozy, with harsh lighting and no music :( . not really for chilling. staff look worn out :( are y’all ok tho.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105350814182339617736/reviews
TH Koh,4,"Giving this place 4 stars because it's practically the only cafe in Vivocity where you have a decent probability of obtaining a seat -- especially during the weekends.

With that being said, there are only 4 small tables here. It accommodates around 3 pax per table.

Coffee is average at best. Banana muffin was excellent because it was heated up before serving. Sausage puff was average.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107094247170799905974/reviews
