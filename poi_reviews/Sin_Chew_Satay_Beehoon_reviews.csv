Cassia A,5,"This is absolutely delicious. The line is long, but moves pretty fast and is worth the wait. While I was in line, 2 locals stopped me to say I was making a good choice.
The satay bee hoon is noodles in satay (peanut) sauce with shrimp, greens, cuttlefish, and oysters.
Two of us shared the $6 medium and also got another meal to share.
It’s so worth the money and insanely delicious.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117662481746295955146/reviews
AC Chan,5,"Being a typical Singaporean 🇸🇬, I spotted a queue that started forming before the stall’s official opening hours and quickly joined in the snaking line.✌🏻 I was finally rewarded with this prized dish in the largest portion, after a 20-minute wait. 🙌🏻🙌🏻
Buried beneath the rich and savoury satay gravy, we uncovered a bountiful mix of fresh ingredients including cockles, prawns 🍤, sliced cuttlefish, prawns, sliced meat, tau pok [a.k.a. fried tofu puff], kangkong, beansprouts and beehoon [a.k.a. rice vermicelli]. In fact, every strand of beehoon and ingredient coated with the gloriously rich, thick and savoury peanut satay sauce is pure awesome-ness!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
Super Fragrance,5,"Queued for 10min and ordered $5 satay bee hoon.

Comparable with guan heng cooked food satay beehoon but is a different take. Satay sauce is more savory than sweet if that's your take you probably prefer this.

Meat was thinly sliced so the lack of tenderness wasn't obvious. Cuttlefish goes well and provides extra dimensions due to the bounce. Definitely not spicy and the amount is not the largest.

What i feel can improve for me is that the sauce and noodle can be less viscous after all the mixing. It clumped up too much so ended up with noodle lump rather than noddles. Nevertheless a good tasting plate of satay beehoon",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105892392413528737906/reviews
