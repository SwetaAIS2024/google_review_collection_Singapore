      "text": "Hakata Japanese Restaurant @ NeWest is a well-established gem thatâ€™s been serving authentic Japanese fare since 1999. Itâ€™s one of my personal favourites, known for consistently good food that keeps me coming back.\n\nThe restaurant has a cozy, welcoming interior with tatami-style seating that adds to its intimate charm. I had the Hamburger Steak for lunch and it was excellent â€” juicy, flavourful, and perfectly cooked. A solid 5 out of 5 â€” a dependable go-to that always delivers.",

Vegetable was refried twiceâ€¦ end up it was soggy and bad. When gave feedback, the store supervisor offered a $1 discount. Yes ONE DOLLAR. He say because it is the best they can do. Wow. The Eihire was I believe, tossed into a toaster instead of grilled. Total bill was $156 for 2 person. But end up the store supervisor waived the beef which was $28++ because we simply couldnâ€™t and didnâ€™t eat it.",

The staff told me that they air-flown their ingredients 4 times a week!\n\nI had the Saba fish for $18. It is more expensive than others but not unaffordable. I got a huge portion and enjoyed the meal.\n\nUnlimited $1.50 refillable green tea. Will visit again.",

      "text": "Affordable simple Japanese dining in the West but some of the cooked pork and beef entrees looks and tastes like Chinese food rather than Japanese. Nothing against Chinese food but this is a Japanese fine dining restaurant!\n\nPortions were generous.\n\nThe deep fried oysters were great. No fishy smell.\n\nYakiniku Don was ok but I would rather not have the ginger and spring onions in my Yakiniku Don. Otherwise, it tastes more like the stir fried Chinese beef with spring onions and ginger. Didn't taste like a regular Yakiniku Don but Chinese beef with ginger and spring onions and looked like it too. ðŸ˜…\n\nI think reviews from other diners also had the same 'Chinese' food experience I had. But I think their sushi and sashimi Japanese food probably tastes and look Japanese. ðŸ˜‚",
