SeungJun Kim,4,"First time trying Vadai and it tasted great. It is personally my kind of favourite finger food. Would definitely buy again, affordable prices and crunchy textures to the fried food

oXRYSTALo Ong,5,"Donkey has introduced me to the delightful offerings at The Original Vadai in Joo Chiat. This esteemed establishment, celebrated for its exquisite vadai creations, has always been a topic of interest in our conversations. The vadai dishes served here are a culinary masterpiece, especially when paired with the zesty punch of green chili.

After numerous discussions extolling the promising flavors of The Original Vadai, our cycling escapade finally afforded us the perfect chance to immerse ourselves in this gastronomic journey. While pedaling past, Donkey pointed out that this was the renowned Vadai spot renowned for its exceptional fare.

During our visit, I eagerly sampled both the vegetarian vadai and the prawn vadai. It was the prawn vadai that truly captivated my palate and left a lasting impact. Accompanying the delectable vadai was an outstanding tea that ranks among the best I have ever tasted.

Having relished the betel leaves paired with the vadai, my craving for more led to an additional order of two additional vadai‚Äîopting for the ikan bilis and another prawn variant. The Original Vadai is a destination not to be missed. The remarkable tea experience further cemented my fondness for this spot, making me willing to cycle back solely for the tea.

Echoing my sentiments, Donkey also found the experience at The Original Vadai truly unforgettable. The delightful culinary offerings, inviting ambiance, and affable service seamlessly blended to create a memorable dining sojourn. Therefore, we are delighted to bestow upon this establishment a well-deserved 5-star rating, highlighting the exceptional food flavors, welcoming atmosphere, and hospitable service rendered.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114556064085815871377/reviews
