      "text": "This is just another add on review that the Sup Kambing is Very Delicious! Flavourful and will recommend to anyone who wants hot comfort soup. No one will regret the taste of this kambing soup. There is no 'bad' goat's smell from any part of the soup and it is thoroughly cooked so you can feel the essence of the tasteful soup run through when you swallow it. If cyclists wanna full meal before your journey home or to Changi Village, this will probably be one you can have. It lies at the far end corner of the hawker centre but it packs a good bowl of flavour! Enjoy!",
