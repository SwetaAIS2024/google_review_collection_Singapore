Approached him with the complete intention to purchase iPhone 16 Pro Max 256gb White Titanium at the price reflected on price board; however; I was rudely notified that the price reflected is “PROMOTION PRICE” with condition that I MUST BUY $250 worth of AppleCare. I asked where was this condition anywhere reflected in the shop, and he mentioned this is company instruction. I reconfirmed with him again if this is true, he confidently said yes!\n\nI will make sure a formal complain to relevant authorities is made, as such unethical practices is surely not the first encounter per several reviews below.",

The staff is friendly and helpful, and they have a wide selection of products to choose from. The store is also open 24 hours a day, which is convenient for travelers. I would definitely recommend this store to anyone looking for Apple products in Singapore.",
