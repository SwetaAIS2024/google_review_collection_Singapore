      "text": "Excellent service at Lens Hub. Kellie, the optometrist, did a thorough and detailed check on my eye health to diagnose issues and then advised on an action plan for treatment. She was also clear and reassuring in her explanations. Another staff then helped in the selection of frames to enhance my facial features.\nExcellent experience overall. Will be back and will bring my family to Lens Hub for our optical needs.",

She did a thorough check on the eyes, asked questions on my needs, patiently did the eyes test and customize the lens to best suit my needs. She clearly explained the problems I have and how she will resolve them. Will definitely go back again and recommend to my friends.",

      "text": "I've been a customer at this store for many years, even after moving. However, since the arrival of new staff, the service has plummeted. Particularly, this female employee is quick to blame others when issues arise, which is ironic considering she handles all the communication when I call.\n\nCommunication with her is an uphill battle. Initially, she made a mistake with the color of my contact lenses, and she attributed it to a previous employee or system errors.\n\nAfter enduring three price hikes within a year, I expressed my dissatisfaction, stating that I'd rather purchase from a store just across the street. Suddenly, she claimed she'd speak to the boss, and the price would be reduced. However, when I showed her a screenshot of the same item at the previous price two months later, she informed me of yet another increase, insisting she needs to consult the boss again.\n\nDealing with her has become tiresome, and as a long-time customer, I've decided to switch eyeglass stores. The level of service and communication has reached an all-time low.",
