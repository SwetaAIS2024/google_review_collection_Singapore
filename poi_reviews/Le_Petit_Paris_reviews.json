The food was delicious and brought when we were ready. The smoked pork belly was devine, foie gras and desserts delicious. A fabulous personal touch by the chef as he greeted all the guests and chatted. We will definitely come back.",

Highly recommend the smoked pork belly - it was so tender and melt-in-your-mouth with all the right flavours.\n\nWe also ordered salmon mosaic, duct confit and ratatouille. Everything was perfect.\n\nWe ended our meal with a banana bergamote cake made by Chef Felicien Cueff himself. It was delicious, refreshing, light and hit the right spot.\n\nI always had the impressionable French food was inaccessible around here but am so lucky to have found Le Petit Paris by chance tucked in a corner of Siglap at very reasonable prices.\n\nAnd the service was fast and excellent - very friendly, attentive and approachable staff, including Chef himself.\n\nThanks again for having us :-)",

They even surprised me with a special birthday celebration, which made the evening feel extra unique and personal.\n\nThe food was fantastic! The air-flown oysters were incredibly fresh, plump, and briny. We also tried the foie gras, duck confit, and seafood spaghetti marinaraâ€”each dish was well-executed and full of flavour. Iâ€™d highly recommend all three if youâ€™re visiting for the first time.\n\nFor dessert, I especially enjoyed the pistachio ice creamâ€”smooth, creamy, and rich with authentic pistachio flavour.\n\nOverall, a wonderful dining experience, ideal for special occasions. Highly recommended.",
