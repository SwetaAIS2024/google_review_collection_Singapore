Yuzu drink is refreshing üòç\n\nBest for sharing but they also have single cup bingsu in petite size for single diners. Check out their ongoing promotion üëèüèª",

      "text": "This authentic Korean dessert cafe is a nostalgic favourite for many that serves up a variety of bingsus (available in both shareable & single-cup sizes), waffles, & drinks!\n\nWe had their green tea bingsu ($16.90), which was made with premium green tea from Hadong, Korea. It features finely shaved ice topped with a rich green tea sauce, ice cream, red bean, & almond bits. Liked how this wasn‚Äôt overly sweet or jelak. If you enjoy a green tea & red bean combo, this is worth a try !!\n\nTried their sweet potato waffles ($12.40), which is one of their newer creations. This had a soft sweet potato mouthfeel. Waffle texture was on point ‚Äî crisp & fluffy on the outside, dense on the inside. Buttermilk might have slightly overshadowed the sweet potato flavour, but it was still an enjoyable waffle overall. They also have an ongoing promo where you can get a free hot green tea with every sweet potato waffle purchased on weekdays!\n\nWe had their dalgona cafe latte ($7) ‚Äî made with espresso, dalgona, & milk ‚Äî this had a strong milky profile with a classic latte flavour. The crunchy dalgona added a fun texture that gave the latte added sweetness as it melted. If you‚Äôre avoiding caffeine, there are non-espresso options too ‚Äî one with brown sugar syrup & another that‚Äôs just milk and dalgona.\n\nAlso !! It‚Äôs currently $5 off a Bingsu Combo Meal (includes a bingsu of your choice, waffles, & a latte)!\n\nWill return for their bingsus ÔΩû",

      "text": "We got the mango bingsu, cafe Latte and sweet potato waffle. Quite a generous portion of mango chunks, and there were some cranberries which added a nice change in texture. The cafe latte was also quite good. The amount of ice could be reduced a bit so the drink doesn‚Äôt become too diluted. The sweet potato flavour wasn‚Äôt very strong for the waffle, and eaten alone was a bit plain but tasted good paired with the ice cream. Overall on the slightly pricier side but it‚Äôs not too bad if split among a group of people! A good place to go for a night out at orchard, would definitely come back!",

      "text": "i love this place!! been coming here since secondary school days, and no where else‚Äôs bingsu tops this. while the prices have definitely increased, i still feel that it is worth the visit if you‚Äôre craving dessert at somerset. all time favs are the matcha and injeolmi signature. not a big fan of oreo personally, but all my friends love their oreo biscoff. it‚Äôs also not a very like atas environment, and sometimes the table gets sticky from old bingsu, but like nothing a quick clean (and your own bingsu) can‚Äôt fix",
