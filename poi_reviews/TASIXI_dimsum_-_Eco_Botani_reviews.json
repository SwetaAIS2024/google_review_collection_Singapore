      "text": "Great place for dim sum. Environment is clean and comfortable. Staff is efficient and helpful. Food ordered served quickly. Other items will be offered to you on a large tray, you can pick and choose. Some of items I wanted were not on rotation. Like porridge, steamed rice rolls and poached lettuce. Waited for a while for them and they never appeared. Had to get other items instead. I noticed the fried items are very ample and keep coming around. The steamed items are less ample and there is less variety. But on the whole there is plenty to eat and they are all very nice. Cheers!",

      "text": "Place had some super solid dim sum, recommend the egg tart, one of my favourite egg tarts with a crispy and flaky pastry and a soft and creamy interior. liu sha pao is really good too. these two dishes, highly reccomend.\n\nthe downside of this restaurant is the decore and atmosphere, felt the place was abit dark, the table cloth was so long that it rests in your leg when you sit, super uncomfortable especially if you value cleanliness.\n\noverall great dimsum place, evident by the consistent flow of customers so do come early if you‚Äôre visiting, great food just need to shorten their table clothes",
