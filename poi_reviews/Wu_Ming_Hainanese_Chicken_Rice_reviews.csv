Priscilla Lim,5,Tender and juicy chicken. The standard is always good! My fav chicken rice~,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112012355379124153478/reviews
Dereth Tang,1,"Their Chicken Porridge used to be good. Now the portion is super small and extremely bland. Very stingy with chicken portions also. They really don't want anyone to order the government mandated budget meal. Then don't bloody we'll advertise something you cannot deliver. I'd rather eat any other stall's budget meal instead of yours. I used to love your chicken porridge. Now there is nothing worthy anymore. I hate it. I hate you. Overall good quality went down. This seemed to have happened when most of the staff changed. Right around the time a Malay lady was handling the cashier. Not faulting anyone in particular, just coincides that the food quality went down when someone new was there and wanted to provide some sort of time stamp. Anyway, these days I'll prefer to buy from Ming Kitchen's Tze Char or the Fish Soup stall. This branch of Wu Ming is seriously not worth it.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111247702216253849824/reviews
