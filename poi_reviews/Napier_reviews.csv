Javen Leow,5,"Newly-opened station with side platforms - the southbound platform (towards Gardens by the Bay) is on the same floor as the ticket gates, while the northbound platform (towards Woodlands North) is downstairs

Serves the southernmost part of the Singapore Botanic Gardens (the ""Botanic Gardens station"" serves the northernmost part of the Gardens)

Napier is also where some of the Western embassies are situated
If you need to go to the British Council, or the embassies of Australia or the US, alight here (note that the UK High Commission is slightly nearer to Orchard Boulevard station)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103533744765056843646/reviews
