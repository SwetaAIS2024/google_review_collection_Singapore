      "text": "Giving it a 5 stars because it duplicates those same type of steamboat restaurants we saw in Taipei street. Nothing atas. Nothing fanciful. Just a nice pot of soup of your choice, with a big bowls of mixed veggies (which usually don’t see here) and the generous portion of main course meat. Soup may be bland at first. That’s why u put in the corn, pumpkin, cabbage to make it more savoury. Of course, please don’t compare it to those high end steamboat restaurant. It was never meant to be. Our kind of place! Will definitely come back again!",

      "text": "Personal pot steamboats are always a little less vibey than sharing pots. Not a very ideal place if you wanna have a more reunion-style dining experience. It’s rm30 per pax per pot, you can choose to share a pot but you have to top up rm5. The menu is pretty large. I’d say go for one pot and add on more sides so you can try more things together! Also because the food in the normal set is not that great haha mainly consists of fishballs meatballs balls ….\n\nLove the sauces though! Not splendid but tasty :)",
