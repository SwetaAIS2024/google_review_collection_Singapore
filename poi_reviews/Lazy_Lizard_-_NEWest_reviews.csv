Pong Ah,5,"Have been here before without giving review although everything was great. We came again for a late lunch (or early dinner) on a quiet weekday since they have now a 50% off after 3pm for all dishes on pizza, risotto, pasta, main and burger. At first we thought the offered dishes will be some downsized version but they were actually a full normal size and taste too ðŸ˜Š

So we had a bulgogi iberico pizza and a rack of pork. The pizza was as great as the truffle salami we had for dinner before. Crispy thin crush, full of flavorful ingredients with a hint of spiciness. Substantial of melted cheese, so it was quite rich as a whole. We managed only to eat 3 out out 8 slides but happily to take home the rest. The rack of pork was also excellent. A thick piece of tendered and well marinated pork, came with lots of mashed potatoes topped with saute mushrooms and cherry tomatoes. The meat was perfectly cooked and the mushroom source matched it very well. Again it was rather rich and we would wish it came with some green salads instead although the mashed potato was really good too.

Overall superb meal with a great ambient. Also we must mention the abundant friendliness and cheerfulness of the serving staff. Will certainly come again many times",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102026585467594766953/reviews
Rong Jingxiang,4,"Nice place for dinner. Kids eat for free on Saturday, Sunday and public holiday which is great for families with young kids. The rack of pork is pretty good. Only flaw is they don't provide free ice water.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108841287693672702030/reviews
Alex Ng,5,"Been here a few times and itâ€™s time to lock in my review. First of all, the rack of pork rarely disappoints! Itâ€™s Duroc pork chop sous vide and then pan fried. So itâ€™s crusty yet so tender in the middle. You never knew pork can taste like that. The service is always top notch and nice atmosphere too. I highly recommend to come for lunch as you can pay for the main and get soup, drink and dessert for free.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116567255422509387871/reviews
Paul Chatfield,5,"Had the asparagus and cheese was great and the beef cheeks were amazing. Veg was good. Burger was great too.

Portions are big so come hungry. Staff very attentive too.

Only thing is put some lower seating outside - not everyone can tahan high stools and table. Put some of this inside too ðŸ˜Ž",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116719992552821137996/reviews
Connie Tin,5,"The food is very nice and delicious . Especially the burger , the juice will squeeze out and it will taste very tasty and scrumptious. The food that I will suggest eating is the carbonara as it is very creamy and of different flavours.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105459237549262146541/reviews
