alex ng,5,"My car tyre punctured this morning. Drove to this Honda service centre , which was the nearest along the way. The Boss assessed and worked on patching himself before his tyre man come to work. He told me he helped , so that I don't reach office too late. Best in Customer focused service that I have come across. Thumbs up !!!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111337252806017444899/reviews

Joshrada Ng,4,"No frills and hassle place to service your Honda vehicles. Went there after I received an unresistable deal from Kah Motor flash deal. Do take note that because of the space constraint, they do not have a proper waiting area and probably no eateries within a 300m radius. Kudos that the wait time for me was within 60mins!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111965690942188397418/reviews
Frances Ong,1,If 0 star was an option I will choose that. Poor service. Been with Honda over ten years.  Battery flat after service. Feedback was followed by a quick and formality call to apologise and to finish their job. Nothing was done. Long running brand great car but reputation tarnishes by their post sales service. Pity.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111776994003131805693/reviews
