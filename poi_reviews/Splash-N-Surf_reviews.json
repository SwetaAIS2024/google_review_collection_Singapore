Life guards were also on duty just in case. Got the washroom and shower area for changing clothes afterwards.",

Itâ€™s wonderful that they have life guards on duty.\n\nLazy river is ticketed and needs an adult accompaniment. Children need to be at least 1m.\n\nRemember to bring sunblock if you heading here between 10am to 5pm. Weekdays are quieter.",

Pre-booking and payment required. For hygiene and safety reasons, riders must bring your own swimwear and rash guard (specialised attire that fits the top half of the body to prevent abrasion). I got my rash guard from Lazada at about $14. The venue provides the boards and safety helmet. You can try prone, kneeling and standing position on different boards. Great fun!",
