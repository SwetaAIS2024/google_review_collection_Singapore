      "text": "This place deserves a shoutout. I’ve ordered them via grabfood twice and never disappointed (never tried it at the physical store before tho). Food’s good, portion’s big and price is reasonable even for delivery.\n\nChicken chop fried rice - fried rice includes bean sprout, charsiew, hotdog and taste like what you can find at typical tzechar stall (even better than some tzechar). Chicken chop is of standard size too.\n\nChicken cutlet - crispy, thin crust, good size. They even packed the fries + garlic bread in another bag! Small but thoughtful gesture.\n\nOld school western stall that serves comfort food. Do try it if you have a chance.",

      "text": "It is what it is!\nIt’s smack in an industrial estate, packed with people who have limited options in the vicinity. Kwan’s has a wide menu selection. From the price and quality I got, a wide menu selection compensated for price and quality... I guess.\n\nManaged by an elderly couple, they were moving fast in the kitchen getting orders out. You would need to shout when you speak, because you were shouted at when asked, “You want?”  LOL it was an experience. Still they are a happy looking couple churning out dishes for customers.\n\nThe queue was long during lunch. Might have been to the lack of options around us and the unbearable heat to walk further out.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Chop for $6.00. Reasonable, I think. But I laughed when I saw a sign that said: “Photo for illustration purpose only.” While waiting for my order, I had that sinking feeling of a bad decision. Oh dear, basic buyer’s remorse.",

      "text": "Fries very little, my son only ate 5 fries when picture was taken.  Even he said it wasn't enough.\nThe fries are dry.\nThe beans small about 1 tablespoon were cold and watery.\nThe garlic bread had a hint of garlic probably stroke the bread when it used to be bread.  Was toasted so much it was no longer bread or toast but had transformed into a crouton.\nThe coleslaw was ok but small still but I'm not a fan of coleslaw.\nThe fish was perfectly cooked on the outside,  the hot wet interior well..... it was wet.\n\nI'd prefer to pay more and go to Astons, where the food is a better quality.",

Paid $50, change $3.8.\nIs my fault on not realise and inform store owner immediately. And what makes me frustrated was the store owners not willing to resolve this together and keep blaming me on “messing with their cash”.\nWell, lesson learned with a chicken chop rice that cost me around $46.",
