One can understand due to the high rental cost but if the food quality does not even meet the minimum standard and expectation, then u can truly understand what it means by over price and expensive.\n\nTo make matter worst, the quantity is even below average\n\nMy bad experience comes from repeated order of seafood soup and rice. The quantity is beyond anyone's comprehension.\n\nUnless no choice, then i will place order during rainy days. If not, this store will be my last option.\n\nGo try it to see if my review is truly biased or not, and you will know why it was given only a one star rating.",
