Nice walk and easier to reach from the overhead bridge that is link to kpe from upper serangoon road and sengkang\n\nOlder post\nMuddy trail towards the forest, best to time it during non raining season. Was not able to make it to the end due to ponding along the trail",

Under the expressway, you would think that the cars overhead would be a nuisance, but that's the beauty of it, only the sound of birds echo in that chasm. Will be a pity to see this go.",
