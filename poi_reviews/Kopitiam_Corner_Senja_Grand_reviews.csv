James Bartholomew,5,"During 1600hrs no crowd and comfortable on a weekday. I had late lunch and early dinner(I suppose). I ordered a chicken chop and add on spaghetti(option) side order (either coleslaw or French Fried) is included beside spaghetti $1, total :$8. Tiger beer $8( weather so warm need to cool down). This eatery coffee shop have 5 Chinese stalls, one Japanese food, one Muslim food and  one western food. If you using NTUC apps,  you will be given 10 per cent discount.  Payment on app. Cash no discount. The western food i had was good, Japanese not bad(but fried stuff can be oily). Washroom one entry for lady and man (one standing cubicle one room). Washroom avg clean. Evening dinner can be crowded, especially weekend. Most stall food will sold out around 8pm. Well ventilated and two Hugh fans(nice). Table are clean too. Economical rice reasonable rice and friendly servers. Noticed the roasted Chinese stall price doesn't goes with the quantity of food orders few pieces of pathetic meats. The only stall that have very few customers",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109142802627956069816/reviews

Rie Huang,4,"Overall the coffeeshop itself is ok. Just the food stall food not nice. Fish soup not nice, jap rice, chicken rice and worst is the latest addition Man Kee Express - serving tasteless Curry Fish Head (fish no taste, curry watery, veg blend n not cooked thru) I also ordered Áå™ÊùÇÊ±§ (oily, parts are weirdly cut, pork rib smelly oil smell probably keep too long, got pork bung ü§Æ) Áå™ËÑöÈÜã (pale looking, light vinegar taste, not cooked enough, flavour not in)  ÁÉßÈ±º grilled stingray (worst of it all- ammonia taste. Chilli cannot cover the taste . Oily also) Please don't eat from the stall.

Mixed veg rice is ok. Kopi is ok. Malay stall quite good and Economical Beehoon ok also.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105949012761277326200/reviews
Elaina Poh,1,"Errmm
Salmon steak as thin as the fork (the metal part of the fork), lightly crisp, defroze fishy smell, honey sauce taste weird to my taste bud. mashed potatoes taste powdery. Coleslaw not to expectation. Whole dishes not hot at all.

Black pepper chicken taste sweet and savory (weirdest taste ever). The texture of the chicken is toward dry and chewy.

Foc crispy fries. Errmm ok lor, foc what do you expect more from it.

Overall, their service is friendly.

However won't be back for their food.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101214311879907130264/reviews
