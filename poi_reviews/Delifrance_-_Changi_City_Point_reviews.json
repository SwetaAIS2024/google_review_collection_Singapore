The pasta options are delicious and the soup of the day with the soup set (pumpkin soup) wowed me. The staff at this outlet are really warm and friendly as well, being patient to accomodate our requests with a smile. I love the modern European ambience of the place as well. Overall a great dining experience.",

I repeatedly told them it was for kids.\nI don't mind the waiting time of 20 mins. But after waiting for so long, they still get my order wrong. I found out when I reached home.\nI tried calling the branch phone number for resolution. Forever no one is manning the phone.\nDate & Time: 3rd May 2025 @ 1.08pm",
