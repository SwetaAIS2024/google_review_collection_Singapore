AK,3,"We started barbecue at 2PM. It was cloudy so the weather was not too bad. However, I would recommend to make shelter as this stand will be exposed to sun and it will be quite warm.

The beach was very close to our stand, one thing has to be careful as there are broken glasses on the beach. Better do not go with bare foot.

Our stand was not cleaned beforehand as there was leftover ash - others are cleaned. Not sure it was supposed to be clean or not. Overall still a good place.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106107222401958946413/reviews
rrhhorh,3,"Can be super hot and honestly very very ulu area, unless you drive suggest not to book around here though views are amazing and plane spotters would love the place. Super hard to book grab cause itâ€™s vv into ECP but good and peaceful BBQ pits it u drive, the bbq pits are also a walk away from the nearest carpark and not much shelter around, nearest toilet also abit far from 70 and below pits",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104272352254720420349/reviews
