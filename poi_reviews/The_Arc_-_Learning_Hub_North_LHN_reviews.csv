G Y,5,"Love the architecture of this place! Gives a very modern and stylish feel to the building.

Amin Shah,5,"Nanyang Technological University, Singapore's (NTU Singapore) second learning hub, The Arc.

The 6-storey building has 56 new generation smart classrooms. Each smart classroom is equipped with multiple LED screens, wireless communication tools and flexible clustered seating designed for group discussions.

Incorporating curved structures and spiral stairs, The Arc is designed with innovative and eco-friendly features befitting its place as the newest building on the NTU Smart Campus.

Instead of walls, it comes with an aluminium sunscreen that reduces solar glare and heat. This keeps the rain out while allowing constant ventilation throughout the day.

Its air-conditioning system saves energy by using passive cooling coils to chill the air without the use of fans. These coils work by creating a natural convection cycle, cooling the air as it sinks downwards, which displaces the warm air upwards.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100804699193511996042/reviews
