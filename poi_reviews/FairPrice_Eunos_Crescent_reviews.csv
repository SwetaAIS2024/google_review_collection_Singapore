Jim Oon,1,Stock always a problem. A lot of things usually runs out. Also the beer are so expensive compared to Giant. Festive period no promotion. Believe the GST 2% has already been factored in before official increment. Look at festive discount from Giant. Dare to compare price.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102230749703762023114/reviews

yq FU,1,"Super small shop with only 2 counters for check-out. The cashier is not efficient and hence always long queue.(especially in the afternoon, they will close 1 counter and the queue is so long that it blocks the entrance) The lanes between shelfs are so narrow that can only fit a single adult. Furthermore, because the shop is so damn small, you can't find a lot of things here. Peace.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105212153265776996014/reviews
Jyeo Teow Hee,3,"This faiprice mini supermarket at block 5  Eunos Crescent is a small shop house. Customers must check can products have expire dates before purchase. The Pasar brand 30s eggs per tray display on the outside of the store are not fresh, please check to see if there are expired dates sticker attached on each tray before buying. There are 2 cash counters only but often only 1 counter is open . Exceptionly long queue before 9am and from 5pm to closing.
Elderly customers do not stand 1 metre apart in the single queue line. Often customers jumped queue. Service cashier staff just ignored those customers that do not queue in line.
Be extra careful about their Mailing can luncheon meat, there are no expired dates shown below the can, their small bottles of Maggi tomato ketcup does not show any expire dates also. Sheng Siong supermarket at bedok central, most can food have expired dates.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117955834511396165585/reviews
