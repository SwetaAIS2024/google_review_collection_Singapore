Bel Lee,5,First time had Nicole doing my session for me. I like her bojin skills and eye massage as it is more comprehensive as compared to others. Her strength are abit of the harder side but is just nice for me as i had very bad blockage especially at the eyes area. Really enjoyed her services!,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105463035699267846343/reviews
Esther Lee,5,"This was my second facial with Mandy, and she is such a kind and thoughtful consultant. She remembered my eczema concerns, checked in with me, and was very gentle throughout the process. Her care not only brightened my day but also improved my skin. I look forward to visiting her again soon!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102570790264568543693/reviews
Kitty Tan,1,"Went for my 2nd treatment but failed. I was late for 28mins which is truly my fault. I tried to check with Grace Lim at Kovan, if can help to postpone another customer for 15mins as my session only 45mins so I am requesting so hard and she rejected me bluntly no means no. I say can give a try, if is unable I will accept it, at least she is trying to help me. I have mentally prepared that i will just not be able to  get my treatment, unfortunately telling me staff need ro OT if all delay.i will ok if she tried but failed, eventually was not. I will not believe none customer had never late before.
Other point I would like to feedback, 1hr treatment is not as advertised..surprisingly that was only around 40-45mins. I can flexible to accept their explanation as 15mins more is inclusive removing of make up, somehow feel my time is shorten n cheated,  cannot blame, what u pay for is what u get, luckily is not expensive.
I will feedback again if she trying to postpone my appointment because of other late customer..see how.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108985902654061296930/reviews
G,1,"Unacceptable procedures during underarms SHR Hair removal and whitening sessions. Therapist failed to conduct basic cleaning procedure before application of gel for the treatment (different from the past therapist). Of course have to use own wet wipes prior to the start of treatment to ensure basic hygiene being observed. Therapist also failed to cover my eyes while having the bright lighting on during the treatment. Each session costs more than $250 yet it was a super fast session simply with one type of gel being applied, done in less than 10 mins. Left with a few more sessions of the package and hard selling tactics came again, trying to squeeze customers out of their pockets to the best they can to hit their own sales targets! Such an underhand approach. Donâ€™t ever patronise this salon. Waste of money and unfavourable results despite the expensive package signed on. Biggest regret ever!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100397362873510110026/reviews
