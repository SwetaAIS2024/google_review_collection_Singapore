Olivia LZ,4,"One of the best parks in Singapore—spacious, peaceful, and beautifully designed.
Great for jogging, cycling, or just relaxing by the river. Lots of greenery, birds, and even otters if you’re lucky.
Perfect for families, couples, or solo walks. A true urban escape.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111575454013833516207/reviews
Joyce “Joyful Explorer”,5,"Beautiful park with lots of wildlife if you take time to observe them. Herons, butterflies, dragonflies, monitor lizards... Big park with sand playgrounds, water play. Lots of field for soccer / frisbee play. There are people flying their macaws too. River crossing if the weather permits. The park is separated into two by a major road, and construction work is ongoing. So much have changed over the decade with the transformation from a concrete canal to a naturalized river, a project part of the Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116040496274789301932/reviews
Buren,5,"Some parts of the park are under renovation now, if you are coming here through the bus stop of Block 254, the park is hidden behind the construction hoarding. Walk a bit alongside the traffic to get into the park.

This park is big, and there are many things to do and areas to walk. When we were there, the river is more like a stream with low water debit but I remember it being much fuller on rainy season.

There are many benches to sit on if you are tired. Some with tables, some are located beside the river as platforms, some are longer lounge chairs. This must be a very nice place to come here with a book, a thermos of ice coffee, and a dog! It must be nice to stay nearby if you like outdoor.

The park is bright and clean, didn't get any mosquitoes' bite. There are many entry points connected to bus stops that connect to MRT station.

People are walking with humans and dogs, jogging, tai-chi, read newspaper, contemplating life, or chit chatting. There is a good-sized dog park as well (where dogs can run freely inside the fence. You can get significant jogging distance here.

Overall, I think this is a lovely place.

P.S. It's so glitchy to update pictures/videos here now. Most of them don't show up even after multiple tries. (@%*%",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103975090698079167241/reviews
Kian Yong,5,"Beautiful place to walk around or jog, with great trails. There is even a dedicated park for dogs. You can bring your furry friends to try out the mini obstacle course.

Li Feng,5,"Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park is a fantastic spot for a relaxing day out, offering a serene natural environment with lush greenery and open spaces. A big plus is the free parking available nearby HDB carparks on Sundays and public holidays, making it incredibly convenient for visitors. Whether you’re there for a stroll, a picnic, or to enjoy the scenic surroundings, this park is a great escape from the city’s hustle and bustle. Highly recommended for families and nature lovers!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105807436200681938352/reviews
