KasperxP,3,"è›‹ä½¬ Dan Lao Scrambled Egg Rice

The Chicken Cutlet was crispy and well-marinated with prawn paste, but unfortunately, it lacked fragrance.
The egg mix contained a spoiled egg, which was a letdown. Additionally, the eggs lacked their natural fragrance.
On a positive note, the firm rice was excellent, and it would have paired perfectly with curry - unfortunately, they don't offer it ðŸ˜….
The Staff, however, were very friendly.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114210666729042004471/reviews
Darren,4,"Chicken Cutlet Egg Rice for $7. Chicken cutlet was marinated in prawn paste, which was unexpected and pretty good. Egg had a strong buttery taste but ultimately was just so-so. If I returned, would ask for less sauce as I thought the rice was a little too soggy for my liking. Don't forget the chilli! Pay with the Fairprice app to get 10% off too.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116771157599704611382/reviews
