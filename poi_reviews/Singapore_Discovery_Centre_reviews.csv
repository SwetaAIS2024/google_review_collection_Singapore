Jeremy Ang,5,"I had an amazing time at the Singapore Discovery Centre! It’s honestly one of the most underrated attractions in Singapore. The exhibits are interactive, engaging, and incredibly informative — perfect for both kids and adults. I especially loved the “Through the Lens of Time” gallery, which beautifully showcases Singapore’s journey from past to present.

The XD theatre and escape room were so much fun and added an unexpected thrill to the visit. Plus, the tour guide Javier was friendly and helpful, making the entire experience smooth and enjoyable.

What stood out most to me was how the centre blends education and entertainment so effortlessly. Whether you’re a tourist wanting to learn more about Singapore or a local rediscovering our roots, this place has something for everyone. Can’t recommend it enough!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110249736523922912074/reviews
