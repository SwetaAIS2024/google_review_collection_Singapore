We dun mind that but couldn't sit on the hard chairs for too long.\n\nLove their cocktails! Tried The Wheel and The Sun. They are soooo good!!! Not forgetting the food on the menu!\n\nUnfortunately we did not have the chance to get tarot cards reading experience as we came on Thursday.\n\nExcellent service, outstanding meal, great cocktail selection. I dun mind coming back again~",

Among the cocktails I had i love the queen of cups most.\n\nWe ordered 12 drinks and had 3 tarot reading by Rae. Although is a short reading but we find the reading pretty accurate. Is the first time 3 of us have tarot reading. Tarot reading is not daily so do check out ahead if you want the reading.",

Their main draws are the signature cocktails, purchasing three of which will get you a free tarot reading. Recommend the High Priestess, 3 of cups, ace of cups, and king of wands (last three pictured)\n\nSpecial shout out to Uma the tarot card reader, for being patient with us and making it really fun ðŸ˜‰",
