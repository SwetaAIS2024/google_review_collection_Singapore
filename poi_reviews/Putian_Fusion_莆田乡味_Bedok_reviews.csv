Natalie lim,3,"Passed by Bedok North a little late and since we had not had dinner, we pulled up at some industrial blocks to have something to eat.
Tried the food at Putian Fusion, food was average for the price paid as the quantity was small.
Seller was friendly and the service was relatively fast as it was near closing time and not many customers around.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115016144668800125447/reviews
