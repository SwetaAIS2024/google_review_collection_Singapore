And also their limited drinks was amazing ! Unfortunately we drink without ice added . It will absolutely taste better with ice.",

      "text": "Probably my favorite part of the burger is the bun, it‚Äôs huge, glazed & soft. I only wished it was toasted on the inside.\nThe patties are alright, what I expect smashed burger patties to be. The burger sauce for me is too much which made it more jelak than it needed to be.\n\nThe interior of the shop doesn‚Äôt suit any form of dining in/waiting in line as it‚Äôs just too narrow & humid in there.\nI would recommend ordering and coming back later to the shop to collect rather than linger in there.",

The bun was soft and the pickles and onions fitted perfectly with the salty a d juicy beef. Definitely worth a try and definitely coming back. Also the fries were crispy and salty with a good fries seasoning. The service was amazing and they gave us a free burger since they had some extra beef and ingredients. Definitely coming back and brining my friends hereüçîüçîüçüüçüüëçüëçüëåüëå",

It is more to a standing table kind and the environment is quite hot during the sunny afternoon.\n\nFood - average. The meat patty is doesnt hold well together. Feels like the bun not well toasted.",
