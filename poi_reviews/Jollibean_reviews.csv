Solar,5,"Edit:
They have now since changed staffs and everything has improved.

Wanted to purchase *several times*, however, the shop’s always void of staff. Once I even waited patiently for 15 mins, but she never came. Even on busy weekends… Not sure what’s going on, never had the chance to buy anything 😂

Please change a staff…",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109354680783481024989/reviews
