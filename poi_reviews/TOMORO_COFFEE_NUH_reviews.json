      "text": "Itâ€™s my first time here. I donâ€™t really expect much.\nWhat I had: 1. A set of Americano & chocolate danish.  Coffee is a little diluted. It was a surprised that the Danish not served on a plate. Need to request.\n2. Muffin and matcha frappe. A lot of ice was used to blend so much so that the frappe remains frozen. Not an ideal sight when my son had to keep sucked it out from the straw.\nWhen we requested the plates & utensils, one of the staff gave a side eye. I donâ€™t think we were asking for the sky & moon here. Just a basic stuff.\nStaff are shouting not communicating with each other. More like a coffee shop environment. If you like quiet, this is not the place.",

The sweetness is covering the fragrance of the hojicha. It is not too hot to drink, but not too cold as well. But overall, it's a good experience.",
