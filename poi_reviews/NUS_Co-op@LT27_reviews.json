      "text": "Terrible service. NEVER buy from this company.\nOrdered a laptop two months ago. No delivery. Emailed THREE times before I got a useless reply telling me there is no stock left. Why am I even allowed to place an order in the first place? Do they not track order amount to stocks? They then suggested that I buy something even more expensive. I emailed back asking when they will restock, if my order will be prioritised in that case, and is it possible to get a refund. Took another three emails to get a reply. The reply chose to only answer one of my questions. This is a terrible company, guys. Just don't buy from it.",

      "text": "Sold me a faulty adapter and did not take it back within the return window because it worked on one of their devices.\nThe staff was very rude and did not want to assist further.\n\nUpdate: I went to the store with the faulty adapter. After trying it on a monitor where the adapter was visibly not working, we tried the other port on my Notebook.\nIt seemed to work. So the rude store worker concluded that it must be a port on my notebook.\nBut it is not, as I tried a lot of different adapters on both of my notebook's Thunderbolt, and every single adapter worked flawlessly every time.\nOnly this adapter: 1. Sometimes fails to provide power pass-through, 2. Delivers a jittery image or 3. Does not work at all\nThe store experience was, again, terrible, rude. They didn't let me finish my sentences and kept pointing to the adapter, trying to get me to say that it works.\nI will not go back there, and I would advise everyone to buy technical devices anywhere else.",
