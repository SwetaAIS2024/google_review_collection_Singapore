Zaki Ramlan,1,"I went to Sunbo Ayam Penyet to buy for my wife. I saw 3 staff eating for their lunch break at 3:55pm. I didnt know there is such thing as lunch break at 3:55pm but i dont mind waiting for them. One of the staff (wearing black) has done her meal and proceed to the stall. When i about to apporached her to order, one of her collegue in red who is still eating shouted at me by saying “WAIT WAIT WAIT!! We are on break!! Then i asked “until wat time”? She answered “half more hr”.. i was shocked that one of her staff has done her meal and still ‘on break’ by sitting playing handphones. So does it mean i need to wait another half n hr to order food despite of finishing their meal?? What kind of service is this? Manager, pls make up ur kind if u want to make business well and dont let staff ruined ur business as u have just open business in the new place. Not only poor quality of food which complained by other customer but worst service by your staff..",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107602071839173221968/reviews
Edwin Chan,1,"As what per previous reviewer says. It’s super dry tough hard. I was wondering if the business owner have tried his own ayam penyet before he sell to others. Worst ayam penyet I have tried. Before that I was with high hopes that it will be nice, displaying of the dish is not bad but food? Absolutely no. Perfectly no.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100679360521358639090/reviews
Evitsu Adam,1,It was the worst mee soto i have ever tasted. Strong fragrant of ginger kills the flavour. The order/payment system was automated and fixed so it will be difficult to custom order your food because it is not in the system to add on something you want. I guess it will be my first and last time here.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111301256583864088985/reviews
Rach Lim,1,"Should have trusted the reviews before ordering. Dont be fooled by the queue! Chicken was dry and hard to bite through, fish tasted bland. One of the WORST kind of grilled chicken i've ever eaten. Service attitude of staff wasn't good and hygiene was bad. What is the point of having people queuing, and a machine with ordering system, yet staff just let the queue form WITHOUT informing those in queue that they can actually order via the machine, only for someone else to 'cut queue' suddenly when they order via the machine just right beside you. Totally Dumb",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111821965453420468585/reviews
