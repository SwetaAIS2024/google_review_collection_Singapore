Shen Clement,5,Lovely CNY event and a big thank you to the teachers and principal for inviting the parents to celebrate together with the children. The activities are well planned which included a wonderful performance by the k2 children! There was even handmade dumplings by the school’s chef who wanted to bless the parents and children this lunar new year. Lots of love all around❤️,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112441091350339408807/reviews
Zhang Ning,1,"Teacher turnover rate is high, younger students get into accidents often due to lack of sufficient staff to closely monitor children.Staff seem to be stretched thin as handling too many students at once. Lack of experienced staff, ratio of new teachers to long-term teachers is high.

School fees are not inexpensive ($1.5k) but they scrooge on manpower and keep taking in new students, cramming them in classrooms. Focused too much on expansion and profits, but current facilities and staff are lacking.

Advice to enroll at your own risk or expect to be brushed off by management when issues arise.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114783851042330448286/reviews
