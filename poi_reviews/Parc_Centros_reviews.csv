Reynante Sevilla,5,"This place is great. Not so big and not so small and has nice amenities for families like swimming pools, event areas and BBQ pits. It's really close to the Punggol Bus Interchange and Waterway Point Mall.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116643328506916697550/reviews

antihunter,4,"[I am writing as a resident of Punggol estate, who stayed here for 11+ over years and my honest opinion in my review when visiting the condos, so that individual can assess the pros and cons before any commitment.]

Common areas and facilities visibly well maintained. Building paint is also visibly weather proof, there is no visual colour deterioration when viewing at a 3 meter distance.

From the carpark to the clubhouse, there is a lift directly to the entrance of clubhouse and its fully sheltered.

The disadvantage of this estate is the very limited facilities for a 618 units condo.

The maintenance fees is slightly less than $300 per month for a 6 strata units (3 bedder compact , or $350 for a 7 strata units (3 bedder premium onward).

The bus interchange is just right next to this estate, and the Punggol MRT is less than 5 minute walk. The cons is this estate is too near to the busiest road, right at the cross junction between Punggol Central and Punggol Place; traffic from all buses exit Punggol Place and most traffic to/from waterway point.

If you are buying 3 bedder unit here, the odd facing for most of their 3 Bedder Compact or 3 Bedder Premium units; either directly facing the road, directly facing HDB, internal facing towards other blocks with no pool view, facing guard house or right beside bin centre... The better ones are internal facing with pool view but with WEST sun.

Overall the pros still outweight the cons, but if you are looking for a quiet unit, there are limited choices in terms of stack and facing.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107409081859681251262/reviews
