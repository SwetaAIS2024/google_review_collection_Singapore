Sathish Kumar J (SK),1,"we‚Äôve been DISRESPECTED by the look.
Not worth it for 100+ Reserved 2 bookings 2 days before. We were told that it is full inside and you can get the table based on the availability. But while entering we saw 3 to 4 tables empty about 1:30 hrs no one occupied . we‚Äôve requested and we were treated so badly not allocating the tables.. we gave our beer as tips for them .. spoiled our mood totally.. **Learn to treat everyone same guys**",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106848837804376235112/reviews

N.F.G,5,"Exceptional Service and Unmatched Professionalism!

I had the pleasure of being served by Shika and I can confidently say that she is one of the most outstanding staff members I‚Äôve ever encountered. From the moment I arrived, she greeted me with a warm smile and an inviting energy that instantly made me feel welcome.

Her professionalism and attentiveness throughout the night were truly commendable. She handled every request with efficiency, ensuring that drinks were served promptly and exactly how they were ordered. Despite the fast-paced and high-energy environment, she remained composed, friendly, and incredibly accommodating. She genuinely seemed to enjoy her work, which made the experience even more enjoyable for customers.

What stood out the most was her ability to connect with guests. She wasn‚Äôt just going through the motions, she engaged in friendly conversations, checked in regularly to see if everything was to my liking, and managed to make every guest feel valued. Her customer service skills are top-tier, and it‚Äôs clear she takes pride in making sure everyone has a great time.

Beyond her excellent service, she also maintained a professional yet fun demeanor, striking the perfect balance between approachability and efficiency. She handled difficult situations with grace, ensuring that everyone was treated with respect while maintaining the club‚Äôs high standards.

Overall, Shika is a true asset to alpha
If you ever visit, I highly recommend looking out for her as you‚Äôll be in great hands. Her dedication, hard work, and positive attitude deserve all the recognition and appreciation. I‚Äôll definitely be back, thanks to her exceptional service!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106849544097775290785/reviews
