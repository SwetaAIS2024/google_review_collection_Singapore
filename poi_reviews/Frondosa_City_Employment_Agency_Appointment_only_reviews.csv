Karen Tan,5,"I hired 2 maids from Frondosa. 1st one for myself & I had problems with her. Edmund go over the extra mile to have a 2 hrs late night face to face counselling with her. The session was helpful for both of us to understand each other & her to understand her duties.

Thereafter I hired another maid for my dad. I was very clear on what I am looking for and described to Edmund. He recommended one that fully matches with my expectation. Had a lot of hiccups with MOM in the process of approving the WP, Edmund did his duty to follow up closely on it, knowing how urgent this is to me. The maid is here now & I am happy that this was what I was looking for. I can have ease at heart knowing that someone I can trust is with my dad when I can't be.

Thanks Edmund for the excellent service provided.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108855836570277335913/reviews
