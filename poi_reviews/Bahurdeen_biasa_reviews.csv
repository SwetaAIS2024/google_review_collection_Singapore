Adrian Chew,5,"Food (5/5): ordered the Sup Kambing ribs (big $10) and roti/ bread ($1). Gravy was spicy and packed with flavour. Mutton was tender but not mushy. Delicious. Perfect meal especially on a rainy day.

Service (3/5): satisfactory.

Atmosphere (5/5): well ventilated and clean hawker centre. Ample seating.

Highly recommended.

Meetal M,5,"The stir fried rice, bee hoon and noodles are consistently great in terms of flavour, vegetable content, and spice level. And you can make special requests too.
