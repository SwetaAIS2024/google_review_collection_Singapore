Jean Ng,5,"I‚Äôve loved their signature passion fruit meringue since my friends bought it for me as a birthday cake many years ago. My parents were not so impressed initially because they had the cake immediately when it was chilled. But the 2nd time when they tried it, they let it cool to almost room temperature and they loved it! The sweetness and tanginess of the fruits came through and strikes a nice balance. The  meringue adds an interesting texture to the cake. I‚Äôm so glad this patisserie has moved here so that I can have their cakes more often ü§ó",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103953031256853182735/reviews
Eric Lai,1,"I had the ""Passion Fruit Meringue (with fruits in the cake)"" that everyone raves about, but honestly, it didn't quite hit the mark for me. I wouldn't recommend it to those who prefer more typical flavors. I think I expected more since it's supposed to be one of the best in SG. The meringue taste was just a bit strange to me.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100746764116211986692/reviews

Han Lee,4,"The Passionfruit meringue has a change in recipe, removing fruits from the midst. Texture is still great just that it lost the crunch of the fruits and makes the cake even sweeter.

Prefer the older version still!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115116918025714974988/reviews
Orrdii Tan,5,"Their passionfruit meringue is definitely one of the better cakes we have tried in recent years.

The lightness in the passionfruit mousse, freshness from the mangoes and strawberries, along with the layers of meringue were a beautiful marriage in every bite ‚ù§Ô∏è

The bakery itself is small and cosy, it‚Äôs pretty much a collection point for cake orders made in advance. Folks there were fast and friendly (there was a queue when we collected our orders).

This is one of the few cakes in Singapore we will probably order again for celebrations. I might even go as far to say that the last time I was this impressed with a cake was the iconic watermelon cake from Black Star Pastry.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112902741558049987606/reviews
