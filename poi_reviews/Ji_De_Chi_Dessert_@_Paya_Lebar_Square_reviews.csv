Peipei Peipei,4,"Huge variety of desserts. Sweetness level is mild, suitable for those who love desserts but not at 100% sugar. Prices are very competitive, I'd say even cheaper that other dessert shops.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101698023158172223112/reviews
Nai Edmund,4,"The good: wide range of selection, with even traditional selection like sesame paste and yam paste. I had sesame paste with tang yuen and it was filled to the brim. Also great that it is not too sweet.

The bad: most likely the dessert is made somewhere else and reheat in the store when you order with microwave. The sesame paste is nice and smooth, but still a little off from childhood traditional taste. It is not bad, just have right expectations.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115825190900629558495/reviews
Ritz Bitz,5,Located on the ground floor of Paya Lebar Square. This shop is easily accessible by passenger traffic from the Paya Lebar MRT or the surrounding malls. The dessert was prepared quickly and tasted good. The shop premises was nothing special but decent enough.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110358387947738376597/reviews

S Ky,1,"The warm desserts are not authentic, it’s full of sugar that the texture changed, hard to stir, i m afraid that not only it’s not nutritious but finishing the whole bowl would be eating junk into the body. We didn’t even eat a quarter of it and we would rather waste the money than eating pure sugar directly into our body. Just avoid this place",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116243565140021729733/reviews
