      "text": "The French vibes and vast Greedy Pasture space are stunning, but that's about where the positives end. We felt like we were in the French countryside, surrounded by lush greenery and a relaxed atmosphere, but the food menu was a major letdown. As vegetarians, we were disappointed to find only one main option - half-roasted chicken - and no veggie alternatives. We ordered a few dishes, but they were more like bite-sized tapas, and the bill was a whopping $137. To add insult to injury, there was a small fly in my gin drink. Not exactly what we expected for that price.\n\nThe table setup was also lacking, with no cushions, table settings, or flowers. And when we brought our dogs, we weren't offered water, which seemed like a basic courtesy. Given La Terrace's association with Michelin stars, we expected a more premium experience. The waiter was friendly, but that's not enough to make up for the shortcomings.\n\nThe ambiance and natural vibes were the only redeeming qualities, but it wasn't enough to justify the price and lack of options. Unless they revamp their menu and service, we'd think twice before returning. #LaTerraceReview #FrenchRestaurant #Dempsey #DisappointingDining",

      "text": "La Terrace is the newest hidden gem tucked just behind Claudine at Dempsey Hill. Think of it as Claudine’s more casual sibling: same warm hospitality, but with an easygoing, come-as-you-are kind of charm. It’s the sort of place where good food, drinks, and conversation flow effortlessly.\n\nThe vibe here? French home-style cooking, made to share. Chef Julien Royer’s vision for La Terrace is simple — great food, relaxed vibes, and a spot you’ll want to visit again, not just for special occasions.\n\nLocation: La Terrace at Claudine, 39C Harding Road, Singapore 249541",

      "text": "This glasshouse restaurant theme is cosy and the staffs were all really friendly and welcoming it felt as if we were stepping into someone’s house for a meal. The scallop crudo was a hit and miss as I personally feel the scallop was a little fishy for my liking but the sauce makes up for it and went perfectly well with the hot appetizer of chorizo cake which we got.\n\nThe star of the night was definitely the half roasted chicken. It’s the only main dish La Terrace offered but they done it so well. The chicken was tender and rice was super flavourful, they also topped the rice with crispy chicken skin so there’s crunch in every bite. What a stellar dish.\n\nEnded the meal with freshly baked madelines and profiterole. We were there for a birthday celebration and the staff were so nice to print out a photo for our keepsake. It was a great meal and would return again next time!",
