      "text": "Located at basement level @ Century Square. Convenient grocery shopping at your fingertips! Shop at Singapore's largest grocery retailer with a wide range of products, price match online and in-store. Finest stores will offer a wider variety of rice from more exclusive or premium brands, which can sometimes give the inaccurate impression that products are more expensive.\n\nThey even have ready-to-eat meal and avaialable seat for us to enjoy the meal. Drink available at the counter. Highly recommended!",

Plastic takeaway containers is a bummer.\n\nMiso Soup was nice. Salad and rice was normal.\n\nLychee Martini was good tasting @ $12.00 | 8.5 out of 10.\nLong Island Tea was strong. Very good @ $15.00 | 9 out of 10.\nPeach Blossom a wee bit disappointing. @ $15.00 | 8 out of 10.\n\nHad a big issue with Peach Blossom pricing as the menu clearly stated $12.00 but the bar tender told me it cost $15.00.\n\nNTUC should check out their menu versus register pricing. Not sure how true but this is not a good experience for consumers if the prices differ by 25%.\n\nDropping my review to 1-Star because of pricing disparity which cannot be verified.",
