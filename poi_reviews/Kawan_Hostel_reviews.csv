Muhammad Zia ul haq,3,"I stayed at this hostel in Little India, Singapore, during my trip in March 2024. While the location was fantastic—convenient and close to many attractions in the area—the experience overall was just okay.

The biggest downside was the price. It felt quite expensive for what was offered, especially considering the size of the rooms. They were small and a bit cramped, which made it feel less comfortable than I had hoped. However, the hostel was clean and had the basic amenities you need for a short stay.

The location, though, was definitely a big plus. Little India is vibrant and full of culture, with plenty of food options and things to explore nearby. Overall, I'd rate the hostel as 3 stars—decent for a short, budget stay, but not quite worth the high price tag. If you're looking for something affordable and central, this could work, but don't expect luxury.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113039759348470221069/reviews
Rabindra N Das,4,"This is a good hostel for budget travelers and backpacker with private bathroom. Rooms are not so big but the location is good near the city center, restaurant, bar, sightseeing and public transport. They provide complementary breakfast and free Singapore SIM card with Wi-Fi. Staffs are professional and helpful. Kitchen facility with bread toaster, micro-oven, instant tea & coffee makers facility was good. Complementary breakfast with bread, butter and tea or coffee.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112404606864959780142/reviews
Krizia Capanzana,5,Nice and affordable place to stay. Rochor MRT is only around 200m away and walking distance from Bugis. The staff are very nice and wifi signal is good. Just don't expect it to have top notch facilities/equipments since this is a hostel.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109277478792070042333/reviews
Shiv Shankar Gaurrav,1,"Located in front of a Mosque in Dunlop street. Cheap stay but can cost u health issues too. Toilets aren't upto the cleanliness standard as required by Singapore authorities. Rooms are shabby,no secure atomsphere,no records of guest moving & out, cockroaches could be seen on the beds & floors. Only Reception looks attractive.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102345917883409628957/reviews
Lenz Senining,4,"We were in Singapore recently,  we stayed here in Kawan Hostel . the place is okay. for backpackers or even for family who wants to travel for a short period of time. Its near MRT and to each of the tourist spot in Singapore. Its very accessible and its cheap. The one who assisted us named Mikey was a Filipina shes so kind :) The restroom is nice, no issues with the shower and the toilet.  Just don't expect for the free breakfast they offer, because its only bread, not the typical breakfast :)
I would recommend this hostel for sure. Thanks !",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116090985099217264115/reviews
