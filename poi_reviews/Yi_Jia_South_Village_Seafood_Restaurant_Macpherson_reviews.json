They still have their crab promo starting from 2 crab for $48.\nAnother must order dish is Manila Clams. It is big and juicy paired with vermicelli, which was on spot.\nThe place tends to get crowded and noisy at times. But who cares the food were good and staff was helpful & nice.",

      "text": "Attracted by their crab promotion (2 crabs for $45 and the next 2 for $35) displayed on a poster outside their restaurant, we made a booking with the intention of getting 4 crabs at the promotional price. After sitting down and eating the standard appetizer, it took a while to wave down a waiter to take our order, only to be told that there was no promotion despite the prominent poster at the entrance. Feeling cheated, we proceeded to order 2 chili crabs (2 for $58), a vegetable dish, and tofu. Fortunately, the food was very good, and the crabs were quite meaty. Unfortunately, there were three tables with people having company dinners, and some highly intoxicated individuals were shouting and making a lot of noise, which made the environment feel like a fish market. The service could be improved, but since there is no service charge (though there is GST), I won't complain too much about it. Overall, go there for the good food and try to overlook the shortcomings for a good meal.",

We ordered curry fish head, scallops with brocolli and the chilli crab. They were having  promotions, 2 for $48, of course don't expect huge crabs. But the crabs were fresh thou! Order the friend mantou to dip with the chilli sauce, so yummy! My friends fell in love with the curry fish head as the gravy was so delicious. Will definitely come back again to try the other dishes!",
