Mmixx S,4,"Took over the OG department store during early 2024, it is a food-centric mall with the supermarket as its core business and it is situated near Somerset MRT as well.

In theory, everything will fall into place given its prime assets.
In practice, it may need to reconsider a lot of things.

The current layout remains unchanged from the previous tenant and it still feels like a department store instead of a supermarket, with restaurants and eateries at the building corners. Due to the layout, it doesn't effectively entice shoppers to buy items and may just window shop instead.

As for the supermarket, there are a lot empty shelves and self-checkout counters are still non-functional as of now. Currently, it feels like an unfinished project, even if it is suppsoedly fully opened for quite some time.

Overall, nothing really bad in terms of shopping  experience. But, it may need to reconsider its business operations if they want to do this long-term.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110083552662312739533/reviews
Michelle Tan,5,"This is a 3-storey supermarket located at Taste Orchard (former OG orchard point). Right beside Centrepoint and Orchard Plaza. Lots of interesting and unique international products that I don’t really see often. There’s also a live seafood area and you can order meals from their counter. Definitely worth visiting. Nice and spacious aisles, so its more relaxing in a way compared to other supermarkets.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116756829043956661781/reviews
Ba Banana,4,"Specious 3 storey grocery store.
Fresh live seafood to aged beef to suitcases to killiney kopitiam.

Still needs to promote better and fill some empty shelves and spaces.
Hope they do better in future.

Excellent location.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100993474974008065411/reviews
Dru Lu,4,Finally opened! After a very Ling delay. They just have the basics put in for now with the rest of the building coming in slowly. It’ll be nice to have even more dinning options in the area in the future. Also looking forward to what that kids play area will look like.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115927493800245457440/reviews
Gary Chia,5,"Came here on a Monday evening and had an amazing experience. Great place to sit and relax after a long day of walking around the usual Orchard Road landmarks. Affordable food and variety available here - think prices and experience similar to the overhyped Fairprice at Clarke Quay.

Would absolutely come back again. Currently a very underrated spot given the newness of this mall but definitely a lot of potential to be had. Orchard lacks a supermarket at heartland prices and this fills the gap 101%.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102761307838010106144/reviews
