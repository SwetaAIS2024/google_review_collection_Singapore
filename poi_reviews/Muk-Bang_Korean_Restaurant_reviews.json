Service was good, restaurant and tablewares were clean as well. The soy garlic chicken (not captured) impressed us though, how well done it is.",

Restaurant was not super crowded which makes it a great place to dine and catch up with friends (suitable for big groups, and baby chair available)!\nFood was tasty and satisfying. Our favorite got to be the bibimbap and fried chicken wings!",
