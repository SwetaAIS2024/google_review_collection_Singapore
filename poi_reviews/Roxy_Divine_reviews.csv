L Y,5,"Despite being an Eastie, I did not know the existence of this cafe until a friend brought me here. This, is a hidden gem.

They serve awesome salads here, alongside with sandwiches. There's a wide variety of cakes you can choose, and when pairing with coffee, the coffee is discounted.

Since discovering this place, I have been a repeat visitor.....making a beeline for the salads!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116804450051508415316/reviews
