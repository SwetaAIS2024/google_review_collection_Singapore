Esther yxy,5,I studied under the mathematics teacher a few years ago. She was  always very patient and understanding. She was great at breaking down complex formulas into simple concepts when explaining to her students how to solve complicated questions and always kept her lessons fun and enjoyable as well as affordable. I would recommend any student to study under her tutelage.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116511908087268307937/reviews
