Vic W,5,Had a good experience here. Ordered the ribeye steak medium with wedges and mash potatoes. The steak was slightly more than medium done but ok. The wedges and mash potatoes were tasty. Price $16.50 was reasonable. Coffee shop setting. Can recommend. üëç,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106487492087285392743/reviews
