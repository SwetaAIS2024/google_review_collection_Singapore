Tatsu Donburi,4,"System was well adjusted and drinks are cheap. But one thing the owner also like to sing ownself, so took up three songs on her own while we waited for total 6 songs. 2 person 1 table only entitled to 1 song regardless of spending. Thus 4 stars otherwise would be 5 stars",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101821954662673238652/reviews
Rose,5,"Oldies KTV Pub was a great experience! The atmosphere was fun and laidback, the staff was friendly and accommodating, and I love the selection of drinks & finger food. You may check it out to find out more. The space was perfect for a large/small group gathering and plenty of tables and seating. A great night out for anyone looking for a fun time to have the feel of family bonds. Highly recommend! ðŸ˜˜",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113650426290443984336/reviews
