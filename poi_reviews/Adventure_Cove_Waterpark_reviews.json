Pretty different from the US. I‚Äôm attaching pictures of the cost of food - prices -, as no one else has done that. Also, no one checked our bags so you can bring food in even if they say not to. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",

      "text": "This is a wonderful park!  The lazy river takes you to all the attractions and it goes through the Ray Bay where the rays come up to the glass and try to splash over the glass wall haha it‚Äôs cute.  There‚Äôs a dolphin experience and you have options of interacting with them.  There are plenty of lockers and full body blow dry machines.  The restaurant is very nice with some veggie options.  There are some beer and cocktails.  My favorite was the Rainbow Reef and the Riptide Rocket water slide.  Not too scary just a quick thrill.  You won‚Äôt be disappointed if you come here.  It‚Äôs clean and not too many pesky birds.",

Do buy your own waterproof phone pouches BEFORE going..else it retails for $40/45 in the souvenir shop. Wish there were water dispensers around thou.\nFood and drinks are pretty pricey( mains cost around 15 and up, drinks cost $4 and up. The walk from rws was a pretty short one( within 5mins instead of 13 indicated by goggle map).",
