Erick Wijaya,4,"Before entering the casino:
- Entry is free for foreigners. Make sure to bring a passport or visa.
- Bring some cash. There're ATMs right outside but you'll need to queue.
- Do not bring big bag/luggage. Small/fanny bags are ok.
- People are allowed to smoke in first floor. If you're not a smoker, consider to bring a mask.

Inside the casino:
- Free drinks
- It's ok to take photos but just don't do it directly in front of staffs.
- Slots have cheap min bet
- Roulettes have min $5 for inside bets and $25 for outside bets
- 3/2 Blackjack has $75 min bet. Dealer S17 and surrender is allowed with exception of dealer ace.

A B C Traveller,4,"Good casino experience for me. Quite an interesting place to spend money for entertainment (without having a goal to win money). I arrived at 11 AM and the place is already very crowded. The security check at entrance was strict, the Indian staff at the front was  not friendly. She tried to rush people in the line to show e-visa or everyone must go back to the line and queue up, as if she has KPI for head counts through turnstile. Once I walked in, I smelled the indoor smoking, pretty annoying for a non smoker like me. I went to exchange for chips. It is $25 each. I tried my luck at roulette tables and the dice game. There are free drinks counters at every corner. The second floor has electronic roulette machines too. Nothing much for non gambling tourists like me. Spent $200 in 2 hours. OK",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116585614877993483182/reviews
Florence Leow,5,"üü¶ The Marina Bay Sands Casino has four levels of gaming floor-space, over 500 table games and up to 3,000 electronic gaming machines to choose from.

üüßThe MBS Casino was officially opened in 2010.  ‚¨õÔ∏è Singapore citizens have to pay SGD150 as entry fee per person, whereas tourists gets to enter the casino for free ( ‚úîÔ∏èupon strict checks of their passports etc).

üü© My photos were taken over a period of several years. üî∑Ô∏è The facade & exterior of the casino were taken by myself.

üü® The interior photos of the casino were taken by my hubby's cousin who came from London, England (üü¶ the cousin is a UK citizen and so he could enter the MBS Casino for free).‚úÖÔ∏è He took a few pics for me to view:)",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews
Globetrotter,4,"The Marina Bay Sands Casino is a massive venue with a wide range of gaming options, from slot machines to table games like blackjack and roulette. However, the overall experience was somewhat disappointing. The staff often appeared bored and irritated, which detracted from the atmosphere.

Additionally, smoking is allowed inside the casino, which may be unpleasant for non-smokers. While it‚Äôs an impressive destination for avid casino players, it‚Äôs not a place I would visit again. That said, for gaming enthusiasts, it might still be worth experiencing.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113564340809663006121/reviews
Kaii,2,"Indoor smoking is pretty disgusting. You can smell smoke everywhere. It's all smoking area - people smoke everywhere. Lung cancer paradise.
So much hassle getting in and out of the casino. Have to register for the e-pass and go through multiple checks. Very slow and rude security staff.
Not enough clear instructions for tourists.
Not enough staff at the rewards counter. Slow and inefficient staff.
Free non-alcoholic drinks available.
Plenty of table games. Limited variety of machines.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101303779286680604048/reviews
