Their Red Grouper was a little bit fishy but I had to give them the benefit of doubt as they were slammed on a Friday night.\nThe other Zi Char dishes that Iâ€™ve ordered tasted exceptional despite the hectic crowd ðŸ’¯ Be prepared to wait 1 hour plus during dinner.\n\nWill definitely return and try their grouper again!",

      "text": "Quite an interesting place, interesting concept. I like it they have big ceiling fans which makes the interior pretty cooling as well, and probably it helps in the ventilation where the smell and smoke from the mookata doesn't really stick on poeple's clothes.\nThere were a few stalls opened by I ordered everything from the SG Umami stall. The prawn noodles was good, loved the soup and the thin noodles. Prawn wasn't very fresh it was kinda powdery when peeling off the shell. The fries went well with the sauce, the meitaiko tamago was good but size not satisfactory (but it's cheap). The lala was okay but the soup was overly salty. Thought the SG Umami signature pizza was recommended but then I enjoyed the thin crust but I didn't know what's on the pizza. There wasn't much flavours and isn't memorable.\nWhat's most memorable was the price. Ordered so much and it was just $41. I was expecting to pay more and the portion was satisfying for the entire meal. Almost tried like everything from that stall which was featured in articles.",
