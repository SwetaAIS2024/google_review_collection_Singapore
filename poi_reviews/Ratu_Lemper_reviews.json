They are famous for their lemper which is the glutinous rice filled with fillings wrapped in banana leaf.\n\nSadly they are located a bit far from the tourist spots so I'm unsure how long would they last as it was quite quiet the 2 times I visited them.\n\nTheir chempedak kek lapis was very expensive though and probably not worth the price tag...",

      "text": "I ordered their kueh thru WhatsApp and send a grab pickup to take my food from their booth at Causeway point. When the grab guy arrive at their booth the 1st thing they told him was there is no order under my name which makes me worried. Then I tried texting or calling thru their WhatsApp but nobody pickup or respond immediately. After awhile my guy called again and say they found my order. I was really worried because I was not at the booth to check it personally and there was no help thru the WhatsApp too. The kueh is nice, all my friends and family enjoy it especially the creamy kawsi pandan. But the other kueh kueh was not cut nicely and I have to slice it thru again so is easier to pick up.",
