I’m standing here because there’s a person in front of me and I don’t want cut her que and this is exactly what happened when I went pass, the person didn’t like it. While paying I noticed the beef rendang instead and told the cashier, he asked the guy who scooped the dishes and  he wasn’t happy and started complaining and accusing me, insisting that I was the one that said beef but I very clearly said I wanted chicken rendang not beef, he then said next time say more clearly in an angry tone. Your staff are rude and really unpleasant. Worst of all, the chicken rendang was not cooked properly and was raw, a real health hazard.",
