I loved the wide variety of ingredients, from fresh meats and seafood to vegetables. The marinated meats were especially flavourful, and the dipping sauces added the perfect kick to every bite.\n\nThe service here is excellent—the staff is friendly, attentive, and always ready to assist. At just $14.90 for a protein buffet with generous portions and a great selection, it's definitely great value for money.\n\nWhether you're a Mookata fan or trying it for the first time, this is a place worth visiting. Highly recommended!",

Though cheap, quality is not compromised!\n\nWe were quite impressed by the variety of choices and the marination of meats here! There are quite a lot to select from but one of our favourites is the Mala and Tom Yum chicken! Tender, delicious and spicy! If you prefer, top up an additional $5 to enjoy free flow seafood too!! Totally value for money!",
