Pak Soon Lau,3,Nice decorations. Quite a good mix of interesting food stalls but the food served by two of the stalls we patronised was disappointing. Not worth our visit.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107524637554500568527/reviews
Foo Rina 詩苑,5,Nice Thai and Vietnam cuisine. The beef stew is a bit spicy with soft beef and it matches well with their French loaf. Spring roll is savory. Mango sticky rice taste good and the grill pork stick is grill just nice.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100079340298381598735/reviews
Peter Loo,5,"#eatingplaces A niche foodcourt with authentic #Vietnamese #Vietnam food at foodcourt prices.
For those living in #Tampines and enjoy Vietnamese pho, spring roll, bread roll etc, will definitely find the Vietnamese stall in this foodcourt very welcoming.
Taste of Vietnam with prices lower than #SoPho in the mall, and served by Vietnamese (not other ethnic groups).

Besides this niche Vietnamese stall, there are also other #food stalls to satisfy your families’ cravings.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109414658093181769440/reviews
