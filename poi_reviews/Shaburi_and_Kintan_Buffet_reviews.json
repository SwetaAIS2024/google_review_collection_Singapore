      "text": "We tried the Shaburi option and upgraded to the premium beef ‚Äî not surprisingly , the ‚Äútasty beef‚Äù didn‚Äôt quite live up to its name. Texture and flavour were lacking. The condiments were okay, nothing particularly memorable. The buffet spread was average, maybe slightly below expectations in terms of variety and quality.\n\nOn the upside, ordering is done via QR code and food is served quickly. Service was fast, efficient, and clear ‚Äî staff were attentive and prompt throughout. For the price we paid, it‚Äôs still a reasonable option, especially if you‚Äôre after a no-fuss, quick hotpot experience.",

Today I come at lunch which costs only $35.80++ for 90 minutes hotpot buffet, plus free-flow fresh oyster & crab.\n\nI had above 50 oyster, crab, shabu beef+pork+chicken, curry, mac n cheese, gyudon, chawanmushi, karaage, desert, milk tea and white chocolate fountain. For me, that was a solid $0.72++ per oyster only. The best deal in town I've known for this fresh juicy oyster! I forgot to take photo for other dishes, as very busy with those oyster. Overall it's only less than $43 nett per pax~~ Thank you for making my weekend dayü•∞ The staffs are kind and helpful. They also refilled soup and oyster regularly.",
