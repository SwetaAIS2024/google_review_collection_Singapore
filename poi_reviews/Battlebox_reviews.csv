Martin Roberts,5,"An interesting piece of WW2 history in the Battle for Singapore and it's surrender by British forces to the Imperial Japanese Army.  Entry is free of charge but do book your entry day and time in advance online. 'Enhanced' tour tickets with an audio guide are also available for a fee. I did the basic free entry and it was fine. A tour, if you are reading the information boards, takes about 40 minutes. It opens at 10am. Located in Fort Canning Park you can enjoy a walk in the park also before or after your Battlebox visit.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104132506169810702389/reviews

Soph Meldrum,5,"Great WW2 interactive bunker experience. Similar to the Churchill bunker museum in London!!

Really interesting museum with lots of information and well presented. Entry is free or you can pay $20 for the audio guide (do this if you aren't up for reading the plaques of info). Air conditioned inside too!!

Definitely worth a visit. Book online ahead as it sells out really fast.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117924896172752237354/reviews
Miles Macdonald,3,"I think this is a really excellent place and, under other circumstances, would have given it five stars. But the reason I give three is when I went to the ""visitor centre"", I was only informed about the enhanced experience entry, and not that you could enter for free. I have subsequently found out that you can visit for free. It was useful having the audio guide, and it did enhance the experience, but I could have managed by just reading the information boards. It costs $20 for the enhanced experience, which also includes two additional rooms. Whilst I appreciate what they tried to do in one of the enhanced rooms, using different coloured spectacles blue/red to see things from the English or Japanese viewpoints, I think it's a little bit of a gimmick.
I'm a pensioner, so $20 is quite a bit for me. I would recommend just visiting this place for free without the enhanced experience. You would still learn a lot about the final days of conflict between the Japanese & British forces and the ultimate surrender of the British.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112943810663501022344/reviews
