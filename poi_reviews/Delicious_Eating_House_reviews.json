I‚Äôve been her customer for more than ten years and it‚Äôs because they are well marinated and never bland like other stalls. I‚Äôd also recommend their white Bee Hoon as it has a bit of Chilli in it and thus more flavourful than the black version.",

      "text": "Very nice spot.  Very inexpensive and a real old school eating house feel, in a nondescript suburban neighborhood.  There is a stall inside with pre cooked foods but I ate from the kitchen of the Delicious Eating House itself.  Thai style crispy chicken was awesome; light, sweet, flavorful, fragrant and it had a delightfully lingering spicy heat that crept up on you after a time.  Kangkong in spicy sambal and green beans with dried prawn crumbles were winners.  Die die must try.",
