      "text": "What can I say? I'm most definitely a fan. Love that you can buy sashimi and onigiri from the store and bring it out to have together with good highballs. I frequent this Orchard Central (OC) outlet - think of it as the \"fastfood\" of jap food and drinks. I typically go for a standard Suntory highball at $8 happy hr price. I've been to the PLQ and Suntec bars but the drinks are just not the same. Definitely recommend this OC space",

The seating is quite limited but can make reservations. Aunties that work here are nice and arenâ€™t judgey of how many drinks you had ;)",

Pretty weak. But yea, cos I ordered it mixed with soda, probably why. You can eat your Donki meals here, provided you order a drink per pax. Weekends a lil hard to get a seat here so recommended to go early, plus take advantage of the Happy Hour discount. Will definitely come here for a drink and meal again. Nice place to chill.",
