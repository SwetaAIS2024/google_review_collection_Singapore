kim c,5,"Authentic and affordable Korean food by a Korean family. Second time here and glad to say that it didn’t disappoint! The churros corn dog is a novelty, beef soup a lil bland at first but adding salt makes it one of the best out there. Rice with seaweed is good too, bulgogi is well marinated. Overall good place to drink and eat, generous side dishes as well, will be back when I’m here again!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109923728999275399625/reviews
Jun Han,5,"We accidentally came into this restaurant as the Japanese restaurant was closed.

I was very grateful that I had the opportunity to visit here.

1. All the food are well prepared.
Great taste.

The Kimchi is THE BEST I’ve tried jn JB!
The taste is totally different from any others I’ve tasted in Malaysia.

Chicken meat is super tender and juicy.

2. More than 80% of customer at my time of visit were Korean.
So you would know how similar it’s like to their taste bud.

This is definitely one of the restaurant that I will visit again!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102432652806403809273/reviews
Noel tiersan,5,"Value for money and authentic korean food! (Verified by koreans)

A-tier bean sprout soup, flavourful enough to balance the rest of the food. Fried chicken and cheese egg roll portion is bigger than expected (us being 2 pax but the portions are good enough and cheap for 4 pax)

However do note its a new restaurant starting out (just a chef and server) so waiting time could be dependent on the amount of people that just came in. And they are only cash only.

Was almost full house with actual Koreans was quite surprising! (Us being the only exceptions)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111388538248923914554/reviews
