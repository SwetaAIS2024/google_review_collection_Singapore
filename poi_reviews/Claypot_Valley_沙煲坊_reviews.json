      "text": "This local Zhichar outlet is a fantastic find, especially if you’re after bold, authentic Malaysian flavors! The standout dish here has to be the claypot rice—it’s simply exceptional. The rice has that perfect smoky aroma, and the ingredients are generously portioned, giving each bite a burst of flavor. The claypot lala is another winner, fresh and brimming with a rich, garlicky sauce. Their Iberico pork with mocha sauce is a unique treat, with a surprisingly good balance of flavors. The combination of classic and creative dishes, along with the unmistakably Malaysian taste, makes this a must-visit for anyone craving true comfort food.",
