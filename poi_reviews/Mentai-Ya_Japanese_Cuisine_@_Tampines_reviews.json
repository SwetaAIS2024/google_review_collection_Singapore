      "text": "*edit - menu updated. $9.80 salmon mentai don\n\nOrdered the spicy salmon mentai don. A tad too spicy for me. But the taste was good. A little too plain for $8.80. Will be good if it comes with some seaweed or pickled ginger (like how they serve in Japan). There isit much “char” taste although they torched the mentaiko Mayo sauce on top of the salmon. There’s some teriyaki sauce drizzled on the white jasmine rice. (Year 2022)",

Although you can tell it's mostly just mayo, But for the venue and price can't complain too much.\n\nThe super unfortunate part is the sauce they put on the rice! It honestly spoils the dish, and I have no idea where they're getting it from or if the person making it made a massive mistake.",
