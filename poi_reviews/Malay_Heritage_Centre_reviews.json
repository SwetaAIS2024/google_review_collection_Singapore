Sit at the big courtyard or around the herbs and spice garden and feel the breeze blowing along your face. And when u look up , u will see the mixture of sky scrappers along side the rich traditional architecture around. A little imagination through times century back and now. Walk around outside the area to enjoy the many food establishments and arts cum souvenirs shops to bring back home.",

It also tells of the olden days ethnic Malays who were here first way before Raffles came. But when going to the first level you feel that too much was focused on the entertainment industry. Lacking in contribution to successful Malays especially on academics, science and such.",
