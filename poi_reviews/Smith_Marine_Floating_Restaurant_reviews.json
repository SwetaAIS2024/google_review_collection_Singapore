      "text": "I had the pleasure of dining at Smith Marine Floating Restaurant, and I must say it exceeded all my expectations! From the moment I arrived, the ambiance was nothing short of breathtaking. Set on a beautiful floating platform, the views of the water and surrounding nature are simply stunning. It felt like a tranquil escape from the everyday hustle and bustle.\n\nThe service was exceptional. The staff were welcoming, attentive, and made us feel right at home. They took the time to explain the menu and made great recommendations. The food itself was absolutely delicious. The seafood was incredibly fresh, and every dish was packed with flavor. I highly recommend trying the grilled lobster—it was perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. The menu offers a variety of options, catering to different tastes, and the portions are generous.\n\nWhat really stood out to me, though, was the overall experience. Dining on the water, with the gentle sway of the restaurant, created a truly unique and memorable atmosphere. It's the perfect place for a romantic dinner, a special celebration, or even a casual outing with friends.\n\nIf you're looking for great food, amazing service, and a one-of-a-kind dining experience, Smith Marine Floating Restaurant is a must-visit. I can't wait to return!",

      "text": "Awesome experience in this restaurant! We bought our experience through klook, quite fuss free as you’d message the restaurant to check availability & organise. Dinner timing is a little early (we arrived 3.45pm, apparently ferry is 4.30, but the bum boaters were nice to take us to the restaurant early). Happy to be back to mainland before sunset.\n\nUpon arrival at Changi ferry terminal, bum boat will take you to restaurant. Workers at the restaurant are absolutely amazing- we added an extra fish for $48 (reasonable price). Apparently they also do take aways where they freshly catch their farmed fish, descaled & vacuum at $20.\n\nThe drinks & add ons are inevitably slightly pricy than mainland but you’re truly paying for a different dine in experience.",
