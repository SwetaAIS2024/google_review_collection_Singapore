Momo Kris,5,"Our girl was in the infant class for over a year, and we’re really glad to have had her in the safe and caring hands of the teachers. They have been so patient and nurturing, and it’s clear how much she enjoys going to school every day. A big thank you to the teachers for their dedication and warmth—we truly appreciate all that you do!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110381498226533063175/reviews
