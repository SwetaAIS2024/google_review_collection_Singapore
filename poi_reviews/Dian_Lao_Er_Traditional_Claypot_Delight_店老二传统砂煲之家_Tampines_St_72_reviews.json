Just an neighbourhood claypot place to satisfy your hunger but not cravings.\nThe spinach is bitter and meatball has frozen meat taste.\n\nI really wouldnt visit again.",

      "text": "Been here a few times. Delicious claypot rice around the neighborhood coffeeshop. Chicken cubes served are very tender and flavourful.\nHowever, I felt the consistency of the food can be better (e.g the amount of dark sauce added sometimes was too much that it spoils the taste of the entire claypot chicken rice)\nI would recommend the braised pig's trotter and ofc the claypot chicken rice if you are here!\nService and pricing wise is okay, definitely will come back if I'm craving for some claypot!\n\nOverall 4/5",
