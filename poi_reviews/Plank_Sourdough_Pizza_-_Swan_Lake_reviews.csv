Brenda Hsiung,2,"I’ve been eating at Plank for the past 3-4 years and I always come back for their Mushroom Pasta and Aglio Olio. They recently changed their pasta to sourdough pasta and changed the pasta menu.

The new sourdough pasta is so hard and doughy in texture. The new Mushroom pasta was under seasoned and so dry - it isn’t creamy anymore. The Seafood pasta is alright but it’s nothing spectacular.

Very disappointed and sad to lose a regular spot.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117439159742916239885/reviews
hsoj,2,"Pizza was really average, maybe slightly below. Or maybe I just got back from Italy.

However the sweet pizza, (walnut and fig one was good)

For the price, not really worth it IMO. Go to now pizza at Funan instead for Neapolitan style pizza

However service was great. All friendly staff

Definitely a nostalgic place for my family",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104351689291758897651/reviews
Mildred C,5,"Great pizza and ambience.  They served good coffee and have good selections of mains and desserts!

The cafe is located in a quiet residential neighborhood while parking can be challenging at times.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117032478338065471499/reviews

Carbon Malibu,3,"I had high hopes for this place, associated as it is with Baker & Cook, who make some fairly decent bread. But it was disappointing. The service was really bad. The young waitress with the light-coloured hair sat us at a table then wandered off. It would have been helpful if she'd bothered to let us know that diners are required to place their orders at the till instead of through the waitress, but she didn't, and she instead stared into space looking bored, fiddling with her phone and not making eye contact with anyone.

We placed our order at the counter but the card machine wasn't working so we had to pay cash.

The pizza turned up and was plonked on our table by the aforementioned waitress who then walked off without uttering a single word! It looked good but it was undercooked and we had to cut it into slices ourselves. The kitchen staff and wait staff don't do this for you as they would in literally every other restaurant. The crust and underside of the pizza were chewy. This is not how good pizza should be! It's a shame because the cheese and the topping were decent.

The final insult when I glanced at our bill was that they added a service charge! FOR WHAT?! We had to walk to the counter to place our order, we had to slice the pizza ourselves, and the waitress was sullen and disengaged! What level of service were we charged for?! It is really quite naughty of the restaurant to add a service charge when they don't actually deliver any service whatsoever.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100614471212636073773/reviews
