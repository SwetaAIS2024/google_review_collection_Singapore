Aur√©lie B,5,"Their salmon pot pie is delicious with lots of salmon bites. Their salted caramel French toast and French hot chocolate are also amazing! Their dark chocolate creme brulee is really good, very thick, I enjoyed every bite. Try them all, you will not be disappointed! I have found their tiramisu just OK. All dishes are very good value for money. Staff is super nice and friendly. I will come back for sure!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103676378224869889358/reviews
Javier Tan,5,"I had a really enjoyable experience at Poulet. The food was excellent‚Äîflavorful, fresh, and clearly made with care. I especially loved the chicken, which was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the brussel sprouts were a standout‚Äîcrispy, well-roasted, and packed with flavor.

Portion sizes were generous, making the meal feel like great value. The service was friendly and efficient, and the overall vibe of the place was warm and welcoming.

Highly recommend if you're looking for a satisfying, well-prepared meal. I‚Äôll definitely be back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106617631020704357051/reviews
Falsefast,4,"Ordered their Signature Roast Chicken and Braised Beef Cassoulet (3pcs of beef oxtail), and truly enjoyed it. The portion was just right, and really loved how tender the oxtail was. Had only wished that our table was not assigned so close to the other tables, which made us feel so awkward and uncomfortable throughout our time here. They were plenty of empty seats available at the back, and we don‚Äôt understand why it was not assigned to us since the restaurant was not that crowded.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107614224395170529226/reviews
HC L,3,"Tried the lunch set which allows you to choose a starter, main course and drink. I chose the French onion soup, miso clam carbonara and ice lemon tea.
French onion soup was well done but the carbonara was overly salty because of the miso. I asked for some chilli to cut the cloyness of the creamy sauce but they only have chilli flakes available. And tobasco which is not really spicy. Suggestion to the waitress that they make some red cut chilli available. After all, some pure Italian joints do provide them. Another complain: I bit into a few broken shells from the clam. It was really irritating and could be dangerous.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105381120259821237733/reviews
Danica,3,Nice place and nice 3-course promo! 2nd time eating here. Roasted brussel sprouts & broccoli was a bit bitter/burnt(to my taste at least) but everything else was good! Service was great üëçüëçüëç,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103793824679441898099/reviews
