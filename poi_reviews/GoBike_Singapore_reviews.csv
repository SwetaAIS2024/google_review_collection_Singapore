Ron Zurinskas,5,"We had a last minute change of destination and all he said was I can make that work.   The bikes were more than trail worthy on the dairy farm trails.   This was a super fun bike excursion that allowed us to see a different side of SG and connect with fellow cyclists.   Great drop off service and solid equipment, highly recommend.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103226100178668431723/reviews

Eric,5,"Would give 6/5 stars if I could. The rental was great! We had a small scheduling issue, but were able to sort it out over the phone very easily. The bikes were well kept and practically new. We met Laurent at the MRT station, he gave us some tips on where to go on the island, and then he picked up the bikes from our hotel.  Super easy and great fun!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103820892547095447571/reviews
