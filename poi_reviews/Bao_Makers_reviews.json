Misses their chilli crab bun so much especially with fried one.\n\nBeen supporting since Covid time. One was takeaway at Westgate. And another one was dinner with a group at Keong Siak. Will go back again & see whether can try other flavours. Thks to the staff for offering the plate. Cos usually I don't like to use my bare hands to hold the food & eat üòã",
