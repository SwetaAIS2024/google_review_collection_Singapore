Abraham Lee,4,"Good selection of dishes which were tasty and portions were pretty generous too. Conveniently located within Jem, can see why this place is always usually full as well.  Good amount of seats with a pretty quick turnover, and probably a more economical option within Jem (depending on the chosen dishes)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews
Sabrina Chia,5,"Mee rebus was extremely yummy & we had added bergedil. Service staff can be a little too fierce (especially towards non-locals) but otherwise, they are pretty fast and efficient.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111575316682211126228/reviews
Yap Hoe BENG,5,"16/1/24, New Year try the nasi Lemak still as good as before .

Today pack 2 x Nasi Lemak - just as warm and good as eating at the shop.

Best Nasi Lemak, have lunch twice a month - Nasi Padang is excellent too. They branches in IMM WOODLAND and PAYA LEBAR.

Andrea Olivato,5,"One of the best places to eat with vegetarian options between Jem and Westagte. Foodjunction has so few vegetarian options, even the mixed rice it‚Äôs almost all meat/fish.

The quality of food is very good and they have a roasted potato dish that is suuuuper good.

Ladiesfingers and mixed long beans and eggplant was also very good.

Also quite good prices.

Highly recommended!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100712413444294703058/reviews
Tracy Zhang,4,"B1 at Jem and looks good.
We ordered fish and Rendumg beef both good üòä yummy üòã
They have many choices so you can choose from chicken üçó beef ü•© fish üêü to vegetarian.
They also have different types of rice. Just the lady who took the order is a little bit pushy so I was really nervous üò•.
But nevertheless it‚Äôs a good choice!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115734578140137125670/reviews
