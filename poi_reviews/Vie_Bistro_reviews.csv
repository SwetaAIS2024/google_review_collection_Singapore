Alvin Li,5,"Vie Bistro deserves more mention but judging from the waiting time on a weekend, they are doing fine.

I have been eating their western food for more than 10 years. My go to order is their spaghetti bolognese, one of my top 3 here in Singapore. The other two being Jack's Place and an NIE canteen stall (not sure if they are still around).

When I'm feeling famished, I'd get the Chicken Chop Beef Bolognese combo, a top up from their standard Chicken Chop.

Vie Bistro had probably been through two major coffeeshop renovations already and there are always at the same spot. Lucky for us!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101636040394390892825/reviews
Garry Lew Your Estate Advisory Realtor,3,"Visited 06/02/2024 Rainy Tuesday Evening. The following sharing are based on our unbiased personal opinion and experience

Returning late from work and the boys just finished their tuition lesson nearby so we decided to grab some food over at this coffeeshop since it's getting late.

We order 1 set of Steak and fish & Chip each. The steak was pretty normal for the price range. The fish & chip is considered decent. Not the wow type of taste but good enough to fill your stomach for a good night sleep.

Chantal T,2,"Ordered a few different items from various visits before giving a review

-Chicken chop: very dry and chicken is bland. Sauce tastes weird (not mushroom, not pepper, not sure what flavour it‚Äôs supposed to be). ‚ÄúBlack pepper chicken‚Äù is black pepper sprinkled on top of the chicken, with the same base sauce instead of black pepper sauce I expected
-Steak: passable as it‚Äôs freshly grilled, but they used the same weird sauce as the chicken chop
-Both steak and chicken comes with fries and coleslaw, both of which tasted plain and boring; no other options for sides
-Grilled snapper is probably my favourite but pricey for the small portion
-Older lady owner is rude, always giving a condescending/arrogant expression while taking orders. The older guy owner is better

My meal yesterday will probably be my last, no reason to support or patronise again",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101758428229172238147/reviews
KW Yoke,5,"Value for money really, I love their pork chop (6.50), excellent gravy, the pork is a bit tough but still tastes good.
Theres a good variety of sides, I personally like the salted baked potato.

Love their garlic bread, combined with mushroom soup, it's very hearty and satisfying!

Pasta not bad, fish and chips not bad.

Always visit when we are in the Bukit batok west area lol.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101653153694763341697/reviews
Lim Daniel,1,"Food so-so, service very slow, not much choices for side dish. Ordered chicken chop (which usually comes with cold slaw and fries) and asked for mashed potato instead (I mean mashed potato instead of fries).
The chicken I got - chicken without sauce plus fries and mashed potato.
Go to another stall at behind coffee shop or another one at Blk 177 is always much better than this one.
Super lousy. This stall is over rated. üëé",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105446728951972298841/reviews
