Got my OBU replaced very quickly and he even explain what I should take note of.\n\nIn addition, I had a faulty car play with me for a long time. I always wanted to remove and other workshop quoted my $50 for workman fee.\nI ask the mechanic for the price to remove the faulty carplay, he just told me a small amount will do and proceed to remove.\nTook him quite a while to remove because the cabling is very deep.\nEnded up when the work is done, I ask for the price again, he say don't need with a smile.\n\nBest mechanic I encountered so far.\nHighly recommend!!!\nExtremely satisfied with the service.\nAs for the OBU cabling work, could be neater if possible.",

But is above a reasonable price? Last time I change spark plug for fino, it cost $5 else where. Anyway I proceeded.\n\nAsked for battery price and they quoted me $70+\nDecided not to proceed because I don’t remember it to be so ex.. subsequently I search online and found battery prices for NMax between $30+ to $50.\n\nFinally got my battery at Ah boy for $38. The better brand one for $48.\n\nI guess good if you are rushing to get things fixed but expensive if you have time to go elsewhere",
