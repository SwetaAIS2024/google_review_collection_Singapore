Florence Leow,3,"üü¶Goldhill Shopping Centre is one of Singapore's oldest shopping centres built in 1969.

‚ú≥Ô∏è The existing development comprises of three blocks of walk-up commercial units, with retail shops filling up the ground floor units.

üü´ This Goldhill shopping centre is within walking distance to United Square, Novena Square, Square 2 and Tan Tock Seng Hospital.

üüß Most of the retail shops here are eateries, salons, coffeeshops, enrichment centres, tuition centres and the like. It is an old shopping centre and the facilities & facade are abit run down.

üü¶But it is within a prominent location. Just next door is United Square mall, and opposite it is the Inland Revenue Dept and adjacent to it are the Novena Square malls.

üü¢ The nearest train station is Novena MRT Station.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews

Flo Yeow,4,"They're right across the street from United Square shopping mall. It's a very old and run down patch of real estate, with mostly eateries and bakeries on the ground floor, and office or tuition centres upstairs. It's nothing much, but it works. Convenience is definitely there as well.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
