Having good customer service is a basic requirement of the F&B industry, and this outlet falls short in that aspect. Do not come here if you expect to be treated the bare minimum.",

Ordered a sandwich after a hard day of work to only be cheated with this pathetic excuse for a beef sandwich.  Never am I ordering from here again. Looking through the reviews here, Iâ€™m not even surprised. If management is turning a blind eye to this, better to close the shop than tarnish the image and reputation of Subway with this outlet.",
