jonathan “Drfeelgood”,2,"Small burgers... shrinking size....

Nice place to chill...

Aircon not switched on fully... quite stuffy... saving money too much???

Coffee ok...

But why are the burgers so small??

And the patties being cut so thinly.....??

Come on McDonald's....

Don't cut costs like that... too obvious le...",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103471111736209790560/reviews
Marcus Chan,1,"Nowadays the burger getting smaller. Double fish fillet but size small until you don’t want to come back McDonald again. Order the coffee yet not coming until I finish review. This is not a fast food anymore. Slow food McDonald. Not the staff problem. I should said it is company problem, coffee supply cannot make on time? Why cut the burger size to such so small? Increase profit in order customer suffer? Good move you. I am a fan of McDonald, but I think I will change my mind since the company sold to other company recently.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100623273091312454597/reviews
Kahyee Chong,1,"I’ve encountered repeated issues with my orders from the Buangkok Mall McDonald’s. On multiple occasions, the hotcake syrup and butter were missing, which are essential condiments for enjoying hotcakes. Today, things were even worse. My order came without syrup, butter, or hash browns for any of the burgers I ordered. On top of that, there was no toy included in the Happy Meal, leaving my child upset and frustrated.

This feels like I’m being shortchanged for a meal I’ve paid full price for. These repeated errors make it seem like quality control is not a priority.

Please ensure all items, especially condiments, sides, and items like toys, are included in future orders. This experience has been extremely disappointing.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106100206777176074587/reviews
Muhammad Hassan,2,"Worst customer service I've ever experienced at the Buangkok McDonald's. An Indian lady was very sarcastic. I ordered the Hotcakes meal and the Happy Meal with hotcakes through the mobile app, choosing to get two whipped butters each. However, they only provided two butters in total. When I questioned them, they insisted that I only chose two, despite my selection. Why must I argue over butter? It should come with the meal as expected. This is the worst customer service I have ever encountered.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101677133220960867181/reviews
