      "text": "It's a nice corner bar for relaxation at night. We had the carbonara and ribeye steak. Carbonara was great, so creamy and pasta was al dente. Chef was really nice, he personally came out to take the order and mentioned that he can cook the medium rare steak a little more if we decide we prefer it a little more cooked. But the steak was good, just üëçWe also had the red velvet cake after the meal which was dense and filling. Will be nice if theres some music playing at night to add to the atmosphere. Otherwise it's just the sound of chatter from customers from the other tables.",
