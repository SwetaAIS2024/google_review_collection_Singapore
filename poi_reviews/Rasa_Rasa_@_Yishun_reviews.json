The service seemed quick for the large crowd and the staffs seemed really polite , there were two robot that served some dishes once in a while and it was quote a sight ... The food didn't hit though , It was extremely greasy and also a little on the saltier side ... we felt a little uneasy after the dinner ...",

I think so far the best meal would be this..\n\nMango Milkshake was nice, teh Halia is not so gingery...lack of ginger..\n\nIf I'm around the area, then I will drop by again if not, I don't think I will specifically come here for a meal..",
