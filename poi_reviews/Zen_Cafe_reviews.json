      "text": "Truly a zen-like cafe to enjoy your afternoon tea/ coffee and light snacks and lunch. Food is nice. We ordered the vegetables bao and latte. Not very heavy meal. The atmosphere is superb. Just imagine light music ðŸŽ¶ playing at the background with aircon. You can quietly sip your hot latte and enjoy a book. It is truly a zen-like experience. Can get away from the busy, noisy and chaotic life and enjoy peace and serenity that is so so important!ðŸ˜€",

The staff could have tell us that today we are serving only CNY set instead if telling us no more fries all sold out.\nYou could said fries available with the set purchase right? see the receipt and items we order?\nWe sat near the counter and saw someone bought the fries separately, too?\nWill revisit if such service provide even the food is nice? This is my 3rd visit receiving such services, really put me in doubts to consider.",

Location is inside the Guang Ming San (Brighthill) Temple.\n\nFood is alright (just vegetarian snacks) but I was suprised that the cold brew had sugar in it which is a No-no.\n\nI will probably hang out here again if I go to this temple.",
