The pork belly is diced like in Âç§ËÇâÈ•≠Ôºåand not big pieces like what other stalls do.\n\n3. The fried meatballs are unique and good.\n\n$4\n\nThe lady working at the stall looks fierce",

      "text": "Yeah! So excited. Ventured all the way to CCK (Keat Hong) after noticing this seemingly old-school #lormee on Google maps. Definitely curious to check it out.\n\nIndeed, lor mee is really popular among the neighbourhood, with every other table eating it.\n\nOrdered fried fish lor kway teow for $5. Generous portion. Comes with 3 big pcs of fried fish with soft centre, cubes of Âç§ËÇâand half a egg. The ‚Äòlor‚Äô is very good, just the right amount of starchiness and very flavourful. They even add cut big red and green chillies for an added kick. So filling and taste hits the perfect note for me. Definitely one of the best hidden lor mee around.\n\nüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã",

At $5, nowadays you can get lor mee with good quality fish such as Ang Kor Li and not dory, which is served here. Even the garlic looked like spat.",
