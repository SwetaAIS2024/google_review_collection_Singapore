Forest BK,5,"⛰️Dairy Farm Quarry was a disused granite quarry site, similar to others around Bukit Timah Nature Reserve area which ceased operation under orders from the Singapore Government in 1970.
⛰️But, unlike other quarries that eventually turn to a wetland, Dairy Farm Quarry was filled in with earth and grass over.
🏔️The picturesque lush vegetation covered granite cliff and its serene surrounding is a popular destination for both hikers and mountain bikers.
⛰️The Quarry is located at a short walk from Hillview MRT station.
The jungle trail is rocky at some stretch.
⛰️Note:
🕸️There are no toilet or water point.
🏔️It is a dead end for hikers, while the mountain bikers can continue towards Wallace Trail via mountain bike trail.

Angelina Angle,5,"From Hillview MRT station Exit A at the junction in of Dairy Farm Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre turn left walked up a bit will be at the road sign showing either to Dairy Farm Education Centre or Dairy Farm Quarry so turn right.

Is just a short hike but along the way have many macaques hanging around so remember to keep any plastic bag in your bag or hide any foods in bag to prevent them from being their target. Actually, I'm afraid of them as alone at that moment passing through but told myself must be brave and pretend they are not existing.

I never walked near to have a looked just stand from far and snapshot. Whole journey through and back just take me 30mins only",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100373202779329959919/reviews
