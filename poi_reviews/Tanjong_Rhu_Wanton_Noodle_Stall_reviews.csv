Ling Ho,3,"Located within a HDB coffee shop

Weekday lunch time and despite a one man operation the staff was patient and pleasant.

Signature wanton mee and wanton soup.

I liked that The noodles didnt have the usual ghee smell however while the portion of noodles was generous the ingredients were actually very little. The char siew was sliced so thinly and in small pieces. The wanton soup was ok it didnt taste like alot of msg which is good.

Patrick Chiam,5,"Another fave Wanton Mee place. Meeting an old friend at the coffee shop 1.5 years after my stroke. Feeling hungry, I order my wanton Mee before my friend arrived. Totally missed the chewy noodle and char siew still taste fantastic. My verdict? Tanjung Rhu or not, as long it is nice and reasonably priced, itâ€™s just a delicious Wanton Me to me.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100900817694981669139/reviews

Joe P,4,The actual name of this stall is Tanjong Rhu wanton Noodle. It's a pretty decent plate of wanton noodles for $4. The lady serving it was nice and polite.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109325409107438635368/reviews
Bobby Pang,4,Now I don't have to travel all the way to Tanjong Rhu for a good bowl of wanton see. Great to see this coffee shop adding more and more good food stalls. All the new additions are above my expectations.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105545609057137156005/reviews
