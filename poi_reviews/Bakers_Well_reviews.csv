Dreamer DK,1,"First, the apple crumbles pricing was misleading. They put $8.50 for one, and $16 for two. So when I took 1 box with 2 pieces in it, would have expected to pay $8.50 for 1 box. But nah, they counted by piece though they put 2 pieces in 1 box, without indication whether 1 piece or 1 box. Ok, so my friend paid for them without me knowing the actual price. My own bad as I didn’t clarify before passing to her for payment..
Interestingly, what drove me to buy the Apple crumbles was how heavy it felt in my hand when I picked them up, even commented to my friend the fillings would be solid given the weight. So Imagine my disappointment when I cracked open the crumble, and found out fillings were pathetically filled. Look at the photo and you would know what I meant. Practically I paid $16 for 2 pieces of thickly crusted cookies. Definitely won’t buy any apple crumbles from this shop again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109533595297935956880/reviews
