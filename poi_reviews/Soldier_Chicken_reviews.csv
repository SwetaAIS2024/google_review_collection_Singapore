William Lu,4,"Too big portion for me. The chicken was so big, I couldn't finish it though. The chicken cutlet was too dry and mostly the crunchy part.

Price was reasonable for western food. $7.5 for chicken cutlet with discount with fair price app. It was quite quick serve.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
Faiz Baharrudinn,5,"Ordered via grabfood, truffle fries portion is a lot unlike other shops small portion expensive price. Aglio Olio and chicken is superb, I can literally eat the pasta by itself and the chicken last and it will still taste good.

1st time ordering definitely will order again!

Many coffeeshop at Hougang old town, especially western foods. This Soilder Chicken western foods stall has been operated few years. Being quite popular and good business since opened.

Their price range was quite high, mostly above $10. Fortunately, their dishes was quite flavourful and tasty. More on heavy seasoning and with distinct taste.

We tried their lambchop, 4 pieces of lamb racks, very well cooked, medium rare to medium cooked. Side dishes come with French fries and cooslow. Priced at $12.90. Slight pricy and small portion.

Overall, still a good western foods with decent quality. Worth visit for first timer.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111255682252678932891/reviews
Zheng Xiang Teo,5,"Pasta delicious. Chicken scrumptious. Plating magnificent. I have honestly very high standards for western food stalls as I am a regular at the Wow Wow West at ABC. But this omg. The chicken I had today was really well cooked. The pasta were both great and garlicky but the tomato base one stood out.
