Lots of medical related clinics here ok the medical tower side. Lots of eateries on the ground floor too. Has its own parking which is super convenient. Will be back!",

No, the bill did not hit a hole in my pocket as it was reasonably priced. A good place to impress your in-laws who would like to try vegetarian food at affordable prices in quite- a- cozy restaurant.",
