Koo Haoming (Haominggowhere),1,"Very disappointing experience. I was standing right in front of the staff, but she prioritized online orders over serving walk-in customers. Absolutely no respect. Despite being short-staffed, they kept accepting more online orders and told us it would take 30 minutes just for fruits tea options ‚Äî we had to change our order. Other customers walked out immediately, and they made the right choice. Even basic drinks took forever (more than 30 minutes). If you can‚Äôt handle it, stop taking GrabFood and Foodpanda orders. Serve the customers who are physically there first. Ridiculous.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106167453532601693476/reviews
Sofina,5,"Went on a weekday afternoon. Staff was patient in explaining how to order & use voucher in app. No q so got my drinks in 5 minutes.

aint sarah,4,"Drinks r ok. Tho i wanna get buy 1 free 1 offer on the app and the staff asked us to order it online in the store itself when the internet is damn slow. Ive been to other branch and they allow us to order it at the counter as long as we show them the voucher on the app.

Also i hope they improve their bahasa... ü•≤ so sad to see our people not being able to speak fluent bahasa.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116985272549561443338/reviews
Yvonne Low,5,"Staffs are polite and drinks are delivered quickly. The drinks are fragrant even with little or zero sugar. We ordered through the online mini program , the baskin Robbin x Beutea special and it came with a free plushie. Everything is prepared promptly. Definitely a keeper.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111062630817313884101/reviews
