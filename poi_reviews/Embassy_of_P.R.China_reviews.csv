Vivian Tsang,1,"Why is it  so extrememly difficult  to speak to a customer service  staff at the embassy.
I  need to  quickly get some important  information  before 12pm when the embassy  closes.  It only opens a few short hours everyday, and yet it  is  just impossible to get through to a staff on duty !

Joy Lim,1,"Super bad experience. They never told me to prepare this document, but on the spot need to submit.

So I stuck there for a few hours and all staff say nothing they can help cuz it’s the system setting.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114917571079969822787/reviews

The security uncle downstairs, although very determined about shutting the door on dot at 12pm, is actually approachable.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112035048266895716246/reviews
