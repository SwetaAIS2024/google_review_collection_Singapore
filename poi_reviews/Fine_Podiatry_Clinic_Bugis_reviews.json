I was also very nervous at the start but Dr Yeo was reassuring and gentle. She managed to remove the nail without too much pain at all. What a relief!\n\nThroughout the entire process, she made sure I was comfortable and doing ok. She also taught me how to clean and sanitise my toe.\n\nPrices were transparent and fair, would definitely come back again if I have any foot issues in future !",

She was really detail oriented, and we had a great chat while she was working on my feet. Totally pain free, and my feet feel and look great now. Bonus: the interior was really clean, warm and welcoming too :)",
