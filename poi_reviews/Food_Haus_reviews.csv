Lee Bee Kim,5,This coffee shop has many types of cuisines. Took the Peking Duck and the Thai Food. The Thai cuisine generally all is good and at a reasonable price. The Peking Duck is restaurant standard and a must try dish. I will definitely be back to try more cuisine.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101782917403214777339/reviews

Lily Ang,2,"My friends and I visited this coffeeshop after reading glowing reviews about the unique food offerings.

Excitedly, I ordered and prepaid for the black truffle roast duck. The next day, we arrived at 6:15 pm, and the coffeeshop was packed. After a considerable wait, we finally found a table in the far corner of the outdoor seating area. However, despite clear signs indicating no smoking, one of the patrons at the table next to ours was smoking, and the smoke quickly drifted toward our side. My friend politely requested for the individual to stop smoking once he finished his cigarette, but his response was shockingly rude. He told my friend that he had no right to tell him what to do. When a staff member stepped forward to make the same request, the patron became even more aggressive, loudly stating that she has no authority over him. He raised his voice and acted as if he was ready to escalate things further, creating a tense, uncomfortable atmosphere.

To my disbelief, the patron’s friend then turned to us and accused *us* of causing the problem, asking if we were ""happy"" with the situation and if we wanted things to escalate into a fight. The audacity of the situation was overwhelming.

I had arrived at the coffeeshop with high hopes of enjoying a good meal, but instead, I was met with hostility.

The food itself, however, lived up to its reputation. We ordered black truffle roast duck, char siew, roast meat, gyudon, and bibimbap, and all dishes were excellent. The staff at the stalls were also very professional in managing the queue and crowd.

Unfortunately, the food, no matter how good, couldn’t erase the discomfort and tension. By the time the food was served, we were constantly watching the table next to us, for fear that the situation might escalate again. The patron moved to a grassy area outside the coffeeshop and continued smoking, sending the smell directly to our table.

We continued eating but we were feeling tensed. As soon as we finished, we quickly returned the empty dishes and left.

This experience was so unpleasant that I’ve resolved not to dine in at this coffeeshop again. While I do want to support the stall entrepreneurs, I will only order takeaway in the future. It is really not worth feeling the lack of safety just to have a meal there.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112054608863176930973/reviews
C T,5,Extensive selection and interesting decor concept. Truffle duck was really good and flavourful. Tried the western and was shocked by their generous serving size! Mala stall has this enormous stewed pork ribs that was super tasty and will be back for more.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102297295703951903374/reviews
TCH,5,"Read a lot of reviews about the so many good food here.  Too bad we missed the window for Peking Duck and Mookata.

We had Mala, Roast Pork, Thai food which all tasted awesome and delicious!

This kopitiam is very bright and clean. Keep it up. Also to continue to upkeep the toilets too as most kopitiams after some time the state of hygiene in the toilets are questionable!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102467592239988127131/reviews
