Martin Low,5,"Ordered the grilled chicken and fish combo, which comes with 2 sides. I chose onion rings and mashed potato.

Food: The sauce paired well with the chicken. Fish was fried nicely which gives it the desired crunchiness and texture. Mash potato has the nostalgic old school taste, but the onion rings could be fried for longer.

Mayo was provided and condiments such as mustard and chilli sauce was available. Protein was relatively large portion as well.

Service: Typical food court experience Order and pay from counter, receive buzzer.

Atmosphere: Non air-conditioned food court.

Overall, it's a decent place for your western meal fix if you live nearby. I would recommend to try either the chicken or the fish. It is best to go on a cool day as the area can get really hot.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113894121481913544527/reviews
Mark Tan,4,"It proves that when eating western food in a neighbourhood food court don’t I say again don’t order beef steak

1 they’re unable to sell you higher prices so the meat quality is not so good.

2 their coleslaw is too raw.

The good point

1. Their service has improved a little.

2. The presentation is not so bad.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109622645562748751519/reviews
Seng Chong Tan,4,"Ordered chicken steak with broccoli and mashed potato. Turns out the food tastes way better than the Western food stall upstairs. The broccoli was complemented with corns with a dash of lemon juice, tastes good with the lime-flavoured mustard sauce. The mashed potato was creamy and the gravy was savoury. The chicken though small in size was pretty well done. Bathed with creamy mushroom sauce, the dish tastes just nice. Worth going back.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112753912480208859387/reviews
Teoh Hui,1,"Quite disappointing.
Tried the NZ Ribeye Steak and asked for Medium Rare only to be greeted by a well done. Brought it back to exchange for a better done steak only to get another Well Done (No red at all) followed by a tougher cut of beef. The reviews weren't joking about the beef being done wrong here.
The only good thing was the black pepper sauce to help mask the flavour of the ruined beef. Not a bad sauce actually.

Either way, just order the other items on the menu. The beef isn't worth it.

Image shows the 2nd attempt.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100677978485354326160/reviews
