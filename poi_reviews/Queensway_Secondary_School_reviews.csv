khadija goh,1,"so far as i can say, horrible school, teachers here couldn't care less, some even 'pretend' to care. My report wasn't even concluded, students here are horrible, some can even be prefects  or 'student leaders' but act like hooligans on public transport. Do better.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106629246749285799000/reviews
teaz,1,"This school is literally horrible. Lots of students here are getting bullied everyday, some even being the victims of brute force and violence, but the teachers and respective higher-ups seem to do nothing much about the situation. They give you empty promises as to them being able to help you resolve the situation, but the punishments that are supposedly ‚Äú met out ‚Äú have not even been shown. A written apology letter was supposed to be issued to someone‚Äôs child i know, and since the start till the end of the holidays she still has NOT received any news on when she could receive the apology letter. There are only 2-3 teachers here who genuinely support the students, and listen to them, but the others just really don‚Äôt care and barely take action.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100104691992131050763/reviews
