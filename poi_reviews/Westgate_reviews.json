      "text": "Nice mall. It is in Jurong East. Many choices of food. The parking is pretty difficult. The area is not often traffic jammed. The mall is anlso child-friendly because the toilets are low. The mall comprises a 7-floor mall and a 20-floor office.  It features amenities such as a childcare center, a gym, swimming pool and Westgate Wonderland. Walk through the bridge and there are shuttles to IMM. Mostly, it is a place to buy your goods.",

Without awaiting much in queue, just walk-in & got our table. Their xlb is simply too delicious ðŸ¤¤",
