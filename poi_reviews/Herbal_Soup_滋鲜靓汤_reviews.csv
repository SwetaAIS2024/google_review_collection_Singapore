Kiri,5,"The soup is super flavorful and nourishing! I ordered close to closing time, the lady boss always gives me extra ingredients or swaps them out if the pork ribs or the ingredient in the soup run out. I can ask for extra lotus roots without any issues! How come there is one comment by STephy so special one leh, never kena extra ingredients one.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103381900618161302542/reviews
STephy Aw 3,2,"Ordered a lotus root soup at 8plus pm. The taste is alright. Not the worst but nothing spectacular as well. While I do understand that I’m purchasing the soup near to closing hours, I would greatly appreciate it if the owner would kindly pre-empt that there’s not much ingredients left. It’s the FIRST TIME EVER, that I had soup with 2 slices of lotus roots, 2 tiny pieces of pork ribs and 2 huge chicken feet (which I unfortunately don’t eat). Upon feedback to the owner, he mentioned that he typically only give 2 slices of lotus roots to all customers. Wow! Could customers who patronized this store before validate this? I’m quite amazed not in a good way.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103925396731418308916/reviews
Mitchell Sia,5,"This stall was set up by the same pple behind Shen Xi herbal soup with stalls in Chinatown, Parkway Parade, Ion, ARC, Raffles City, Vivicity etc. There used to be an outlet at Jewel too but it has closed there and a new stall was set up in Tampines. It is good stuff! Try it!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113381623421164120896/reviews
