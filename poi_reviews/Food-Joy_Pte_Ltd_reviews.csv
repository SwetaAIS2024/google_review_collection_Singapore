Bryan Lim,1,"I am a local customer but have no choice but to buy from this shop sometimes as there are no options available. Heard of many dishonest experience as per other reviews, those are true. The management (old man and daughter) does not care about reviews/service and only profitability since they are a monopoly in the area. Avoid if you can because many residents have boycotted this Food Joy, unless you have no choice. Enough said, go shop at your own risk!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106618845968521315688/reviews
Geetha,1,"Admin fee for different payment method is so bloody inconvenient, the only convenient way is to pay by cash.
As well I would like to feedback what happened today at the shop, I'm quite a regular customer, I find it ridiculously frustrated to keep taking items out of the freezer to check for the prices. Why are the prices not indicated as I could compare the price difference of certain brands and food. When I feedback this to the cashier who was a China girl and a foreign lady they kept quiet and didn't even reply me. One even showed her pissed off face to me. I'm the customer and was merely asking. Ridiculous customer service and in fact spoilt my morning mood. Put the bloody prices for the freezer items!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108329668254968621327/reviews
Kunta Kinte,1,Expensive. Be prepared to pay 50cents to 2 dollars more at this shop. Better to get at the supermarket. Avoid this shop at all cost. Surrounded by private estates and foreigners. Sure hike up price..,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113435258480330706778/reviews
Muhammad Farhan,5,Lot of choices and it's in ideal place if not you would have to visit further to get your groceries shopping done. Also there is auto kiosk where you can scan your products and pay the amount or cash or card. But if your going to cashier you need minimum 30$ for card payment,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104815732327637620059/reviews
