A2B in an EV,5,"Beautiful store. Stocked up on a variety of rooibos-based blends (due to caffeine sensitivity) and delighted in the range they had. Despite the late hour at night (around 11pm), the gentleman behind the counter was engaged, patient, helpful, courteous. Minimal waiting time for service. The macarons and chocolates looked delicious too!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102050510624352247259/reviews

Naiyowmee,5,"Beautiful, quaint tea shop with an incredible array of teas on display. The staff were very helpful, asking me questions about the kind of tea tastes and scents I liked and suggested a few blends. Their suggestions were all so amazing - I wanted to take them all. A wee bit pricey, but the brews are amazing. They also have some cute tea pots and sets, as well as traditional china tea sets",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103922406395339049988/reviews
