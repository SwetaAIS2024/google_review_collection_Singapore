Janet Glyde,1,"I am an ex staff from this preschool, from my experience this preschool does not take into consideration the welfare of their staff. They are always understaffed and their turn over rate is high. The curriculum for the children is weak, the thematic-based curriculum is dry and not child appropriate. In my opinion and on behalf of the other ex staffs that left, we strongly encourage you not to send your child here. They will not have an enriching/nurturing environment to flourish in. The school‚Äôs resources are also not updated and very old, most toys are reused for over 3years, broken and in bad condition. They also do not have a proper primary school transition programme for kindergarteners. I just feel bad for all the children going to this school. We strongly do not recommend this preschool to anyone.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102938094824553583770/reviews
