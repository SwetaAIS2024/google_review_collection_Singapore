Apparently veggies or meat, same price, so better take more meat.\nHelp yourself to the limited range of drinks and pay at counter. No cup. No ice. Hence, no service or minimum service.\n\nTaste is not bad. Appreciate that there is free flow of kimchi. And you can formula your own sauce too.",

Apparently when the total amount came by I was shocked by the price and amount of food. Doesn’t looks like it worth the price for the amount that I ordered. I don’t know if they even “tare” the weighing scale, but this is too exaggerate. Not coming back anymore",

Staff attitude was poor; witnessed another customer asking what sauce he's holding but was replied rudely in an unwilling manner. One of the chopsticks was unclean. Return tray area was full of returned bowls. I am totally disappointed, will not recommend this outlet.",

Taste of soup is decent and ingredients were mostly fresh (at least those we had).\n\nWould I revisit? Unlikely. Will try somewhere else.",
