There is no original Thai food favor and Thai fried rice’s chickens full of chicken skin. Vegetables are too raw. No recommended.",

So far, we have tried tom yum fried rice, basil pork fried rice, garlic pork fried rice, tom yum soup & mee mama (spicy fried mama noodle). All of them did not disappoint. Will be back to try other 'zichar' dishes when we have larger pool of people. Highly recommended.",

Really spicy and wok hei and flavor is substantial. Will try other dishes in the future. Packet their Tom Yum clear soup and my wife approved the taste. Sorry no pictures taken in the soup.",
