      "text": "My stay at the Dorsett Singapore was extremely disappointing. The location of the hotel is convenient, however, coupled with the poor rooms and the poor service from the concierge (in particular, from Germaine). I would not stay here again.\n\nUpon arrival, we noticed that our keycard was not activating the lights in the room. In fact, the system fell off the wall upon insertion  and we had to request for a room change. Also, the layout of the bathroom was poorly thought out and was very uncomfortable to use. The sink was also scuffed and some tiles had noticeable cracks in the bathroom.\n\nThere was no apology due to the condition of the room and the reception gave us the impression that it was an inconvenience for a room change. Later on in the evening, we requested for an extra duvet, however, over the phone, a reply of \"It might take a while..\" was unpleasant to receive.\n\nMoreover, although the pool closed at 8pm, by 7:45, the lights had been dimmed and the environment was near pitch black, a health and safety +/- accident-in-waiting.\n\nAlthough the location of the hotel may be tempting, I would encourage others to book elsewhere.",

      "text": "Great Stay but Housekeeping Needs Improvement\n\nI had a good stay at Dorsett Singapore. The room was comfortable, and overall, my experience was pleasant. The staff were friendly, and the hotel had a nice atmosphere.\n\nHowever, one thing that needs improvement is housekeeping. During my stay, the shower gel ran out, and it wasn’t refilled. It’s a small detail, but regular checks would make the experience even better.\n\nOther than that, everything was great, and I would consider staying here again!",

She was professional and helpful. Our interactions with her were positive. Very convenient location. Didn’t have a chance to use the pool nor the gym therefore cannot comment on these two facilities.\n\nWe enjoyed our visit here. Hopefully, will have a chance to return.",
