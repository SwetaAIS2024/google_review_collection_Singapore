lontongstroong,3,The bus stop where the shuttle bus lines to both western and eastern parts of Sentosa Island originates. It's located within walking distance from the Sentosa Monorail terminus at ground level - just find the light blue signage. The signage for either directions aren't well marked and there's no staff to enquire too. Note that the buses make lengthy stops at this bus stop - be sure to ask the driver prior to boarding!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews
Abdul Haireel,1,"Bus B didn't pick up passengers at the designated bus waiting area. We missed the bus and had to wait 15 minutes.

Unfortunate for such a nicely laid out station.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110724038962101322096/reviews

Kaisar Amani,5,"Beach Station is the last station part of the Sentosa Express and has a transfer hub located on the ground floor that includes bus services such as 123, A, B and C, as well as the Beach Shuttle service.

Due to construction, the pickup and drop off point for taxi and private transport has been relocated to the basement carpark. It is right beside the entrance of the carpark which is directly opposite the old Kidzania building. Guests should not be picked up or dropped off in the bus bay area (the obvious sign that it's the bus bay are the signs on the road leading up to it and the buses parked there) as there are buses constantly entering and leaving there.

From Beach Station, there are a few F&B options nearby as well as bars, clubs and attractions.

For smokers, the smoking area is located behind Beach Station next to the restrooms.

The road next to Beach Station is a shared road, therefore guests should stick to using that road when cycling, skating, rollerblading, etc. but they should watchout for vehicles.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114175960063922988006/reviews
