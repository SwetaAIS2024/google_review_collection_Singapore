Liew Jun Tung (JT),5,"Preachers are faithful to God's Word. Biblical and sound doctrines are preached, emphasized and exercised, and not following the way of the world.

Members are kind, loving and filled with the Holy Spirit.

May it continue to be so.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111113081486799425810/reviews

Hafiz Zain,4,"Coming back here for a third time for another wedding. So far three for three have been a pleasant experience, facilities all clean, auditorium is beautiful and sound system worked with no hiccups. If you’re coming here for an event do note that parking is very limited so either come early or park nearby. I parked at Mattar MRT Surface CP, a 8-10min walk away, for free parking.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110258588070405761623/reviews
Kevin Xie,5,"Was only visiting as I was on vacation in Singapore, but I could tell from just one Sunday this is a good church. Biblical expositional preaching, strong Sunday liturgy, beautiful worship with meaningfully rich songs. Multigenerational and large congregation. An excellent church to attend on Sunday even if you are visiting Singapore. Also very convenient since it’s just a couple minutes walking by the Blue Line Mattar Rd station",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111192699594607272618/reviews
