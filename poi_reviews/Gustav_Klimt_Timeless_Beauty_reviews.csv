Miles Macdonald,4,"There are two parts to this session, a documentary element that lasts 35 minutes, followed by 20 minutes of immersive digital art.
The documentary element was excellent taking you through chapters of Klimt's life, really five-star, very well put together and presented l.
The immersive art experience should have been really good, but this is where my gripe lies and the reason it drops a star. I really think children under 15 years old shouldn't be allowed into this exhibition. When the immersive performance started, several children started shouting and running around, chasing the moving patterns on the floor. You can't expect the parents to stop this. It doesn't work. They just shouldn't allow young children in. It spoils the atmosphere for adults trying to enjoy the music & visual experience of the immersive show.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112943810663501022344/reviews
