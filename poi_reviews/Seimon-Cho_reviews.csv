Chun Wei Yap,1,"When seeking assistance or inquiring about products, I expected courteous and helpful responses. Instead, I was met with condescension and dismissive replies that left me feeling frustrated and belittled. I believe it is essential for your staff to understand that customers visit your store seeking not only products but also a positive and respectful shopping experience.

Furthermore, I was taken aback by the apparent arrogance and ego displayed by some of your staff members. It is perplexing to witness such inflated egos in individuals who are primarily responsible for selling plushies and figurines. The unnecessary haughtiness and superiority complex exhibited by your staff were not only uncalled for but also created an unwelcoming and hostile atmosphere within your store.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113508263446425587652/reviews
