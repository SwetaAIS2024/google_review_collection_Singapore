      "text": "A small coffee shop in Pasir Panjang, conveniently located by the bus stop.\nThe place is quite small and does have some stools to sit but it's more for order on the go.\n\nOrdered flat white twice was really happy with the coffee taste and quality. The service was also very warm and friendly. Pricing wise is moderate, a cup of flat white cost $5.50... It is still reasonable for the quality.\n\nThey also sell some pastries, tried the pain au chocolat, it was just OK. They also have cheese cakes, which was recommended by the barista. May try next time when I'm craving for some dessert.\n\nI'm wondering if they could make Magic or Piccolo latte, will try asking on the next visit.",
