Joe Goh,5,A rare gem of a stall for Nasi Lemak and economic Bee Hoon lovers in Sengkang! The fried chicken is a must try along with the many other well done dishes. Kudos the family for the quality of cooking and friendly service consistently 👍🏻,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105361594202045896635/reviews
