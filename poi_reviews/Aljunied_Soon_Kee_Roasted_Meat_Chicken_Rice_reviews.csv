MsOmNom,5,"Been dining here at *Aljunied (Soon Kee) Roasted Meat Chicken Rice* a few times. This time we ordered half a steamed chicken, with additional gizzard, and two servings of rice that comes with soup â€” all for just $11.60. The chicken was tender and juicy, complemented perfectly by the fragrant, savory rice. The gizzards were a delightful addition, cooked just right to retain their chewiness without being tough. The chili sauce had a great balance of spice and tang, enhancing each bite. And if you want, you can ask for a free refill of soup if you dine there.

Beyond the food, the stall uncle was incredibly kind, despite his somewhat intimidating appearance at first glance. He made sure our food was served with a smile, and his warm demeanor added a personal touch to the meal. The value for money here is fantastic, and the food is simply delicious. A must-visit if you're craving authentic, affordable chicken rice in the New Upper Changi Rd!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112478801214182052307/reviews
James Ang,5,"Uncle is damm passionate about his rice and chicken, and it shows in the end product. You stand outside the stall you can smell the chicken rice already, and I mean the rice itself like woah bro...

Chicken is roasted perfectly and isn't too salty where some stalls use seasoning to just inject some taste but the chicken itself here is tender and soft with a hint of herbs fragrance.

Keep up the good work uncle, your skills are crazy good and I hope everyone gets a taste of your mad power.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100655878992435360282/reviews
Rajen Arasu,4,"Usually takeaway Char Siew and Roasted Pork Rice from this stall. Portions of rice and meats are generous.  Plus point is that the stall's default rice served is chicken rice even for non chicken rice orders. Accompanying chilli sauce is sufficiently spicy and flavorful. Personally the food served here has a nostalgic, old school taste that reminds me of what we had more than 50 years ago .. no frills, decent meals from this stall.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113317460774650179369/reviews
Ryan Lau,5,"A very decent plate of charsiew and roasted pork rice, at a price of $4.50 at the time of this review, it is hard to beat nowadays. The soup is seasoned well, and the sweet tangy chilli really packs a puncha nd cuts through the meats. Very appeytizing, they should have more patrons imo.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111770205941380899788/reviews
