Jules Cates (Jules),5,"My time at this beautiful venue was more of awesomeness...this lovely complex is connected to a 5 star resort, shopping mall with high-end luxury goods, restaurants/bars and a casino.

My main purpose for visiting was to the Gardens by the bay attraction...Everything about this place is amazing and love that they open the whole venue to anyone who wants to visit.

The Shops in the mall are nice, clean and well laid out...there's something for everyone, the interior is architecturally impressive...the sky high escalators are not for the faint of heart though...a must visit when down by the Marina.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112064282621849519349/reviews
Wisanu Tuntawiroon,5,"The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is a destination where luxury meets architectural splendor, redefining the high-end shopping experience in Singapore. Stepping into this world-class mall feels like embarking on a journey of indulgence and sophistication, set against a backdrop of innovative design and impeccable service.

The Shoppes captivates visitors with its breathtaking architecture. Floor-to-ceiling glass panels, elegant water features, and soaring atriums create an ambiance that is both modern and timeless. The interior design seamlessly blends art and functionality, making every corner of the space a visual delight. The iconic canal running through the mall adds a touch of serenity, inviting shoppers to leisurely drift along the waterway on a gondola ride—a truly unique feature that enhances the overall experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109243125213682583986/reviews
Xoom Too,5,"The mall has a ton of high end branded names such as Carolina Herrera, VERSACE, Adidas, Swatch, Gucci, and more. There are also restaurants and a food court but since the area is prime the prices are higher than other locations. The lay-out especially near the higher floors is quite impressive.

Location is honestly great near multiple MRT entrances/exits, bus stops, car pick up areas, and it’s right next to this big walking area which is used for jogging/running/biking, and more. It’s seriously a super long area so if you’re biking I’d recommend visiting.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105863133358477079886/reviews
Michael Joel Mawikere,4,"This mall is nice. The food court is often very crowded. There is also an Apple Store, if you see it from the balcony it looks like it’s floating on the water. Some glass doors open automatically. The parking is pretty crowded. From the balcony you can also see the Merlion. But the most important thing is the service, cleanliness, ambience and safety. Keep up the nice work!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110185022401059709772/reviews
James A,4,"Impressive mall very fancy with premium brands at premium prices. You don’t have to be rich to go here, but be prepared to pay. The food court has good value for the dollar. Excellent food there a good prices. Everything else is more than what you’d pay in most of Asia and the USA.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107462499074142707055/reviews
