The service attitude is very good, the variety is rich, and it is worth trying.

This is my second visit.
The combination of ingredients is creative, but unfortunately the price is a bit higher than other food stalls. It tastes good, which I like.

I hope the boss will consider the price:
$4.50
$5.50
$6.50
$7.50
Classify different ingredients into different grades, which will help customers choose.

Chicken and pork prices should not be too high.

The market generally accepts that the price of fish, mutton and beef is higher than that of chicken and pork.
