Shawn Kim,5,We are staying for 2 nights in Singapore. I and my son lost a way back to our hotel and phone battery was flat. We stopped in front of this church and asked for a direction. There were a group of people who were willing to assist us. One of them let the others go first and was kindly waiting for us to catch a taxi. Couldn’t ask his name but we could feel that he was such a gentleman. We wish to say “thank you” again. Thank you.,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115310328088457618605/reviews
