Wynn,5,"Had a wonderful dining experience at Shin Minori! The food was absolutely delicious with a wide variety of fresh and flavorful Japanese dishes. The atmosphere was cozy and relaxing — perfect for both casual meals and special occasions.

Special shoutout to Julia, who went above and beyond to make our visit extra memorable. She was warm, attentive, and genuinely caring — truly one of the best service staff we’ve encountered in a long time. Her thoughtful service made all the difference.

Highly recommend Shin Minori for anyone looking for great food, a pleasant vibe, and amazing people in Shin Minori",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102081811500265864704/reviews
Hiang Ar,4,"The concept is quite unique, and the buffet offers an impressive variety of dishes. Despite being an all-you-can-eat experience, the seafood stood out for its freshness, and everything was prepared to order. There's even a mini steamboat and free-flowing Yakitori. One of my favorite surprises was the seaweed taco sushi—such a creative and textured twist on the traditional sushi roll. I also really enjoyed the truffle pasta; it was packed with flavor, though a bit too oily. The desserts and fruits were deliciously sweet as well.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101185220797498251612/reviews
Posh Pearl,4,"The star of the show for me was their sweet and succulent oysters. Their thick cut sashimi was fresh. Their cooked food is rather standard fare as you would expect at this price point. Overall it’s worth it if you enjoy feasting on raw seafood.
Service wise requires some waiting time.
Atmosphere is very casual.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106728704755913363642/reviews
LY,4,"Went for their hightea buffet spread which also has an impressive variety!
Best to go in smaller groups though, as larger parties may find their orders getting mixed up. (They provided only one  QR code per group for ordering)

The space is a bit tight, but overall, great value for money (hightea menu) & definitely spoilt for choice!

And they provide ice cream far from the usual chocolate and vanilla!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106276366511187593505/reviews
EQ Xavier,5,"Visited this outlet on a public holiday eve, service is still top quality despite being full house. The buffet has many food, to which most are presented in small portions, meaning you can try the whole menu easily. Highlights are the taco items and the grilled items. The price is on the expensive range for japanese buffet but u are getting quality food and services. They clear the empty plates timely and are very professional.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105533019712721928126/reviews
