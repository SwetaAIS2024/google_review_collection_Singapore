Diana Quah,2,"The crispy prata texture is achieved by deep frying and not frying, a little bit too oily.

The dhal curry watery and salty to my preference.

Personally, I prefer crispy texture achieved by frying yet still soft to bite through.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116232453288130898977/reviews
Paul Gallagher,4,"plain prata is crispy, no joke! Slightly oily as a result, but comes with a fish curry that hides this with a nice tang. Definitely come back to try other menu items.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117145608649017960128/reviews
Will Tan,5,"Came here for the crispy prata, got exactly what it says, probably one of the most crispy prata I had. For the egg prata, it can't be made crispy but is not bad either, curry is however average. Reasonably priced, 2 plain prata for $2.6, egg prata at $2.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102407587022102569954/reviews
JC,4,"First time buying from this stall. Got the Indian rojak and it was delicious. Sauce is also thick and tasty, lots of onions and green chillies too. Will try the prata next time.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105403312120201214630/reviews
iati jo,5,"Hot fresh prata that is cooked upon ordering. Not the crispy kind but thatâ€™s alright, i like it this way too. Curry pairs up well with the prata.

A halal option for Muslim parents who send their kids to the nearby religious classes.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104351636616993949538/reviews
