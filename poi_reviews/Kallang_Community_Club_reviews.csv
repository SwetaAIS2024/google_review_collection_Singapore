SuSian Hon,5,"We had to update Singpass access for my mother-in-law. She is elderly and bed-ridden. Madam Faisal from the CC (hope we have the correct spelling for her name) was extremely kind and helpful, both when we called to enquire and when we were at the CC.

Wei Jiun Lim,5,"Convenient courts for badminton! The place was clean, and easy to find. Patrons are respectful, and ended their sessions at the allotted time, no additional admin process required. One minor downside, is the spot lighting above the courts can make it hard to see the shuttlecocks flying through the air. The toilets are passable, but not the best for changing in/out of sports wear.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110661475370204868060/reviews
