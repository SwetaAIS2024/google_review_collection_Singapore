Yvonne Khoo,5,"Attended by staff named Ms Joy Yeo and Ms Rui Jing on 12-07-2024.

They both were very helpful in telling me how best to proceed with my cashier's order.

They went the extra miles to assist my corcern and escalated to the branch at Hougang to save me making another trip from Buangkok to Tampines.

Their dedication professionalism & willingness to go to the extra miles were truly commendable & made a significant positive impact on my experience.
