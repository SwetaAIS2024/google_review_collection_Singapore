Tracking showed delivering at 9pm. Showed the vehicle moving then it was supposedly delivered at 9.10pm but NOTHING arrived! What the heck is going on! Absolutely BULLSHIT!!! Is this how things are done? Are you scamming people? Do something or have the guts to contact us to explain! I paid $85 for no delivery?",
