The sashimi platter was fresh and thick cut (worth it!), the kani gratin was so good, spicy salmon don was delicious, mentaiko rosti was tasty and their kushiyakis were üëçüèº (except pork belly slightly drier and not fatty enough ü§≠)\nReally enjoyed the dishes a lot and we were beyond full as we over ordered - we left with satisfied happy bellies.\n\nStaff were attentive and friendly as well. Will definitely return again to try other food. Recommended and thumbs up!",

It was very worth it, tried so many different kinds of sake, from the hot ones such as junmai to daiginjo to doboroku.\nThe staff were friendly, and willing to explain the art behind the sake brewery and its food pairing as well.\nI ordered some food items including skewers and the oden, pretty decent food. Crowd was great and it wasn‚Äôt too packed for the event. I was glad to be able to bring home the special event sake cup and also a tote bag.",

The other dishes, like the eggplant, spicy salmon don, and oden, were also delicious, making for a well-rounded and satisfying meal. Would recommend to my friends :)",
