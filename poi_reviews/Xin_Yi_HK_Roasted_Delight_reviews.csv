Terry Teo,1,"At the coffeeshop in Verasamy branch. Bought a roasted duck rice at 5pm for $8. Asked the Chinese gentleman why such a price despite not published on the price board.

Took place in June. Death stare given instead. I just paid and went off, didnt wanna stage any argument. Dishonest place. Do not go during off peak. Rip off.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109852882407830688657/reviews
