Alan Gan,5,"Located in the area around Changi Business Park, the restaurant serves mainly sandwiches and coffee. There is a crowd during peak hours, so there will be a queue.

There is an area for dining in. A bit narrow like many restaurants in Singapore, but still quite a number of small tables.

Service was smooth. The order taken at the cashier, and go back to the back to collect your order. They give you a paper bag to pack the sandwich if you order takeaway. The sandwich is quickly done up.

The smokin’ pulled pork (with multi-grain bread) tastes great. The homemade coleslaw goes well with the taste of the shredded pork making it a flavourful experience. Portion size is good, enough to fill one with an average appetite up.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102159735720042737505/reviews
Nicole Yang,4,"it's the place to go when im looking for something that feels healthier and lighter when im in the area. usually like to get the grain bowls with a good quantity of protein. you can build one yourself and select the grains, protein, carbs you want. taste is pretty ok! main gripe is it can be on the pricey side (this was $14.50) and quantity can vary depending on who is serving. overall still good and will come back for sure! sandwiches are pretty good too (but again in $10-$12) range.

add on: salmon fish is like half of a standard portion so it's not too much. not ideal if you are a bigger eater.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107660172885999064218/reviews

Evelyn Poh,5,"I ordered the Chicken & Salmon Grain Bowl from Knead to Eat for our Leadership Meeting, and it was an absolute revelation.

The bowl began with a base of perfectly cooked brown rice and salad providing a hearty yet light foundation.  This combination is ideal for anyone looking to feel full and energized without the heaviness of traditional grains.  The toppings were thoughtfully chosen and generously layered.  The dressing was packed separately.  It was the perfect drizzle to enhance the freshness of the chicken/salmon, vegetables and the grains.

The Grain Bowl was a perfect combination of texture, flavor, and nourishment. It was light yet satisfying, healthy yet indulgent, and every bite left me feeling both satisfied and energized. Whether you're looking for a filling lunch or a wholesome dinner, this bowl is a fantastic choice that doesn’t compromise on taste. It’s clear that every ingredient was chosen with care, making it one of the best grain bowls I’ve ever had. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a flavorful, vibrant meal that nourishes the body and soul.  Everyone love it.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113758821919476189931/reviews
