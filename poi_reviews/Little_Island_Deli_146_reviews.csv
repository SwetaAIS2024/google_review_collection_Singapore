Flo Yeow,1,"It's one of the food and drink booths at Kallang Stadium, and it's honestly extremely underwhelming. Given that they seemingly use part time employees, the entire process was very haphazard, and it felt very much like a school canteen.

The cashiers weren't very friendly or familiar with their devices, when the menu is already so short. I had difficulty telling them I wanted my Cabernet Sauvignon, because they only know it as red wine. Given the huge markup that I'm already paying, and to have such an experience, is unacceptable.

In any case, given that I'm rarely here, and that there are many other stalls all around the stadium anyways, it's fine.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
MC SM,5,The place for COLD drinks! Kudos to the service crew for the efficiency in clearing the massive line of patrons. They even let us know which drinks are iced cold and which are not cold yet so we can make better decisions.
