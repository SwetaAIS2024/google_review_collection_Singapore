      "text": "I walked past this stall multiple times but brushed them off as just another tze char stall. However, I found out recently that they are THE ORIGINAL 香港街珍记, and that made me want to try the food, as growing up, there were multiple places naming themselves as such, and one was near my place. These were shops opened by their ex chefs after they became famous.\n\nWe ordered fried prawn rolls, prawn paste chicken, spinach with bean curd skin and san lou hor fun (total $53). We didn't have to wait long for the food.\n\nOnly the prawn paste chicken was decent. The prawn rolls were nothing extraordinary. The biggest disappointment was the san lou hor fun as there was no wok hei at at. Actually, while writing this review, I'm struggling to remember if it was even hot when served.\n\nI had hoped to experience some old school delights, but I left with only disappointment.",

The flavors were bold and tantalizing, making it a truly memorable experience.  The other dishes we ordered were above average.  While I'm still eager to try the elusive Song fish head, the Calypot grouper has certainly compensated for the disaapointed.",
