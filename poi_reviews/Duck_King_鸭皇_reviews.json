Friendly boss asked us if we wanted the head when we ordered whole duck and gave a large bowl of soup.\nRoast pork crispy skin is the highlight, charsiew is the well marbled heavily sauced rich sticky kind but could have been charred a little more.\nNoodles were just ok, had some pork lard bits but were otherwise a little too plain and under seasoned.",
