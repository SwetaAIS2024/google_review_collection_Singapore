      "text": "I stopped by Eat. at HarbourFront on a public holiday and ordered the laksa set (which came with tea) and the curry chicken chop rice. The pricing felt fair for the quality nothing exceptional, but decent enough for a quick meal. However, the public holiday rush seemed to stretch their staff thin. It was hard not to notice the leftover plates stacking up on nearby tables, spilling over due to delays in clearing. This understandably affected the overall dining atmosphere.",

Added more chili but the chili and vinegar are pre mixed hence you cannot add too much or it’ll be very sour. Hope management can look into QC-ing the quality of food.",

Shouldn't treat your customer so rudley especially to elderly!Management should give training and give warning to these 2 men.",

It’s a reliable choice when I’m unsure what to eat. This time, I ordered their dry mee pok. The flavor is decent, and the portion is just right. The fishballs are chewy and relatively big, although the toppings are minimal. The overall taste of the mee pok is light and not overwhelming.\n\nThe Teochew fishball soup is another dish I tried. The fishballs have a nice texture and a distinct meaty flavor, served simply in broth without additional ingredients. The broth itself is flavorful enough to be enjoyed on its own.\n\nStrangely, when I alternated between bites of mee pok and sips of the fishball soup, the mee pok seemed to lose some of its appeal afterward. Maybe the simplicity of the soup overshadowed it.\n\nA dependable stop for simple, hearty meals.\n\n(๑>؂•̀๑)\n- 𝙎𝙞𝙣𝙟𝙤𝙛 ⋆౨ৎ˚⟡˖ ࣪",
