Shu Zhe Ng,5,Great place to gather with friends and family. Awesome food and service! The place could be a little hot and humid at times. Definitely will go again for catchup on occasion! Highly recommended.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107333158713312587720/reviews
Tin Maung Htay,5,"All the food were great, the atmosphere is also not bad. No smoke, no smell and can enjoy skewers. Great locations, after drinking and eating,  MRT and bus interchange are just beside the shop, no need to walk long distance to get to public transport.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100870946901727610993/reviews
WQ,5,"Food was cooked better than other branches I have visited, not so chao ta. Service was very attentive, helping to refill drinks so often. Staff was also open about discounts available and even reminded us when the discount timing has reached to order the food. Atmosphere was not noisy, allowing you to have a good conversation with your dining partners. No1 among the branches in my opinion.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109082683437014320705/reviews
Angel Cheong,5,"Super love the cumin flavoured beef and lamb. The beef is super tender, beef tendon is superb!  The squid tentacles very crunchy and tenderness is just right! My new found favourite is the lamb ribs!!! üòçüòç Á∫¢Ê≤πÊäÑÊâã spiciness is just nice and not very numbing or ma la.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106414060291768557647/reviews
Cristina Camilon,2,Ordered in foodpanda 3 pork skewers and 3 beef skewers. But what arrived is a box with meat inside which we don‚Äôt know what kind of meat. Also those meat had holes so meaning they were with sticks but for some reason the skewers were removed from the sticks then was put in the box. We didn‚Äôt eat to be on safe side. Reported in foodpanda and was given a refund but not really why it happened. The chicken gizzard and chicken skewers were ok.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115963973558817093089/reviews
