Service wasn't great - took quite a while and had to ask for our rice like 3x. But would go back again to try the other food on the menu",

The Signature Lemongrass Pork is a must-have dish for us. The Garlic Baby Kailan was fresh and green. The Signature Minced Meat Beancurd was different from their Yishun branch (if my memory serves me correctly) but good nevertheless. The price is reasonable for the food quality and service. Recommended.",
