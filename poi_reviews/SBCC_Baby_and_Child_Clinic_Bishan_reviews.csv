ros,5,"First time visiting SBCC Bishan yesterday and I must say it was such a great experience with Dr Adeline Wong and staff!

Apart from the long waiting time, which I understand can‚Äôt really be avoided, the staff were really nice and attentive. Dr Adeline Wong is really cheerful and pleasant to speak with too! She did made my husband and I feel like we‚Äôre speaking to a friend that was advising and encouraging me in my breastfeeding journey, not just talking about the issues our baby was facing.

What was really good was how she took the time to listen and explain too. It was not rushed at all- so i understand the long waiting time but i think it‚Äôs really worth it because we felt heard, seen and definitely left feeling encouraged despite it being a pediatric appointment for our infant.

Thank you Dr Wong & team! üôèüèº",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114121392681044610049/reviews
Veronika Sie,5,"Dr.Adeline is very experienced, patient and always gives the best solutions for my 3 years old son sickness. One-time visit will solve my son's issue. The nurses are also friendly and experienced. Although the waiting time can be up 1.5 hours, i think is worth waiting for!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101434489315523950138/reviews

Andy Teo,1,"Seriously don't understand the need to wait for 2hours plus to see the so called Dr Wong with rave reviews only to enter her room and got out in less than 3min.. without much examination of my son down with stomach flu...

No eye contact at all when talking and nothing much was explained.. Attitude was definitely less than stellar... Perhaps we got her on a wrong day when she's not in a gd mood and her fees are expensive... Should have listened to my sister n visit the other clinic nearby instead. Unprofessional.
