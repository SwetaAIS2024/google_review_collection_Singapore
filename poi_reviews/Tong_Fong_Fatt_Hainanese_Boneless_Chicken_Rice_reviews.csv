Yong Jian Rong,5,"Had a good experience ordering with the auntie, unlike the reviews below. Generous portion even for $4+1 for the gizzards. She assumed it was takeaway but later switch to eat-in when I told her.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104663836323476662669/reviews
Kevin,5,"I always order the roasted chicken rice here, never lets me down. The food is always consistent.

Honestly shocked by the number of bad reviews. As a sgporean who grew up eating chicken rice, i can say it is one of the best tasting, the chicken, sauce and rice. It is probably of the location that is why customers expect a 5 star service. As someone who also grew up with markets, hawkers and food centres, i understand the service provided and have no issues with it. After all, i come to a food centre to expect good affordable delicious food, and not for great service.

Thanks for the amazing roasted chicken rice as usual team!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111728619290387518013/reviews
M WONG,1,"If the boss is reading this, the lady you‚Äôve employed is not worth the salary you are employing her for. I would not return purely because of her.
When asked how much a portion of chicken is (without rice), she points at the wordy board and say Prices all stated, look at it yourself - ironically it didn‚Äôt state what I wanted.

When I say I want 1 person portion of chicken (only) she asks big or small.
When I say big, she then asks $7 or $8.
I didn‚Äôt know a 1 person portion then has so many sub categories to choose from.
What is the difference ? She didn‚Äôt answer.

When the kind uncle inside asks which part of chicken I want, she shushes him up before I can answer. ‚ÄúJust give anything‚Äù she said to him.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116593582811301855341/reviews
Ivy Tan,1,"My 2nd time ordering this chicken rice. I ordered a plate of chicken rice and the lady asked if I want a small or big plate. I told her small plate will do. She collected $4 from me and the next moment she informed me that she left with only ‚Äòji wei‚ÄôÈ∏°Â∞æ.

She told me it is near the thigh and it will cost $7. I was very hungry so I just go ahead with her suggestion. I gave her another $3, hoping that she didn‚Äôt cheat me.

The next day, I went back to the hawker centre and realised that chicken drumstick is $5. I wonder where did this $7 come from???

Well, this lady obviously dishonest and has no integrity. Definitely will not patronise this store again! I would love to give them a zero star if Google allows.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100772218016157718360/reviews
