She goes above and beyond to ensure the best for every child. Her patience and compassion are unmatched, and she has a way of putting both children and parents at ease during stressful times.

Anne Alcantara,2,"Here my honest review about this clinic, I wish I can give  Doctor Chua 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ but Google only rate overall for the clinic. Doctor Chua was an amazing Doctor! He's the best compare all the pedia i go before (like a lot ), I have met lots of Paediatrician already , Is just I have compare Doctor Chua  as a very kind doctor and have a very big patience to all your queries he will let you feel comfortable too!

Ok I give 2 star because of the receptionist. The one who always do the billing (especially) she is rude. She don't like repeating questions ,she will show irritated face at you which is so rude. Well I never say anything until I go back again bring my child and here she is again she's just so irritated. I don't think she fits this job , if you don't have patience then at least act nice . I can't just control my self not to review.

Doctor Chua still the best.

Except their reception.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112662424730852918810/reviews
