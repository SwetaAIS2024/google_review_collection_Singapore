Aspen Kuro,5,"Really cool store filled with traditional toys and memorabilia! They often update their shop too with new in trend character toys or even robots and nerf guns, darts and more. You can even go there for last minute gifts or seasonal decorations. The store owners are a really sweet and friendly old couple. A true gem in a quiet neighborhood.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108176380472011047924/reviews
