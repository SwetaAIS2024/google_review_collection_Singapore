Professional teachers and staff: done Haruka and Maeâ€™s sound bath/meditation sessions and absolutely love the therapeutic effects. Highly recommend this place.",

It was a calming & peaceful session and the space was relaxing & cozy. Haruka's very friendly & approachable , she makes you feel so welcomed. Don't be surprised to find yourself falling asleep for awhile during her session ,that's normal and i meant in a good way :)  I'd recommend this place to anyone looking to learn some breathing techniques and apply in your daily life.",

She leads the session with her peaceful and beautiful voice, I could almost imagine myself in vast pasture during the session. I've returned for more sessions and will definitely be doing more here.",
