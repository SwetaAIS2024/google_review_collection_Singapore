Nyjer Seam,5,"If you prefer a PD who takes his time with your child and goes beyond what's required, then Dr Low is the PD for you. He doesn't rush his checks, checks for other problems and, he's the kind of Dr who calls you personally whenever he can to explain the medical results instead of the clinic nurses.

But there's a downsize to all of this - Since he treats all his patients the same, the waiting time is long. Unfortunately if this deters you, then you will really miss out on this rare A-Class service and expertise.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102751275309038599637/reviews
Juls Lim,5,"Dr Low has been our daughter’s PD since birth and we are always grateful for his care and concern. He has very good bedside manners and is always gentle, calm and steady. Although this might be misconstrued by some kiasu parents as “not caring enough”, his demeanour can be said to stem from his years of experience.

I remember when my child at 4mths had high fever and her skin turned blue, as first time parents, we were freaking out. However Dr Low was calm and collected and assessed the situation thoroughly. He did a pre-diagnosis of UTI and referred us to KKH. True enough it was really UTI and the KKH staff did not waste time in treating it.

The clinic staff and nurses are also superb, often showing genuine care for my daughter. They are quick to go above and beyond to provide additional help as well. For e.g our UTI case, we rushed out of the house to see Dr Low and forgot to bring our swaddle. The nurses promptly offered it to us, which was a lifesaver as it kept my daughter comforted to KKH.

Overall, I would recommend Dr Low for his deep expertise, experience and knowledge, in addition to the genuine care and concern from him and his staff. If you are a kiasu/kiasi parent that is unable to manage expectations and prefers a doctor who can mirror your kiasu/kiasi-ness, then this PD is not for you. If you are someone who is able to trust a highly experienced doctor who knows what he is doing albeit being more relaxed and calm, then this PD is for you.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107974597416598398187/reviews
Natasha Angeline,5,"Dr Low has a good bedside manner, relax and love children. He also detailed and meticulous in assessing my child’s health. He’s my child’s NICU doctor and he followed up with me personally.

A suggestion is to add a changing table at the clinic since it’s a child clinic.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111976671966649747872/reviews
eileen lin,5,"My first child has been under Dr Low's care since her birth 5++ years ago, with the recommendation from my gynaecologist. Subsequently, I also entrusted my 2nd child into Dr Low's care.

Dr Low is a gentle, soft spoken, highly experienced, patient, skillful doctor and has a subtle sense of humour. His preferred language seems to be English but he's fluent in Mandarin as well.

Regardless of how fussy or cranky the child is, Dr Low knows how to conduct diagnose on the child swiftly, and has ways to get the baby / child's attention, saying ""check, check!"" (my elder girl likes to imitate this), ""bye bye"" etc in his way.

A meticulous and attentive doctor, he's always patient when listening to parents' description of symptoms and concerns, jotting down what he hears, as well as his diagnosis.

Sometimes when visits are a bit too often due to newborn stage (aka parents insecurity) or some lingering symptoms, Dr Low is also willing to provide professional advice over a phone call.

When conditions require involvement of other specialists, Dr Low makes reliable recommendation of specialists that are specifically for and good with children as well.

Dr Low is often sought to provide PD advice on the local media (articles, live interviews) in English and Chinese Language.

Though the Google reviews seems limited, the clinic is almost always crowded everyday. The number of front desk staff has increased from 2 to 3 over the years. They're calm, professional and caring when handling parents.

Over the years, Dr Low and his staff have rendered a lot of support to my children, and a warm, family kind of relationship has been established, the same goes for many of his long time patients.

Anson International Paediatric & Child Development Clinic is definitely a clinic you can trust and depend on!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113816794947803126276/reviews
