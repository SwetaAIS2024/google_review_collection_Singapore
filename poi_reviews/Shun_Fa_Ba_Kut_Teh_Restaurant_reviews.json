Pig stomach pieces had the right texture. The sesame black chicken was very nice.\nPrices were reasonable and affordable.\nIt's air-con but noise can be loud because of the hard floor and paneling. Service was prompt and efficient.\nWhen requested, because I'd no cash on me, propiretor HUANG BIN consented to TnG transfer which was great",

It came out sizzling hot, the soup broth was herby but not too strong flavour and just the right level of saltiness.  This was the first time I tried authentic bak kut teh as i have tried other versions too and now I know the difference and this was way better.\n\nThe place is also got comfortable seating and quite spacious.",
