      "text": "A Solid Halal Chicken Rice Option, But with Room for Improvement\n\nIt‚Äôs rare to find a good halal chicken rice, and Edmond‚Äôs certainly stands out as one of the better options I‚Äôve tried. However, it does fall short of the high standards set by other Hainanese chicken rice stalls. If you plan to visit, be sure to arrive early to avoid the long queues and the possibility of them running out of chicken.\n\nThe set is great value, offering generous portions of vegetables, rice, and chicken. The roasted chicken is juicy and flavorful, the vegetables are well-seasoned, and the soup even comes with two wanton dumplings‚Äîa nice touch. However, the rice was overcooked, which was disappointing given the quality of the rice brand used. It also lacked the rich flavor typically associated with this dish.\n\nOverall, while there‚Äôs room for improvement, Edmond‚Äôs offers a satisfying meal for those seeking halal chicken rice.",
