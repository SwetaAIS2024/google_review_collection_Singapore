Rise&Shine,5,Fragrant Briyani rice with chicken $7. Very generous portions. Be prepared for a long queue here.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112934659764529579482/reviews
YH J,5,"Went for dinner at 7+ and there was still a short queue. Got the plain thosai - had been left out for a while and was cold but still flavourful. Towards the sour side, which I liked. Could eat it plain if I wanted to. Dips were also room temperature but decent. Would come back again.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110082210226531439831/reviews
Pal. Raj,1,"Hi,

Today afternoon (21-09-2024), I bought Meal with Mutton Intestine and chicken fry parcel, total cost $10.50 they charged, when i reach and ate the mutton totally no salt... really very sad, you people are charged so much but even your never taste it before serve to customer, it does not cheap!!!

when you're in hungry, if totally no salt in the food how you going to eat ????? ridiculers. it's about $10.50.

My strong recommendation to everyone, don't take parcel from this place.  if you want to eat just eat there. stupid people never taste before serving, and also charging too expensive...

Thanks,",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102674108147404448576/reviews
