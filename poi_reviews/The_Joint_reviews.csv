Isaac Sim,5,"Came here for drinks on a Friday night and it was almost full, which shows how popular this place is, and I can see why.

The drinks were quite tasty, but what really sold it for me was how friendly everyone was. The bartenders took turns to talk to us, to make us feel welcome, even though they were busy making the drinks. Would definitely visit this bar again to chill if I have the chance! Good vibes indeed!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115087478880471995378/reviews
amber wenxuan,5,"Amazing vibes hidden from the crowd, known for their ""kecapmanis burger"" of which I sadly did not get to try but seems to be really raved upon. The whisky choices here really impressed me. Been to several whisky bars but this my my first time leaving a review because this place is worthy of one. Service is superb and you ought to try the 1430s cocktail. You might want to try your luck here with whiskey you don't commonly find outside.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102532836428093013449/reviews

HS Ng,5,A quiet bar craftily hidden in the busy streets of Tanjong Pagar. Reckon no one will interrupt you be it business or personal. Great place worth your exploration. Keep the eyes on a black door entrance lest miss the authentic hidden speakeasy bar.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105521988738464956297/reviews
