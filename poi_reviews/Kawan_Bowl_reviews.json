      "text": "Having tried the main outlet at Maxwell (Danlao), I came to try this as well since this was nearer to where I stayed at. I was a little disappointed that there isn't the same egg and tomato dish that is available at Maxwell.\n\nHowever, the dishes are quite well done. My friend and I were served quickly too. I ordered the scrambled eggs with luncheon meat while my friend ordered the panggang chicken dish over a crispy omelette. The food court can get quite crowded even on a weekday dinner time and there was a queue forming as I ate my meal, so do expect to wait at usual meal times.",

      "text": "Absolutely delightful scrambled egg rice with satay chicken and beef rendang. Personally preferred the satay gravy more as the taste is precisely on point! Will surely frequent this again.\n\n1 star for improvement to allow the addition of vege as side dish. Sadly they ran out of wraps at night. Also, the staff looked pretty lost when taking and making orders - i think they are still new and orientating.",

Not to mention the sweet yet spicy sambal. Amazing bowl of rice. Definitely recommend.\n\nThe sambal definitely packs a punch for those that cannot stand the heat. Do take note!",

Also the cashier gave me a sample of their taliwang chicken and it was good as well but the sambal is not for the weak ü•µ their homemade chili oil is the bombs ! Would buy a whole jar of they sell it HEHEH 10/10 also the silken tofu egg is so silky and runny just the perfect texture I LOVE IT ! The price is so reasonable heheheh definitely gg back again and hopefully overtime the taste doesnt change üôè",

(bonus: it‚Äôs halal certified!)\n\nwe went at around 4pm on a saturday afternoon and the place was not so crowded, so we received our food quite fast! the cashier was also friendly and polite ‚ú®",
