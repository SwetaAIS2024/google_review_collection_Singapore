But the killer was the extremely tight spacing between guests, led to space issues and particular group beside me kept looking over when their space felt threatened. Generally just bad environment and experience but food saved it.\n\nThe service here was amazing! This lady was so nice to help us and explain things to us slowly!",

      "text": "This is my first time trying Bangkok Street Mookata at Toa Payoh. They're located in a coffee shop setting like most other branches. If you go late, there's actually a queue because the coffee shop is quite crowded and a lot of people don't eat Mookata, there's a variety of other food.\n\nAnyway we ordered the 4 pax set with additional meat dishes which came up to around $60+ which is quite decent. I wasn't super full but I guess it was also due to the slowness of cooking. I won't blame them but it's because we chose a seat under the big a$$ fan so the wind was strong and even though they had a skirting around the fire, it  affected the fire enough till the soup never really boiled the whole time we were there. So if you want a strong fire,don't sit under the giant fans.\n\nThe meat were all nicely marinated, although I didn't really like the beef very much, but it's just me because my friends liked it. The soup was also nicely flavoured. I'd say overall it was a good experience and I would come back again in future",
