小辣椒,1,Can 261 hire a better driver? Everyone is the same. 261 only walks 8/9 stops and it is very slow every time. Then the bus is very deliberate every time. People have to run to get there. The bus deliberately closes the door quickly. My friend said on the bus that the driver looked in the rear mirror and quickly closed the door when he saw us running. He was really very intentional. What kind of quality! It turns very fast when turning! Is it because the driver is in a hurry or is it us? I will definitely take a photo of the license plate next time!,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103073716424807489401/reviews
