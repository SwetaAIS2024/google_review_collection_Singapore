      "text": "Extremely Poor Service and Queue Management\n—————-\n\nSu\n\nDisappointing and Poorly Managed Service\n\nI arrived at 9:00 AM and it’s now 10:51 AM—and I’m still waiting. When I got there, the staff directed me to queue at the video teller, saying I could both withdraw money and get a replacement for my lost passbook there. However, the staff assisting with the video teller couldn’t help and quickly referred me to another staff member at the entrance who was managing the queue numbers.\n\nHe asked me to wait while he went inside. About 5 minutes later, I was handed my new passbook. When I explained that I also needed to withdraw money from my trust fund (which was part of the reason I came in the first place), he told me I had to requeue again for that.\n\nSeriously?\n\nI stood my ground and said I wasn’t going to queue all over again when I’d already made it clear from the beginning that I was there for two services. Instead of helping, he rudely replied that I “should’ve said so in the first place.” Right… I had already explained my request to three different staff members by then. He just hand me a queue ticket and walk off.\n\nI’ve already been standing for nearly two hours. The queue stretches all the way to the door, and now am I supposed to be looking at another two-hour wait? Embarrassingly, I got a seat in the priority area  which is meant for elderly this time, because my back is killing me after standing for so long— now it’s been 45 minutes and still not my turn.\n\nThe whole system feels disorganized and inefficient in this branch. Making customers wait this long and queue multiple times for related services is just unacceptable.\n\nPS : staff Camy is extremely polite helpful and nice though so it’s a ⭐️just for her.",

Each time they told me the issue was fixed, but weeks have passed and it's still not updated. Very disappointed with the lack of follow-through and resolution. Wasting my time. Totally took 5 hours to queue for nothing. Suck",

      "text": "I am writing to express my concern regarding an unpleasant encounter I had during my recent visit on 02 May 2025.\n\nAt the entrance, I approached the staff for assistance but was met with rude and abrupt behavior from an Indian staff member — her nametag was Arumugam (spelling may be incorrect). She raised her voice at me, cut me off immediately, and did not give me a chance to even explain what I needed. Her conduct was unprofessional and left me feeling dismissed and disrespected.\n\nFortunately, a Chinese lady whom I believe is a manager noticed the situation and came over to assist. She was calm, polite, and helpful, ensuring that I received a queue number and proper guidance. I sincerely appreciate her professionalism and support.\n\nI hope this feedback will be taken seriously. All frontline staff should uphold a basic standard of courtesy and respect, as they represent the first impression of your institution.\n\nThank you for your attention.",

      "text": "I visited this branch to update my account name. It took 30 minutes of standing in line just to get a queue number and another 1.5 hours to be called. I waited very patiently until their queue system suddenly assigned two numbers—1099 and 1102 (mine)—to the same counter (Counter 2).\n\nI also noticed my number on the side of the screen, which said, \"Please speak to our staff for assistance.\" When I approached a staff member for help, she told me I had missed my queue. I told her it couldn’t be because the person with number 1099 was still being served at Counter 2. She said okay and instructed me to wait at the same counter while 1099 was being attended to.\n\nWhen I approached Counter 2, the staff member, whose name was Puspa, I believe, questioned why I was standing there. I explained that another staff member had directed me to wait there. To my surprise, Puspa raised her voice and insisted that I had missed my queue, asking the service staff to reassign me a new number. I couldn’t understand how I could have missed my turn when 1099 was still being served.\n\nThe service staff seemed confused. She offered to help find another available counter to assist but disappeared. Fortunately, another staff member—an older, very helpful lady—stepped in and just reissued a new queue number for me, and I only had to wait for four more numbers before it was my turn.\n\nThis review would have been 1 star because of unprofessional behaviour and lack of courtesy at Counter 2. However, the friendly and efficient service from the staff member at Counter 3 helped salvage my experience.\n\nI strongly suggest improving coordination between the counter and service staff to avoid such confusion in the future.\n\nAdditionally, all staff should be reminded to treat customers with respect, as they have outlined by the signs displayed on the counters to treat staff with respect too.",
