Bunny 馋兔食光,5,"The handmade dumplings are made fresh every day, with thin skin and generous fillings, and are delicious and juicy. The flavor choices are diverse and very distinctive.

Black gold fish roe, egg yolk and fresh shrimp dumplings, fresh shrimps with egg yolk and fish roe, moderate saltiness and solid taste.

Fresh meat, corn and cheese dumplings, with the sweetness of corn and a hint of cheese, the taste is rich and not greasy.

The overall taste is good, if you like handmade dumplings, you can try it! It's a pity that I went there late and the cold dishes were sold out, so I have to go there next time😭",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114912626167050394621/reviews
張紫琳,5,"Recently, I finally found a clean and delicious handmade dumpling in Johor Bahru. I really recommend it to everyone! 🥟✨

📍 Four Seasons Dumplings features a transparent open kitchen, where you can see the entire production process, freshly packed and cooked, clean and safe!

This time I ordered fresh meat, organic leek dumplings and chicken and mushroom dumplings. They were super big and the skin was elastic and not easy to break. When you bite into them, they will really burst with juice! 🔥 The leeks are fragrant but not overpowering, the chicken and shiitake mushrooms are fresh and sweet but not greasy, it’s really good! 💯

The braised food platter is also a must-try, it tastes super delicious and paired with a cup of Coke, it’s the perfect way to relieve your boredom! 🥤🥢
