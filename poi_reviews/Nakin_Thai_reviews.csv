Cheng Han Chua,5,"A short walk away from West Coast Plaza with plenty of parking.

The prices of this Thai Food in a coffee shop is fair. The spicy lime fish and the fried pork collar are a must order!

Their basil pork rice and kang kong are nice too!

Will be coming back!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117114158221155370806/reviews
Gooose,5,Good and affordable Thai food in a kopitiam. I particularly liked the fried pork collar it was crispy and meat was fatty and not dry. Phad Thai had good wok hei. The stall has a wide variety of dishes and will definitely go back to try out their other dishes.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112758192712209103259/reviews
Jason Ong,5,"One of the best Thai food I have had in a coffee shop. This unassuming stall serves delicious and authentic Thai food that is wallet friendly.
I have been there several times, and this time, being a quiet evening, our food was delivered to our table. The Tom Yum Soup was tasty and not overly spicy, just nice. One of my favourite dishes is the Crab Fried Rice, which is enough for 2. The Prawn Cakes were excellent too.
When we couldn't finish our food, they were nice enough to pack the food up for us to bring home, and after packing everything nicely including chilli sauce, they brought them back to our table. Really great service. Highly recommended.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101337983538091125134/reviews
Pei Ni Richael Chua,5,"The highlight of the meal was this super tender and flavorful steamed seabass! The tangy lime, fragrant herbs and slight spiciness was perfect. I also really liked the crispy fried pork with garlic. The mango sticky rice was so good too! Highly recommend this spot",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117508775223353682297/reviews
