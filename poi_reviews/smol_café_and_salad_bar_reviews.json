      "text": "I had the pleasure of dining at Smol Café & Salad Bar, and it was nothing short of delightful! I tried the Salmon Says and Make No Misteak, and both dishes left a lasting impression.\n\nThe Salmon Says was an absolute standout. The salmon was perfectly cooked—crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. Paired with their vibrant and fresh salad, the dish was well-balanced, light, and flavorful. The combination of textures and the tangy dressing brought everything together beautifully.\n\nThe Make No Misteak was equally impressive. The steak was cooked to perfection—tender, flavorful, and juicy, just the way I like it. The accompaniments elevated the dish, with the greens adding a refreshing crunch and the dressing tying it all together.\n\nWhat I loved most about Smol Café is the attention to detail and the focus on fresh, quality ingredients. The cozy atmosphere and friendly service make it a spot I’ll definitely return to. Whether you’re craving something healthy or indulgent, Smol Café is a must-visit!",
