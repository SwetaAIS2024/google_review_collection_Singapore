Bee Wei,4,"Ordered the curry chicken lunch set. Was not bad. Quite generous with the portions as it also came with a drink and a curry puff.  There were 2 sides to this place. One is standard ""takeaway-concept"" stall u will commonly see outside. The other is a retro-designed restaurant. Service was efficient. Once you place the order, wait for your number and collect your own food. Please remember to clean up after you eat. Overall good experience. I wouldn't mind eating here again.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109752934941241453584/reviews
Max Tan,1,The smell of reused oil stench is so strong. This shop should be banned from changi airport. Most horrible OCK that I ever tasted,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112309095195912631544/reviews
jazmine miralles,5,Was craving their curry empanada and came across this store. First time trying Old Change Kee and it was delicious. Cravings were satisfied and you get a good sized empanada for $2. Definitely would come again.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115517790936101966570/reviews
Sten (Piqued Wanderer),5,"Nothing short of being awed.

The food is as what you would expect BUT the decoration of the whole place is exquisitely retro. And i really a blast from tge past.

There are 2 sides to this place. One is d standard ""takeaway-concept"" stall u will commonly see outside. D other, is a retro-designed restaurant. Lets talk more bout d restaurant since it is one of a kind.

When u step, you will need to order via d self-service kiosk. Follow d instructions carefully ya.. next is to wait for ur food. We are actually amazed at how the old, current n past is incorporated into 1 place. Well, OCK has outdone itself again!

Congrats and well done OCK!!
