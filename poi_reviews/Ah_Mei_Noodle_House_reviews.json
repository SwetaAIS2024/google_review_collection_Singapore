Exactly same taste as what we had back in random Kuching HC. Char siew and braised mince meat was delicious. Overall not overpowering, not too bland, not oily and this is the right taste we miss. Simple yet flavourful. One mouthful of it bursting with memory of Kuching!!\n\nWe will be back for the laksa.\n\nüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã",
