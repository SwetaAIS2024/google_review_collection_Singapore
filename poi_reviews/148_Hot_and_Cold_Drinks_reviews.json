The brewing of local coffee looks simple but somehow the outcome is never the same and hinges on many factors including TLC that is put into brewing the coffee. The coffee here has that nice coffee aroma and punch (and it is not a given as many places are just bitter and missing that coffee aroma). I read the toast and egg here is good which I will definitely be back to try them.",

Frankly, I would prefer to have it with sugar and or milk.\n\nStill good lah, cause I can still drink it even without sugar.\n\n80 cents for a cup of black coffee is very cheap already.",
