Shazia Shaikh,5,"I got to know of Cathy through two of my friends who highly recommended her, and I am so glad I took their advice. True enough, Cathy is an absolute gem of an agent. From the very beginning, she took time to understand our family's needs and recommended a helper who fits in perfectly with us. Her experience and intuition in matching the right helper to the right home is truly impressive. What sets Cathy apart is her dedication that goes beyond just completing the hiring process - she continues to assist even after everything is finalized. She's always ready to help, clarify and even communicate with the helper to avoid any misunderstandings. Her helpful nature, professionalism and genuine care make her someone I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. Thank you, Cathy, for making the entire process so smooth and reassuring!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103692966976389929986/reviews

Muhammad Afiq,5,"A quick search for a maid agency listed JL Recruitment with positive reviews.

Me and my wife walked in, got in touch with Cathy, and wasn't turned away. In fact, she immediately attended to us (No other customers then) and was patient and professional throughout.
