"Hock Lye, Khaleel, CHAN",5,"A very good plate of freshly made pratas, made crispy. The winner must be the robust fish curry, not thicken by strach but from boiling fresh spices, vegetable and fish. You can tell when you find fish bones while eating the curry with the prata so, be careful.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109901583439985965302/reviews
