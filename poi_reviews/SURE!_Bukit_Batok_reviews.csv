Xing Ooi,5,"A newly opened Western food stall in the Skytech building industrial canteen features a signature chicken chop that's a must-try. The marinade is flavorful, and the meat is tender. We also ordered the breaded fish, which is crispy on the outside and soft inside. There are plenty of side options available, with new ones coming along the way. Good portion and reasonably priced. Whether you're working nearby or staying in the area, be SURE! to head over and give them a try SURE! delicious! Check out the photo for dining with a view!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108625515756709223715/reviews

Sure bo!! Sure lai liao arr!!

This new 2-month old western food stall with an interesting Singlish name piqued our curiosity. Opened by solo friendly young hawker. Right next to the popular dim sum stall.

Always like to give new hawkers a try especially those who open at industrial park. It's not easy to run a stall in industrial area as there is a limited window of business. This young man was quite daring and we like that courage.

We had chicken cutlet & chicken chop, add on any 2 sides for $6 each. Also add on curry puff and mushroom soup. Imo, that's quite reasonable.

Cooked from scratch (waited about 15 mins). Both meats are thick, cooked very well and tender inside, Cutlet batter is very crispy. beautiful sunny sideup, love the very smooth mashed potato (very different from what I’ve tasted before), mushroom soup is good too (not the canned variety) and well done onion rings (can fight fast food chains)!! 🤤

After our meal, owner asked for our opinion on the food and how to improve. Such enthusiasm. Well done!! 🫡

We will be back to support our local young hawkers!!

Pamela Lam,5,"My husband ordered takeaway for lunch from this newly opened Western food stall in the Skytech building industrial canteen! Only $6 per set, which is so reasonable considering the large portion.

We ordered their chicken chop (well marinated & tender) and breaded fish (crispy on the outside and soft inside) which were yummy😋 There are plenty of side options available, of which we chose the broccoli, raisin rice & onion rings. Highly recommended if you’re around the area!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101857651194332817338/reviews
Teo Family,5,"My wife & I shared a breaded fish c/w fries and onion rings. Also added a set of 4 chicken wings (whole). Came to $6 per person.
Food was excellent and I'd say restaurant standard. The owner was friendly even though he was very busy.
PS. Order early or be prepared for a looooong wait because it's a one man operation.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117740275475808131159/reviews
