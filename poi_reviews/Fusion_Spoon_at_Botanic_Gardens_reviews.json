      "text": "Came here thinking it was a child-friendly restaurant, especially since there’s a dedicated kids’ play area. The setup gave the impression that children could play and entertain themselves while adults enjoy their meal. But surprisingly, the staff came over to ask the kids to lower their voices—even though they weren’t being excessively loud, and the restaurant was far from full.\n\nIf you’re going to promote yourself as family-friendly, then commit to it fully. Don’t install a play area and then scold kids for using it. That’s just poor planning and sends a confusing message. Clearly not a welcoming place for families. Would not recommend this to anyone with children—and we definitely won’t be back.",

Looks and feels like a automate controlled fast food - maybe because it is a automate controlled fast food :-) You place your order on a screen, but you have also a big menu on the wall to prepare your order. Payment is only by card.\nBut the handled food (you take yourself at the Counter B, Counter A is for drinks & Beverages) is good! Tasty, good quality, nice arranged - and very affordable! You pay in average 10S$ for a good meal.",
