I walked in to the clinic this morn without calling for appointment; I thought they allow walk in, but was told by the clinic nurses that they only serve patients with appointments. However, nurse Jennie was really kind to allow me to wait to see Dr, as she saw I was in really bad condition and she knew I purposely visited them after reading all the good reviews! She even served me warm water which I really appreciate! Dr Tammy is also really kind and very motherly-like. I hope to recover soon, and I really like to thank Jennie for your kind gesture üíñ",
