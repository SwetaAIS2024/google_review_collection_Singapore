hi,5,"I visited an orthopedic surgeon for my child's injury.
Dr. Akai, the orthopedic surgeon, was very thorough in his examination and explanations, which made me feel very at ease.
It was my first time visiting a hospital overseas, so I was a little nervous, but the receptionist was very kind and helpful.
thank you very much.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104368916376990926182/reviews
uka,5,"I am receiving treatment in the pediatrics, dermatology, orthopedics, and obstetrics and gynecology departments. All the doctors are Japanese.
All the doctors are kind and listen to me with compassion. I felt that the examinations and treatment were better than those at hospitals in Japan. At the end of the examination, they always ask me if there is anything else I'm concerned about, so it's easy to ask. I'm relieved to have found such a good hospital since coming to Singapore.
They are also very good at dealing with children, which is helpful.

The pharmacist explains things in English, but the doctor explains the medicine thoroughly during the examination, so it's not a problem even if you don't understand.
There are both Japanese and local people at the reception, and they are all very nice.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106571590999232617649/reviews
A K,5,"Thank you for your help in internal medicine and orthopedics. Both teachers were kind and listened to me very well, which made me feel at ease.
The receptionists are all locals, but if you can speak simple English, I don't think you'll have any problems.
The waiting time is also acceptable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107297036518531031985/reviews
