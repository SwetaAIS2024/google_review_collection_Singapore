David Lam,1,"On the 11 Jan 2025. My first time visit this Clinic have a bad experience with Clinic Assistant. Checking with them about my company whether listed under this clinic. Inpatient reply’s and told me no the look unfriendly. I walk away from the clinic but I go back to the clinic and register. I have no choice due to very heavy rain. Waiting time for 1 hrs under one doctor on Duty.

Clinic staffs has serious problems . Hopefully can be corrected.

Finally waited for 1 hrs to see the doctor, Dr Chi was great, patient and attentive.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106007698432119196132/reviews
K.D. SHARz,1,"The staffs are friendly, lil slow but nevermind about that, the doctor was good. The thing that disappointed me was people who already left after receiving their numbers. When they come back again they are called in. For example: Patient number 19 left and now the running number is 25 and the 25th patient coming out from the treatment room, the patient number 26 waiting to go in but since patient number 19 is back he or she is called. TBH this is unfair for the people who are already waiting. If others can wait so can You and the clinic make this as a normal practice… Went for a very very bad back pain today entered the clinic between 10:40-11:00Hrs and because of this issue left the clinic almost at 13:15Hrs. Trully disappointed…",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112205230960081187821/reviews
B T,2,Bad clinic assistant that showcases biased behaviour towards patients. Came in without IC when I already had a history with the clinic (it’s been the family clinic for many years) then assistant insisted I must produce IC. Another patient came in without and she asked for name to register? I missed to register my queue two times because of the assistant’s unwillingness to help.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107438538545049825462/reviews

Each visit is a huge physical challenge for me but the nurses are always ensure me that I have a seat. I am happy now I don’t have to wait.

Josh Lim,5,I got Covid! So came here to get the confirmation and some medication. Saw the poor Google reviews and I have to say my experience was actually quite good. The receptionist was friendly and shared a lot about the protocol. The doctor is professional. The whole process was fast and efficient. Full marks for me definitely,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100606910212221946176/reviews
