Priyanka Patel,4,"We were trying toast box for the first time, and I was really looking forward to trying their kaya toast. Besides trying a few different versions, we also had their chicken curry roti, which was really good. The chicken curry, however, was one of our favorites. This is the perfect place for coffee and an original kayo toast that was sweet and buttery, which I would return to again and again.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100792040145007745680/reviews
michael lin,4,"As expected tasty toastbox standard. Love the potatoes in the curry chicken noodle. (probably more a laksa). Ordering at the till took a while, but food came super quick.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101093200154303210000/reviews
Agnatta Teng,5,"Dined at Toast Box (The Centrepoint) quite a number of times. Will normally take the seats outside as I noticed my clothes stank badly every time I sit inside.

But bad thing about sitting outside is that there is no aircon, it was really stuffy and warm. Apart from that, experiences were good.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102986467512829632835/reviews
Shabeer Mohamedappa,4,"We enjoyed the Singaporean breakfast at Toast Box. This place is small with limited seating and reasonably priced budget wise. The coffee, kaya toast, peanut butter, and butter toast are simply delicious. We enjoyed whatever we ordered for breakfast. I would really recommend people to try out this place. Overall, we enjoyed the food and Kopi!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115082554866035260013/reviews
Shiela Kim,3,"Usual coffee taste of toastbox. Service was not bad though. However, there is really limited seating and the corner of the shop has slow internet connection. Probably because itâ€™s not quite compact. But maybe its also my carrier issue. Not really sure. So if you are planning to kind of do your work there and need an internet connection, I highly suggest not seating in the corner.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103187116620220847179/reviews
