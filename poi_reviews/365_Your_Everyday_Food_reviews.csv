Harsh Patel,5,One of the few places where I noticed with every bite that they used freshest ingredients and still kept the prices affordable. Vegetarian Minestrone Soup is my personal favourite as of now. Soup’s not in the menu near the entrance but it’s on the screen. The assorted hummus are delicious but this branch didn’t have all the flavours. I recommend going to their flagship store Asian Twist by 365 Food. My friends found the veggie bowl (fun guy) really really good. 10/10,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103824480589887097124/reviews
Glam Maven,5,"I was trying my luck to get turkey for coco last min.

Then I saw this 365 food advertising their turkey breast to be super juicy! Chef Kenneth also very specific about how to eat it, to ensure the taste and texture at its best! A bit expensive ah $91 but it was actually quite good! Coco and loki love it too! We finished everything on one sitting!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113079119375238144221/reviews
Andy Andy,4,"The food is yummy and tastes clean. You can choose the main food item (e.g. salmon and chicken breast), base (e.g. rice), and topping at additional costs (e.g. mushrooms). They also serve good traditional coffee as well as decent selections of home made cakes and cold brewed teas.

The place itself is spacious and comfortable. Surprisingly not much office crowd even during lunch hour. Expect to spend at least $10 for food and drink.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105676099555784742093/reviews
Gerad Leow,5,"A good friend bought us a most succulent turkey breast! Flavourful yet tender, the meat was awesome. We can't wait to try the other menu items! Well done guys!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115710811019934603767/reviews
Cheryl G,4,"Nice food at decent prices - had the black vinegar pig trotters which was very tasty and very friendly, chatty owner who makes an effort to get to know his patrons (sometimes a bit lame lol).
Dined in once and also pre-ordered for delivery before. Will come back if I’m in the area.
Wish their utensils and cutlery for dine in was more environmentally friendly though, everything was disposable plastic.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111350027893372053309/reviews
