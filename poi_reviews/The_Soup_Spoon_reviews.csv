LP Pua,4,"There was no queue on a late Sunday afternoon. I ordered the $7.90 Daily Saver Set, which comprised a sandwich, a soup, and a drink. It was ready within 3 minutes because the restaurant was almost empty, with only 2 other customers. The food was okay for the price, and the restaurant was bright and clean. Good value overall.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Jingyi Lim,1,"Highly overrated. The salad portion is extemely small, especially for the $8.30 price tag. The four tiny pieces of chicken breast didn't seem to weigh even 60g, especially compared to the 90g portion sold at 7/11. It feels like they're cheating me with this portion.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104599963341197250823/reviews
Kly,4,It can get super crowded during office lunch crowd but the waiting time is still acceptable. Only gripe is that the soup is always scooped out 1st before the salad/sandwich is being prepared. Because of this the soup sometimes get lukewarm by the time I have it.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104106844849786226128/reviews
Raidah Razak,5,"Overall it's okay.
The quesadillas are pretty good and making me full all day.
The beef bulgolgi inside the quesadillas are really juicy.

Price wise, I think it's a bit expensive.
Portion wise, for what I eat, just nice.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103466284402884282922/reviews
Fab C,3,"Delicious Japanese chicken soup, BUT SG$8.40 for such a SMALL bowl! Tiny. See my photo of the soup bowl compared to the size of my glasses. Feeling a little ripped off. Overpriced for soup only.

Maybe meals are better value! 3* for good taste though, if a bigger portion, would gave been 4*, but portion size is seriously mean and miserly. An extra 50% would probably only cost less than an extra dollar to make as it is 80% water, and would make for happy customers. Won't be coming back as value too low, even though the soup is good.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107660703838315074541/reviews
