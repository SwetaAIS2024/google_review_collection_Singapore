Darren,2,"Even if this was a cafe and I got the meal for takeaway, I really cannot smooth over the sheer disappointment I had while struggling through the Signature Classic Barn Burger ($19.50+). My main gripe was that the bottom of the burger was completely soaked in grease! The base bread was all limp and soggy, and I couldn't get a bite in without the lettuce and patty all slipping out. - everything was just falling apart! And this was only about 5min after I collected the package and walked across the street to Timbre+ to have my meal. Simply terrible experience.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116771157599704611382/reviews
Charlotte Teo,4,"The service was generally good, though the staff seemed eager to clear the table, constantly checking if we had finished our meal. We ordered two fish and chips, which came with generous portions of fillet, and the sauce was quite tasty. We also added 1 iced latte and 1 ice flat white, which were decent. The total bill for two came to $53.41.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106428966509112024190/reviews
Peter Lombard,5,My 'local' when I'm in the area. The nachos is brilliant. Service is super lovely. And of course beer is nice and cold. Well done,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101608868464654428553/reviews
Lynette Liew,4,"Great coffees (Lavazza) that came with a biscotti each. Was pretty empty around 3pm on a Saturday, so the food was served really quickly and the service was great too. Churro fries came in a big portion and were value for money. Good place to have a quiet lunch on a weekend or a lunch meeting.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109359807764976673240/reviews
Caleb Tan,5,"Massive lunchtime crowd and the only tables available were the long outdoor bar tables. The staff was really nice and got us an indoor table after 15 mins.

Ordered the King Prawn Aglio Olio. Taste was not bad but nothing worth remembering.

Would like to come back and try the other dishes.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113662045918405903382/reviews
