He knew is my first tooth extraction and was very patient and explained every single step he is going to do. Have recommended to a colleague but colleague found the price at Dental Hub a bit ex then neighbourhood clinic.\n\nMaybe Dental hub can introduce some package say 2 times tooth scaling and polishing per year at a discounted price.",
