Connor McBride,5,"Incredibly reliable service for all things bike related. Jeff and his team sold a bike on my behalf that I had been trying to sell for 6 months. For more than I was asking for. Hassle free.

After lots of consultation with me, Jeff then bought a new bike on my behalf. Made edits specific for my requirements and had it delivered and built at the shop.

On collection day I was able to enjoy a lovely breakfast and coffee before riding home. An excellent experience.

I've added the shopping basket....",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111830470512464230723/reviews
Stephen Choo,5,"Came in to do a quick tune up for my rear D and met with Jeff who was enthusiastic to help. Although he was working on another bike, he was happy to address my concerns and he did an exceptional job troubleshooting. My brakes were a little “squishy” and had too much play so I opted to also get my cables changed along with a new set of carbon brake shoes. There is a waiting area with very reasonably priced drinks and I had a nice life cold bottle of Stella while waiting. Bike rides like a dream now. Overall very happy with the service and experience. Will most definitely recommend Bike Craft to others",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105341935565919814973/reviews

Experimental BeX,5,"It was a fuss-free repair of my mountain bike! The staff was super helpful and they were very transparent in the cost quotation.

Changing of both gear wires and tuning of my mountain bike was $53, but it was done beautifully :)

Tldr; you get what you pay for!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102685497044753170585/reviews
