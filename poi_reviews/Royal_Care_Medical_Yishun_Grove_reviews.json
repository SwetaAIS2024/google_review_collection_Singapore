Consultation always is so fast too. Nowadays hard to find real Doctors who care for patient. Honestly the surrounding clinics are the same too, therefore it's more of coming to see Doctor jus to take medicines.",

When asked the counter, they just say “doctor is on the way, not sure what time”. Not even apologetic for wasting many people’s time. I purposely came early so I can make my dinner appointment at 6.30pm\n\nTerrible service. It’s better to go to Minmed at Wisteria. I will never come back to Royal Care Clinic anymore even though it’s a few steps closer from home.",
