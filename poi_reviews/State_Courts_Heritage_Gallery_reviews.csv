CK C,4,The heritage gallery is rather small. Seems more like a contribute to our judges. Admission is free and no booking is required. Remember to visit the court simulation.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
The Genesis Family,5,"You will need to go thru security check to enter as standard protocol. Do not be alarmed.
Do note, Photography and videography IS ONLY ALLOW INSIDE THE GALLERY. Once you you step out, it's not allow. The security is strict on this, even if you step out to take photo of the entrance

The State Courts Heritage Gallery is a great place to learn about the history of Singapore's legal system.

It is located in the former State Courts building, which is a beautiful example of Art Deco architecture. The gallery has a variety of exhibits, including interactive displays, photographs, and documents. It is a great place to visit if you are interested in Singapore's history or law.

Izhar,5,"Really cool, modern and informative heritage gallery with a nice simulated court. The display and historical items were very informative and diverse. Can finish the visit within 15 minutes. I would recommend a drop by especially by people with a strong interest in pursuing law in Singapore.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107057289508191400718/reviews
Song Ong,5,Small gallery with quite a few digital touch points.  The reflections on the screens from the afternoon sun makes it slightly hard to read the content tho. Especially love the simulation court.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111738813406830199134/reviews
