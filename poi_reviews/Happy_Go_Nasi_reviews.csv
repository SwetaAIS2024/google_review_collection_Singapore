shiloh,5,"The best beehoon Nasi Lemak I‚Äôve had! The chicken is so fresh and crispy, and the flavor of the chili is great. I was hesitant on ordering the luncheon meat because it looked dry, but turned out to be wonderful. I love their generosity of the luncheon meat cut too, most places are so thin and stingy these days.

Will def make this a go-to spot for beehoon!

Side note: the Teh here is really good toooooo.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104058024077485669454/reviews
