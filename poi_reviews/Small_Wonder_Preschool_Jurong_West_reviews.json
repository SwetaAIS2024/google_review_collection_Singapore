Happy for her to advance studies and follow her passion, wishing her all the best‚Ä¶!",

My son, Aidan, was so well taken care of that when I transferred him to another childcare ctr due to our relocation, I had to 'quarantine' him at home for the last 2 weeks so that he wont be traumatised when he goes to his new childcare ctr. N thanks aunty Teng for your farewell gift to him. Thx alot!",
