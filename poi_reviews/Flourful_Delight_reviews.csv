L S,5,"Best Wanton in chilli oil tried as a foodie! I am back the second time to the totally revamped Hawker Street, at Bukit Panjang Plaza, to try this dish again, with the Dan Dan noodles too. It is so peanutty and flavorsome i just can't shake off the fantastic taste still in my mind!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104943415089697121781/reviews
Maria Ben,3,"$5.90 for the zhajiangmian.  It's good but the serving is toooo small, it would leave you still hungry.  I've ate here few times to check incase if its just my unlucky day, but really that's the serving.  I feel like it doesn't justify the price",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116135781582917014949/reviews
Ethan Tan,5,This is super tasty! The skin is soft and the fillings comes with delicious soup and tender pork. Very nice!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107479040228482758491/reviews
Ray Oh,5,"The noodles were delicious‚Äîflavorful and well-cooked! The xiao long bao was also amazing, with juicy fillings. üòã

However, the food court seating is very limited, making it hard to find a spot during peak hours. If not for the crowded space, it would be a perfect meal!

Recommendation: Go for the food, but try to avoid busy times if you want a seat. üçúü•ü",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104467324767867242653/reviews
