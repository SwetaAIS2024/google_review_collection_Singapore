Sophia Wee,1,"A few months ago, I would have rated 4 stars for the review of this place. I love indomie and I think the Satay Gado Mie was the best thing ever, it used to have this chonky satay chicken with the indomie (You can see it from a review from 6 months ago). This year the meat was reduced severely by half to 2 sticks of regular satay ü•≤ was there a change in ownership? Is this from the GST increase? I have no idea but I don't think I can patronize this store as regularly as I once did. Major downer.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115519015927495295184/reviews
Mustafa Zainudin,4,"Visit here for lunch on 15/Oct Sat at 12pm. Place was cosy for a quick lunch. There were 3 staff managing  the outlet.
There are several authentic Indonesia food & tasted very good. I love the Ox tail soup, very meaty & the broth was power & beefy! Wife had Gado with Noodle, love the peanut sauce.
Overall very good...Well doneüëèüëèüëè",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117377713823646502834/reviews
Chen Carina,3,"Ayam penyet on the slight pricey side ($6-$7 on average). Limited seating. Enjoyed the gadomie the most, flavourful noodles and tender boneless chicken with satay sauce. And keropok! Chilli packs a punch. Fried chicken has very subtle tumeric taste, overall abit bland. Also they can have more gravy on the white rice.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111996576432815242881/reviews
Huixian Nah,1,"DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! UNCLEAN FOOD!!!

I ordered their NasiGo on 10 Oct 2022 through deliveroo and had such a nasty food poisoning afterwards. Vomiting for 2 days, stomach unwell for 3 days. Even had high fever on the first day of food poisoning lol. Spent $100+ on visiting the doctor. Terrible experience. I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre serving food from previous days or your kitchen is unhygienic. But something is definitely wrong. Please check because you‚Äôre playing with people‚Äôs lives. This is unethical. Will NEVER eat here ever again and strongly suggest people DO NOT EAT FROM THIS PLACE!!
