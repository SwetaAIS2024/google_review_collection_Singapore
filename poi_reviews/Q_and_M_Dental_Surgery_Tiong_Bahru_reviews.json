Where theres a need, i can always trust that they are equipped with all necessary specialised tools and equipment like X-ray, be it filling up a cracked tooth etc. I’m also pleasantly surprised that they have good electronic data management system, with my teeth records at other O&M outlets readily available, the dentist can remind me on what was previously done to the concerned tooth and make informed decisions to either remove or perform filling. Always a pleasant experience at Q&M",
