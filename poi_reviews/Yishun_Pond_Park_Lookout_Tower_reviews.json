      "text": "A viewing tower in Yishun Pond Park.\n\nExcept the last flight of stair, this is elderly and disable friendly viewing tower because it has full ramp access to the viewing terrace. It's also connected to the bridge opposite the street  next to the bus stop, however, there is only stairs from there.\n\nThe view from the top is good, although only some portion is clear because the other is obstructed by trees. However, there was this auntie who thought it was a great idea to do dancing exercise with loud music on top of the viewing deck, that is not big in the first place. Auntie ah, can you do this on the ground or less limited area? At home? Less risk of falling? Peaceful surrounding? This is a viewing deck, not to view phone.",

The over-bridge walkway connects it to Yishun park on one side and the lookout can be used to access the pond park. A tranquil place with possibilities of viewing reptiles and birds. The reflecting view of the pond is appeasing and can only be seen from the lookout tower.",

      "text": "I have been in Singapore for a year and have visited many places. But Yishun Pond really surprised me for its simple beauty to help patients at the nearby hospital relax and recover.\n\nI was at KTP hospital to visit my father in law and we brought him to this pond often to lift his mood and just to catch up with him about his treatment.\n\nIt is a very well designed little park with a running trail, a lookout integrated with an overhead bridge and we had a great time there with my husband's family during visiting hours. Congrats to the Singapore Parks and Recreation team for designing and creating this wonderful little green space.\n\nHowever, the pond has a dam that should be cleaned more frequently. Even though fish and tortoises thrive near the dam, it is oily on the surface with trash strewn across the area.\n\nOverall, a nice and important green space that makes the KTPH area a different hospital in Singapore.",
