What a treat! üçª We must agree that it's a girly beer and we ‚ù§Ô∏è it!\n\nWe totally enjoyed the fish and chips! üê†üçü Super fresh battered fish! So deliciously yummy üòã\n\nWe also had the buffalo wings  (read: winglets, cos it was not the whole wing) Nicely done with a generous amount of sauce üëç\n\nIf you're not into sitting on high tables and chairs, walk further in and you'll find dining tables and cushioned seats.\n\nGreat service too! We were undecided but the service staff were friendly and approachable. Kudos to the team! We'll be back for sure ü•≥",
