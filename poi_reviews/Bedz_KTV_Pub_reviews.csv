Lauren Tan,3,"Went there on a Tuesday night, there was plenty of space for both indoor and outdoor seating. Given the reasonable prices for their food and drinks, this is a great place to unwind after work with colleagues. KTV machines available for guests to use. The boss is extremely friendly and will go from table to table to interact with the guests. The food is standard Singaporean bar food, nothing much to shout about.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106400901761268230817/reviews
