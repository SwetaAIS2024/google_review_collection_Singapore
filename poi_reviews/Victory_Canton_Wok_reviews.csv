Richard Khoo,5,"Nice food. Prawn paste chicken a must try.

Atmosphere is in a hawker centre, so don't expect any ambience.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108629327788615513176/reviews
Kenny Yap,4,"Came on a Saturday afternoon and managed to place our order and get served relatively quickly. Unfortunately the much raved prawn paste chicken was sold out by that time. The other dishes were good but nothing to die for, just comfort food at affordable prices. Convenient for people around the area but would not travel out of the way to have this.

Service was good and people were friendly.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105256927610815725781/reviews
Sharon Wong (Clover),4,One of the oldest hawker centre more than 30 years old. The food is value for money and service is friendly. Quite a variety of dishes and the soup is of my favourite. It is rather windy and you won't feel so humid in the afternoon.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102746852375315856332/reviews
Adeline O,4,"The bean sprout with salted fish was crunchy & tasty, as was the Prawn Paste Chicken.  Their Specialty Tofu was generously garnished with tasty minced meat.  Egg omelette & seafood bitter-gourd soup was very tasty.  All in, a very filling meal, just a tad salty for me but just right for my uncle & auntie.  Quite crowded for a Sunday dinner at 5:40pm",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113624229216489380995/reviews
