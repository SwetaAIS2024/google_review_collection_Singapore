The cappuccino is superb, and the barista even crafted a cute rabbit latte art, which was such a lovely touch. The spaghetti was good, though I think it could be a bit better, but still quite enjoyable. Overall, a great experience!",

      "text": "Very Reasonably Priced\n\nOn a weekday at lunch, this was the only restaurant at the Grassroots club. The others happened to be unavailable that day.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was how friendly and sincere the customer facing folks are. Food is ordered at the counter but they will serve you when your food comes.\n\nThe western food served was at a great price - $11.90 for fish and chips, $8 for 6 pieces of chicken wing. There is also a 1:1 beer promotion amongst other offers.\n\nThe place is quiet and cosy. Definitely great for a\nnice and quiet place to have a chat.",

In others, you may just be seeking for an easy option to fill a void in your day, and Common Folks offers just that. I ordered a Mocha and a Carbonara, providing much needed comfort amidst a rainy day. The atmosphere was also pleasant on this Saturday afternoon, with the other patrons and staff just minding about their day. Overall, a very peaceful option for anyone to seek refuge from a busy day.",

Food came in like > 20mins.\nHad high hopes for the dishes but their pasta was sadly flavourless :( didn’t had any tomato flavour and sauce was mild and thin too. The baked rice was decent and peppery, but had nothing special to it.\nIce cream with waffles was generally nice, waffles was hot & just slightly crispy, got different ice cream flavours and some weren’t that nice, either unexpected taste or that it tasted q artificial. Would suggest their black sesame and earl grey tea flavour if you’re getting ice cream.",
