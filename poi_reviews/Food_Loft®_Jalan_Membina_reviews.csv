S L,3,"Economy rice stall (JinSheng) has variety and price is reasonable for the quality and quantity. A one vegetable-one meat-one egg combo costs $3.3. Tehsi siudai is $1.6 for takeaway ($1.5 for dine-in). Coffeeshop is not too crowded nor hot even during lunch hours. Ample alfresco space. Paynow available.

Edit on 22 Aug 2023: a friendly warning to those customers who dine solo : pls do not leave your food unattended, as the mynas will help themselves to it!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111316266362121177513/reviews
Wayne Koh,3,First time (after a long time) visit here. Decided to try the fish and chips. Unfortunately the fish was not evenly cooked and raw in the mid section. Luckily the staff was readily ok to replace a new set at no extra cost. The Western food prices are about 20% higher than the comparables in the market.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113949799122977019750/reviews
pungg tan,1,"Raw egg was sent via grabfood and I spent a lot to hit minimum order but in the end didn't get to eat what I wanted. I was only refunded 1.60 by Grab.

To my surprise Foodloft refused to refund more and say that this picture doesn't meet their refund standards. I'm disgusted.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109655505695942821455/reviews
Ramdass Pal,1,"Popiah/waffles shop is very unhygienic. A lady who makes the waffles, ate chicken wings with her hands and made the waffles without washing hands and touching the knife and wrappers! So yucky! I will never buy from there!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114711373898535795129/reviews
