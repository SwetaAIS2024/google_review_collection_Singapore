Syed Ibrahim,1,"Hi, i had ordered my meal at 5.12pm and only managed to collect it at 6.10pm which is 1hr later.

I don't blame the old single man managing the stall as he was seen trying his best to prepare all the orders himself.

Should not the management employ additional staff in the outlet.

Really disappointed with the waiting time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103493506007693410424/reviews
