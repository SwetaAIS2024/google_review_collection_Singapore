My 5-year-old daughter has been attending their crayon painting and pencil sketching classes, and she absolutely loves it. The instructors are incredibly nurturing and skilled. The classes are engaging and age-appropriate, helping my daughter develop her artistic skills while having fun. I highly recommend Global Art for anyone looking to inspire their child's love for art. It‚Äôs been a fantastic experience!",
