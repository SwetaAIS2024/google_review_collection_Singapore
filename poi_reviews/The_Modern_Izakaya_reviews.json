      "text": "Excellent Japanese eatery. Did a walk in on a Friday evening and the main restaurant area is full. Got ushered to the sister restaurant Kome Bar, which is empty. Ordered the food from Modern Izakaya and got served at Kome Bar which odd very quiet and nice environment. The waitresses were very attentive and prompt, excellent services.\n\nThe food were delicious and very well marinated and cooked, especially the stingray, chicken skin, chicken and pork meat. The beer was 1-1 before 8pm. Overall excellent place for Japanese food!",

      "text": "Lots of food selection, we had the 5+1 oysters for 30 dollars theyâ€™re huge jap tasty oysters. Asahi pint goes for 1-1 at 16 dollars. For yakitori we had the chicken skin, chicjen tail, pork belly, pork with enoki, chicken wings and liver. They served all the stiicks at once but would be better if they did it by sticks to maintain the food warm. The pork trotters is also a must try for that collagen boost. Overall good!",
