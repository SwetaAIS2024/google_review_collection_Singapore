Matthew Phang,5,"Hidden in 346A Kang Ching Road Coffeeshop ( under the multi storey carpark ), this little heartland stall dishes out great economical bee hoon and other dishes. Firstly, definately have to admit to the affordable prices. The lady cook Peng Jie whips out amazing fried bee hoon, kway teow, chicken wings and many more food varieties to accompany with your staple. It's a great place to have or to pack breakfast before going to work. Operates from the time the coffeeshop opens ( around 6:00am ) till items are sold out.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116828649080542336777/reviews
