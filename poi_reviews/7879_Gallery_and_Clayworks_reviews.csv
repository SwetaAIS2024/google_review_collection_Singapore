Wen Shun Chan,5,"I had gone for their wheel throwing pottery classes 2 times, once for my sister’s hen’s night with the bridesmaids and once with my other friends.. the instructors are so experienced, clear in communication, quick to reply and respond & the studio provided with materials is honestly so generous and clean!

Love the experience, the coaches are funny in a really real and fun way! I’ll keep coming back!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106548877206248524743/reviews
Snekkyy snek,5,"Had a really great time at the studio learning the basics of pottery. And it's all thanks to our instructor, Shirley!

Shirley was very patient and easygoing, making it easy for us beginners to learn and follow along as she guides us step by step throughout the session :) (We also got to know a bit about the the firing/trimming process too)

If you want a chill pottery session I would recommend giving this place a try! Bonus point: theres a cute dog in the studio",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116301561138275934890/reviews
Varian Teo,5,"Organised a team bonding pottery event and everyone really enjoyed it! Kudos to Alvin for bringing his humour and showcasing his expertise. The schedule planned is very feasible to complete within 2-2.5hrs and everyone was preoccupied for the entire duration.

Note that they are in the midst of moving (Dec 24) so the event was held at a separate location than registered, be sure to check with them first. The new space is spacious enough to hold ~20 people, really nice!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115208981475261438932/reviews
adeline,5,"The studio hosted a hand-building + wheel throwing workshop for a group of us - 9 adults and 2 kids. Alvin and the staff were accommodating, friendly and patient! They helped us willingly with our work when needed.
This workshop is great for those who would like some great bonding time with friends or would like to have a basic feel of what wheelthrowing or hand-building is like. The experience of the hand-building work (excluding the intro talk and instructions) is around 1-1.5hr while the wheelthrowing is about 15-30min.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107800150910001345573/reviews
