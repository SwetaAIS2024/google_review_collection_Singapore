Gator,3,"A newly opened coffee shop and the family decided to try some of the stalls out today. Pretty disappointed with what we tried today. We had the chicken rice, Chinese mixed rice and minced meat sauce ramen. All tasted below average in our opinion. Good thing was the fact ghat itâ€™s new, hence the tables and environment was clean.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
