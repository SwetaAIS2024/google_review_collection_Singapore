Ashley Liew,5,"Love this white mee hoon which has a very clean taste to it! So it tastes quite healthy to me. My first time trying this tonight and it was delicious, even though mine was takeaway. Lots of options too, I went with the sliced fish option. Thank you for making my night! üôèüèª",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
S Lim,5,"Family fav for years!

Ocean gems(FRESH), thin beehoon noodles in a glorious seafood stock (zero msg) with wok hei aroma is perfect for any time of the day.

Came back two days in a row because we refuse to eat anything else.

Thank you for remembering us!!

We (3pax) paid 25SGD for the one in the video and it was more than enough.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114157644700254876937/reviews
Jeanie Yip,5,"I love this! SGD25 for 3 of us! The portion is right! 1 person 1 1/2 crayfish each, 3 prawn each &  enough la la - we have lost count for lala! The broth is good! Thick & not salty can‚Äôt taste MSG. There is no shao xing wine & ginger shreds added meaning the  lala, prawn & crayfish are all fresh that  no need to use extra ÂéªËÖ• ingredients to cover the taste!

Most importantly , the bee hoon has wok hey! Unlike most of the shops  which only give u plain white bee hoon! This is an extra star given for this shop! We will definitely eat again!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108782393310476213384/reviews
Ngee Wah Ng,5,"Last Saturday,  I came across this White Mee Hoon at Pasir Ris Central Hawker Centre, managed by Foodfare. It means there is at least one dish selling at $2.80. White Meehoon (Veg/Lala) at $2.80. My wife and I went for Crayfish Lala Prawn Meehoon $15. The portion was large, enough for 3 adults. The stock of meehoon was deliciously rich with flavours. The crayfish, prawn and lala (clams) were very fresh. The stall holders were friendly and honest.  I initially ordered $20 , but he said $15 is more than sufficient for 2 adults. The meehoon was dry fried to give the smokiness aroma before adding the stock. Heavenly taste. They have pure fish version for those who have prawn or crayfish or clam allergies.  Value for money. I like the white meehoon so much that I went back in the evening to buy another two tubs of $20 each for my whole family to try. üëçüëçüëçüòã",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117507372873437369551/reviews
oscar w,3,"pictures on signboard looks very enticing. however the actual product looks quite different and bland. taste is ok, average at best and not memorable. price is on high sideÔºåand not quite value for money in my opinion.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111622338660084561466/reviews
