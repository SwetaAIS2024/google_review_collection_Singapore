The salmon don was lacking in salmon. Service was quite okay. We overall enjoyed ourselves here. Thank you! üôèüèª",

But no worries, I'm a salty tooth so I can take it. And that is my personal reference. Lol. Wish that the salt intake could be lesser so people can enjoy more of the taste. Apart from that, the service was good, thanks to Rashid and the team. Kuddos! üôÇ",

The ordering process was unnecessarily cumbersome. Staff were too busy and difficult to get their attention.  Hopefully, other locations offer better dining experience for customers.",
