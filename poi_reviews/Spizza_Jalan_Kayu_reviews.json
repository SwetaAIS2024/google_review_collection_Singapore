      "text": "First of all, I've been a regular patron and the following has never happened before... But yesterday's order was absolutely disappointing!\n\nThe Mushroom Soup was NOT like the usual i.e. creamy, rich and fulfilling... It was WATERY and thin! As a regular customer, it's pretty obvious! What happened?? It seems like they had missed out some ingredients...? Like cream or milk or flour...??? It's so SAD!\n\nThen, the pizzas - The crust were not as fragrant and soft as usual... The content were ok. BUT, the way the pizzas were 'cut' - absolutely HORRIBLE! It feels like a half-hearted job... (Or someone seems very unhappy with their job...) The cuts were SO IRREGULAR!! - which means you'll get an extremely large or petitly small piece of pizza!\n\nSAD! Seriously, even if I order again, I'll remember NOT to order from this branch!",

Plus, it is very affordable and generous with its servings. The staff are also nice and approachable. We will definitely come back for a third time or more!!!",
