      "text": "I visited Dr. Lai today on the recommendation of a friend, and I was utterly impressed by her patience and meticulous attention to detail. Despite having to bring along my 23-month-old baby due to a scheduling issue, she went above and beyond—handing him a book to keep him entertained while she attended to my concerns with great care and professionalism.\n\nA special shoutout also goes to Chun Li for her warm and thoughtful good service. Thank you for making the visit such a positive one!\n\nKen See",

He did not rush through the vaccination process and really took the time to understand the patient’s current medical conditions. Truly professional . Kudos to the front desk service staff as well for making it a pleasant experience.",

All this despite the clinic being busy.\n\nThe wait was quick I was tested for Covid under 10 mins, waited for results, and not long after 5 minutes got my medication. The doctor was also polite and clear with her instructions.\n\nThis clinic deserves more than 5 stars - my only 2 regrets were not getting the names of the service staff and doctor (they deserve a warm shoutout)\n\nMy other regret is I did not go to this clinic first, instead of the previous one that left me with a bad experience.",
