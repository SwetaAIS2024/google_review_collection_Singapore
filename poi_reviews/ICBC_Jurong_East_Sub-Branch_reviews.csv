DB TDD,1,"I have to say this is the worst bank branch in Singapore, you saw it right, there is no ""one of"" in front of ""the worst"". I have been there quite a number of times, and they are just SLOW. waiting time is super long, they have four counters, but not all are fully operational. Even if they are, you will still wonder why they are so slow. when I went there today, the security officer said the waiting time is 2 hours and suggest me to go try other branch...... I was speechless.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100406729302895319822/reviews
Onggo Wahyudi,1,"I had an unpleasant experience while changing my ATM card at the ICBC
Jurong East Sub-Branch. When the staff asked me to enter a new PIN on the pin pad. I entered the same PIN, but she said it failed 3 times. Instead of guiding me through the process, she gave me an unfriendly expression, as if I didn’t understand it. As customer I didn’t appreciate her attitude, so I raised my voice that made other attention. Please ensure better customer service and treat customers with respect.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102320036710385252100/reviews

Layla,1,"Slow as snail and need to come 3 times for opening an account. Recommend to go for BOC instead, very efficient and convenient there.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102675652015398820930/reviews
Wai Peng Chan,5,"One of the banks with high fixed deposit rates with a minimum of $500, for minimum 3 months. Online account opening is easy, but have to wait around a week for it to be activated. The app is easy to use, if you can translate English to mandarin. For example, for biometric identification, the app says 'please touch your finger'.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110947405217054478180/reviews
