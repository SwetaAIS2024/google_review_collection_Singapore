Flo Yeow,3,"This is probably one of the oddest NTUC Fairprice outlets that I've been to, but it works for what you need. They function like most other NTUCs I've been to.

That said, they are hidden in Square 2, on the 4th floor (when most supermarkets are located on the ground floor or basement). There's also a Don Don Donki in the same building, and a Cold Storage not too far away. So why would anyone make the effort to go all the way up to the 4th floor, of an already confusing building, to get their groceries?",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
Bee Lee Low,4,I wish to commend your cashier assistant at the self checkout Ms Oh Bee Leng. She is always friendly and helpful; today she helped me check such that I don’t miss out on the PWP offer; showing attentiveness and great customer service. 5 stars to Ms Oh and a big Thank You!,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106268223267187687158/reviews
Hansen Ku,5,"Good selection on the items. I was actually on mission to buy Mamee Hello Kitty edition. I asked the staff but they are not aware of this. It was kind of a bit difficult to find more information about this product, especially if you are not local and visiting SG (like me)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102832563818225452167/reviews
Seok,2,"Date 16 Jan. 3:15 pm. Thomson plaza branch. Left fish to be deboned at fish section. Came back after shopping and fish not done. Ask the lady worker about fish and she said ‘not done’. Then she left whatever she was doing to pick fish up and ‘attend’ to fish. Note: this is not early morning peak hours nor ‘rows of fish’ waiting to be deboned. Neither was she deboning other fish.
I stood there to watch her debone. It was mere few minutes job. Didn’t know I needed to stand there to watch the deboning before she could get to work.
Hopefully her supervisor to verify above event by watching the cctv.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112935036857732405679/reviews
