Finally decided to go and the only regret I have is not going sooner.\nIf you are looking for a no frills, muay thai workout with a friendly community that spurs everyone on, this is the place for you. Trainers are really friendly and will push you to your limits! I highly recommend this place for your next workout.",

      "text": "I'm a Canadian who travels to Singapore a lot. I do BJJ here as upstairs from the muay thai gym, there is a space for grappling. I believe they call themselves Kreation BJJ.\n\nVery nice people, relaxed environment, and solid teaching (Shawn and Ron). Its only two days of teaching a week and 3 open mat but perfect for the traveler who wants to stay fresh while away from home. Most flexible and cheapest option in Singapore hands down. Good for locals too I must say. Its very hard to find a straightforward, decent place that doesn't cost waaay too much or lock you in and this place is a gem in that regard.\n\nIn addition, they played the best roots reggae hits from Murderer by Barrington Levy to Dreamland by Bunny Wailer and Bob Marley, produced by the legendary Lee 'Scratch' Perry.\n\nHopefully this plays sticks around so I can visit next time I'm in town :)",
