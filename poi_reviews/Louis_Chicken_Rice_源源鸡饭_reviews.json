      "text": "Happen to pass by AMK 628 hawker centre late one night, decided to drop by and see what was available for dinner. There were limited stalls that were operating and this chicken rice stall happens to one of it. As i was there pretty late, they have sold out most of their items. Over here, they serve both roasted and white chicken. Price for the chicken rice starts from SGD$4 onwards.\n\nThe meat and rice is plated separately. Portion of the meat was pretty generous, Meat wasnt too dry and actually quite tender. Rice on the other hand was fragrant and wasnt too oily. Their chii sauce was not bad either, compliment the meat well.\n\nOverall, a pretty good plate of chicken rice if you ask me. Wouldn't mind trying their roast chicken the next time round.",
