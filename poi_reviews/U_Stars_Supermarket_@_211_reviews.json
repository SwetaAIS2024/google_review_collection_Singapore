Also, they often forgot to program some items (e.g. fresh Milk) where there are suppose to have discount if you buy 2 items, end up, consumers has to pay much more for no reason. I used to pay extra $1 for 2 bottles of milk that suppose to have discount, but due to their programming fault. Today, it happened again, and I refused to buy.\nI hope their management could look into this matter.",
