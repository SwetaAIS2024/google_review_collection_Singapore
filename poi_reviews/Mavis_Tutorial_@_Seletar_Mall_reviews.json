Ms. Joyce reached out to him at just the right time, speaking with him and encouraging him to attend the tuition classes.\n\nAfter each class, Ms. Joyce took the time to communicate with him, helping to strengthen his relationship with us. There were even times when she accompanied him home. She also made a point to call him before each class to remind him to attend.\n\nNow, Tat Yuan is willing to go to his tuition classes at Mavis, and this positive change is entirely due to the support and care of Ms. Joyce and all the teachers.",
