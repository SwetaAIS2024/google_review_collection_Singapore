Dragonshutter Photography,5,"At the stall they also sell Vietnamese food, served likely by a Vietnamese. I had the rice noodles with grilled meat and fried spring roll ($5.80) that were freshly cooked and utterly delicious. The spicy fish sauce was amazing. Authentic Vietnamese like you get in Vietnam. Next visit I will try the Bánh mì. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110097377816844470624/reviews
