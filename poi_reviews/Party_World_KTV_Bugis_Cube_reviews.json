She helped us get chairs to sit outside while waiting for our turn and ensured that we were comfortable also.\n\nService when we had the room was also superb. Chips were a little stale but other than that, we are definitely coming back again!",

      "text": "We went on a Friday afternoon and the section we were at had nobody else for the entire two hours so it felt a little empty. Unexpectedly, the staff offered to take our payment afterward instead of upfront, however barged in 30 minutes BEFORE the ending time to demand for payment (???). It was quite puzzling of them to interrupt to get the payment before we had finished the session.\n\nThe service charge and GST were additional fees and as all drinks were served together, the cold one melted while the hot one became cold. 3/10 experience",
