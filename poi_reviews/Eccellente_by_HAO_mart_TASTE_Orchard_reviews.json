      "text": "Took over the OG department store during early 2024, it is a food-centric mall with the supermarket as its core business and it is situated near Somerset MRT as well.\n\nIn theory, everything will fall into place given its prime assets.\nIn practice, it may need to reconsider a lot of things.\n\nThe current layout remains unchanged from the previous tenant and it still feels like a department store instead of a supermarket, with restaurants and eateries at the building corners. Due to the layout, it doesn't effectively entice shoppers to buy items and may just window shop instead.\n\nAs for the supermarket, there are a lot empty shelves and self-checkout counters are still non-functional as of now. Currently, it feels like an unfinished project, even if it is suppsoedly fully opened for quite some time.\n\nOverall, nothing really bad in terms of shopping  experience. But, it may need to reconsider its business operations if they want to do this long-term.",

Lots of interesting and unique international products that I don’t really see often. There’s also a live seafood area and you can order meals from their counter. Definitely worth visiting. Nice and spacious aisles, so its more relaxing in a way compared to other supermarkets.",

Affordable food and variety available here - think prices and experience similar to the overhyped Fairprice at Clarke Quay.\n\nWould absolutely come back again. Currently a very underrated spot given the newness of this mall but definitely a lot of potential to be had. Orchard lacks a supermarket at heartland prices and this fills the gap 101%.",
