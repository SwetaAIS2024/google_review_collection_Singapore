MAD Mama,4,"Excellent taste, chef cooked the noodle with some skills, the needle was tender and tasty, roasted pork slice yummy. The portion of noodle can be more.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111827780067936585673/reviews
CG,1,"Although taste is good, but price keep going up and quantity keep going down.  Used to hv 3 wontons, then down to 2, then 1 now.  It is just pathetic. It’s not even filling for one portion. And no green chilli which is a basic for wonton noodles. Disappointing",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106521726495684224815/reviews

Time for some noods!! 🍜🍜🍜

Looking for a nostalgic bowl of wonton noodles? Recommend Kok Kee Wonton Noodle!😝

I enjoyed the dry wonton noods more;)) QQ noods tossed in that flavourful spicy 🌶️ sauce yum yum!😋😋 Don’t be too surprised if you ordered dry but see your noodles drenched in a pool of watery-looking sauce, that’s how they do their sauce!🤣

Wontons and dumplings were delicious too! Fillings were tasty and the skin wasn’t too thick👍🏻 Although the char siew was thin & very dry looking, it actually wasn’t! Maybe it didn’t feel too dry cause it was thin🤣😅 This whole bowl was simple yet delicious 🫶🏻

CW T,3,My first time trying this wan ton noodles. I found it pretty good. The star is the texture of the noodles. Not too soggy and not too al dente. The sauce and the chili sauce that is doused on top of the noodles is on the salty and oily side. Too bad they don't serve vinegar pickled green chili to cut the oil. The char siew and the wantons are ok. Price to food size portion is average.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110213850832346635768/reviews
