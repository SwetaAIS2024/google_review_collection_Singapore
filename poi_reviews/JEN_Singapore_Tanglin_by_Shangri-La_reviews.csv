Sabri Osman,5,"Had an amazing buffet dinner here! The variety was impressive—everything from fresh salads and hot entrees to delicious desserts. Everything tasted fresh and well-seasoned, and the dishes were constantly being refilled, so nothing sat out too long. The staff was attentive and kept the place clean and welcoming. Really good value for the price, and a perfect spot if you're going with a group or just want to try a little bit of everything. Will definitely be back!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112640699223641797627/reviews
Isabelle Tay,5,"We had our wedding banquet here and the experience was truly amazing thanks to Xinyi, Phoebe & Hazim!

Our wedding planning process was not a smooth one as we had two major hiccups which were swiftly resolved by Xinyi & Phoebe!

First, we had to change our wedding date due to family circumstances. Phoebe, who was covering for Xinyi, responded quickly and found alternative dates for us. She was very understanding and even replied us at late hours & while on leave, which we really appreciated.

Second, just days before the wedding, there was an issue with our original ballroom. Xinyi handled it right away and moved us to a different ballroom, which actually turned out to be even better!

Both Xinyi and Phoebe were incredibly patient despite all our requests and changes, going above and beyond to make sure everything went smoothly, even throwing in free upgrades and meals to make our stay extra special.

On the actual day, Hizam managed the banquet like a pro. He even opened the bar early when guests arrived ahead of time, which was a thoughtful touch. The food was amazing—generous portions, great pacing, and full of compliments from our guests. Everyone left absolutely stuffed and happy!

We thoroughly enjoyed our wedding and stay here. Huge thanks to the team for making our big day so memorable. Highly recommended!!!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104140455507701408773/reviews
Elly Eng,5,"Location is great with easy access to the MRT and nearby bus stations.  I love it that we can order room amenities via their app.  It’s convenience and efficiency under one roof!  Overall, the staff were very helpful and treated us with very warm hospitality!  It is also a great hotel for family with kids.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106942148635963617825/reviews

Dariush Malekirad,5,"Very nice hotel, clean and luxurious. The reception staff were very friendly. The buffet breakfast was awesome. Large outdoor pool and nice gym. My only comment is about the restaurant which had a buffet of seafood and the entire hotel was smelling of seafood and for someone who is allergic (myself) to seafood, it wasn't pleasant.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104139036588813086611/reviews
