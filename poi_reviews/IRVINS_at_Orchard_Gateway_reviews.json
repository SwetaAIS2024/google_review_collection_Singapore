While the brand has expanded to the US, the product line is different and does not include its most famous product, salted egg fish skin. Bought a pack of the salted egg fish skin here which was delicious with a rich and savory flavor. If you go to Singapore, I would recommend picking up this item given that it is still not available in the US.",
