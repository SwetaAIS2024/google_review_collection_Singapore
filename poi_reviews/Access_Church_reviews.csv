Jen Xiao,5,"I actually came across Access Church on YouTube and ended up binge-watching all their sermons—they were that good. So I decided to check it out in person… and wow, I’m so glad I did.
From the moment I walked in, it just felt so warm and homely. Everyone was super friendly and genuine, like you’re part of the family from day one.
The sermon was amazing—so real, so relevant, and it really spoke to me. If you’re looking for a place that’s full of heart and truth, this is it.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104146231632985013516/reviews
Isabella Tan,5,"Struggled with breaking out of the Sunday-Christian cycle and was looking for somewhere to anchor myself in. Never felt as drawn to a place like this one - though small, the presence of God can be felt on a corporate and interpersonal level.

Pastors are spiritually and socially adept; unfazed by accounts of church hurt, difficult conversations and real struggles; holding space for true versions of selves while equipping and pointing the flock towards God. No spiritual arrogance or overly distorted views of life here — just people intrinsically motivated to pursue Jesus.

Excited for what’s ahead!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103729323603965391616/reviews
Pearlynn Wang,5,"If you’ve always felt like you don’t fit into any church, give this church a try. I walked in ~3 years ago hesitant, cautious & mildly unsure of the mix of youngsters running what I’d initially felt was an off brand worship church. Today, I call this church my home. God has profoundly blessed and multiplied this church in so many ways. I’d recommend this church if you’re looking for a loving, fun and welcoming community you can’t get rid of, because you’ll spend eternity with them.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108612355032351227029/reviews
Kessler Teo,5,"a very welcoming church that has absolutely 0 judgements. Hard to find that anywhere especially in a place like Singapore. No matter how broken you are or how messed up ur past is, im sure you will fit into this community cos its full of imperfect people like me and you. Spirit-filled too, what more to ask for",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116240772389487959855/reviews
Jason Lee,5,"A church that feels like a home!!! If you’re looking for perfect people, you may not find them here. But if you’re looking for a community to journey through life with, you could give it a shot! (also it’s a great place to play DnD)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116264544178146317841/reviews
