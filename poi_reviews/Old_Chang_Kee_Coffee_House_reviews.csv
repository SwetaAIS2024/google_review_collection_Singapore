just Wai,4,"Food
Curry chicken with Prata (2pcs)
Curry chicken is not bad, but also not good too. 6 out of 10. Prata is probably from packaging one. 6 out of 10.
Mushroom Puff, 7 out of 10.
Lime juice: 8 out of 10.

Service is good, food come fast. Instruction is clear.

Atmosphere is good too, giving a chilling vibes.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113857140644341643606/reviews
Melissa Aw,3,Was there for a late tea break. Glad to have found them having tea special price meals with their signature curry puffs and coffee. It’s a pity that buns were out of stock when I was there. I also heard feedback from customers that the cheese curry puffs being seasonal for Christmas is also a demand for permanent menu. Air conditioned cafe environment makes it a good place for tea breaks. Please have more attractive meals price at different timing to attract more crowds and kindly make cheese curry puffs back too…. I need to try them .,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107701735181442278856/reviews

Zee,3,"They have a “Buy 4 and get 1 free” poster on the counter for all the stick snacks and curry/sardin puffs available from 3pm till closing but the guy serving the counter didn’t even give me a free one?? I bought 2 chicken sausage on stick, one spring roll and one sardin puff, expecting an additional free snack but he said it’s not applicable???? Then why have the poster up stating that? Just to get your customers to buy more then tell them the offer is not available? Simi sai",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110033637274761366342/reviews
Clo’s Laobu,2,"First time trying out the food. Ordered blue Pea Nasi lemak with dry curry, curry with bun and prata with egg and onion. Serving portion is small with only 1 small potato with a spoon of peanuts and ikan bilis. Curry gravy a lot but chicken only 2 or 3 small pieces. Price is not worth for it.

Food 6/10
Ambience 6/10
Service -/10 ( order via phone and it’s self service )",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114142484779850595642/reviews
