Vincent Phua,5,Ordered via Grab and no far the quality has been very good. Beef Hor Fun ( for 3) portion is good and tasty. Option to separate gravy a plus. Will order again.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103461072442670769876/reviews
V. S.,5,"Chanced upon Ken's Kitchen through Grabfood and we did not regret our decision! Really love the taste of every single dish we had ordered so far!
For our first try, we had Hong Kong noodles, Sambal Potato Leaves & Coffee Pork Rib. We love the taste of sambal! You could taste the dried shrimp in it! The coffee pork rib was a 👍🏻👍🏻!
Today we tried the Mongolian Chicken which was a rock 🌟 too! Sambal kangkung will never disappoint us and the moonlight kway teow was pretty decent too! Oh! Serving for each dish was of the right size too!
Hope to dine in some day! 😊",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101472022606125175531/reviews
Alvin,1,Less than a star even. Made a scheduled preorder two to three hours in advance but in the end got cancelled after my whole family waited 30 mins after the scheduled timing. Better not order from this restaurant to avoid last minute changing of dinner option.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113447504048590189408/reviews
Alvin Neo,1,"If possible I will give no stars or negative stars, accept my pre order through food panda, cancelled my order at the delivery time, if you can't fulfil the order, let the customer know early, so customers can do another arrangement instead of wasting time and got cancelled,won't patronise again... Lousiest merchants I seen in food panda.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109353480561910902606/reviews
