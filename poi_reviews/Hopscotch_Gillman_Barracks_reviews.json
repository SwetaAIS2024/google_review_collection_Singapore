      "text": "Pleasant environment for a chill evening. Had the Roasted Duck pizza, Chilli Lobster Linguine and the Pangium Beef.\n\nPizza was crispy and flavourful. The Chilli Lobster sauce was spicy on point, satisfying yet it doesnt sweat you out. The Pangium Beef was super tender, the meat was so soft that it melts in the mouth!\n\nFor the cocktails, my partner and I had the White Sands and the Wish Upon the Lantern. Super intriguting experience, with the White Sands being an edible cocktail and the interesting short \"performance\" by sending our wishes through burning.\n\nHighly recommended for those who are looking to chill for the evening after a long day of work or over the weekends with friends!",

Donâ€™t mind Travelling all the way to try because of the price. It turns out to be the best decision. Their entree was amazing and the mains were so good itâ€™s so value for money. Apart from the fish and chips that is a tad dry, but the portion certainly make up to it",

Cocktails are visually appealing, but there should be more depth to the explanations.\nHad mostly the fried stuff and pizza, which was good.\nLive music performance and the football table were a big plus too!",

Bad customer service at the start.\nFood portions are very small. Duck was small size with two baby potato's and tea soon of salsa vegg. For this price you expect more. Other meals were also small. Just put more potatoes and veggies please!\nThree adults left to McDonald's because we were hungry and we didn't have time to get another meal.\nWas it worth it? No definitely not. For this price I will go to way better restaurants.\nGoodnight",
