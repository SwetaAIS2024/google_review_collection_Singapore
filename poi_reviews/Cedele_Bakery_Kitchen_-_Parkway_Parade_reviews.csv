Crabby Dancer,5,Pasta served al dente and many healthy options to choose from. Standard cafe prices ranging from $18 to $25. Ambience may not be fantastic but the quality of food makes up for it.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100688349581284563658/reviews
Gregory Athanasius,5,"Located at Basement B1 of Parkway Parade Shopping Mall, looking for something healthy. Instead of just having sandwiches, how about trying the dishes at Cedele.

Service can be slow and expect some waiting time. The food is delicious and there is a range of healthy dishes to choose from.

Most of the mains are designed to be a protein paired brilliantly with grains or pasta.  There’s always space for cakes and Cedele is officially the best place for it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101240389824842882822/reviews
Beng Lim,3,"I am a member and have always patronise this outlet. Love the staff there !

However our recent dining experience, I was disappointed with the food. We ordered a Christmas salmon dish, and I was totally taken aback when the food was served ! It looked like some left over food from my mum’s kitchen ! The salmon was a thin piece n the plating was unpleasant n to think that I have to pay $28 for it ! appalled !

The other dish of chic n prawns quinoa was bland n the prawns were so tiny !

The cook must be overworked n tired to churn out sub par food !

Cedele  seriously you need to improve !",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103509871408629976443/reviews
Jack Ng,2,"Food is not bad. Service really subpar. It’s not like they are lack of staff. To what I saw, they have enough staffs, but the productivity is very low. The one who serve our food can serve without cutleries. My order was waited long enough about 25 mins that I thought they forgotten about my order. The person who’s making my drink, upon hearing my order, were confused as she needed to ask her colleague about the make of my drink, which was in their menu. The whole experience was bad for me.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102045103446835771192/reviews
John Tango,4,"4th review dated 14th August 2022 Sunday for late lunch.

Good overal experience. Staff generally helpful & friendly. Score 9/10.

Portobello Garlic Toss scored 10/10 ⭐️👍🏼

Bacon Beef Burger on Walnut Bun toasted was actually good however a tad too sweet from caramelized onions. The presentation of the salad & fried sweet potatoes was excellent. Overal 8.5/10 👌🏼 May order again but perhaps request less of the caramelized onion which juices was dripping when eating burger. Patty was good.

Iced Rooibos Lemon Tea is not bad. Glass a bit small small for the price. Scored 8/10 👍🏼 will order again if craving for the ‘exotic’ flavour.

==============================

Third visit was Sunday, April 18th, 2021.

The Hearty Breakfast was below expectation only because the eggs “over easy” was done “over hard”. Apparently, in Asia the term “over easy” is not understood that “over easy” is to flip the sunny side up eggs for 5 to 7 seconds to set the egg white while the egg yolk is left runny.  Also the sour dough bread was too hard. Maybe toasted to long. Keeping rating to 4 star for now.

The Hearty Breakfast all day brunch rated 6/10.

There are 4 other orders from picture no. 10 to 13 with ratings.
