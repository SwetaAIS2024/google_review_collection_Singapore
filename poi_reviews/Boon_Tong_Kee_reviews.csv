lolli _k,4,"I’ve visited Boon Tong Kee many times over many years, and it remains a dependable choice for chicken rice. The rice is consistently fragrant and flavourful, and the chicken and other side dishes are decent and reliable. The chili and ginger sauces are a bit too salty for my taste, sometimes overpowering the more subtle flavours. Still, it’s a place I return to regularly—especially when I have friends visiting from overseas, as it offers a solid introduction to local favourites.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107628884150723380259/reviews
Kelly Leung,4,"Coming for the tender kampung chicken with fragrant oil rice. There was a long queue on Saturday night at around 7pm-ish, and we waited for 15 mins to get a table. The dishes came quite fast. Recommended if you are looking for a slightly premium place for chicken rice.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104789885423897668628/reviews

Alexander Egy,5,"came in during dinner time, just had to queue a bit, and we got to order while queuing so we got our food quite fast. ordered the usual boiled chicken, rice and fried tofu, also first time trying their sweet sour pork. everything were really good, their portions also worth the price. fyi the wet tissue isnt free so, if you dont wanna be charged with it just gave it back to the cashier when youre paying ✌️",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103740368823767717398/reviews
