TNJ Housing Solutions Pte Ltd,5,"Cheapest food and drinks I can find around the area.

Economic rice is always wide selection and tasted good. Price increased this year (2024) but still cheap.

Drinks are nicely done too specially their hot milo.

Can try mee poh as noodles are very springy and nicely done. Laksa not too bad but not the best. Soup a little watery kind but taste is maintain. Generous in their ingredients too. Worth the price still.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103779904320049277745/reviews
