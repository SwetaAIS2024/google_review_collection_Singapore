Josie Low,1,"I patronises the store rather frequently, but I really do not think that is a wise comment to make by one of your staff to the colleagues inside the store. Everyone knows that from the 1st July onwards quite a handful of supermarkets start to impose charges on the use of the plastic bags. Nevertheless, I reckoned that it's moving towards the objective of safe the environment. But the staff said in such a critic way that quote and unquote, see now have to pay five cents per plastic bag, people stop asking for double bag no matter how heavy the things are. They are not afraid of the plastic bag give way or tear now. And when I checked out at the Cashier counter, I did bring my own recycle bags to contain the items I bought. But I feel that the counter cashier shld not rush into the next customer before I can finish packing my things, as I am not just buying less than 5 items. I would compliment the staff at the NTUC JEM outlet who has the initiative of helping to pack the items into the recycle bags for their customers. I hope the management can sincerely look into their staff performance as he/she carries the name of the big and renowned organisation.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107645000538791165370/reviews
Dolly Queen,4,Not very big but they do sell quite alot of items.From vegetables to household items and even ensure milk.The aisles are quite narrow.Not very spacious.Service from the cashier was so-so.She seems to be in a hurry.Wants to serve the customers fast till to the extend she didnt even ask whether we are a member and I had to show it to her on my own accord.She kept on asking us how many plastic bags we need which in most of the outlets the cashiers will just remind us that each plastic bag is $0.05 and they dont keep on asking how many bags we need.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110896331946261998105/reviews
