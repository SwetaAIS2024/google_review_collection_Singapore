      "text": "The old receptionist, short hair, in glasses, working on 8Jun morning,  has a bad attitude. Firstly, she asked me to wait as she's in the midst of doing something. Fine. No empathy for patients and warned(not informing with courtesy)that patients with an appointment will get priority to see the doctor. This is as with other clinics, so what's the big deal. She was not even concerned about registering you, she requires an acceptance of her statement. I said I would leave given her bad attitude, she say go! Dr Tang, please change her out as her rudeness will only cause angst to an already sick patient. I mentioned that I will provide you the feedback and she said go ahead. It is appalling that you are not doing anything about it given all the negative reviews about your receptionist. No wonder this old hag has the least respect for you. I hope she doesn't fall sick and get the same kind of treatment elsewhere.\n\nToo bad for Dr Tang : If you do not want to deal with a rude receptionist before you see a doctor, go to Chinatown Wellness Clinic just upstairs Cross Clinic : Blk 531 Upper Cross Street #02-01. The receptionists are friendly and professional. Obviously, they know how to better manage the queue. Dr Lai is also very thorough and patient.",
