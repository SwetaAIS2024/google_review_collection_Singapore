Felicia Wong,5,"Cayden has stayed with them for a week. From the videos that they sent me, I could see cayden was happy and comfortable being there and this is very important to me. The place is very clean and the staff knows what they are doing :). Cayden has cancer and the staff took very good care in making sure he takes his medications timely. Once again, thank you everyone at pet boarding centre for taking care of my fur baby. Highly recommend and cayden will be back again. :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102900648196096815131/reviews
Nur Hafizah Jumari (Kaz),5,"My cats were under their care for 4 days. Upon arrival, was a bit concerned due to the dog noise and vicinity, but indoors it was very clean with no smell and I saw that the other cats in other rooms were lounging and rolling on their backs comfortably. They sent me daily morning videos to show how my cats are doing and I could see within two days even my more anxious cat was relaxed! Regina is clearly a cat lover and can hear her speak adoringly to my cats. I'm really impressed with the service and care they showed for my fur babies.üôèüôè‚ù§Ô∏è",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113293971494643919679/reviews
Emellia Rohman,5,"My recent experience boarding my cat here during my vacation was absolutely delightful! Initially apprehensive, we decided to visit the center first and Regina was incredibly helpful throughout the entire process. Despite the loud dog noises in the vicinity, the center itself is very conducive for cats. I had a fantastic experience, receiving daily updates including photos and videos of my cat. I'm confident that my cat also had a wonderful time there. I highly recommend this center for cat boarding!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115603390747260438583/reviews

Robin Lim,5,"Boarded my cats here multiple times. Rooms are clean and well cat proofed, and my cats are well taken care of. The daily morning videos give us the assurance that our cats are in good condition. Though there are dogs barking from the surrounding shelters and boarding houses, my cats are still able to settle down and eat normally.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114400789907700487621/reviews
