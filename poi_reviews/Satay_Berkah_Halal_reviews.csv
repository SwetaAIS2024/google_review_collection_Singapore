Gator,4,"A new satay stall that‚Äôs opened right in front of jia Yi tea house, close to the carpark. In fact, the tables are set on top of the parking lots itself.

The stall was quite busy when I visited on a Saturday night. If you are eating the lok lok next door, you can actually order the satay and have them served to your table.

The satay was quite generous in terms of its meat. The chicken is selling at 1.30 ringgit per stick and the beef at 1.60 ringgit. Not bad and they tasted good. The gravy was good as well. Sitting by the roadside eating satay had a rather nostalgic feel to it. Try if you are around the area.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
