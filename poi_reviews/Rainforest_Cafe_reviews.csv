Chin S,1,"This Sam Hennessy review has to be a fake. This is the most dismal cafe I have ever been too. The service is completely boh chap, and the place is filthy. I don’t know how anyone can screw up a simple cup of tea, but it was the grossest thing I ever sipped, at $3.20 !?! If I can give zero stars I would !!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115996631300718828388/reviews

Samuel Ng,4,A quiet place to have your meals. It can be hard to navigate and find this location as it is at a secluded area. Food is decent for the price.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105724618237040745842/reviews
