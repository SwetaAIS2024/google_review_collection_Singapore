      "text": "It‚Äôs a chain roast meat stall. Probably nth to do with andy lau. Their charsiew is pretty gd and also reasonably priced. I ordered from them a couple of times before. A single portion charsiew+roast pork rice with egg is only $4.80. Damn..the price for the current state of economy is considered quite reasonable alr. I often takeaway 200gm of charsiew for my fam which costs $10. 1kg costs $45. They also have this Dangui roasted duck which i‚Äôm tempted to try next. It‚Äôs something v quintessential msian. Dianxiaoer is known for it as well. But a whole duck here is only $45. Really not bad at all for a chain!",
