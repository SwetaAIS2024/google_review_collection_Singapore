The pricing is unbelievably cheap but more importantly the food quality was amazing! I got the roast pork with chicken rice and the price for it was only $5.5(!) you easily pay double at Maxwell or other hawker center.\n\nThis place deserves 7 stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è",

Ordered half roast chicken, quarter white chicken and 2 rice cost $34.00. Preference for boiled chicken over the roast chicken as the roast chicken is dried and less juicy.",

I've been eating at this place since about 2019 and their quality has been always consistent.\n\nJuicy, tender roasted chicken paired with their fluffy flavorful rice, topped with the addictive chill. They got everything right!\n\nI just wish it's easier for me to travel all the way to Novena so that I can eat it regularly!",

      "text": "Heard a lot about this chicken rice stall, especially since it's more often than not, being compared to Wee Nam Kee just nearby.\n\nIt's a great coffee shop chicken rice stall, and a very busy one during meal times. Reminds me of school time canteen food actually, since they have macaroni and noodle options here.\n\nGreat option for nearby office workers. Their roasted chicken rice is better than the white steamed chicken rice. Definitely cheaper than WNK as well. Add some oyster sauce vegetables, and you're good to go!",
