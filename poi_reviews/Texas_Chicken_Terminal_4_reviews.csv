Ferdiantono Lim,4,"I rarely fly from Terminal 4 at Changi Airport, but this time, I did and noticed a Texas Chicken outlet. I had been wondering how it tastes these days, so I decided to give it a try.

Needing a quick protein bite before my flight, I ordered their popcorn chicken. Unfortunately, the experience wasn’t the best, as some foreign tourists took an unnecessarily long time just to place a simple fast-food order. That aside, the popcorn chicken itself was decent.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117289056511151480296/reviews

Alfred Romeo,4,Can't complain about a meal in any airport for 12 Singapore dollars. Chicken burger was tender and tasty and really liked the coleslaw. The biscuit also went great with my coffee. Friendly staff too.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106439771249918416668/reviews
Elijah Tan,4,"Texas Chicken at T4 is a great spot for a quick and satisfying meal.

The service was fast and efficient, making it perfect for travelers to have a quick bite before their flight.

Their mashed potatoes and biscuits are especially delicious—rich and flavorful.

I do recommend if you are in T4 transit.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109287346354369266778/reviews
ri fieschi,4,"my first time eating texas chicken here in terminal 4 transit, ate this around 2am, the cheese fries wass super goood coz it was hot and the amount of cheese and mayonise was ALOTT!! thank you and appreciate for that.

the price wise was pricey at most for these 2 meals total was almost $25+?? which i meannn expensive but i have not much comment on that.

the chicken was mmmkayy and abit dry AHHH idky maybe just on that day, because i didnt go and eat again. (maybe i should if im really craving for it)

the onion rings was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside which is gOOOODD! also the honey butter biscuits really tasty with the amount of honey being battered?¿
