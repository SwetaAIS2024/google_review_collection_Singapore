The sauce was refreshing and well balanced, topped with thinly sliced cucumber. The Gado Gado has a good mix of crunchy bean sprouts, cabbage, tempeh, potatoes, eggs topped with fragrant peanut sauce",

You will know which shops are popular as there are often a long line!\nI totally recommend the $1 Kopi (aka coffee) and the nice traditional noodles (in the pic). You get to choose any other add-ons to your noodles. I chose the luncheon and an egg, and it cost $3.\nGreat value for money. Totally recommended. We'll be back tomorrow",
