      "text": "Finally open! Their hours don't seem to be accurate (unless they actually sold out by 9am when I visited on a Saturday previously...)\n\nTheir dough is actually more like a nian gao/muah chee rather than a spongy fluffy pancake (thick injera). Or like Korean sticky pancakes you find at their food markets in Seoul. When hot (uncle just made them) it's actually pretty sticky and soft, which I found didn't go as well with the pastes (I prefer some contrast in texture). After it cooled down, I liked it better.\n\nPeanut - 4.5 stars\nThe best of the lot for me, though it's incredibly messy to eat.\n\nRed bean - 4 stars\nPaste wasn't sweet, which was great.\n\nYam paste - 4 stars\nUnique filling but not much inside.\n\nWent around 9.15am again on a Saturday and there was quite the line. They only had peanut, red bean and 2 yam ones left.\n\n+++\n\nMade it on a Thursday before 6am and there was no line. They had everything except the salted bean.\n\nHaving tried it again and without having to line up, I'm not sure I'd return. Their \"pancakes\", as another reviewer aptly pointed out, have the texture of a tapioca kueh, so the bean paste don't provide as much of a contrast in texture as the crushed peanuts. When cooled, the gumminess comes out more as well. I like fluffier pancakes...\n\nPandan green bean paste - 2 stars\nNot much flavour, and the filling was an artificial bright green.\n\nBlack sesame - 4 stars\nOne of the better ones, with ample filling, though the filling is a bit dry. I'm not a big fan of sesame.",

Ah gong and Ah ma were slowly getting ready as I beat any possible crowd, by arriving at 0340hrs.\n\nSeated steps from the stall patiently swiping my mobile, up til the aroma of steaming pancake competed with the wet market had my attention. Ah ma flicked the switch to light up their signboard at approximately 0415hrs.\n\nWarm chewy gooey goodness sandwiching a big heap of crushed peanut, very lightly sweetened with white granulated sugar. A smallish 2 bite portion for 80 cents.\n\nNot the crispy crust type. Nevertheless very addictive.",
