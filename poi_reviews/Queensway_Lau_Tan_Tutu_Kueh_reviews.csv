DaX Toh,5,"Traditional Tutu Kueh made to perfection. A dying art helmed by Kerwin, the friendly 3rd generation boss. Used to have a branch in Ion Orchard as well but unfortunately that closed during Covid. Many born in the 80s/90s would have grown up eating this yummy snack. With rising costs and rental, and the younger generation always wanting to try the next fad in food, this is a snack that could potentially disappear when the current generation of hawkers retire. So come on down to try it if you miss it for old times sakes. Besides Tutu Kueh, the stall sells other stuff such a Muah Chee, Tea Eggs and Waffles as well. It’s solely for takeaway so don’t expect a nice comfy sit down area like a cafe. :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110795556109846185546/reviews
Xdd Shuaige,2,"They’re more famous for their atrocious service.

Auntie ignored me despite seeing me for a whole minute never mind. Accidentally said 茶鸡蛋 (tea egg) instead of 茶叶蛋 (tea leaf egg) since the spelling on their menu is different and the cashier auntie went on a scolding spree, scolding me thrice in 10 seconds that I confused her and she doesn’t understand what I want. Is it that tough to understand when you’re only selling one kind of egg.. 😔

Taste not bad. No egg skin on the outside so don’t need to peel. Quite fuss-free to eat. But that experience left a sour taste in my mouth. Despite the bad reviews, wanted to visit to visit since I grew up eating their tutu kueh and cup corn before they rebranded and became so commercialised with the merchandise.

Will not come back again :/",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118200494995391997118/reviews

One of the best or perhaps the best place to get kueh tutu with the affordable pricing and good quality. I often ordered peanuts and coconut.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102392172058235258162/reviews
EQ Xavier,5,"Ordered a piece of peanut waffles, I was sceptical when the auntie took a piece that's sitting on the side and reheated it. So using this cooking method of double cooking the waffles, it creates a crunchy texture instead of the normal soft and fluffy. The peanut is spread thinly to avoid any wastage from leaking out, this also avoids ur teeth having sticky mess afterwards.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105533019712721928126/reviews
Jason Lim,5,"Happened to be around Queensway so decided to have a quick snack of Tu Tu Kueh and Original Waffles. 😋 Had the peanut 🥜 filled Tu Tu Kueh. 😋 Though there was a long queue but worth the wait. 👍 Quality is still the same after so many years. 👌 Just like wine 🍷, gets better with age. 😂👍 Highly recommend all Tu Tu Kueh lovers to check them out when around the area. 👍 Definitely a satisfactory experience. 👊💪👍",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108711445962963678471/reviews
