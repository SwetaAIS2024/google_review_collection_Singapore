      "text": "A cozy private gallery with brilliant artists gathered to featured their works with a theme. The combination of digital arts to fashion as well as material experimentation were intriguing to max. Not to mention, we were well received by knowledgeable intern from NTU which we have forgotten to ask for her name. Her explanations top with light banter and discussion hyped the experience. It was nice to meet the artists and understand their works from their perspectives. Thank you organisers.",

The works that this studio collects is pretty interesting and goes back down to the Asian roots of many of these artists, whether they are Chinese, Indonesian, or Singaporean. Only thing though, don't expect the artworks to be anywhere near commercialised works at Opera or those bigger boys.",
