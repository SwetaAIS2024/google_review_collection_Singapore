James Pee,5,"Wide selection of beer (including soju) at reasonable prices. Discounts available for more 2 / 6 bottles depending on products.

Small place but well stocked.

Cashless payment only paynow and paylah.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111424365104745497160/reviews
Florence Ang,5,"I heard good things about this store so I decided to pay it a visit.

First off, the prices are very reasonable, with many canned drinks selling at a dollar.

I also found interesting items ranging from Hai Di Lao hotpots and ready to eat soups to a wide variety of beers and other alcohol.

But what particularly caught my eye was their own brand of ice cream called uGelato.

The candy cotton bubble gum flavour intrigued me. But I decided on buying the apple strudel and sea salt chendol because they have a combo price at two cups for only $6.10!

I am super impressed that the apple strudel taste just like the real thing! And the chendol is a new take on a favourite dessert of mine.

I will surely be back.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103627904388034597772/reviews
