Ann Koh,5,"Miss Loi is really engaging with the students. With her guidance, children can grasp the concept fast. She is alone determined lady, no matter how difficult the child is she will not give up and have them work with her. My first two children recommended their younger sibling to join Miss Loi's class as they have improved tremendously under Miss Loi's coaching.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100546548247570597231/reviews
Karen Lim,5,"We are very very grateful for Ms Loi's dedication, patience and effective teaching methods that worked so well. My daughter started classes with Ms Loi since Sec 1 and obtained A1s for both Mathematics in the O levels exams that she sat for last year. Ms Loi is not only knowledgeable but also very approachable and supportive of the students, providing clarifications that my girl posed to her. Once again, thank you Ms Loi.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110663144195577014287/reviews
Chloe Ng,5,My twin girls have been going to Ms Loi for over 5 years now since their PSLE. I must say we owe a huge lot to Ms Loi for her dedication and methods that really work in our current academic system. They had been failing and barely passing when they first started tuition to getting As!  Am very happy to share honestly that Ms Lois methods are efficient and they were getting As almost continuously which helped in their confidence so much. Thank you Ms Loi!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113032368096897573778/reviews
