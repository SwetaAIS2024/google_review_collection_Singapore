Oz Aksugur,3,"It is great that there is a Guardian Pharmacy at Kallang Wave Mall, part of the Singapore Sports Hub.  Handy if you are there for some sports or an event.  However, the Guardian group hardly ever keeps a pharmacist at this location anymore, so perscription/medical needs may not always be met.  Good for ‘health & beauty’ as the name implies.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107744238467743039130/reviews
Madeleine Lee,1,"I was trying out the Jergens body butter when a staff came up to me and told me in a heavy Filipino accent that I couldn't try any of the lotions. I pointed to her that I was trying out the tester. It was clearly labelled ""tester"". Can't she see it for herself? Please hire a more knowledgeable staff in the future.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113459756000090252612/reviews
geeta cherian,1,"I went to the Guardian store at Kallang wave mall on the 18th of April sometime between 11 Am to 1 pm and had a question about mask sizes. Was told by the cashier who was the only staff around to go check myself. I ended up buying my masks at the Fairprice Xtra .
So my experience/review about this guardian store is - the staff was extremely unhelpful.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115398906862285943799/reviews
