Dinesh Nesz_Film,5,"We had a fantastic dining experience at Curry & Kimchi Lounge, thanks to the generous invitation from the owner! The fusion menu was impressive, with dishes that seamlessly blended flavors from different cultures. Our kids loved the variety of options, and my wife and I enjoyed the creative twists on classic dishes.

The service was warm and attentive, adding to the overall warmth of the evening. We're grateful for the hospitality and can't wait to return!

Highly recommend for families and foodies alike.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113179389405629330254/reviews
