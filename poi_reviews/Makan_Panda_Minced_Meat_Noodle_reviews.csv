Pam S,1,"I ordered from the app and waited until the app showed it’s ready for collection. Then, when I went to collect but staff asked me to go and queue. When it was my turn, the uncle told me to read out my order out loud so it can be done faster (apparently they don’t even bother to check my online order).
