      "text": "The staff was very accommodating.\n\nLost a star due to mixed popcorn being mostly salty. This was clarified later to be due to poor mixing of the caramel for the sweet popcorn therefore the sweet popcorn is practically its own sweet & salty.\n\nThe other issue is in the cinema room, the exit signs (which I know need to be illuminated) really affect the film. It especially irritates as I have astigmatism and the bright green partially obscured the film.",

      "text": "I've been to many movie theatres from different countries. But my experience with Golden Village was pretty nice. It’s one of my favourite theatre till now. The sound Quality was good and the screen was quite bigger, so they've done their work on this. The hall was nicely clean and they have an Air Cooling system. So in summer, you can enjoy your show comfortably. I visited which is located in Jurong Point. In front of the theatre you’ll find restaurants, in case you're hungry. There's also a ticket vending machine and you can book tickets  online.",

I am a PARENT. it’s not like i am letting her go by herself right? And just because of that, i had to waste 20 FREAKING DOLLARS on your stupid tickets. I demanded for a refund but your stupid malaysian manager said that we can’t get that because of your stupid policy. At least you could’ve gave us a refund for the tickets that I wasted. But no. You had to be more extra by not giving us a refund. Thanks alot golden village.",

      "text": "Terrible Sound Quality\n\nWent to Golden Village at Jurong Point yesterday for Tamil movie and the sound system was utter garbage. Zero clarity, low volume, and completely ruined the movie experience. For the price we pay, this is unacceptable. Felt like a total waste of time and money. Wouldn’t recommend this location unless they seriously fix their audio setup.",
