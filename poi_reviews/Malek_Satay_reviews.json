The peanut sauce is moderate. Well maybe the owner was rushing today as there were much crowded.  Burning up the satay faster than usual.",

We just ate satay from another queuing stall but that one was sweet and with coloring so definitely not to my liking. The beef satay here was meaty, nicely marinated infused with lemongrass and grilled with the smokiness from the charcoal. Very sedap! ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹Must try the mutton satay next time as it was sold out.",
