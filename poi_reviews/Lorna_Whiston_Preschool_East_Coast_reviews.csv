amanda siew,5,"My son absolutely loves going to school here! The most important thing we looked for in a preschool was a warm, loving environment—and this school truly delivers. The teachers genuinely care for the children, and there’s great communication and accountability between parents and staff.

All enrichment classes are included in the fees, so every child gets to join in without feeling left out. I also appreciate the many fun activities planned throughout the year, with opportunities for parents to participate too!

Knowing my son is so well cared for gives me peace of mind every day. Highly recommend this preschool to any parent looking for a nurturing and engaging space for their child.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117694367512153610080/reviews
Vanessa J,5,"My child has been with the school since 2022. I’m very happy with the school, the teacher turnover has been very low and a lot of the teachers from 2022 are still there, the principal and her staff are highly communicative and easy to reach, and most importantly my child enjoys going to school. The masterclasses are interesting and engaging, with some highly accomplished teachers, and the core teachers are caring and supportive. There is also a warm community of parents who often get involved in the school’s parent-child activities. I highly recommend the Lorna Whiston East Coast preschool.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106087426506219769031/reviews

Joann Pang,5,"It’s definitely a great preschool for kids! My daughter has been there since 2021, the teachers are always warm, welcoming and friendly. Very prompt communication via app & WhatsApp. The school always put in a lot of effort in organising activities that parents can participate in together.
My child loves going to school everyday, there’s a good balance of indoor and outdoor activities for the kids to ensure holistic learning.  Definitely one of the best pre-schools in my opinion, highly recommended!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117234831355655561190/reviews
Abhisek Rai,5,"3 of my kids have been to this school with one currently still attending.

I really like that the teachers are really warm and everyone in the team instantly makes the kids and even me very comfortable.

I also love all the activities they have that involve parents and various outdoor activities to let kids be kids.

Kudos to everyone involved in this school.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113418124446839169050/reviews
