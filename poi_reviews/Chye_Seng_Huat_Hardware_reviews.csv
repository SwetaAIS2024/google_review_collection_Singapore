mahvelous,5,"Atmospheric coffee bar; they even capitalized on actual rust for the front facade. If I am not mistaken this used to be an actual retro Chye Seng Huat Hardware store which has been preserved. I tried their cappuccino Throwback (House blend) with notes of caramel and hazlenut which was creamy and lovely - I loved that they don't charge more for oat milk option -- and a pistachio lemon loaf which is not what I would normally have for breakfast. I ordered some takeaway croissants and pain au chocolat, a milky way croissant with white chocolate and chocolate dusting, and some muffins that came with a cute paperbag for an extra 30cents.

The waitstaff are attentive and efficient. The vibe feels like Brooklyn hipster industrial with a moody warmth from edison light bulbs splashes of chrome and steel and wood barstools and midcentury style chairbacks. There is outdoor seating as well which I think would be especially lovely at night. I included screenshots from their ordering site, as it was well designed and user friendly.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110193081714382721143/reviews
Kate,4,"The brews are above average, and the baked goods hold their ownâ€”particularly the chocolate loaf. The service reminds me of a chain store experience, the ambiance more than makes up for it. The location is stunningly beautiful, uniquely charming, and perfect for anyone seeking photogenic spots to enjoy a cup of coffee.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100966531425160994597/reviews
Ling Sg,4,"One could see from the photos shared here how an old hardware shop is preserved to give a nostalgic feel.
The coffee is nice and cakes are of rich flavour. 5 of us paid $75 for 5 beverages and 3 pieces of cake. We came here after a heavy dinner, so we didn't try other food.

The seating is limited for big group, and outside seats are not sheltered, so overall, it is a small cafe.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107153795203347743102/reviews
Neil Jimenez,5,"Finally returned to CSHH since 2019.

Their coffee game has improved. This time we had the pour overs. They have a decent selection with some beans having unique flavor notes. I liked it. The barista who prepared my coffee looked very professional and skilled.

You have the option to seat inside or outside. Because of the summer heat, I stayed inside.

They encourage to order via the QR code that leads you to their website where you can order and pay.

Smooth and informative service. Not too crowded too.

Highly recommend.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103931522674995265912/reviews
Vincent F.,3,Coffee was good but food was so so. The egg with croissant could have been seasoned with some salt. Also the wild rocket that comes with it can be mixed with baby spinach or other greens to lighten the bitterness from the wild rocket.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103302796099074107821/reviews
