Pet David96,5,"This is our highly trusted all-year-round anchor minimart for our estate …very well stocked and price are very reasonable and competitive for easy accessibility for neighbourhood dwellers. The Owner and staff are friendly and neighbourly .. for those ??? who complained;  I believe u don’t lived here but are  Casual drop-in ! These people do not give true representation for us faithful neighbours especially the seniors who see this minimart as a true blessing and a must goto place for our estate!

Paul Bishop,5,No idea what others are saying here but we've always had a welcome from Auntie in her store.  We moved house about 6months ago but up until we did this was our go to shop for all the little bits in walking distance. Thanks for all the shopping over the years and the occasional mandarin lesson from Auntie!,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109154374873613714022/reviews
Wendy Ho,1,"Lousy experience. Male and female boss very arrogant. Foul face. Treat me like thief. Very tense shopping at there. Their son slammed the cashier drawer and turn his back on me. I will let Minister in charge of our area know about their negative treatment. Turn the neighbourhood spirit low, although they paste so many pictures smiling and holding hands with the Ministers, but treat customers with foul face and arrogance, what is the point of having their presence here.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103570221510122078623/reviews
