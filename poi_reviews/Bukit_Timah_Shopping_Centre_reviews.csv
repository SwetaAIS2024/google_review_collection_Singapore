Prawnsalad1991,5,"Many tuition agencies, traditional Singapore food, workout classes. What is very unique about this mall is the old style, mosaic, doors, lift lobby, toilet and corridors. Very nostalgic.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103203190516039640744/reviews
Tuina Bao,3,"These two Caucasian students were seen on a number of occasions preying on the female foreign domestics workers. They would wait for opportunities to sit next to them n then racking conversations with one or two of them.
Their motives are really questionable.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105428932608035085590/reviews

Xin Hao,3,"Not much agenda to be here other than if you are looking to helper employment for your home. There are a couple of reputable ones here from reviews - you can search them up through google but have not personally engaged with any of them directly.

A few small eateries are present as well, most possibly to accommodate to the tenants. Looks delicious nonetheless with reasonable pricing. Very traditional delicacies as well which brings back fond memories.

Other tuition centres, tailors, and massage parlors are also located here - mostly catered to the regulars living around the area.

Overall a good mall with good layout but of course not as commercialized. It serves its purpose at the end of the day.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101038177603319548234/reviews
