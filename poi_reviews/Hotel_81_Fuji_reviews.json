      "text": "I had a deeply frustrating experience at Hotel 81 Fuji at Balestier and would strongly advise against booking this hotel.\n\nOther budget hotel is still better.\n\nUpon arrival, there was confusion about the requirement for a physical IC due to a new government policy, and the staff handled it with little flexibility. Despite eventually providing my IC, the room was nothing like the photos on Agodaâ€”no window, not as clean, and far less spacious.\n\nWhen I spoke to Zai and the female staff at the counter, there were conflicting instructions. Zai initially confirmed it was fine for me to register under my name, but later insisted my friend had to register as a visitor, which didnâ€™t make sense and was never communicated clearly.\n\nThis led to a heated exchange where Zai became unprofessional, raising his voice and telling me not to speak to him anymore.\n\nWhen I clarify if I will get my full refund & I would like to cancel this booking. Which initially the Indian female staff offered. He continued to not answer me & tell me to directly speak to Agoda. He will not answer me.\n\nAdding to the confusion, the female staff promised a free cancellation, but then later said there would be a one-night penalty, because we already took the keys and went into the room. which was never mentioned during check-in.\n\nWhen we requested a refund, we were told to contact Agoda directly, even though the staff member had originally said she could provide a full refund immediately.\n\nIn my opinion, the staffsâ€™ communication was inconsistent, with Zai contradicting himself, and how the Indian lady was not fully transparent, the overall handling of the situation was unprofessional.\n\nIf Zai was so knowledgeable, why didnâ€™t he step in to clarify things when we were talking to the other staff?\n\nThe lack of clarity and poor customer service left me feeling dissatisfied. I would never recommend this hotel based on my experience.\n\nOverall itâ€™s not that cheap, price really donâ€™t justify the quality of this hotel.\n\nBook with caution. Unless your expectations is really all the way down to hell.",
