      "text": "It has always been a reliable point for parcel collection in the past, until recently. On 13 March, which was the first day of the parcel collection, I arrived at 9.45pm. Closing time is 10pm. The young guy has already locked up the place. Knocked on door and he shook his head. I tried again and asked for parcel collection and he signalled no again. It's not asking him to open the cash register, I thought it's just done on a mobile phone. Forget it, I returned on 14 March, arrived at 9.15pm, quite ahead of closing. Door was locked and this time a lady was mopping the floor. Another customer soon arrived at she continued, nonchalantly for the next 5-10min, without giving a care. Finally she opened the door and asked what I wanted, I said parcel collection, and she said \"10 minutes\" rudely. This is simply ridiculous and a total waste of my time. Sadly, I think this is the last time I'm setting this place for my parcel collection/drop off.",

Talking to the phone all the while n never bother to attend to customers.\n\nTold her I wanted to collect parcel, gave me colours to see. Repeated many times of my pin to her she couldn't catch it.. Cause she was busy talking to d guy in her loudspeaker phone. Yet she still gave me that look n tsk me. Blamed me it was my issue cause I didn't tell her what I wanted...\nI had to very slowly read each number for her to capture that.\n\nLet's see how long they can sustain. Good luck. Bye.",
