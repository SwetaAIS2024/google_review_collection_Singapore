dewanty anggraini,4,"Been there once because this place is one of the bus stops to Malaysia.
The mall is small and quiet
The location is near MRT station",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118402499401962560420/reviews
Ashley Liew,5,Excellent location along East Coast Road importantly with its own car park that is open air. There is at least one preschool here and several enrichment centres. NTUC FairPrice Finest supermarket is a huge plus. Eateries and other stores available in this cosy but modern centre situated beside a hotel.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
Alysa Nguyen,5,"Superb hotel! The staffs are so kind and accommodating. The room is massive.  Our bedroom comes with stove, fridge, washer and dryer. They have free nespresso machine and pods if you need your coffee first thing in the morning. It’s located next to the mall and small hawker center, so your food will come with plenty of price point. Under our hotel is a super market so you will have everything you need. It’s my first time in SEasia so I don’t know much but Singapore is super humid so if we don’t turn on our AC, our floor feels like sweat, and the rooms feels muggy. So blast the AC and it should be fine. The lobby of the hotel smells wonderful, the room lobby not so much. Our room has two balconies, the view was okay. We have a standing shower and bathtub with all the a amenities you would need in it. I would recommend this hotel/ if something seems off, just contact front desk and they will resolve it/",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114616178952471804573/reviews
Jane Hearn,4,"Lovely, helpful, friendly staff and hotel  with big rooms with fantastic huge shower, great water pressure and bathroom facilities.   Lovely pool too.  Restaurant expensive, didn't eat there.  Booked 6 months ago and advised we needed early check in and would only be staying 9 hours during the day.  Response was prompt,  would see what they could do to accommodate our request.  Room was ready at 9am , but we had to pay an extra 118 singapore dollars for early check in which was not advised earlier.   That was disappointing.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109286852297040233454/reviews
Rajata Mehra,5,"It's a nice compact self contained shopping complex, spread over full ground floor and half of first and second floors.

The ground floor has a FairPrice store, a general store, and several more small utilities stores.

First floor has a nice Cafe offering fabulous bakery products, coffee and other beverages.
Theresa also a massage parlor.

Second floor has some offices and commercial units.

This place is very well complimented by an array of eateries and Food & Pub outlets across the road along East Coast Road.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109639360646546384639/reviews
