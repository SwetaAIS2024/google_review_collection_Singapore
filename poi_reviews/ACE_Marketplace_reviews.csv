Ayako N,4,"This is a convenience store located in Bedok North.

The store is not that big, but they carry a wide variety of products. (For some reason, I couldn't find any mineral water.) The store also sells gin from Japan's ROKU, canned beer, and Jacob's Chardonnay wine ($26 before tax).",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111715625032920437828/reviews
