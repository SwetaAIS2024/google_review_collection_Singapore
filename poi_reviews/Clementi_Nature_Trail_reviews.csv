Dani Baal,4,"The Clementi Nature Trail is a scenic nature walk located in the Clementi area of Singapore, offering an escape from the city’s hustle and bustle. The trail winds through lush greenery and is popular among nature enthusiasts, hikers, and bird watchers. It provides an opportunity to explore Singapore’s rich flora and fauna, particularly the biodiversity of the surrounding forests and woodland areas.

The trail connects various parks and green spaces, making it a part of the larger network of nature reserves and trails that promote outdoor activities and environmental conservation in Singapore. The Clementi Nature Trail is suitable for those looking for a peaceful outdoor experience, with well-maintained paths and opportunities for leisurely walks, photography, and relaxation in nature.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103357020897930875043/reviews
Forest BK,5,"Clementi Nature Trail forms part of the Clementi Nature Corridor that would eventually connect up with Holland Green Linear Park and onward to the Rail Corridor.
At the moment, only this stretch of the trail is completed.
This stretch of Clementi Nature Trail offers a generously wide path covered with short soft grasses. Running next to Ulu Pandan Road winding up a gentle slope it ends at a forested area (not connected yet, so you need to U-Turn back).
As the young trees were newly planted, it may not provide enough good shade.
Nonetheless, enjoy the tranquility it offers.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Yong Seng Soh,1,A disappointing trail that starts and ends nowhere for now. Seems to be poor planning as this trail is completed more than a year ago but is somehow left undone with a dead end that hits a wall of forest. The original landscape was amazingly pretty but due to poor planning and disuse the trail is quite overgrown by now.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105602530892384718258/reviews
