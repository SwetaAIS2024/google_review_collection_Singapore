      "text": "This is the only carrot cake stall in the hawker centre. It has a nondescript shop front but saw good success when it opened recently.\n\nA fairly large portion of carrot cake was generously served for a low price of $3. The egg was still slightly crispy at the edges and the radish cubes had a good bite. I finished my meal without feeling like it was too oily or greasy.\n\nThe char kway teow and oyster omelette seemed to be a hit with other patrons too. Do go early as the food sells out fast.",
