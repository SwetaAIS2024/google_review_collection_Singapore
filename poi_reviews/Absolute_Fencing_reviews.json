      "text": "My child is an introvert who does not like outdoor sports, as such we decided to introduce fencing to her when we chanced upon ABF. We knew very little of this sport and alot of uncertainties and unfamiliarities set in when we decided to let her join ABF. We were impressed by Coach Ye Kai during the trial lesson because he guided my child with confidence and explained patiently throughout the trial lesson. We signed up with ABF after the trial. Since then, Coach Ye Kai has been very encouraging, my child becomes more confident and more interested in sports. We realised that fencing is not only about complex physical manoeuvre, it also requires mental discipline to perform properly and well. Taking this opportunity,  we would like to thank Coach Wenying and Coach Daniel too, for guiding our child during the Minime competition. She was extremely nervous on that day and made so many mistakes. We thought that she would be daunted by the competition. However, the coaches at ABF went through a post competition debrief session with her and it turned out to be an enriching experience with positive takeaways. Kudos to all ABF Coaches! Thank you for your passion in guiding the little kids to fence! You have made fencing into a safe and fun sport for the young ones to learn!! Many thanks ðŸ˜Š",
