Azhar Khan (Presbyterian),5,"Just graduated from here [On 14 November 2024].There are many good, kind ,and friendly teachers.One is Mr Lite, Ms Chua ,Mrs Toh and Cikgu Naz. Canteen has very good people and food, especially the Auntie and Uncle at the Western Stall. Because of a certain English teacher, my English skyrocketed and gave me motivation in P3. When I got my results, my two  P1 & P2 teachers congratulated me on my Malay as I got AL 6. Being an Indian taking Malay, it was hard.With tuition and help from Cikgu Naz and my classmates,I was the first to get 41\50 for Prelims Malay Oral . When Cikgu Naz told this to my Malay class, the reaction was a grand applause. My jaw dropped [metaphorically]. Many or even, all of my accomplishments are purely because of my teacher's support and unwavering determination [look the phrases up, you are on the internet]. Parents, if you are living in Toa Payoh or somewhere nearby, this school is most suitable for your kids' primary school journey.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117436063073636775661/reviews

k,5,"i had a great time at this primary school, it was enjoyable, dont listen to other reviews that its bad, other than the football court being small, and the P5 and p4 being naughty, I graduated last year in 2024 i was in 6.7 my teachers was really kind, they could be fierce sometimes though just dont be naughty lol my honest rating is a 3 star but i want to be positive and make it 5 stars if u are a parent and plan on making ur child join this school, the food is really good but i feel like some is overpriced, the western stall aunty is the best overall, if you live in toapayoh or bishan, this is the best option, its nearest to bradell mrt just walk and theres also a macdonald nearby",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111722032904140457628/reviews
Selvi,5,"Kheng Cheng is best primary school on earth. They really pay attention to each child well being. Now i m having my daughter always not happy if being sick and cant go to school and she is at primary 2. There is homeworks and she likes it. We really love the teachers here. From security to seller in the canteen are all very kind, gentle and understanding. I think this is the culture of caring has been embedded in this school. Hope they will make secondary school in the future because to find school who pay attention to student well being and not merely academic is RARE now.

Rizqin,4,"I graduated in 2023, and for the three years I have studied there, I have found my experience enjoyable. I liked my p5-6 class better than my p4 one. I really liked Cikgu Amirah she was nice and she told us ghost stories sometimes.
