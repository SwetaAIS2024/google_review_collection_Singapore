      "text": "Service was excellent! There is both indoor and outdoor seating. I opted for outdoor seats and was treated with the sighting of a beautiful peacock. The service staff was patient and friendly. Baguette was served hot, the orange juice was freshly squeezed, quality tea and grandmaâ€™s chocolate was lovely. It would be wonderful if the basket of mini viennoiseries were soft hot too! The jam deserves a special mention too. Definitely a cheaper option if you donâ€™t want to pay for hotel breakfast and if you donâ€™t want a heavy breakfast. (Read on trip advisor that people are asking for cheaper option with RWS eateries under renovation.) Only set back is table is a little small but they are very thoughtful to cater to family of adult and children diners. 2 adults can dine at bigger table while the 2 children dine at the childrenâ€™s table ðŸ˜Š",

This has been one of the best restaurant experiences we've had in quite a while.\n\nThe gallete and crepe we had were quite good. My wife found the food all a little overpowering, hence the 4 stars in aggregate for food quality. I personally thought that was the best crepe I've had in Asia or Europe though.",

She's kind, friendly and capable. It's always nice to chat with her when I visit.\n\nI'm looking forward to my next visit. (I keep inviting my friends so I have an excuse to go back :)",
