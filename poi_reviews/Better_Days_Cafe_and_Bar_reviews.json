Owner is super friendly, and absolutely love that it’s tucked away from the hustle and bustle of the food centre. Drinks were refreshing, and the atmosphere at night is also really nice for hangouts. Will definitely come back again, it’s must-visit hidden gem at Beauty World!",

Drinks come out fast and are consistently good, which is kind of rare to find.\n\nThe vibe at night is just perfect—chill but lively, just the right kind of atmosphere to hang out and enjoy. Definitely one of my favourite spots to grab a drink and unwind.",

The atmosphere is absolutely perfect—cozy, inviting, and just the right balance of lively and relaxed.\nThe staff is friendly and the music is great. It’s my go-to spot to reset after a long day. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a welcoming place to relax!",
