There’s a mix of seating — quiet study zones, comfy lounge chairs, and group discussion rooms if you need to collaborate. The views from the windows are also a nice bonus, especially if you snag a seat by the glass.\n\nTech-wise, it's well-equipped with plenty of power sockets, printers, and fast Wi-Fi. The online resources and book selection are solid, especially if you're in engineering or tech — not surprising, given it's right next to the School of Computer Science and Engineering.\n\nIt can get pretty packed during exam season, so go early if you want a good spot.
