Martin Yeo,5,"Quiet and tranquil place for a hike or stroll. Bring your camera as there will be plenty of photo opportunities. Bring yourself alone, with a partner, friends or family, whoever comes here will be awed and satisfied with the serenity of this place.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107217464996017596553/reviews
karuni chan,5,"Exploring part of the Bukit Timah Rail Corridor from King Albert Park to Rail Mall. We met at King Albert Park mrt stn exit A. Started our walk towards Truss Bridge. Under and near the bridge, we saw a directional sign to former Bukit Timah Railway station. Part of the railway track was kept and construction was underway to preserve the former station. We saw lots of joggers, cyclists and walkers along the way. After visiting this part, we detoured back and followed the Woodlands directional sign which brought us onto Truss bridge. The path is easy to trek on with lots of local floral and fauna. There are exit points to Bukit Timah Plaza, Bukit Timah Hill Station, etc. We reached another Truss Bridge, end point exit to Rail Mall at Hillview. Construction works are on-going from this point. Hence, it is blocked. Completion and opening will be after mid 2024 (according to the information posted).",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104430049843327442475/reviews
Evan Lau,5,The Rail Corridor section at Rifle Range Rd has been recently reopened. Check out the old Bukit Timah Railway Station which has been restored along with a nearby cafe for hikers to take a break at. The hike towards Tanjong Pagar is about 10km. Nearest MRT station is King Albert Park along the Downtown Line (Blue line).,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102053587096986647755/reviews
Urban Explorer,5,Fantastic trail to break a sweat through this humid natural forest section. Some trail se√ßtions are pure gravel only so remember to wear appropriate footwear. This point is through the old Bukit Timah railway station.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110591086467295236142/reviews
Gao Ziqing (Chijtpss),5,"The road is very nice. You get to enjoy the scenery as well as much of nature. It is a good place to cycle, jog, and exercise, and relax. The only thing to look out for is the high number of insects and spiders.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110698770976443238256/reviews
