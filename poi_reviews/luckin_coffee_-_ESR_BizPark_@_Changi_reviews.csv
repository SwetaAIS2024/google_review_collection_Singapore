Skye Cai,4,"Tried the rich extract latte.
It tastes a bit weird, not sure is it because it‚Äôs heavily extracted.
Taste very bitter. Especially after the ice melt, it tastes very diluted.
Fast servicing especially good for the mobile ordering.
Collect time was earlier than expected too.
Staff very friendly.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
Izad Kim,5,Would say the coffee is decent and also had their refreshing Zesty Pamelo which is very sweet and tangy. If only I can request for less sweet. Anyway I enjoyed my drinks ! The staff are friendly too.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105903714027272381170/reviews
jia,2,"Not a really pleasant experience because we had to download an app or register as a member to get coffee. It‚Äôs not tourist-friendly. We don‚Äôt have a Singapore phone number because we‚Äôre only staying here for three days, but registering often requires a phone number. That took us about 10mins to figure it out and order coffee lolü§£
Anyways, coconut latte was good, normal latte was bad as hell. Hope this helps.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101409143603134957072/reviews
Wendy Loh (whimsea.wanderer),5,"Gotta take the chance to try this Iced Big Cheese Latte when luckin coffee sends a voucher.

Whilst I‚Äôm still missing the toffee hazelnut latte that I had during the Christmas period, I‚Äôve got no regrets trying this. Really love this combi! The cheese is not overpowering and it complements the coffee very well. üëçüèª",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116391448637858467398/reviews
Su Sahiman,5,Had their Xmas drinks - Toffee Hazelnut Latte and it was a good blend of bitter + sweetness. Ordered for takeaways back to office and they sealed the cups well so there were no spillage. Acceptable waiting time and the staff were friendly. I came for the decor too üéÑ,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109432401445615531300/reviews
