Douglas Seah,4,Food is good and expectedly unhealthy. Sunny side up is individually fried which taste different from mass produced type. The ingredients are quite similar to other shops. They add chye poh for you as well. Amazing.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107477715700835137855/reviews
YY,4,"Chanced upon this after I had my breakfast one day and visited immediately the second day, seeing that the queue was rather long versus other stalls.

An affordable bee Hoon stall that‚Äôs great for breakfast, albeit a little oily, they do serve up a decent range of fried food for breakfast.

Definitely one that I will return in future üëçüèª",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews

Albert B TAY,3,"From past memories... Old school. Eaten this stall noodle since my very very young days.. Faithful customers for their. 3 generations.  Will drive back every month even I moved out of toa payoh 20years ago. Their cai po added extra favoring and texture to the fried noodles. Yummy!

What I dislike is their lack of professionalism, they will close and open when they feel like it since 10 years ago.  No pattern or routine for years.

Recently this market finished renovation and reopened on 1 May 2021. They keep shifting their opening date till today (3 Jul 2021), still close. Just a torn paper... Closed till... With different dates overwritten and cancel.  I had been coming to this market every weekend from Punggol craving for it!

========= updated 10 July 2021 ========

Finally opened. Changed owner. Taste different. There gone my 40yrs of childhood memories, taste, and 2 months effort wasted waiting for it to open since 1 May 2021 after market renovation coming weekly from Punggol!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106117696160686257386/reviews
