      "text": "Had a very unpleasant experience trying to drop off some Ninjavan packages for pick up. Went in at 930am and there was 1 staff attending to 2 customers in queue. She then told me she is very busy now and cannot scan the packages I want to drop off, and told me to leave it at a corner so that she can scan later. I told her it is ok, and I can wait till she is less busy before attends to me. It is our company policy to witness the handing over and scan in of the packages as we had bad experience in the past when we lost packages when we did not see for ourselves the packages being scanned. Anyway the staff at Angel Supermart was extremely rude about it, tell me next time to come after 11am as morning is very busy. I thank her, and brought my packages to nearby 7-eleven instead. Will never return.",

Generally it sells small items needed daily. Good to visit and buy dish washing soup, newspaper, cloth hanger, etc. Not a big fancy shop, it just what you need with affordable price",
