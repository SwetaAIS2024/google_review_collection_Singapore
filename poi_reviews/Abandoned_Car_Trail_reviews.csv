Meng Fai Yip,5,"First hike of 2025! It was an AMAZING HIKE. We did the following:

Botanic Gardens MRT Station > University Road > Kheam Hock Park > Trail Entrance > Abandoned Cars (two and a half cars) > ""Avatar"" Trees > Bukit Brown Cemetery > Lornie Highway Bus Stop > Adam Food Centre (pit stop, via bus) > Botanic Gardens MRT Station

Difficulty level = 2 out of 5. It would be good to bring hiking poles along, especially for the first two portions of the Trail.

Here are some photos of the Abandoned Cars and the trail leading to them.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109238839349859158213/reviews
