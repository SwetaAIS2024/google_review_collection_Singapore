J L,5,"I had an exceptional experience with Dr. Johnson and his team. Despite the severe pain from my corneal erosion, they were incredibly gentle and patient throughout the examination. Their calm demeanor and skillful handling made me feel reassured and cared for during a difficult time. The patient service associates are very responsive and friendly too. I truly appreciate their expertise and compassionate approach to patient care.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105488781287596207867/reviews

Celeste Loh,5,"Dr Foo Fong Yee has been the only eye doctor we have seen for our family. She‚Äôs patient, detailed and always take time to explain the findings as well as things to do and not to do, to maintain good eye health.

In our world of technology, this speciality has become an important part of our life and I would highly recommend Dr Foo if you‚Äôre looking for someone kind and caring for an honest diagnosis. No doubt she‚Äôs working from a private hospital, she continues to play an instrumental role in nation-building support in local government hospitals.

Thank you Dr Foo for being such a wonderful doctor and showing you really care.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116469295431237801819/reviews
James Goh,2,"My family and I have been visting the eye centre for the past 5 years, and recently it seems like they are trying to squeeze every dollar possible. Requested for a 1-liner memo to mention that it is a follow-up visit as required by insurance and was told that the management has recently implemented a $15-$20 charge for it. While I understand that cost has escalated which is already reflected in the increased billings, I find that charging so much for a piece of straight-forward memo is outright money-grubbing. I will be moving myself and my family business elsewhere",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112300068856321148280/reviews
