The Testing Ground,1,"make teachers who are old and carry heavy workloads up and down stairs, does not provide lift.. seen Secondary kids being rude and offensive to their classmates and friends while skimming through the school. not very welcoming. need better uniform.. my child went into one of the classrooms and saw the schedule and was shocked at how early and late the start and end time was.. she asked if she could make a report to adjust the timings. she also tripped over a slight step and said that this place was not wheelchair friendly. the toilets and classroom floors are extremely dirty. the classrooms also need better tables and chairs. Iâ€™m not very pleased with this school. will not bring my children to open house after their PSLE.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331450443283127277/reviews
AR C (StreetKid),1,"The atmosphere is very uncomfortable. Some of the students & teachers don't get along with me very well. The thought of settling in this school cause me full regret. Crimes do happened in rare cases. Hardly make any good company, was treated as if I just existed.  Bad influence do exist there.
Wouldn't recommend going to this neighborhood school unless you have no better choices.

Please don't make a bad decision after PSLE. You will have to suffer 4-6 years there
