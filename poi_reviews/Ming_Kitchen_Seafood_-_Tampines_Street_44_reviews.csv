Joanne Cheng,1,The food portion was so horrible and less. The price for the salted egg prawn ball is $20 and the portion you can see from my photo. The prawn paste chicken is $14 and totally not worth it. The assam fish is a bit oily. I will not patron the place again as the portion is not worth the price. We can get better food with generous portion. Pretty disappointed with the food.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110408957347137900620/reviews

Samuel Tan,3,"Food here is a 3.5/5.

Some days the food is incredibly good, other days it can be meh. It's a bit of a mixed bag, but I'd say most days the food is pretty good.

My subjective take is that the food tends to taste a bit lacklustre midweek, especially for the Thursdays lunch service. The portions on the lacklustre days also seem smaller than the norm.

Dishes here worth trying: the spare ribs; kong pow chicken; ginger and scallion pork; mee goreng; salted egg chicken (get the one with the added sauce); sliced fish soup.

In terms of service, well the eatery gets the job done ie ensure that you are fed at a reasonable price.

Quick tip: when ordering for take out at peak hours eg 11.30am to 1pm or 6pm to 7.30pm, be prepared to wait up to 40mins.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116151825787551609085/reviews
