      "text": "After a few unsuccessful tries in seeking a doctor to examine my dad (aged 88) at home, finally a prompt reply from Ninkatec gave such a relief. The process from assignment of a doctor as well as the administrative matters were well implemented.\nDr Chew, assigned to examine my dad, arrived earlier than expected. She was not only thorough in examining my dad, but also compassionate and kind.  While giving her professional advice for treatment, she sought my inputs objectively and sincerely assuring. Her commitment to check-in even after my dad is warded and discharged, is an example of her professionalism with empathy.\nThanks for the kind, compassionate & prompt services, Ninkatec team!",

They are very professional in handling my queries, took time to provide useful information with clarity, efficient in arranging doctor appointment for the MCA medical report.  Dr Chew is very kind & patient during the assessment and provided much comfort to my mum, a dementia patient.  From the time I made my query to assessment done and medical report ready, all in within 48 hours.  Highly recommend Ninkatec, a healthcare provider that has their customers and patients at the heart of everything they do.",
