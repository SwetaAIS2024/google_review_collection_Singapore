      "text": "The manager ,  Wendy was very rude. From the fitting room i can hear her talking loudly to the point it‚Äôs so annoying , and she keeps on persisting to buy more stuff when my plan was just to buy 501 , honestly i just cannot withstand such behaviour as i expected an outlet at such mall to have more class but yet i was treated with such rubbish service. And i could barely understood her english , furthermore , i can smell the stench of cigarettes emitting out from her mouth every time she speaks. To those who wants to buy levi‚Äôs , i suggest you explore to another outlet rather than this. üòíüòí",

      "text": "Terrible experience at this store.  I asked three times for a specific type of jeans, but the store assistant kept pushing the boyfriend jeans on me, saying they'd look great. While I appreciated her recommendation, I was clear that I wanted to try the jeans I requested. Instead of helping, she made unsolicited comments about how the jeans I wanted wouldn‚Äôt suit me, saying they'd make me look bigger and weren‚Äôt flattering. It was completely uncalled for and rude. I‚Äôve worn that style before, and I love how they look, which is why I wanted to buy them again. After I insisted on trying them, she then conveniently claimed they were out of stock.\n\nIf you're looking for Levi‚Äôs jeans, I strongly suggest going somewhere else where the staff is respectful and attentive to your requests. There's no reason to spend your money in a store that makes you feel uncomfortable and disrespected.",

Giving suggestions and even passing me more styles under the fitting door to try out.\nI cannot remember the last time I enjoyed retail service already. Too bad I didn‚Äôt like the fitting, was really hoping to buy something from her.\nHope she can keep up her warm personality. üëçüèº",
