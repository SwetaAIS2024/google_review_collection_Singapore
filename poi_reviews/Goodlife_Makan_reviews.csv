happyvit 100,5,"Provides wonderful activities for seniors by instructors who are enthusiastic, patient & kind. I'm attending a few: Zumba Gold, Vitality exercises & Qigong. There are other activities: you are free to choose. You also get to go on excursions for such a miniscule amount (usually $2 but balloting is necessary as they are popular). Annual membership is only at a token sum of $12, $1 a month!",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105765600718146439084/reviews
