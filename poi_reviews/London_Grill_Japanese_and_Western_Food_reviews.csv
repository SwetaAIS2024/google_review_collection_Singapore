Party Gorilla,5,"My apologies that I only decided to take a photo when I'm almost done with the meal.

I'm very glad to have had my meal here.
Ordered the Salmon Curry Rice and just wanted a little more rice, the store owner was so kind as to give me another spoon and when I asked how much? She just smiled and told me ""it's okay""

This act of kindness really made my day, as it's not about the money but understanding that really goes a long way.

Thank you, I wish you business all the best!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117796259548829855219/reviews

RAY,5,"Price and portion ok. Just the chicken cutlet over-fried.
Salad is nice. Fries is hard. Chicken cutlet uses chicken breast, quite thick. Fish taste similar to ljs, but not crispy.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108657581496547004057/reviews
