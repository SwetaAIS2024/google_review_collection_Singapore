Steven Curtis,1,"The photos for this park are of different places, or weird angles that don’t reflect this place. A path between buildings with a few trees is how I’d describe this. Only a park in Singapore, anywhere else would be better described as an alleyway. Tourists, please don’t come as there is nothing to see.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105287809016295753380/reviews
