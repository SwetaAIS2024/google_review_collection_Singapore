Smokers crowding around a dustbin blowing the air out from a small window but but is really bad for non smokers when you need to use the toilet.\nSound system is good, the microphone was very compensating and catches your voice easily.\nThe waitress kept chasing you to drink. Had even took my beer for my friendâ€™s next table and they pour out so many glasses for nothing. Rude and no etiquette.\nAvoid at all costs",
