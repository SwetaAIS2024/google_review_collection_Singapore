Nursharina Roslan,4,"Came here with Hubby for dinner. Been meaning to try the food here for a while but never got the chance.

Got quite disappointed with the service. Its supposed to be fast food, but our order was missed, and we waited for a whole 30mins.

Luckily, the food was their saving grace. Hubby ordered the OG Tandoor burger with loaded fries set and an ondeh-ondeh slushie. I was having the Crispydoori burger with masala fries. The brioche burger buns were cold, but the chicken patties were definitely hot. I especially love the masala fries and their mayo mix. Overall, the food was lovely and savoury, with some notes of spiciness.

The shop looks cute with bright colors that welcomes people in and background music that makes the food much more appetising.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101153613645951897173/reviews
Muhd Yasier Azmee,5,"What can I say? The experience for us as a family was perfect! :D

Masala fries is well seasoned, no need chili sauce one. Just wished the mint yogurt was more on my patty hehe cos it‚Äôs dammnnn goood bruh! The Chai Peng Slush was really good as well, tastes like ice cream at one point.

Ground level is the main dine-in area but if anyone of you wants some quite space then head to level two!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115545744285274012492/reviews
JY,4,Read rave reviews of this unique tandoori burger and it did not disappoint. I loved how the chicken was tender and it paired well with the mint mayo. The serving was also huge and well worth the price point.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105486231286004438682/reviews
Clark Tan,5,"The OG burger is undeniable one of the best burgers in my list. Huge slab of baked chicken thigh well marinated with fragrant tandoori spices. Patty was succulent, tender, and bursting with juices on every bite. Brioche bun was soft and sweet, together with a generous amount of green minty yoghurt with raw onions that added so much flavours to it.
The Crispy Doori burger featured a thick slab of deep fried chicken thigh meat that‚Äôs well marinated with tandoori spices together with Harissa mayo and slice melted cheese. Satisfying crunch and bursting juices coming from the patty. Masala fries were heavily seasoned and were so addictive. Price is super affordable.

Alvin Choo,2,"Saw some posts and articles on this place and decided to check it out. I ordered the original tandoori burger with loaded fries, wings and a bandung slush.

Overall I was quite disappointed with the food. Despite some preparation time, the chicken and fries were not hot at all. And this was food at rather premium prices for their category (~$20). There were also flies buzzing around which was not acceptable. There was also nothing special about the taste of the food and I found the chicken rather dry.

This will be my first and last time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113288475978172355218/reviews
