It's a good place to have performance! And the VIP room for after-performance party is clean and cosy too\n\nHowever, their lightings could be improved, not that bright/high-quality",

Think conductor did a great job!  Wish that in the future, concert like this can be on the live stream like YouTube or Facebook live so that more public get to enjoy, as I know ticket was sold out very fast n there s people who like to come but couldn't get ticket.",
