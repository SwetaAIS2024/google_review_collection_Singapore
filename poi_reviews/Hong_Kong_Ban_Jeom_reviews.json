The spam sushi roll was also super delicious, the rice was soft and fluffy. Love the pancake too, it was soft and a generous amount of fillings. The tobokki was also spicy enough and chewy . The zhajiang noodles was also superb, it was seasoned well with the black sauce.",

Ordered their jajjangmyeon with tangsuyuk and mandu and they were very delicious! Missed having it when I was in Korea and it definitely hit the spot satisfying my craving for a good jajangmyeon! The tangsuyuk is a must order and the kimchi sides was very good too. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a great jajangmyeon and tangsuyuk, along with a variety of other dishes from their menu!",
