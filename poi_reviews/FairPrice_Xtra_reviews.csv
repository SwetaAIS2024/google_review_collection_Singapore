Shreyank Shah,3,"I have been here to one of the biggest FairPrice stores in Singapore. I could find almost everything that I was looking for!
You will be able to get groceries, vegetables, bicycles, clothes, sportswear, electronic items and many more things.
I found many of the items at a higher price (not actually a FairPrice) though a few items were at very reasonable prices.

The only thing I didn't like is why they are charging for plastic bags? They could have given free if the bill reaches a certain amount. I would have given 5 stars otherwise.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105493433777388644116/reviews
