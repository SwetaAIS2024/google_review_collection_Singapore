Low Bao Heng,3,Frequently had dinner with Family over here. The food is above average and price is reasonable. But yesterday got a shock when I ordered this salted egg chicken rice. Was craving for creamy chicken rice but they donâ€™t have and they recommended that salted egg chicken rice instead. So went ahead w the order and was shocked when she said $8.50. Inflation? Duno leh. I think elsewhere could get at $5-$6 plus. Look at the photo. For $8.50 worth it? ðŸ¤”,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108033403024309465290/reviews

This Zi Cha store selling very good Hokkien Mee and fried dry Hor Fun $15 (big). Worth trying. Hot plate beancurd prawns are big and not the usual you get elsewhere. Pork ribs, prawn ball and sour sweet pork so so can be better.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104258555113765533217/reviews
Sandra Galistan,1,Ordered takeaway. Serving portion was disappointingly small for the price. Itâ€™s unfortunate that food quality and food portion have been on a steady decline.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113670878604349922333/reviews
Verena Wong Yu Lee,2,"We always order from this outlet because it is closer to our house. We regularly go to this stall outlet and order the same thing because we like the food, hokkien mee with no sotong is what I always eat. Today the most horrifying thing happened. At 8:15 to 8:20pm we ordered from the outlet and picked up our food. Once we got home and opened up our food, in my hokkien mee, there was a bug cooked together with the noodles and meat. Upon spotting this, I lost my will to eat hokkien mee. I'm so disgusted and disappointed that this happened. My partner was so disgusted that he lost his appetite to eat at all. Please be careful and the cooks there, please check before you serve to your customers.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107293760982350031537/reviews
Opyger Ong,1,"Bought their Fried Bean Curd with Prawn to find a weird stale taste on the Beancurd skin. I smelled the skin and indeed it was spoilt! And guess what? To my horror, there were 2 flies in between the skin. 1 big 1 tiny baby. The hygiene for this shop really is bad. I ordered thru Mei Chin Restaurant but both Mastercrab n MeiChin are actually same outlet same address and same menu! Dun be cheated by the rating on MeiChin!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106080936124819548661/reviews
