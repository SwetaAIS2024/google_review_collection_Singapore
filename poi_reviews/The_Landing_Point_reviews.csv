Carlo Miccolis,5,"Went there with friends for the afternoon high tea. Loved the savoury part, which I would recommend. The sweet side is not overwhelming and the mini cheesecakes were delicious. It's also great that it's possible to have both one tea and coffee selection. And finally, the view is amazing!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108746019131122051467/reviews
Christine Lim,5,"One of the good & posh ambience with high ceiling glass window overlooking MBS view.

$120 per pax for an afternoon tea, comes with two choices of drinks. TWG TEA and/ OR BACHA COFFEE.

Love the scone but macaroons are too sweet.

The Manager by the name of David & team have given us a great service (with our fussiness) and definitely would be visiting again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108945044040504469885/reviews
Madeleine Tan,4,"We tried the Strawberry Bliss Afternoon Tea. Our drinks arrived 15 minutes after seating, the scones came 10 minutes later and the high tea set took nearly an hour to be served. While the food looked stunning and perfect for photos in the beautiful setting, the taste was fairly standard, nothing wowed us. It’s clear that you’re paying more for the experience, brand and the atmosphere rather than anything particularly unique in the flavor department. That said, it’s still worth a visit, especially for the vibe. A plus point is that we get to choose two servings of tea or coffee per person.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114071385496499747851/reviews
Red_squirrel hime,5,"Went for the Strawberry High Tea here for my friends birthday. Would definitely recommend as the selection was absolutely delicious with a solid selection of teas and coffee.

Tea (loose leaf in bags from TWG)

Irish Morning - the flavours were not overpowering and paired very well with the food selections as an easy pallete cleanser

SAKURA! SAKURA! - a very enjoyable green tea with hints of cherry blossom flavour, which paired exceptionally well with the strawberry feast

Strawberry Tea - flavourful strawberry tea to end the meal, was easy to drink, and did not overpower the rest of the meal

Coffee (Bacha cofee in french press)

1910 - a very enjoyable coffee with hints of floral and fruity flavours, bitterness, and acidity were low, making it easy to drink without adding sugar or cream/milk

Savoury

We thoroughly enjoyed the savoury selection, especially the truffle egg sandwich and the tuna pancake - the scones were also very delicious buttery and more reminiscent of an american southern biscuit As a bias, i also enjoyed the cucumber sandwich

Sweets
By the time we got to the sweets, we were actually very full. Though, one suggestion would be to cut down on the number of cake selections and add a contrasting flavour / style of sweet. Exchanging a cake or two for a pastry or a mixed strawberry vinegarette would have been a good choice to help break up the flavour and texture

overall, we thoughroughly enojoyed our experience for this high tea date",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103058626220847086280/reviews
Stewart Antony,4,"Drop in for the afternoon tea on short notice. Very accommodating staff. The treats were delightful. Not however the stones, they seemed stale ; and patrons we noticed also didn’t finish them. Just a small blemish on a perfect afternoon",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110580288729471572800/reviews
