ERIC CHAN,5,Fantastic Fried carrot cake aka char kueh. Huge portion for the $3.50 option although it was served in a tiny plate. Great tasting carrot cake. Kudos to the young gentleman behind the wok for carrying on the traditional local culinary delight. Highly recommended.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113614902035973411013/reviews

Other than famous $2.50 kway chap stall at Jalan Batu HC, we found another hidden kway chap stall that sells for only $2.50 in this happening neighbourhood.

Morning breakfast, saw this kway chap stall manned by solo auntie with such an afforable priceðŸ˜±. Definitely have to give a try! Kway chap is old school and very good taste, Kway sheets are thin and soft yet firm and every ingredients braised really very well. $2.50 å“ªé‡Œæ‰¾!!!

Tan Chee,5,"Went this morning and decided to eat the fried carrot cake (black). Still good and serving is generous for price of $3.50. You can order black and white (mix) if you order large one that cost $5.00.

Go try when you are there. Really not bad.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109929201530959294598/reviews
