      "text": "Have a parcel shipment to make? DON’T FIND THIS COMPANY.\n\nTheir guarantee is just like thin air. I asked him a few times if the way the package is wrapped will cause damage along the way. He guaranteed “I do this many times already, don’t worry, won’t break one”.\n\nBe careful, we lost a new school bag ($45), baby-G watch ($111.20) and the luggage ($69.90) damaged. But boss say want to pay $45 only for the luggage ONLY.\n\nWe told and showed him a 28-inch luggage is easily above $70 now. He say it’s his personal cost that he’s willing to pay for the damage. So he wants to haggle for $25 discount??? lol joke.\n\nDon’t know how many poor things he have con with his shipping side line from his fake front convenience store.\n\nIf it wasn’t for my wonderful helper, I wouldn’t even have met and known such unconscionable people exists.",
