Ming Shen Tham,4,"Marché offers a decent variety of dishes at reasonable prices, making it a good spot if you're after value for money. I tried a few items across different meals and here’s how they fared:

The soup portion was surprisingly generous and tasted decent, which made it feel like a good deal. The carbonara, while it looked small, turned out to be very filling – though personally, I would’ve preferred it to be a little saltier to bring out more flavour.

I’ve also had their breakfast items, and the smoked salmon croissant was just alright – nothing particularly special, but it does the job if you’re in the mood for something light.

Overall, the food here is value for money, especially if you're not expecting anything fancy. Taste-wise, most dishes are pretty normal, but it’s a convenient place to grab a satisfying meal.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116082735539712168059/reviews
edtayjb,5,"This is THE place for a very good Western breakfast; especially on the weekends, when it's 30% off its breakfast menu. As usual, I had a very very substantial and very very good Marche Breakfast at $19.90++ at 30% off and it came with lotsa things and quality ones at that. And today, I got myself a beverage upgrade of orange juice and a Cappuccino at $8.90++. Whilst the coffee here is very good, I could do without the ice in my orange juice. My wife on the other hand had a $8.90++ Continental Breakfast also at 30% off, which she said was very good. And while the personal service here was good, the place is clearly short handed at peak hours.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107467079327459015215/reviews
David Tan,4,"Good food and friendly staff. We had the spinach ravioli, salmon steak and anti pasti pizza. Slightly pricey but otherwise good quality. Would have given a 5 stars if not for the fact that they don't give water.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111427923555364795751/reviews
Magdalene,4,"The blackforest ham crepe ($19.90++) was delicious and filling. I like that it had lots of vegetables within. It came with a side salad and dressing.

My friend had the pork ribs which were passable, but a little tough.

Service wasn’t great. There was one lady in white who was friendly, but the other waitresses in pink ignored us even when spoken directly to.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107907784704767460720/reviews
