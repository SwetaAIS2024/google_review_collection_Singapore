LeongYan Yoong,4,"Top 5 cigar lounge in SG! In the heart of Chinatown (Trengganu street). A wide selection to choose from including an impressive whisky offering too.

Ch Wo,2,"Place doesn't look good at all. Hard to find and you get into this really old 60s lift that fits 2 people. Looks good when you arrive but it goes downhill when you walk through the door into the cigar lounge. It's fine to smoke a cigar but if you want a nicer ambience, I have seen better cigar bars. This place has the atmosphere of a seedy opium den! It doesn't have to be high end but they could try to create a nicer atmosphere for what are expensive cigars.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101373908700552487219/reviews
Mark Nelson,2,"Hovering staff in the first half hour was annoying, then all attention shifted to one of two other people in the entire bar? I was visiting with someone and asked to move to the lounge chairs and was told that they were ‘reserved’ so for the next hour no one else came in? Inexperience aloof female staff shuffling around looking busy and when asked for a cigar nub spike I was given ‘tooth picks’? Even after I explained the purpose of the cigar spike I was again given tooth picks! Way overpriced, skip this one and go to others in the area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110218821496614363876/reviews
