Glenn Rafael,4,"We ordered carbonara and fish and chips. Overall, both dishes are OK for it's price. The carbonara isn't too salty but less creamy while the fish n chips quite delicious",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104204321984523357061/reviews
Mike Teo,3,"Overall the food is OK, just that I recently ordered a beef steak, they only do it well done, no other choice, its a red flag but I still went with it. The beef looks funny. Seems like many pieces glues together to form a pc. I have never seen a butterfly steak, u can peel the steak into 2 to 3 layers. Taste wise, its very salty. Will avoid the beef in future.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113299387837467066721/reviews

ROBIN WEE,1,I orders steak and it is salty and doesn’t look like steak. I don’t even know how to make do of it.  Better to avoid it. Maybe SFA should check on the quality of meat,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108953153356868806270/reviews
