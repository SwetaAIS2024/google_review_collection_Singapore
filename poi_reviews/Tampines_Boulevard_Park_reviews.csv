Trung Vo,5,"I ran from Bedok Reservoir to check out the newly opened Tampines Boulevard Park, which just launched last week. The place has a great vibe—open spaces, plenty of shaded spots, and a nice mix of greenery. I saw kids having fun at the playground, and some were even trying to fly kites, which added to the lively atmosphere.

Halfway through, I stopped by the ice cream shop in the middle of the park and grabbed a sea salt cone. It was just the right treat to cool down after the run. The park is a great addition to the area—perfect for a casual day out or just to relax.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110180539763852146237/reviews

Low Diane,5,"Those are millipedes in the Park, not centipedes. Millipedes are harmless.

Millipedes have two sets of legs per segment that are positioned directly under their body, while centipedes have one set of legs per segment, positioned to the side of their bodies. Centipedes also have a flatter body while millipedes have a more rounded body.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103320887332803934700/reviews
