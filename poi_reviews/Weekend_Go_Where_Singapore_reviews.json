We thoroughly enjoyed the cruise, and my children absolutely loved it as well.\n\nIt was worth every penny! I‚Äôm already planning to book the cruise again for my kids holidays in June and December 2025. I highly recommend Carol as an agent; she will ensure you get a great deal.

I saw their promotions via facebook.\n\nCarol is very responsive throughout my queries. Everything was done through whatsApp. Booking, payment and check-in are all done electronically, making the process even easier.\n\nCarol managed to arrange cabins at the same level for my family both Interior Stateroom & Balcony. It helped us a lot for were when we need to meet up for activities in the Cruise (this not in my request).\n\nThanks, Carol for the great service and arrangement.\n\nOverall, very easy and fuss free to book from Weekend GoWhere.\n\nDefinitely will look for her again for my next family gateway!\n#wgwCarol98523494\n#weekendgowhere\n#weekendgowheresg\n#travelwithweekendgowhere",
