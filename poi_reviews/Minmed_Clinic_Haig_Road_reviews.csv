lynn mok,5,"Good experience at the clinic when I approached them to do my vaccine . Staff (Carmen ;Jing Yi; & Charlotte) are helpful & it makes our visit pleasant.

Dr Dr Lisa Chen is such a warm & experienced Dr. She explained the details & that makes us feel so comfortable. Thank you.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108817945057801217380/reviews
Aaron “Alien” Lin,5,"Frequently visit place for when I need meds and a diagnosis from a GP. Not just cause it's one of the nearest listed panel GP for my company but also coz it's always the most hassle free. Dr Hor is always there to help.
Special thanks to the always nice desk personnel Charlotte Carmen and Jingyi as well.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117297667205237341529/reviews

Sky Blue,1,"Visited the clinic with my father when he was unwell last week. The clinic does not accept cash and does not print receipt that shows the breakdown of transaction.

Waited for a good ten minutes just to register and during registration, counter staff asked for my email address so as to send me e-receipt. Till now I did not receive any e-receipt.

Bad attitude of nurse and counter staff when speaking to my sick father with no empathy and patience.

I do not recommend this clinic.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105477764324835575936/reviews
Lynn Lim,5,"I have been visiting this particular clinic for more than 20 years, sInce when it was still DaySpring and my doctor was Dr Lisa Chen, to the current Minmed and my current doctor is Dr Hor. The entire team has been professional and always did their best. Throughout the years, definitely there are times when I do have bad experiences but overall this is still a clinic I will go back to. But I do avoid the timings when Dr Hor is not in. :)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106318471643969341262/reviews
