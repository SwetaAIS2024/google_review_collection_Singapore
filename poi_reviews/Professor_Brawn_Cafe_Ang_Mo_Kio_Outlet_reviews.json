It also has a retail section displaying artwork and products designed by Pathlight students. Come and support this social enterprise by Autism Resource Centre. Both cafe and retail shop accept CDC vouchers. There isn't parking within the premises at that time due to school buses. The cafe staff took the initiative to inform us when my friend made the reservation.",
