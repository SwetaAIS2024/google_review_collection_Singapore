shi jie,5,"During my visit to the clinic Dr Claudia was incredibly thorough during my consultation for the surgical removal of my wisdom tooth she took the time to explain all the intricate details of the procedure. I appreciated their gentle approach, especially since I tend to get nervous about dental work. Throughout the procedure, Dr Claudia made sure I was comfortable and constantly checked in to ensure I was at ease. Dr Claudia also took the time to explain the important steps required to ensure optimal post recovery.

I highly recommend Dr. Claudia she definitely earned my trust, and I'll be returning for all my future dental care needs.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102979563122233945290/reviews
Marilyn Lim,5,"We, tha Canossian Sisters sent our new Myanmese helper Htet Htet as she was in pain. The doctors were very kind n reassuring as she was worried that she could not afford to pay. At the first visit, she had 2 teeth extracted n a filling for a third tooth. Dr gave a big discount. Today Dr had to extract the tooth as it was decayed. Dr did not charge her. We are very grateful for the kindness shown to our Myanmar migrant worker who has no resources. May God bless the doctors.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102450290450212032273/reviews
Moi,5,I have been to Mandarin Medical & Dental (near my house at Toh Yi Drive) for more than 30 years. The Medical Centre opens at 8.30am and the doctor is punctual! Dr Ho Hang Chen is smart and efficient! She used the ear irrigation washer â€˜gunâ€™ (for ear wax removal) to flush out the impurities in my right ear and the tinnitus (whining sound) just disappeared in a jiffy. Truly a saviour! ðŸ˜Š,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117021795429732267661/reviews

Kok Kum Fai,3,"At least this clinic was willing to see me unlike the others in that area.

Sometimes the lady GP is ok. Other times she appears to be alluding to something her fellow docotrs at NUH A&E did or said?",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114333752803125042296/reviews
