Kevin Ang,4,Gets really busy during lunch hours when everyone rushes to get reasonably priced and delicious food. This speaks well of this outlet and the food/drink offerings.

M_T ‚ÄúMarg‚Äù,3,"I visited Heavenly Wang located at Alexandra Retail Centre (ARC) and tried their Prata Curry Chicken. While the curry chicken tasted quite yummy, I was disappointed to find that the prata was hard. Additionally, the mee siam didn‚Äôt taste nice and overall, I felt it wasn‚Äôt worth the price.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104700621786063544130/reviews

+1‚≠êÔ∏è for food.
After renovation they hired more staff so the cashier is no longer overloaded.
Upon ordering you get your eggs n drinks rather promptly before you get seated and wait for your toast.
Realy enjoyed their warm toasted yuan yang buns.
The set is cheaper than usual toast set and it is good!
My go-to for dreary days back to office.
You can tell the cashier to takeaway your kopi/teh as it is large size.

Decent kopi. Decent toast.
Their breakfast set @ $5.70 comes with Large kopi/teh, 4 toast, and 2 eggs, which I think could be too much for a person to consume in the morning.

This morning, the kopi/egg guy was working hard to clear the orders, which was nonstop for at least 30min while I was sipping away my large kopi.
He was doing his best, the roadblocks is where  there is an egg order, so that will slow him down from his kopi/teh momentum.

As he needs to make kopi, pack and serve, that slows down the service (or maybe that's how they wanted to pace the order, to avoid queue# piling up)

Plus a lot of diner kept standing at the drinks counter, thus causing the queue to standstill, instead of waiting aside since we all have our numbers.

Because of that, those rushing for takeaway will felt that the queue doesn't move.

No issue with toast orders, it was fast and prompt.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108197474271189843317/reviews
