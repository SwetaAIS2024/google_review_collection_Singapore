Tried their a cup of flat white & a slice of quiche salmon.\n\nWhile awaiting, came across a group of ang mo. Look like they are the regulars at this outlet. Cos one of them claimed that this cafe serves the best coffee.\n\nApparently he always stuck at this outlet & never try on others. Did recommend to the whole group of them on other cafe. After trying at this outlet, the standard wasn't the same as their original outlet ðŸ˜·",

      "text": "I enjoy coming here for their tart and salad set ($17.99). This ham and gruyere tart was served warm and fragrant, and was delicious. Several of the salads are oily and loaded with carbs rather than veggies, but this particular one was refreshing. Do take note the space is small with 3 small tables indoors and 2 outdoors.\n\nâ€”-\nTried the banana bread ($6.90) for the first time. They gently heated it up. It was thick, moist and not crumbly. Thereâ€™s a crunchy cinnamon streusel at the top which I found too sweet.",

Had to ask them clean table mess, and didnâ€™t even get latte art done properly. Didnâ€™t even ask if I was a member too, which they did for subsequent people.",
