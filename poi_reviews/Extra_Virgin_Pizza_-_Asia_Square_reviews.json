      "text": "Saw the good reviews and came to try on a weekday night. We didnâ€™t make any reservations and got seated at the outdoor. It was breezy and it was quite relaxing with the soft music. The two of us ordered one pizza, one truffle fries, and one fried calamari. I liked the truffle fries a lot but the pizza and especially the calamari were a bit salty for my taste. Overall the location is convenient and the food was not too bad , but would be much better if they were less salty.",

Rocket salad + ham and pizza separately.\n\nOn 26th Apr early lunch, there is only 1 lady waitress and her service is good.\n\nAttentive to us and observant.\n\nRemember to compliment her.",
