I still went ahead with my order of Peppermint Milk Tea, and ended up with a crazily sweet drink that made my face scrunch up on my first mouthful. Couldnâ€™t finish it and had to throw half of my drink away.\n\nThe pearls were good though - very soft and chewy.",

I like their mocha earl grey milk tea with pearls SO GOOD. My boyfriend likes the banana ice cream milkshake. GOOD JOB GUYS KEEP IT UP WHEW.",

They have a wider range than most bubble tea chains and every single one of their drinks tastes amazing.ðŸ¤— i jus wished they opened longer",

Often times they follow up with customers on their recommendations if the customers try them.\n\nPeach Mango smoothie with yoghurt bursts is my favourite drink that I would personally recommend if you like something fruity sweet and slightly sour.",
