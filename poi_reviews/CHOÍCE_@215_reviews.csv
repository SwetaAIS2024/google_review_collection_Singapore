Johnson Ee,4,"Couldn't find SaveurThai on googlemaps at this location hence posting my review here. This is their 6th outlet apparently and the food is so good. Ordered 7 dishes and the bill came up to $60ish, which is much cheaper than a typical zhu chao place.
One thing to note though, perharps because it's relatively new, there was only 2 staff working of which 1 had to work as a cashier too. Be patient to wait for their food, you would not regret it!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101567592939796748217/reviews
