      "text": "I worked nearby back in 2016, and had the chicken chop at least once a week. The chicken was good, suspect he put abit of  Kentucky-style powder on it before grilling it. Portion was super huge too for the price. I came back recently (2024) hoping to enjoy the chicken chop again. It tasted different to me this time. I couldn‚Äôt sleep that night wondering if it was the chicken chop that changed, or was it me. I know the sauce definitely changed (the new black pepper sauce was very overpowering) but I‚Äôm not sure about the chicken. The portioning is still huge though. Please let me know if you have a similar thought or experience too.",
