      "text": "This dessert place never fails to surprise me with something new every now & then. 1st fell in love with their chendol soft serve with their secret receipe of adding simple lemon & other interesting stuffs into their chendol to make it really special.  Today they surprised me & mummy with a very delicious or-ni ice-cream soft served, mixed with black glutinuous rice, sweet, salty & fragrant!!!  Its dark chocolate ice-cream isn't too sweet for my mum's diet as well!!  To top everything up, they also had very beautiful service from hosts with sweet paranakan roots.  Simply love this homely place. No regrets bringing my mummy along ‚ù§Ô∏èüíû5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê",

Ordered the egglet waffle with blue vanilla and early grey ice cream, cup of chocolate ice cream and their weekly special. All of them were great, especially their ‚Äúorh nee‚Äù ice cream with a topping of pulut hitam that paired well with the taro and ice cream. Eventually we also ordered a few pints of their ice cream for home consumption.",
