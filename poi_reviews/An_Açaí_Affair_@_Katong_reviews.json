      "text": "My fiancé’s mom loves acai but I usually purchase it for her on GrabFood. On Saturday and today she ventured out to purchase from the shop herself. On both occasions the staff on duty were incredibly dismissive and rude in reply to her questions. She was so shocked by the attitude by the service on Saturday that she thought she might have went to the wrong shop. “See for yourself.” The young man told her when she asked if there is any dairy in the products because she is lactose intolerant. I like to add that she is always polite to a fault and that the staffs in Acai Affair Katong simply can’t be bothered to explain to a senior who is trying to buy Acai for herself for the first time. She is so kind that she still bought from the lady serving her today. I would really like to express how disappointed I am with the service in this outlet. Please seek to improve and don’t bully the elderly.",
