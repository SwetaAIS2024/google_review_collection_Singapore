Feliz,4,"Had a good Vietnamese Food, own by a Vietnamese lady who married to a Singaporean. She stay in Singapore more than 10 years and decided to open a humble Vietnamese Food in Cendex Cafeteria.

I came across her stall by chance last year. Today I brought my friends to try her food. Is definitely way better than going to Vietnamese restaurant and paying way much more.

Her price is reasonable and is real authentic Vietnamese food,

I had grill chicken with noodles,
my friend had chicken soup with noodles and I pack 1 beef kway teow soup -
(Pho bo)

Her food is like home cook and really good .

The only thing , she stop selling the rice paper spring roll because she has no time to make because she's alone in the stall.

Her business starts from 10am to the most by 3pm as she focus only office crowds for lunch hours.

You can pay her cash or by PayNow.

She only open from Monday to Friday.

Do go and try her food , you won't regret it.

Do say hi to her, her name is Tina.

Tell her that you had read my review that's how you get to know her stall.

Alex Binder,4,"The dish I had in the vietnamese stall was good. Ask for the soup. When I had it, it was not the usual chicken broth, but had some star anise and another spice in it, making it exotic (it did not taste like Pho broth either).",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114865283253385221337/reviews
