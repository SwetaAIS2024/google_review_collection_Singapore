wei K,5,"Didn't know there is such a shop in Newton circus! The owner (just guessing he is the owner) really puts a lot of effort to pull the beer, to balance the beer and foam. First time I tabao draught beer, covid phase 2 :s I ordered the IPA, happy with it. Went back a 3rd time but the shop was not opened :( will definitely buy again if the shop is open!
