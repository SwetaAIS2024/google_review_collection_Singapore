Sean S,1,"1. Filled with lies and half truths.
2. Worst on-job training
3. Zero long-term benefits

LIES AND HALF TRUTHS
Always told lies in order to get people to commit their time and effort. Know that they will change whatever the initial job specification is while not even explaining before asked, and when they do explain do not provide any concrete reason. Employees are left with the option of either to have wasted so much time for training or to continue working for them with low pay and no benefits. They will make sure to tell you that others are happily working and there is no politics while they are actually suffering and not able to do anything about it. Many people leave very quickly.

WORST ON-JOB TRAINING PROVIDED
Compared to 3 other companies that I have went through, and based on many others' experiences, they have by far the most questionable training. No mistakes are tolerated as they will either make sure to tell you that you will be fired with any internal/external complaints that are not valid, or you never hear about it and you just get fired. Resources already available are sometimes never provided. Questions about pressing issues are 90% never answered.

ZERO LONG-TERM BENEFITS
When the company needs to cut cost, be sure that anybody they can fire they will do so without. Benefits of hardworking and excellent individuals are only abused and minimally rewarded no matter how long you work for them. Many are complaining that the benefits if any are very quickly removed. Since the start we have already given them sufficient feedback but was always ignored. Higher management never explains their actions even when asked and even when they do they tell you lies or half truths, they never ever specify.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104130557322684513476/reviews
Wakale Kong,5,"Excellent work-life balance with great benefits.

Terra treats people like people, not employees.
Its reflected in the benefits and how HR & management approaches employees, no yelling and screaming about challenges, just collaboration and ideas.

The CEO truly cares about each individual, welcomes creativity, and leads by example.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103009604158731481329/reviews
Winston Lee,5,"Very thankful for being given the opportunity to put my course into practice for my mid-career switch.

This is the only company that is willing to give everyone a fair chance to fight and prove their mettle even without prior experience. All of the interviews I went to all looked at your past working experiences.

Without venturing out of Singapore for work before, there are only a limited number of companies and sectors that you can work in.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116987840379128644187/reviews
