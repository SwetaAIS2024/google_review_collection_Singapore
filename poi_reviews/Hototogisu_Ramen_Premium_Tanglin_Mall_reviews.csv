Ashley Liew,5,"Love the service here. The free flow hard boiled eggs and noodles are such a wonderful treat here, free with any main dish. Our toddler absolutely loved this and had so much fun! The tonkotsu ramen üçú had a clean taste too which www great for our son. Gyoza was nice too. Perfectly located on first floor of Tanglin Mall. Thank you! ü§©",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews
ML,4,"Been here several times. In the past they didn‚Äôt have much promotion but now they have the value deal like paragon branch. You can order a ramen from $16++ and add $5.90 to get a side dish (eg. Karaage chicken / gyoza) & tea. I‚Äôve had ramen here several times, always been pretty good. Soups are flavorful and noodles not overly cooked.

They also have rice sets like Cha Shu with rice & miso soup, gyoza with rice, fried chicken with rice. In case you don‚Äôt feel like noodles, you can eat rice set from $15++

I had noodles for lunch already so I had rice set instead. It was good but wish that the gyoza set came with a side of salad. Even a small amount will make the meal more balanced.

There‚Äôs free hard boiled egg, pickles and extra noodles if you order a main. I think it‚Äôs more affordable than when I first started coming here. More value for money.

Area looks clean and decor is like japandi style. But I did notice some ants crawling on my table. Maybe it‚Äôs just this table.
Anyway it‚Äôs a go to spot for me to get a decent meal at tanglin mall.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106421457478618430542/reviews
Stan Yeo,2,Very short staff when I went. The food quality  is so-so not really the Michelin that they sell. By the way the photo shows a $10 soft shell crab. A very sad portion for the price. Batter is more than the crab. Oh whatever. Not returning to their chains anyways.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116623480256114979540/reviews
Skyxi,3,"Ordered the tonkotsu ramen set meal with gyoza. The food was ok for the price. The ramen, especially it's noodle, was extremely good. However, the sides(gyoza) was okay at best, expected the sides to be abit better for having a Michelin star.
All in all, decent value for the money especially with the set meal. A bonus for the free flow noodle and hard boiled eggs, and karashi takana, quality is barely compromised despite it's free flowness.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118036285348445714969/reviews
ANTON CHIA,4,"Saw it has 1 Michelin star for the past 5 years, decided to try for lunch; try the crispy pork spicy ramen, was not disappointed, very crispy and fragrant, the crispiness stays throughout its submersion in the soup. Just the right amount of spiciness for Asian taste. Gyoza was a 90 cent add on, not fantastic but not bad, can‚Äôt complaint for the price. Ramen has right amount of tangy feel, solid soup base. $10 get two Asahi beer. All these enough to fill up a fat man. Plate looks small but actually deep. Overall it‚Äôs very worth.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105641875241396885190/reviews
