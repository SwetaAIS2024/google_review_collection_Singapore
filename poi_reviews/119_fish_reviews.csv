Tan Junyu,5,"Despite they are busy preparing for a huge takeaway order, they still take my order promptly. I like it how they make an effort to remove the fish skin, the fish is fresh and the generous amount of batang fish for the smallest portion. Even there are quite a few stall selling fish soup in this estate, this is still very much my preferred one. üëçüëçüëçüòã",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113984036409422535641/reviews

R T,5,"Aljunied area has a few good fish soup stall, hence when we chanced upon this fish soup, we are happy to find that this is on par with the rest!

The fish slices were thick and firm, and has NO SKIN, which we liked ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Smallest portion cost $6 but fish slices was generous.
Soup was clear, light but still tasty, with a hint of sole fish in the broth. Each portion came with a slice of the ti po as well.

Recommend to give this a try if you are in the area.
We will definitely be back.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114937758998585419198/reviews
