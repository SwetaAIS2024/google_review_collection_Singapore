Monna Hasan,5,"One of the most vibrant places to relax after a long day! The ambiance is a perfect blend of cozy lighting and energetic vibes, especially with the live music that adds a magical touch. The menu is diverse ‚Äì I enjoyed both the Western steak and the Indian curry, and both were cooked to perfection. The service by the staff was warm and attentive, hospitality. Highly recommended for anyone looking to chill with good food, great music, and friendly faces. Definitely coming back again!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105272592890356889399/reviews

Dennis Yeo,5,It's my favourite place to chill and dine whenever I'm at Puteri Harbour. Best quality food and unparalleled service quality from their staff. Great beer and beverage promotions to accompany you on a night of nice music and live telecast sports events. A must visit venue with friends and family dining in front of the beautiful marina. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114321733137426786611/reviews
Nurul Anis,5,"Ladies night on a Wednesday is a great chill out session- free selected drinks from 7-9pm is really worth it.

Price for food is affordable and great service from the crew as well.
