ben vaillant,5,"Superb experience and highly recommend for Dinner!

The service from when we entered the building all the way to us leaving was top notch!

We highly recommend the scallops for starter and the pasta wheel for main. The wine pairing we was offered was also a lovely accompany to the main.

The atmosphere was great, especially for a late dinner reservation (20:30) and the pre ordered drinks were ready for when we were sat.

Mark, our waiter was very professional and provided us with a great insight into the menu and was very communicative throughout the evening.

This dinner reservation was also for my partner’s birthday and they were great with everything requested too!! Highly recommend for a date night.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118246295467421053874/reviews
Yuan Tian,5,"We recently celebrated Valentine’s Day at this restaurant, and it was a truly memorable experience.

Ambiance:
The atmosphere was bright and airy, thanks to the large glass windows and lush greenery. The modern decor, combined with natural lighting, made for a relaxing yet elegant setting. It’s a perfect spot for a romantic dinner or any special celebration.

Food:
The dishes were beautifully presented and tasted just as amazing as they looked. Each plate was thoughtfully crafted with fresh ingredients, and the flavors were well-balanced. We particularly enjoyed beef which stood out for its taste and texture. Also the dessert was really tasty and not too sweet.

Service:
The service was attentive yet unobtrusive. The staff were friendly and ensured everything was perfect throughout.

View:
The panoramic view added a special touch to the entire experience. Dining with a view like that elevated our celebration, making it even more unforgettable.

Overall:
This restaurant was a perfect choice for Valentine’s Day, offering great food, exceptional views, and a romantic atmosphere.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113261722861482475818/reviews

Darwin K,4,"Truly a unique experience to visit this restaurant. It has spacious indoor area and cozy outdoor section, from which one can enjoy the breathtaking view of Singapore skyline without worrying too much about rain, thanks to the roof covers. Staff are professionally trained and very knowledgeable about wines and other alcoholic beverages. The 4-course Western meal is delicious, although the portion is shy of filling. The Beef Tenderloin with Truffle Jus steals the limelight while the chocolate dessert brings the sweet finishing well. The night was made complete with a great live performance by 53A.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111742897677287064516/reviews
Syl L,3,"Seasonal menu calls for improvement.
Suckling pig could be done better as skin isnt crispy, fats of pork did not melt down in mouth.

Seasonal dessert lacks some texture or taste to bring out its uniqueness.

Standard menu is great. Turbot was better than cod.
Beef tartare from standard menu would be better.

Overall service is great!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114850437828511138776/reviews
