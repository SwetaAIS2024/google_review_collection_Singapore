      "text": "On 16/09, I ordered a buttermilk chicken burger meal with special request to remove purple slaw and xtra lettuce. Also ordered a mcwrap. Waited 20-30mins fo rmy food to be served, there was a huge chunk of purple slaw in my burger, no extra lettuce was added, then i realised, there was no pineapple. By the time i realised, i had alr eaten half of the burger. Can't believe you can miss out a whole piece of pineapple. My mcwrap order was also missing when served to me, i went to the counter to ask for my mcwrap, crew told me to go back to my seat, he will attend to me after. waited 10mins, nothing. I went to the counter again, then he just handed me the mcwrap. Couldn't have just handed it to me 10 mins ago? On 21/09, i ordered a hotcakes with sausage MEAL on mobile app, went to collect my order as i opted for takeaway, it was a 15min wait btw. I went back home, my hashbrown was missing. Used to think this branch of mcdonald's was the best, but my recent experiences have made me think otherwise.  Wrote in to leave feedback via mcdonald app on 16/09, nobody got back to me about my buttermilk incident, then whats the point of the option for users to choose if we want to be contacted about our feedback? No effort to follow up.",

      "text": "Ordered table service for dbl mcspicy with cheese upsize meal with instructions to remove the lettuce. Waited for more then 20mins and had to go over the counter and self collected. Instead of double mcspicy was given single patty so i went to feedback this to the manager and she told me that she will sent it over once the pattg is cooked. But instead i was forgotten and finished my whole meal till i went to the counter to claim my patty. They even closed half of the place for cleaning which i dont see anything done and place was filled with customers. I was not the only one waited for their orders, very slow service and forgetful staffs.",
