      "text": "Probably the best chalet of the lot with a massive back yard with a direct view of the sea and the yachts from the sailing club as well as Pulau Ubin. It had rooms that are dreamily expansive by the Singaporean standard. Moreover, everything worked from the coffee machine to the wok to the really powerful aircons. We were there for 4 days for a family reunion and even through the place gets eery after dark given its close proximity to the abandoned and reportedly haunted Old Changi Hospital, it just added to the uniqueness of the atmosphere and really made us feel like we were not in Singapore anymore or at least not the Singapore of 2025.",
