The lift is also pretty damn quick, which, due to my irrational fear of lifts, unnerves me a little. But the ride is quite smooth so there isn't much issue there. The security guards are pretty helpful too.",

      "text": "Very bad attitude main security guard. Give wrong lift lobby direction but refused to admit and want to quarrel.\n\nI m a delivery driver. I informed the main guard and a part time guard at least 6 times and showed him the delivery address on my app that I need to go to unit #××-12 (one two) and block 881. He kept insisting its the wrong block stated in my app. And informed me to go to the other furthest lift and another block.\n\nSo I went but couldn't enter the unit number on the intercom and came back to the guard post again. I even called the customer to clarify. The guard denied his mistake and wanted to show aggressiveness. He said that I mentioned unit zero two (02), not unit One Two (12). How can the words \"zero\" and \"one\" sound the same!!\n\nTime is precious to all customers n he just wasted 15mins of mine n customer's perishable items.\n\nSo unprofessional as a security guard to the residence. If don't like that resident, don't bring issues onto delivery people.\n\n1st Dec around 745pm.",
