Frank Taylor,4,"This is a nice, clean, modern, and safe location for keeping your boat in the Singapore/Malaysia area.  We kept our boat here while we went home to the US for two months. The marina complex is the first completed part of a huge planned development known as Nasajaya which will have many multi-story condos, museums, cafes, multiple marinas, shopping mall, and more.  The current marina is well-staffed, and the prices are quite reasonable.  The facilities are first rate (excellent docks, good power, water, etc.), and the service is quite good.  The only negatives are that you either need to rent a car, pay for a taxi, or get the marina van to take you to places.  There's a cafe at the club house, that now serves beer.   There are several restaurants open in the buildings next to the marina which opened in late 2013/early 2014.  The Traders Hotel opened in late-spring 2013. There is an excellent mall with a supermarket that caters to international customers, but it's 15km away.  The marina van will take you to a gym a few km away that has swimming, weights, and massage parlor for very reasonable daily rates.  They do have a fuel dock, but it is a temporary floating wooden dock alongside a big quay with a long hose leading to it.   There is a new customs and immigration facility that is in the new ferry building nearby that now simplifies clearances.",10 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115287487083989909472/reviews
