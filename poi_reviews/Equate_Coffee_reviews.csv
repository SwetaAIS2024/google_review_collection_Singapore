Kelias Quek,3,"We stopped by for a quick and light bite before our evening event, hoping for a decent meal, but unfortunately, the experience was quite underwhelming. The food was passable but entirely unremarkable‚Äîflavors were muted, textures uninspired, and overall, nothing stood out. While not outright bad, there was certainly nothing to rave about either. It felt like a meal that was simply put together rather than thoughtfully crafted.

What truly dampened the experience, however, was the lack of service. It was practically non-existent, largely due to the restaurant being severely understaffed‚Äîa glaring issue, especially on a busy weekend. Tables were left unattended, requests took far too long to be acknowledged, and there was little effort to engage with diners. At times, it felt as though we were just left to fend for ourselves.

Given the mediocre food and the disorganized service, it‚Äôs hard to justify a return visit. While the place might serve as a last-minute option for convenience, it‚Äôs certainly not one I‚Äôd go out of my way to recommend. With so many fantastic dining options available, this one, unfortunately, falls far behind.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102455125673888414066/reviews
Chang Yi Tong,5,"Have to say their pork sandwiches are awesome! If you are only getting a bite, the portion is probably too big for 1 to finish. Their coffee is also pretty good too! A good recommendation in the heart of town üëçüèª",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114649514936949413803/reviews
Matilda Yeong,3,"This used to be one of my go-to cafes in orchard but the standards have dropped drastically recently. Not sure if the chef/barista changed but the dishes that used to be good are quite poor.. Scrambled eggs tasted weird and was presented quite poorly, brussel sprouts were now oily and didn‚Äôt carry the crunch it used to have, 50‚Äôs brew was rather tasteless and i could feel the bits of tea leaves in my mouth, baked eggs had its eggs overbaked and cheese underbaked. The food here used to be really good, and all the dishes mentioned above were dishes I frequently ordered because they were good. Please bring back your old chefs and baristas üòä",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115702569486231111192/reviews
Cheiro Theorem,4,"Throwback to our seasonal shopping trip! As we walked past a caf√©, the rich aroma of coffee filled the air‚Äîyum! My senses immediately craved a caffeine boost, haha. The coffee was fantastic, so aromatic and satisfying. Since the caf√© was packed with weekend crowds, we skipped the savory bites and just grabbed a quick sip before heading out.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106441412113355113329/reviews
Claire Ang,1,"Worst $8+ I‚Äôve spent on a ‚Äúmatcha latte‚Äù. Ordered my drink this Friday evening and was left terribly disappointed with the quality - filled with visible clumps and I could literally feel the matcha powder in my mouth. Was so hard to drink I eventually threw it away.

Worst part was, I brought it back to ask for my drink to be remade, but the barista insists that my drink was meant to be like this due to the type of powder they use.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116551801286774117741/reviews
