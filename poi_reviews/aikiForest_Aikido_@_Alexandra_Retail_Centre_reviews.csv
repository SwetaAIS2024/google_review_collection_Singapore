Glen Sin,5,"My kid absolutely loves his Aikido class, he look forward to it every week and even practice the stances at home!  What we like about akiforest is their gentle approach in handling the children while imparting the discipline and concept of martial art in a fun and engaging manner.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117385723802685692285/reviews
Grace Nathanael,5,Have been sending my children to Aikiforest at ARC for 3 years now. Clean and spacious dojo with friendly and helpful staff. Teacher Marina and her fellow teacher have been guiding my children in transitioning from affiliated preschool where they experienced their first lesson to moving to Alexandra branch after graduated. Small class ratio so everyone can learn from the best. Would highly recommend to parents who are interested in sending their children for Aikido,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113805536149916651971/reviews
Seah Han Chong Jeremy,5,"We brought our 4yrs old to another academy but he did not like it, we thought to give it one last try with AikiForest and teacher Marina manage to capture his interest with her interesting way of interacting with kids. Now he is 5yrs and after 2 grading, still going strong. Great job!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103874294722147856325/reviews
