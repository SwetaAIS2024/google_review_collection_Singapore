He was our salesperson for our corporate account and definitely a go to person!
Not only he went out his way to helped us but i will always receive consistent updates about their company promotion / new product launch, which i feel is very important in F&B industry.

Ari Thursday,5,"William from Zuzen Food has been my POC for food ordering and liaising. Amazing guy, goes way beyond to ensure my requests are being met and often keeps me updated on any changes and others. Definitely my go-to guy for food purchases, not to mention the wide variety of frozen foods and desserts that Zuzen offers. Definitely 10/10 recommended!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103469660878002152908/reviews
