elva w,1,"Very bad experience, young male doctors prescribe medicine, fever to see the doctor actually did not give antipyretic medicine, cough, phlegm, mouth lozenges opened a lot of drugs. This is the first time because of a fever to see a doctor spent more than 100 dollars, the hateful doctor prescribed the wrong medicine can not be returned. I also met patients in the same situation who found out that the doctor had misprescribed the medicine and wanted to return it ðŸ˜“ This clinic is absolutely bad reviews",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100328709070155009137/reviews
