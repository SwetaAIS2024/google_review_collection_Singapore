If you report or complain to the company, and she finds out, she will start ranting at you even more. She never thinks she’s the problem.\n\nThere are several other convenience stores in Plaza Singapura, so unless you specifically want to experience a shopping trip where you get scolded, there’s really no need to go there.",
