They do everything to make sure the children feel comfortable with food, nap time, and learning.\nWhen our son started, he hardly spoke any English. Now he can speak freely and express his thoughts. We are really proud of his progress and thankful for the support he got at school.\nWe also love that Little Lions often organizes fun and interesting activities like outdoor walks every day, water play, sand play, celebrations, trips, art workshops, and small shows. Every day is exciting for the kids.\nThank you to the whole team for your great work and care!",

The staff are genuine teachers, nurturers and carers. The only reason for leaving Little Lions was to prepare our son for Primary school. Thank you Ms Katelyn, Ms Chloe and rest of the staff at Little Lions!",

We are a British/American family who have been here for 6 years.\n\nOur youngest boy was born here in SG and first enjoyed coming here aged 1-2 when the pre-school was under different ownership as ‘My Prep Montessori’ - we were a little worried about the change because he was so happy there… but he has thrived at Little Lions and has been so happy there.\n\nWe regularly thank his teachers for creating such a warm, caring, and fun environment. We have loved his enthusiasm for learning, for crafts, for being kind and showing respect, and for the creative camps and little projects they have introduced. He has made good little friends there, and the whole experience has been lovely. We would happily recommend this pre-school!",
