      "text": "Did you know this stall is featured in a Michelin Guide article as one of the best places to get your dough fritters in Singapore?\n\nHandmade dough fritter is a rare find in hawker centres these days. This local snack is delicious and affordable which makes it a great companion to savour with a hot beverage.\n\nThis elderly couple has been selling freshly made youtiao (Ê≤πÊù°), butterfly fritters (Ëù¥Ëù∂ÁÖé) and ham chim peng (Âí∏ÁÖéÈ•º) here for many years. All items cost SG1 each. Whenever I am in this food centre, I will buy their butterfly fritters AKA bei hei ji or horseshoe fritters. It is crunchy on the outside, yet chewy in the middle and offers the right sweetness.\n\nTip: I recommend buying the snacks when they newly fried as this is the best moment to savour its hot and fresh dough texture.",

      "text": "The best place in Singapore for fried dough - butterfly, you tiao and hum ji peng all for $1 each! The butterfly is a must try - it has a crunchy and tasty exterior with the right balance of the taste of sesame, and a fluffy interior.\n\nNone of the products are too oily and they also do not have the old oil taste that some places who reuse their oil have. Stall is run by a very friendly uncle and auntie! Only downside is that the stall only accepts cash payment, so rmb to bring your wallet!",

I‚Äôm sure saying something is the ‚Äúbest‚Äù can be very controversial but the dough here really is, let‚Äôs say, really one of the best in Singapore. The dough itself is flavorful - butterfly being my favorite (good crunch on the outside from sesame on the outside), followed by the good ole you tiao. And the auntie taking orders is so cheerful she‚Äôs adorable! The elderly uncle is working so hard in the background. I always leave there with a big plastic bag of fried dough and a smile on my face.",
