Asking for a refill of side dishes will deliver you with an unpleasant glare as if you’ve done something wrong. The staff’s attitude is unwelcoming, and any request seems to inconvenience them. It’s a complete shame because the food has potential, but the service ruins the experience entirely. If you value good customer service, this is not the place for you.",

The right answer is this Dooboo House. They make the most nutritious Tofu themselves and serve all the table in genuine manners you will really appreciate and remember so long. They are so good at welcoming, cooking and serving. I've visited just once today but, they deserve to be known and praised more. I am really proud of them. Visit and enjoy Korean Spirit!!",
