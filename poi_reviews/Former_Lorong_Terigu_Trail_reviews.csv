Dani Baal,4,"The Former Lorong Terigu Trail is part of Singapore’s heritage and nature trails, offering a glimpse into the area’s history and natural beauty. This trail is located near the Rail Corridor, following the old railway line that used to connect Singapore with the rest of the Malay Peninsula. The name “Lorong Terigu” refers to the road in the vicinity that was historically linked to the railway system.

The trail offers a scenic walk through lush greenery, with remnants of the old railway infrastructure scattered along the route. It provides visitors with a chance to explore the rich biodiversity of the area while learning about the significance of the railway in Singapore’s development. The trail is now a popular route for nature walks, joggers, and cyclists, as it forms part of the larger Rail Corridor revitalization project that aims to blend Singapore’s natural environment with its historical railway legacy.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103357020897930875043/reviews
