There’s a 4 level library as well with culinary studios, many food places, arcade and bowling alley. Can never get bored at OTH.

Winston Teo,5,"Had a great badminton session at Tampines Hub from 8 PM to 10 PM. The hall is spacious, with 18 courts available, making it easy to book a slot. It's well-lit, providing good visibility for gameplay. Convenient amenities like water coolers and restrooms are located within the hall, making it a comfortable experience. Overall, a great place for badminton enthusiasts!

$2.40 per entry for parking. Will definitely be back.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103983640077681957103/reviews
Jardin Jumat,4,"Outside will be based on weather. The day i visit was hot humid. Even though got giant fan at the mall, its still hot. The stadium, same thing. All depends on weather. Better bring your own portable fans to counter the humidity. Other than that. The place got alot of shop for foodies. Great place to eat. And there's some interesting activities there as well.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112123481625988110362/reviews
Joyce “Joyful Explorer”,5,"One of our favourite place! We love that it is a one-stop for study, play and food. We have one super cool library with a large collection of books. A MakeIT area where one can learn to tinker with 3D Pen, 3d printer, sewing, etc. Many different sports facilities to cater to all our needs. A sheltered running track. Various pool facilities with water playground. Indoor playground - both free and paid. Bowling. Table Tennis. Multi Purpose Hall. One will be spoilt for choices for food too. And movie screenings! Lots of study tables for study and play too. Love to borrow their board games at the customer service counter for games we don't have them at home. Recently, a community piano is added!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116040496274789301932/reviews
