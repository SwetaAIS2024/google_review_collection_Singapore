Jo Y,5,"I’ve sent my little baby girl since she was few months old to SGM kidz, little did I know SGM kidz teachers are super awesome,

Especially Teacher Wati, Teacher Joanne, Teacher Apple, and even the new comers teachers did their very best to take care of our kids, there’s a new lady teacher with dyed hair I didn’t get her name and teacher Azizah as well as teacher Rachel they all did a great job too, I did not regret one bit sending my infant baby girl to SGM kidz, it’s the best decision made,

if you can see from the photo I took of Teacher Wati and my baby girl, she was crying because she refused to go to school just like every morning but Teacher Wati took her time to carry her and sang songs to her to cheer her up, and it’s not the first day of school, it’s already 6 months long and Teacher Wati still sincerely treat my baby girl like it’s her first day in school, please promote Teacher Wati or give her a raise :) highly recommend to send your kids to SGM kidz

I also would like to add on the principal is very enthusiastic and entertaining to us the parents, very professional and definitely the best suited for principal",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114504231489393643165/reviews
