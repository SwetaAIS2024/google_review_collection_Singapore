devilaz devious,1,"The Tuna maguro is a total mess. The meat doesn't melt in your mouth like jelly as you bite but instead it feels so soggy and mashy.

The mentaiko tamako taste üëçüèΩ

Sauce for the cold soba is too salty(my preference)..should adjust to lighter taste instead. üëéüèΩ

Not worth to come back for 2nd time.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100507376416577530937/reviews
Ravish M,5,A great halal Japanese food place found. The place is very cozy and the food is super yummy. The pricing is reasonable and staff is very courteous. Drove from other corner of Singapore to try this place and was happy to be there. The food was served hot and presentable. Tried their few dishes and garlic fried rice took me to the next level üòÄ. All other dishes as posted in the pictures are yummy and tasty. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for halal Japanese food in Singapore in the Jalan Kayu area. For people far away from here would not regret to visit.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116138807654098240752/reviews
Shuhada Jamal,5,"I ate :
Salmon sushi (get the belly part so it's fatty and delicious) wasabi are fresh too

Tuna Sashimi ( melt in your mouth, not really my fav but still good )

Garlic Fried Rice ( Tastes like tenpanyaki garlic fried rice which in my opinion is nice and well balanced)

Raw Oyster ( Plump and juicy The best raw oyster i ever eat in SG at halal restaurant )

Overall the seafood is legit fresh and not fishy at all same like other review said. The kimchi side and salad are to die for. Thanks to the kitchen team for serving the best dish. Very detailed and good quality of ingredients.

The service are top notch too. Madam who serve me today deserve a compliment for her hospitality. She will keep add the hot water into your green tea so you can enjoy the green tea more and help clear the dirty  plate after you finish it so you can eat in peace.

This place has become my new fav place to dine. I feel happy to spend my money at this halal Izakaya with this kind of value .

Sincerely a satisfied Customer.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107130025236077271547/reviews
Ira Salleh,5,"One of the best Halal Japanese food I have ever tried. The sushi is very fresh, big and succulent, the Angus meat skewer was tender and juicy, the miso soup is very rich and they are very generous with the toppings for the rice bowls and I love that the hot green tea came in little jars and cups. Been there twice and definitely would go again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102996138117195433917/reviews
Alex Leng,1,"Surprised in a negative way by the quality of food served here.

Went there recently to meet up my group of friends. Place was crowded and nice as expected on a Friday evening, but the food served was just horrible. Ordered this salmon thingy sushi, it was horrendous. When I took a bite of it, it was hard. I thought that it was supposed to be smooth at least. I should have listened to my instincts and quickly run away to a different venue, after all it is located on a busy stretch of food shops. But my friends were enjoying themselves so ok fine.

Ordered this set meal - teriyaki chicken with a coke. The coke was the best part of the meal. The teriyaki chicken was so hard and overly fried. The seaweed chicken pack after air fry would have tasted better than this. I left the entire bowl of food uneaten after the first 3 bites. Chicken was hard and dry.

Verdict: never coming back!
P/S: my friend booked this place cause she said of the good reviews she saw. I am not too sure how accurate that is, but I am definitely not going to spend my hard earned money on this establishment ever again.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101849497569029608889/reviews
