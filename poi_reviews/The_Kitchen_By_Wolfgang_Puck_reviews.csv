Hui Ping Tan,4,"5 stars for their service but food was 3 stars. Thank you Pla-Ant for the exceptional service! It was tough to deal with a 2-year-old but she has been nice to play with him. The pork ribs was tough, not much meat and too little sauce. The truffle fries were nice though. WP burger, fish & chips and carbonara were so so. Kids pasta was too sour. Coffee is kinda overpriced too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104665643633517206090/reviews
Fiat,4,"Nice menu, beautiful food varieties. Nice place at the airport. Not too cloudy very well designed with the view on the airport. You finish your meal you can chill out by the small pool with the colorful fish.  Nice and relaxing place.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115063930537770273587/reviews
Retronala,5,"Great food served with fabulous service !!!

Had the grilled salmon done perfectly and served promptly.

The sautéed summer vegetables is very good as well!!

Will definitely return for more!

Just that food preparation can take awhile when the restaurant is rather full. So if you are rushing for flight, ask how long the wait is gonna be.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112518296548968952078/reviews

2bearbear Tom Lim,4,"Glad to have been able to try out the Avocado Bread Toast ($24), Steak and Eggs ($28) as well as the Half Chicken Cremolata ($28) on these different visits…

We actually did like all the dishes served above. In particular, the steak (Steak and Eggs – $28) was flavourful and had the fatty bits on the end. Slightly overcooked but we still enjoyed it with crispy potatoes on the side. Perhaps we should go with “medium rare” next time. As for the Half Chicken Cremolata ($28), it was really tender and moist on the inside as well. Although we would have loved more avocado on our toast, in terms of the taste department, the Avocado Bread Toast ($24) was decent – though we’d unlikely order it again next time due to the close pricing to Steak and Eggs.

During our visits, we also got to try the desserts…
