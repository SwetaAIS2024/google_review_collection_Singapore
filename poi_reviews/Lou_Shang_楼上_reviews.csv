I was kinda right.\n\nSeeing the decor up close was quite something, if you’ve lived through this era you would find it a blast to the past! The door being framed as an elevator is also a great touch. The false walls give room for a small light behind each door, giving a sense of being in a lived-in corridor. If this was the exterior, then 冰糖糖水办公室 would show the interior.\n\nThat aside, I went for the full breakfast(I know, it’s just a breakfast platter, nothing fusion) but I found it kinda lacking. The Rosti was overly soft and lifting the pieces you could tell it was drooping abit. The curry mayo also basically tasted like Creme Fraiche, couldn’t really taste much curry. The scrambled eggs were fine, so were the mushrooms. The chicken cheese sausage were also very ordinary. The best parts were the toast and the otah.\n\nThe toast was crispy and chewy, with a nice slab of butter on top. Just good in general. The otah was the only thing out of the ordinary in your standard breakfast platter and it stood out. A little sweeter compared to most otahs and alot spicier, had nice texture and was smooth enough to cut without being gel-like. Watch out for the kick if you can’t take spice.\n\nOverall, for the price you could do worse, but you could do better too. Visit for the decor and maybe the fusion food, just not for this. Maybe order something else with otah on the side? I’ll go a little lighter on it for the novelty, it’s a place you should visit once(maybe with your parents).\n\n7/10', 'languageCode': 'en'}","{'text': 'Lou Shang’s Full Breakfast @ Lou Shang\n\nHaving seen this in so many social media posts, I thought it was quite novel but probably just cafe-ish.
