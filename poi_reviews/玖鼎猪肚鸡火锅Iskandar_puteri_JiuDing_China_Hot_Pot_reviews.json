      "text": "We had a wonderful dining experience at this restaurant. The food was fresh, with a great variety of ingredients to choose from, and the broth was flavorful even after several top up on the soup. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed without being intrusive. What I appreciated most was the peaceful atmosphere‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt overly crowded or noisy, allowing for a relaxing meal. If you‚Äôre looking for a good steamboat place with great service and a quiet environment, this is definitely worth a visit! Overall it cost RM189 for this wonderful meal. It‚Äôs worth it. Will return again.",
