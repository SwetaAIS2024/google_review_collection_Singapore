C,3,"Cyathea Hut at Chestnut Nature Park is a simple, functional shelter that provides a shaded rest stop along the trail — great for taking a quick break from the sun or rain. It’s nothing fancy, but a welcome feature for hikers needing a breather.

Nearby, there’s a small bridge that serves as a minor landmark within the park. While subtle, it adds a bit of visual interest to the trail and helps break up the walk. I’d rate the spot a 3 out of 5 — basic but useful, and part of the charm of exploring the park’s quieter corners.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108121427451405924195/reviews
