It was cooked with a great stock base which lent it good depth.\n\nCuttlefish was excellent, fresh and springy.\n\nBraised peanut was a good balance to the overall dish.\n\nI am looking forward to visiting again to try other offerings.",

I always go for triple egg porridge and century egg porridge. The sliced pork porridge is awesome too with a unique pork fragrant.\n\nThe youtiao is unbeatable compared to other stores as they fry on the spot, so it’s crispy and hot. Shiok!!",
