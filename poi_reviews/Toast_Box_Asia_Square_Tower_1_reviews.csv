Stephanie Choong,4,"Maintaining their food standards, but price has gone up quite a bit (Sorry, I've not had Kaya toast set for a long time). Last I had was around $4.50 and now is $6.00 a set.

The atmosphere is ok if not crowded. All high chairs and tables by the window.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106489618015949867950/reviews
Teh C Gao Siew Dai,3,"Visited again on 28 July 2023. Initially there was no queue when I ordered. However, the queue formed and grew after me. Staff can be more courteous and serve customer instead of checking his phone, especially if customer is already waiting.

19 May 2023 - Outlet is located in Asia Square Food Garden. There was a small queue but service was still quick and efficient. The Teh C ordered was acceptable.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102646679801920717610/reviews

Rachel Chew,1,"Food is of the normal Toast Box standard and expensive than other outlets. What’s worst is the service level of the staff sucks to the max and could have be much better. If the management of Toast Box see this, I think you should either give them a retraining or put them out of the front line so your customers won’t experience such lousy and rude attitude.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112828927819283080777/reviews
