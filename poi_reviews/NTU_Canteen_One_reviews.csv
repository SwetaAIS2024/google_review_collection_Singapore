Colin Hong,5,"The Indian food here is bussin! The Indian aunty was super friendly and warm, and loves the food she serves. This Briyani was delicious, yet not too oily. The marsala chicken was flavorful and I could taste the effort that went into it.

There are special promotions on different days, so I'm excited to come back and try them again! One of the most reasonable food here in NTU.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108522089452538457928/reviews
