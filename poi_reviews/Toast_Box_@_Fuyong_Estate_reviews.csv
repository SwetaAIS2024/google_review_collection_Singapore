Flying Molen,5,"Worth a visit if you want to get a local taste but donâ€™t want to sweat under the hot and humid weather. The interior design is cosy and old colonial fashion. The old pictures on the wall tell the history of this place and the railway that connected Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia. I ordered their nasi lemak and coffee with milk. The nasi lemak was flavourful. The rice, chicken wing, egg, cucumbers, peanuts with ikan bilis, and sambal paste were beautifully arranged on top of a banana leaf. The coffee was excellent. Itâ€™s prepared at the right temperature and with balance amount of milk. Although the total price was a bit high, the overall experience paid off ðŸ¥°",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113209867782143825808/reviews
Bian Lee,4,"Went there for breakfast after submitting Bukit Timah Hill twice. There was a queue but it moved pretty fast. The Milo was thick and not too sweet. I love the consistency of the soft boiled eggs. Itâ€™s a good place for catch up after our morning exercise. And Cold Storage is just a few steps away to pick up some groceries

The place is clean despite the high traffic",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106963842817729813226/reviews
Mandy (Rin),5,"Really have to give credit for the fast serving once order is taken. Coffee turns out to be one of the best local kopi we had, kudos to the lad making the drinks.

Yam toast was great, I love how the butter melts in the mouth instead of being a cold slab of butter. I would ask for less butter so that I could get more taste of yam. Was looking forward to the black sesame toast however it was a tad disappointing cos the spread was thin and the butter overpowered in taste.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112464850479125656421/reviews
Ilamaran Ramamoorthy,4,Had tea and toast bread with my childhood close friend & uncle. We dropped by this to have a quick drink before heading to an event nearby. The cafe has a great ambience with a beautiful & calm interior. Very fast and efficient service. The food tastes great too. It is an ideal cafe for hot drinks and a long chat.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107209163547292370189/reviews
EL Liew,4,One of the Toast Box with cooler environment and bigger space. Ample places on a weekday morning. The mee rebus from this branch was good. Coffee and tea as good as other branches.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108730848222366414650/reviews
