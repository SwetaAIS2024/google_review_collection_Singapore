Even after the course ended, he remained approachable and responded quickly to my questions. His dedication and helpful nature make him a truly great teacher. I highly recommend anyone considering the RES course to learn from Kent!\nOne tip i can share with student taking RES exam, never give up, read thru the notes, do all the questions book. You will sure to pass! All the best!",

      "text": "Hurray!!! I couldn't hold my excitement for one time passed.\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank Real Centre Network TAMPINES for providing such a confident RES course. I am also thankful that Mr. Kent Soo is so generous in his presentation styles. The willingness to help students make me feel touching. He is a very experienced lecturer and RES. Through his experience in the Real Estate industry, he can tell us more practical knowledge and expertise. Hopefully, RCN TAMPINES can retain such a good lecturer to teach more future RES.\n\nOne more person to thanks is Serene. Serene can manage all kinds of problems I face before and after courses as a dedicated and meticulous individual. Serene is friendly and helpful.\n\nThank you RCN TAMPINES again!!! :)",
