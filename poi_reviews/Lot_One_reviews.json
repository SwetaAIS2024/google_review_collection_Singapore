      "text": "It’s a compact yet well-equipped neighborhood mall located right next to Choa Chu Kang MRT and LRT stations, making it super convenient for residents and commuters alike. It’s not a mega mall, but it packs in the essentials—from retail stores and a NTUC FairPrice supermarket to a library, cinema (Cathay Cineplex), and food court.\n\nThe mall has a good mix of local and international brands, and the upper levels are home to clinics, enrichment centers, and family-friendly services. It’s a great place to run errands, grab a bite, or catch a movie without traveling far.\n\nWhile it may not be a major shopping destination like Orchard or VivoCity, Lot One is a solid go-to for everyday needs and casual hangouts. It’s clean, accessible, and gets the job done.",

During the hours when the library (the books area) is yet to open (normally between 11am to 9pm), no staff will be around at this zone to assist. You can book a seat on NLB app or scan the QR code at the table to use the computers or for self study. Entrance near Fun Toast Level 4.",
