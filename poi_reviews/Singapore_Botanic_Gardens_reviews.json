I spent 2 hours in there alone.\nIf you have the time, take your time,  there are places to stop and listen and also to get coffee and cake (if needed üòã)\nHighly recommended",

The garden is well signposted as to what is where. There are a reasonable number of toilets, which are free, always clean and there are drinking fountains.",

You could see beautiful plants and flowers, orchids and even animals like birds, swans, fish, turtles,‚Ä¶.. .If you are lucky, you could see an otter passing the road! This place should be best in the afternoon. When I visited this place, it was in the morning so it was kind of hot. Lovely lace for a picnic or a walk. 5 starü§©ü§©ü§©ü§©",

The park also features a lake, a small decorative waterfall, and a wide variety of tropical plants.\n\nAlthough I didn‚Äôt see anyone actively trimming or maintaining the greenery, everything looked well cared for.\n\nEntrance is free, but if you want to visit the orchid garden, there is an admission fee",
