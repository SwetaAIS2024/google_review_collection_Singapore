Eint Nyein San,5,"I recently had the pleasure of taking an signature eyelash extension basic + advanced course with the incredible Juju, and I couldn't be more impressed. From the moment I enrolled, the admin, Elliot, made everything seamless and welcoming.

Juju's dedication to her students is unmatched. Not only does she provide every single piece of equipment needed for the course, but she also goes above and beyond by supplying enough materials to give extra people a brand-new lash set. It's truly astounding!

What sets Juju apart is her unique offering of a free eyelash pod—the first of its kind in Singapore. This, coupled with her transparency and the fact that there are no hidden prices, makes her classes an absolute delight. Juju's expertise and genuine care for her students make her the best eyelash extension coach in Singapore.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106551250609474021824/reviews
Syaza Aqilah,5,"Amazing class!!

I picked this place because of the topics that it covered so I would be able to be more well versed. It was exactly how I expected it to be and more. Other courses would teach u the basic thing, that's it. She covered all aspects.

They provided starter packages, which was incredibly useful for a beginner.

Teacher juju was patient, stern, and very experienced.

Totally recommended.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110560310041275699645/reviews
