We checked all the cubicles and he was no where to be found. When we exit the toilet he mysteriously some how got back out, he told us that he did not see us too and if we were walking to the toilet he would have been obvious if he was walking back. I remembered there was once the toilet was locked up too, to prevent people from going in. Idk why but maybe its cursed.",
