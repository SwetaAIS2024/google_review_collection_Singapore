      "text": "This restaurant food is ok but what is so dissapointing about this restaurant is that though it was stated that there shld be no wastage of food else would be charged , the owner of restaurant don't have to scouge thru our food n soup to look for food leftover before deciding if we are clear to go . It is so embarrassing and unprofessional in my opinion . This will be my last time to visit this place . A simple lunch buffet for 3 w 3 standard drinks sets us back $127.",

If U’re opting for the weekday buffet promo, note that the promo price is excluding the soup base. The ambience is really good too, nice and cosy place. Will come back again. Oh, the beer is cheap, but glad I did not order as I ran out of space.",

Based on total price, makes Hai Di Lao look very affordable and reaaonably priced.\n\nNonetheless, this is a good place to go if you have no better alternative as there are usually seats available.\n\nRecommended to stick to cooked dishes here, like zhi char restaurant instead.",
