Jun Wei Koh,4,"I visited Tanjong Rimau last Saturday and had a great time exploring the rocky shoreline. One thing to note is that the rocks can be quite slippery, so make sure to wear sturdy shoes and be cautious when navigating the area. It's also important to check the tide information before visiting as some areas may be inaccessible during high tide.

One of the things I appreciated the most about this spot is how secluded it feels - it's hard to find such serenity in Singapore with no crowds or noise pollution around. Overall, it's a beautiful and unique spot in Singapore to explore the coastline and enjoy the peaceful scenery",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107110413670660540015/reviews
HC Lum,4,"It is definitely a good and unique experience to visit here. Please handle your safety as first priority as the place is quite remote and fewer people will get notice if anything were to happen accidentally. It is a scenic place to be but got to watch closely with the timing of tides to avoid disappointment. Really would like to see the 2 long legged houses, but just hesitated to explore further (safety first). I believe it was just behind the corner.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107295031316336799609/reviews

KZ Seet,5,"Very nice beach that is remote and hence everything is as original as possible. Low tide is the best time to go as you can walk on the rocky shore. However, please be careful due to the terrain.

gideon lam,5,"I first learnt about Tanjong Rimau when people on the internet was talking about some secret beach in Sentosa. So I went there to check it out. Initially I went there via the Fort Siloso Route and the access to there is restricted as you will end up on a high cliff. However the view of Keppel Harbour was good.

I went there again the following morning and it was as early as 8.30am when the tides was low on that very day. (Check the tide schedule to avoid making a wasted trip). The intertidal walk was magnificent and I saw many coral reefs and marine wildlife. There were also pitcher plants found at the cliff area. I learnt that the rock formation dates back to the Jurrasic Period and that there was a dinosaur footprint found there.

Nparks should have created a boardwalk like that of Chek Jawa so that people who goes there during the low tide wouldn't disturb the wildlife,especially the corals and the sea grass",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113126193042559138360/reviews
