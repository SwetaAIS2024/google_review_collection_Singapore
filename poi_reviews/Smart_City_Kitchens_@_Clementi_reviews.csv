Low Bao Heng,3,"Amazing. Came to collect my self-pick up order. Like what others had commented, there‚Äôs no/poor network. Overall an interesting experience.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108033403024309465290/reviews
TT YL,1,"Ordered through Jollibee app and went to this ulu location at 25 Pandan Crescent to collect. Patiently waited for order number to be displayed. Many grab/food panda riders have collected and left. After 30minutes or so, decided to check with the only visible staff behind the closed window counter. Her immediate reply was that we were supposed to approach her. (How would we know that? We assumed ours were in line since we ordered through app. App status showed processing)

Network was terrible at basement, only Singtel works unstably. Starhub/Giga nothing at all.

Although staff could see us from her seat, she made NO initiative/attempt to assist 1st time visitors. She was in her own world.

After approaching the staff, we waited again... a few more collections took place but ours still no news.

We wasted 1 hour plus there.

Concept is good but location at B1 isn't ideal, staff's service level need improvement as well.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116384428661300999918/reviews
