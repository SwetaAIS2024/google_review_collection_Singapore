Jarvinia Xie,1,"Worst tooth cleaning experience ever and a complete waste of money to conduct other tests‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
The clinical response to my questions is not very polite and seems to push the problem around.

Have been a loyal customer to this clementi branch for years, but was so disappointing that I will consider the well-decorated clinic next to it next time.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107974746136007366229/reviews

Yumo Pan,5,"Wisdom tooth surgery

Had the best dental experience with Dr Cassandra Lim and her team.
My appointment was at 12pm, and I finished consultation+xray+wisdom tooth surgery within 1 hour (I left the clinic before 1pm).
Dr Lim is so experienced and gentle, the entire process wasn‚Äôt as scary as I previously thought. The pain was totally bearable and I stopped taking painkillers from Day 2. Also to my surprise, there wasn‚Äôt any swelling at all (although this might vary case by case).",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110328200134622855424/reviews
