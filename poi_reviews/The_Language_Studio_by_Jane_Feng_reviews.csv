Raymond Chua,5,"**Review for teacher Jane**

We are incredibly impressed with Jane's dedication and teaching methods. What stood out the most was her ability to connect with Raphael on a personal level, which kept him engaged and motivated throughout the lessons. Jane‚Äôs approach is not only structured and thorough but also flexible, adapting to Raphael's needs and learning style.

Under her guidance, Raphael has shown significant growth in his English skills, particularly in his writing and comprehension. She focuses on building both his confidence and foundational knowledge, which has helped him tackle challenging topics with ease.

I would highly recommend Jane to any parent seeking an exceptional tutor who is patient, attentive, and truly committed to their child's progress.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108737818977961285920/reviews
Kanako Mori,5,"Jane‚Äôs proficiency in Japanese was a tremendous help during one of the events I supported for Japanese visitors in Singapore. Initially, Jane was one of the participants, but when we realised that the organiser had not appointed an emcee, she took the initiative to facilitate communication between the Japanese and local participants. Without Jane, many of the Japanese guests would have felt lost, so I‚Äôm very grateful for her assistance. I believe her passion for languages will inspire young students. Wishing you all the best in your future endeavours, Jane!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102847623732290814392/reviews
Jerlyn Tan,5,"Just attended a Japanese dessert lesson with a master from Japan, it was so intimidating to learn from someone who couldn't speak a common language but thankfully we had Miss Jane with us to save the day~

Clearly if you ever attempt to learn a lesson conducted in another language, you might feel introverted or just 'lets get this done and over with' but I was immediately drawn to Jane's warm personality and professional translation! Even I took the courage to ask her questions in order to really learn as much as I can, despite being shy.

It was amazing how she took observation to the actions and surroundings around her, making sure she assist to asking questions at the right time to prevent the master teacher from getting overwhelmed. She would go up and beyond to check the clarity of the problem, sharing our opinions to the teacher in order to get more insight, ultimately, you could totally trust her and her skills!

Love the way she speaks too, it was clear in tone and speech, it was a good way for me to practice hearing and even speaking Japanese too.

Overall, I had a very good experience, and I even made friends with her and I wouldn't have it any other way~üå∏ Thank you very much~",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105933711943347984752/reviews
