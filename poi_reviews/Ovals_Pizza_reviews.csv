commander eps,5,"they pride themselves in their homemade dough, cheese and fresh ingredients! i love their pizza dough, which is thin-crusted yet still retains a chew üçû absolutely divine for texture lovers :)

i thoroughly enjoyed both the pizzas i tried: scorpion and design pizza. the scorpion comes with jalape√±os, chicken sausages, olives which pack a flavour bomb in each slice üí£

the design pizza is a fully customisable DIY pizza, where you can choose the amount of marinara sauce and cheese, as well as the toppings and protein you fancy! you‚Äôll definitely enjoy the pizza because it‚Äôs filled with everything you like üòÜ

another stunner was their sweet knots!!! it‚Äôs basically their pizza dough with lots of sugar and butter, and doused in sweetened condensed milk ü§§ü§§ doesn‚Äôt it sound heavenly alr?",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116922317507738631153/reviews
Ravi Nair,5,"Ordered online and arranged for pick up. The place, which is a central kitchen at Serangoon North, was a little difficult to find. However, the designer pizzas were simply awesome. Very generous with the ingredients. The sweet knots were complimentary and were just as nice. Everything was great and as indicated on the box highly addictive. Highly recommended.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110019581652439678126/reviews
Caleb Ellis,5,"Amazing pizza with great value! Came fast and was worth it. Tastes authentic, and the size for the price is good! The sweet knots are amazing too.

Rose,5,Pizza's flavours are very well balanced and the size of it for its price?? The star for me were the sweet knots that retained it crunchyness even through delivery. It had a perfect balance of the baked char and the sweet glaze damnnnn 5/5,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109259018744489836002/reviews
