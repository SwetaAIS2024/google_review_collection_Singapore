SC X,5,"I recently had the privilege of being treated by Dr. Tan Bin Chet’s , and I am truly grateful for the exceptional care I received under his expertise. From the very first consultation, Dr. Tan demonstrated deep medical knowledge and took the time to provide clear, detailed explanations about my condition and the recommended procedures. His ability to explain complex medical terms in a way that was easy to understand gave me great confidence and peace of mind.

Dr. Tan performed both an endoscopy and a gastrointestinal surgical procedure for me. His professionalism, precision, and calm demeanor throughout the process were outstanding. It was evident that he possesses a high level of skill and experience in his field, and I felt well taken care of every step of the way.

Stephen Wang,4,"I recently had a cyst removed by Dr. Toh and the entire experience was excellent. He communicated clearly and kindly before the surgery, which made me feel comfortable and well-informed. After the procedure, I had two follow-up visits where he carefully checked the healing and even addressed some post-op swelling by draining the clogged blood. Thanks to his attentive care, my recovery was quick and smooth. Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117135595155560523577/reviews

Abigail Chang (Claritykisses),5,"Dr Toh is a compassionate & trustworthy surgeon that makes his patients feel assured and safe no matter the circumstances, with his passion for gastrointestinal health shining through in the various consultation and conversations I had with him. I was admitted into Parkway East hospital for gastrointestinal issues and Dr Toh was referred to me to be on my case as a second opinion after a CT scan showed an inflamed gallbladder with the presence of gallstone. Dr Toh patiently talked me through the surgery process, and assured me that it was a low risk surgery. Post surgery, Dr Toh also checked in frequently and explained what he did during the surgery, where he also did repairs for my umbilical cord hernia on top of removing my gallbladder. He also showed detailed images and footage of the surgery process and educated me on it which I found was a really interesting and essential part of me understanding what happened in my body. Dr Toh also promptly replied to my messages when I was facing issues that I have with my surgical wounds prior to my follow up appointment. A great surgeon that is super passionate about his job - one that I will definitely recommend!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113570038935151892741/reviews
