      "text": "considering that theme parks are the most FOMO-inducing places to have a meal (due to the plethora of highly-themed and attractive options at one's disposal), i completely understand if you're struggling to choose your food-spot-of-the-day while at universal singapore. let me ease your worries and direct you to oasis spice cafe — right across from this park's mummy clone (if the florida version ends up closing, let's all pray that this one stays intact). DELICIOUS eats at this shaded spot, away from the hustle and bustle right outside. food is served fast and fresh with a counter service style; order the mutton if you want an absolute BURST of flavour in your mouth. the samosas were also so so so unexpectedly good. don't let the singapore heat deter you from a heat-filled feast. the spice will cool you off !!",

A bit chaotic and if you order poppadoms for example you have to queue twice once for your curry and then again for your poppadoms. Weird. If you ask the staff who gave you the curry to give you the poppadoms they just stare at you blankly.",

Even though we’re used to different tastes back home, we truly enjoyed every bite. Great job to the chefs and the whole team! Highly recommended for anyone looking for tasty and satisfying meals.",
