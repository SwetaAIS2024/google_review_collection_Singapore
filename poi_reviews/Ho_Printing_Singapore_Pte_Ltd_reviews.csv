Tatyana Kildisheva,5,"I'm a book author based in Singapore and I had the best experience with Ho Printing metal offset printing job that they did for my publication.
My photography book required very meticulous printing job to convey correct colours and they did the most perfect job possible given that it was a few thousands of copies.
Great communication and technical support throughout from the Ho Printing team were unparalleled. To insure the quality they provided multiple proofs and retakes until they got my photography colours correctly for the book production.
Highly satisfied with the experience and I am recommending Ho Printing to everyone.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106833004116927616303/reviews

Jo Bailey,5,"I can highly recommend Ho Printing Singapore! I am a New Zealand author who has had two books printed at the company. The quality of the books was excellent (one was full colour, and the other black and white). The service and communication of Wah Yuen Ho and his team was also absolutely superb. I have really enjoyed my experience dealing with Ho Printing and  I have no hesitation in recommending them - in fact I continue to do so regularly to others in the writing community here. Keep up the great work team! I look forward to having more books printed with you in the future.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111831916888653639158/reviews
