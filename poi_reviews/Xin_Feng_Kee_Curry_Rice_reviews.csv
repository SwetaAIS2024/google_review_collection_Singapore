Louie Chong,5,"The curry is very good and the portion is big enough for a male adult. This is a balanced plate of curry rice with meat, veggie, egg, and rice. They use the more expensive Japanese rice that adds more flavor to the dish however the rice today was a little too moist. Highly recommend this if you crave a good Singapore style curry with a good piece of meat.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102104603990601854320/reviews
