Dany Chan,5,"Fantastic place for a relaxing night out! Friendly staff, a cozy vibe, and a great selection of drinks‚Äîideal for catching up with friends. The deal of free darts credit with 3-5 buckets of beer made it an even more enjoyable and unforgettable evening with the group!‚Äù",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116718304704941280415/reviews
Matthew Lee,5,"Went with wife, bro & sis in law. The beers prices are cheaper than most places at $48 per 8 bottles bucket during happy hour. Non happy hour price is $55, which is equally value for money.

Special mention to the karaoke system (KOD) which has most of the latest songs. The mics and sound systems were impressive too.

Didn‚Äôt order finger food this round but the menu looks good. Will try next time coz will definitely go back again. There‚Äôs a tasty steamboat just opposite the shop. And there‚Äôs free parking!!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104876534813745812829/reviews

John Soh,5,"Love the coziness of the place especially the private room whereby you can have gatherings with friends playing darts and singing karaoke in privacy. The finger food also tastes great. Last but not least, the beer buckets pricing are worth cheaper compared to similar outlets. Definitely a place worth going!
