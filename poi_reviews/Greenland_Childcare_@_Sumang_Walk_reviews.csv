Nelson Quek,5,"We’ve had such a great experience with Greenland at Sumang Walk! My daughter absolutely loves it there and looks forward to school every single day. She’s always the first one awake in the morning, excited and determined to be the first to reach school.

Miss Judy and Miss Song have been amazing teachers. My daughter adores them, and it’s clear how much effort they put into creating a fun, loving, and nurturing environment for the kids.

When we recently bought our new place, one of the key considerations was ensuring it was near our current house, which is near to Greenland so she could continue attending the preschool she loves so much. We’re so glad we made that choice!

Highly recommend Greenland to any parent looking for a warm and supportive preschool for their little one!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112644253236382139486/reviews

J T,5,"We transferred our child to Greenland Childcare @ Sumang Walk in 2023, and the difference has been remarkable. From the very start, I was impressed by the warm, nurturing environment the teachers provide. They are dedicated, caring, and truly invested in the children’s growth.

In just a short time, I’ve seen my child make incredible progress in both learning and confidence. She has developed a real love for attending childcare and looks forward to going every day.

Our child has also made lasting friendships and loves spending time with her peers, which speaks volumes about the supportive, positive atmosphere at Greenland. As she graduate this year and transit to Primary 1, I can confidently say that this centre has laid a strong foundation for her academic and social development.

I am so grateful for the care and attention given to my child, and I know she will carry the lessons she’s learned here into her next chapter. Highly recommend Greenland Childcare to anyone looking for a wonderful environment for their child.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101071084297886764937/reviews
