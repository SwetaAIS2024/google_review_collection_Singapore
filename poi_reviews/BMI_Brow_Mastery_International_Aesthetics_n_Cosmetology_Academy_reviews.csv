Jenny is a nice, friendly, capable, patient, knowledgeable, experience and professional teacher / coach.

I had enrolled 3-days course on eyelash extensions course with zero knowledge and experience, I had learnt a new skills and tactics through her guidance.

During the course day, she made me feel ultimate relax and always boost my confidence to strive better by sharing her experiences.
