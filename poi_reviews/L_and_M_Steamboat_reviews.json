They served the cooking tray after wiping with kitchen washcloths which they are using for wiping tables!!!!! And I requested to wash the cooking tray, and yet another one they gave me had crawling animals after putting on stove which I dun even know what they are! The worst place ever to dine! And My craving on a rainy day just disappeared and lost appetite!!!!!!!! They need to close down!",
