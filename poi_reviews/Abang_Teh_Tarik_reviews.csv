silverhorse,5,This stall makes very nice teh. One of the best low budget teh in SG imo. Only $1/cup. I don't drink kopi so not sure if their kopi is also as good. Their youtiao (油条）is also very crispy and cost only $0.90. Where to find,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115397086693158876147/reviews
