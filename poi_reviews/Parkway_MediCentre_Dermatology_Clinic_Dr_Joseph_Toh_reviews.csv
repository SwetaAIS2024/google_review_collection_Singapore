Darren Vuong,5,"Iâ€™ve been seeing Dr Toh for several months to treat my eczema which was both stubborn and severe.  During my first visit Dr Toh thoroughly explained how to take better care of my skin, all the available treatments and we chose a comprehensive treatment plan (dupixent + skin care) suitable for me.  After 2 months my eczema is 80% improved and getting better each week.  Very happy with the results and Iâ€™ve had a very good experience at the clinic.  Dr Toh is very knowledgeable and professional, and staff is courteous and fast!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102913617751169019952/reviews
