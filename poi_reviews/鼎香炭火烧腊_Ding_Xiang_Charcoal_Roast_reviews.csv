cpv green,3,"Roast duck is black and hard, probably that's why the stall name has the word charcoal. Hor fun portion is small. Otherwise, taste is ok",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117814917533501177360/reviews
Ryan Ng,1,"Don’t bother coming here. Bunch of cheat and beggars. Use your cdc voucher at risk as they will over charge you. $4.30 but ask to redeem for $5 because they don’t accept part cash part vouchers. And when they charge $5 - no change given. And when you complain, grab food out from hand and throw away. They knew their scam were up when he gave back the cash.

Take them off the cdc plan as they don’t deserve it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102840716051974990892/reviews
Noel Teo Jin Hong,5,Just tried their dang gui duck and char siew. Duck was tender with herbal notes. Dang gui sauce was superb. Char siew was nicely charred and fatty. Prices reasonable too!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109822282006979219530/reviews
