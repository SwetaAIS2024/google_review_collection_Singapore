Marcus Chua,5,"I have been seeing physician Huang since he was a consultant for Euyansang. He is patient and give good health advices. My whole family has been seeing him for the past 10 over years bcoz his diagnosis is accurate and most importantly his prescription works for us.

It‚Äôs good to see him starting his own practice and I hope he can continue to serve the community bcoz it‚Äôs rather hard to find someone who is non-commercialized, high morals and genuinely care for his patients. Thumbs up to him!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105742174403132073570/reviews
