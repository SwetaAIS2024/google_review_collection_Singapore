But it was wet/ soggy, and the lemak taste was lacking.\n\nThe fried chicken was ok, the extra portion of thigh meat we ordered was better fried/ cooked through than the drumstick üçó - which was crispy on outside but tight/ tough on the inside (under cooked).\n\nSambal was ok (not spectacular), but was important to help make this nasi lemak more palatable.\n\nNot a fan.",

The Chili is really super good. Overall a good plate of nasi lemak. Will definitely be back here again",
