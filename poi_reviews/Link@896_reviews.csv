Stephen Kong,1,"Crazy management, after drop off, by right we can drive away easily by turning left. But they want us to drive one big round thru the narrow and dangerous route, really nonsense!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103827329715654621752/reviews

daddydrives,3,"Link@896 seems to be undergoing some major renovations at the moment, which is noticeable throughout the building. However, the reason I still come here regularly is that my son attends Wang Learning Centre, which is conveniently located within the complex. Despite the ongoing renovations, I appreciate the ample parking provided. The long grace period for parking is a huge plus, as it gives us plenty of time to fetch our kids without having to rush or worry about parking fees.

Though the renovations are ongoing, I look forward to seeing the improvements once they are complete, as it could potentially elevate the overall experience at Link@896. For now, the convenience of parking and accessibility for our family makes it a frequent stop for us.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110175904101132494704/reviews

(Any other place if you might ask , wellâ€¦ yes. United Square. )ðŸ˜Š

** For those driving and looking for a place to park, take note of the weird traffic flow or direction upon entering via the gantry.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107954436929098254033/reviews
Ellena Yeo,1,A centre with many enrichment/educational centres but bad traffic management for parents waiting to drop and pick up their kids. Cars are often stuck at the entrance/exit due to poor traffic flow within the building compound. I do not understand why the building management has to block off one lane to forbid parents from temporary parking along the lane. They need to look into this issue. Deploying private traffic wardens and cones are not effective solutions.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101351667620192834202/reviews
