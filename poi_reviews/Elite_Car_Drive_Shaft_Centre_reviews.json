Very professional, honest and efficient. Highly recommended.",

      "text": "I had an ongoing issue with my car‚Äôs steering rack, which had been replaced twice within six months by another workshop. Unfortunately, neither repair lasted more than three months. Thankfully, a friend recommended Jason and his team, and I‚Äôm glad I took their advice.\n\nNot only did they offer a repair option that cost a fraction of what I had been paying for used parts (about 1/5 of the price), but they also completed the job in just about a day and a half. I dropped my car off late on a Friday afternoon, and by the Tuesday's noon, the issue was fully resolved.\n\nWhat really impressed me was their honesty and transparency. Unlike many other workshops that rely on paid marketing or ask customers to boost their ratings, this shop‚Äôs Google reviews are genuinely earned. Jason and his crew live up to their reputation of providing excellent service. Highly recommended!",

Some even propose to replace steering rack. Went to Elite, attended by the boss Jason, proposed to leave car for 3 days to troubleshoot and repair, even estimate the cost. In the end, the problem identified and solved within same day at a very reasonable price. Jason listened carefully when I describe the problem, tested and heard the noise but some other can't. He is experience and very detail.\nAccord CP2",

Work is done fast and workmanship is good. Came back a few days later to check on a small suspected issue and the boss helped me look at it thoroughly, and was very patient throughout. The people here are honest and reassuring, with a positive attitude towards the customer. Will use their services again.",
