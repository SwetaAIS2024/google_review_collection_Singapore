It's expensive but their ice creams are made from all natural ingredients so it worth the price. It would be perfect if they accepted cash and had seats in the shop.",

Don't worry - the ice cream is supposed to be more natural and healthier compared to other ice cream!\n\nThe ice cream are priced at S$4.70 for a single scoop, and S$7.70 for a double scoop. You can add S$1 extra for their thyme cones, which are freshly made on-site.",

The ice cream is a bit too sweet after awhile and could be a bit richer / darker, but if eaten with another flavour (like mango sorbet) to offset, it’ll be great\n\nLove their ice creams generally and really nice waffle cones",
