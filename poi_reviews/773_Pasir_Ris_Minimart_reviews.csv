Evelyn Eve,1,"I will never go back to this place again if the wife is the cashier.

Twice I was over charged.

1) bought loose shallots and garlic, she collected $5.80 from me.

Just the next day, I went again as I don't have enough and bought the same amount of shallots and garlic, the man only charge me $2.60.

My sis who has been staying here many years she say his wife will usually charge much higher.

2) today I went to get 2 ice pops, a small bag of twistes and a bag of kueh bahulu which was tagged $2.90 price.

She collected $9.60 from  me. I was so tired after A long day of chores, I didn't think much at the instant moment.

As I walked off, I check again. My ice pop she said 0.80 each so is $1.60 for 2 and kueh bahulu $2.90 as tagged, then my small twisties $5.10?!

XstarkillerX,5,Anybody that stays near this place have probably seen the owners who are an uncle and an auntie. They are extremely friendly towards every single customer and will strike conversations whenever possible.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110220213337369215504/reviews
