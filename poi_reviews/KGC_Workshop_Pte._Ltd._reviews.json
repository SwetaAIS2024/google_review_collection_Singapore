Repair cost and product mark up about 15-20% more than other workshop without bargain( I told them 1st time customer and did not bargain)",

I called KGC general number and was attended by Ms Ang who patiently explained what the workshop could do to salvage the scratches. The customer service was prompt and explanation clear. I went to KGC this afternoon and within 10 minutes, the helpful staff made my paint scratches gone. Thank you for the prompt service!",
