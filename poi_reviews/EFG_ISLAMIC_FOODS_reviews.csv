Nicholas Soh,3,Ordered 2 chicken thigh briyani and masala dosai. Portion of rice is ok but chicken portion is small. Could have added mention of budget meal. Eggplant curry was extremely salty. Dosai was nice.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107121785235828864940/reviews
Mun Chong,5,"2 things stand out here
Mee goreng is incredibly NOT salty at all, just another miraculous find in the world of heart-healthy hawker food
It's still very very tasty so this is my new favourite mee goreng stall
Portion is huge, piping hot fries in cheese sauce are served as sides
Fries in cheese sauce in mee goreng. Standard serving. They moved here from Shenton Way.
In the neighbourhood of My Father's Minced Meat Noodles, suddenly blk 477 has become my favourite haunt in Tampines.
Do note that they can be pretty hard to find. They're right behind the Family A1 Ayam Goreng and Western food stall (another of my favourites)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103491652776344320179/reviews
