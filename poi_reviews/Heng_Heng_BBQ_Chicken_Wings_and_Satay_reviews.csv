CP,5,"I am always thrilled whenever I see Hainanese satay as I know I can expect grated pineapple in the peanut sauce, which is so quintessential in my view to add that sour sweet component. The satay skewers are perfectly grilled and the meat is tender. I will be back to savour their pork belly satay.

Update: I finally did try their pork belly satay and it is perfect - with nice balance of meat and fat and perfectly grilled.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861923464679544218/reviews
Kyla G,5,"I decided to try this stall because a friend highly recommended their wings and satay, and Iâ€™m so glad I did! The chicken wings were perfectly cooked, with glistening skin and flavorful marination that was absolutely mouthwatering. The pork belly satay was a standoutâ€”unlike anything Iâ€™ve tried before!

I loved it so much that I ended up contacting the stall owner to order a larger batch for my Christmas party, and it was a massive hit with all my guests. Excellent food and great serviceâ€”Iâ€™ll definitely be coming back for more!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111643047146460120419/reviews
KittykattoEatto,2,"This is a totally unbiased review. I was SO looking forward to eating the satays. The stall looks amazing. BUT after a wait, the satays came cold. Real cold , as if they placed it there for very a long time. Not forgetting to mention that the meat is VERY HARD AND CHEWY. The only satay meat that is edible is the slightly warm chicken satays. Chicken wings are just ok too, like normal chicken wing. The only thing that deserves a star is the pork belly satay and their service.. had to give a review cus I was so disappointed.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104436172939560826879/reviews
jojo goh,5,Both satay and wings were nicely grilled. Meat was tender and juicy. Pineapple purÃ©e was added to the satay sauce and the chilli for the wings was fiery spicy but yummy. This stall is a must-visit for anyone who loves satay and chicken wings. But be prepared for a bit of wait during peak hours.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110705738541913657076/reviews
James Tan,5,"This is the first time I tried their satay. I ordered the pork belly satay. It was heavenly. The satay peanut sauce with pineapple completed the wonder. It was the best satay I had for a long time. I would say, ""die die must eat."" ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108418264377567576838/reviews
