You go in with photos of the angles and corners that need parts. nevermind if cannot get same parts, at least provide alternatives la. how can you ask people bring the cupboard to your shop?! take taxi arh? then ask the item send back china. wah. easy say hor. All three times i go there, same treatment. discrimination siol.\n\nDon't know which part of his expertise and experience are the rest of the reviewers raving about. It's one thing that a customer is helpless in naming the exactly types of nails/screws, but it's totally an insult that uncle assumes we don't know what we're talking about. An make it our fault for buying items that happened to have missing parts/tools.\n\nWe go your shop hoping you have the items so we can buy and fix ourselves le. We provide you measurements of the holes that the rivets/screw etc ok.\n\nEh sudah la. Role your mat up uh.",

In fact this is the 2nd time I went, the first time I bought a higher quality long extension cable which not many heartland shops carry. They do carry some mid- good quality stuff, but have to prepare to pay a bit more which I donâ€™t mind at all. Lastly, get your Nippon paint there, they have the machine to give u any color u want.",
