      "text": "I came across Zhou Chu Ming's TikTok about the Tham’s Peking duck at his Bidadari kopitiam and decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, the experience was very disappointing.\n\nThe service was poor—staff members looked unfriendly and unapproachable. I ordered a full duck to try. The presentation of cutting the skin were ok.. nicely placed on the keropok.\nWhile the skin was decent for the price, the meat was cut into overly large pieces and was very tough to eat. They didn’t ask if I wanted the carcass, so I had to specifically request it, only to find there was still a lot of meat left on it.\n\nThe wraps were soggy, the keropok was stale and soft (\"lao hong\"), and overall, the meal did not meet expectations. We couldn’t finish the food and asked to pack it, only to be charged an additional $1 for the packing. On top of that, we were charged another $1 for extra sweet sauce.\n\nThis was my first visit, and it will definitely be my last.\n\nNow I know why not many people order their food. A lot of customers there eating the bak chor mee and mala staff or the Malay food.\nI will try other stalls.",
