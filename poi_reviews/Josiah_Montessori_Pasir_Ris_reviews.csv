Jerry He Fangyuan,5,"Baby has been to Josiah Pasir Ris infant care for half a year and we are very happy with LO’s growth and progress. The teachers and principle are caring loving and equipped with teaching styles that nurture kids independence, curiosity/ self exploration, learning through play. The environment is lovely and Montessori style. Their teacher to kids ratio is better/ below ECDA guideline. There are special outdoor and festive programs monthly. Communication via Little Lives is daily. Baby is happy to go to school :) recommend!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113566594912522579664/reviews
Janice Sumawang,5,"My son has been attending Josiah at Pasir Ris and I love that he is comfortable with the teachers and the staff. He is getting along well, the staff also continuously communicating via the app and giving some progress on their development. I love the fact they include more plays in their curriculum. Kids have time to go outside with in their premise and play sands and water. The studies are also balanced. Would recommend this for kids who are more into Montessori teaching and fun and plays.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112657441569516827347/reviews
Nessa A.,5,"My child has been attending Josiah Montessori in Pasir Ris. For working parents who struggled with a lot of initial guilt at sending our child to infant care, we have been so at ease with the level of professionalism, love and attention to detail that the teachers at Josiah give to caring for all the children. When you send your child to a second home, you want to be certain that you're sending them somewhere where they are taken care of well, with individual attention and loads of varied activities. And it is clear that Josiah's teachers do just that. The facilities are great, the location is accessible and the center is always welcoming. It's been a joy seeing not only my child grow and flourish, but all the other children there as well.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100240370646383991079/reviews
TheSwayways,5,"Josiah,Pasir Ris is one of the newest Josiah centres in the city.
It has been set up extremely well and in a very thoughtful manner to enable and develop young creative hearts.
The teachers are very professional and very sensitive towards the child’s need along with all the other staff working in tandem to ensure the well being of children whilst at premises.
The Montessori based learning model at the school is helping children to have a holistic approach towards their environment and develop life skills.Highly recommended!!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109212696587609476313/reviews
