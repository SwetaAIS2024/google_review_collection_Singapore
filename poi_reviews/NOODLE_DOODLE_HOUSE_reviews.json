      "text": "tried the minced meat butter garlic noodles today and loved it! you can taste the fragrant butter, and the garlic is not too overpowering. opted for little bit of chilli and it really completes the overall flavour. a very comforting bowl of noodles.\n\nmeat portion can be small for guys with larger appetites. maybe 2 pax can order 1 noodle dish then add on extra meat to balance out the carbs and proteins.\n\nalso can be a tad oily but i’m ok with it. pair with a refreshing drink like iced lemon tea and it’s a shiok meal.\n\nonly randomly discovered it on grab by searching “noodles”. not sure why i never saw the listing before today. glad i gave it a shot.",
