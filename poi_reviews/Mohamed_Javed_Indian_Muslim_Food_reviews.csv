Marcus Tan,4,"We have been dropping by Mohamed Javed Indian Muslim Food for the past few years now, and in my opinion this is one of the most underrated roti prata in the Anchorvale / Fernvale region. In fact, it is even better than the roti prata shops at Jalan Kayu which is nearby.

And why is it good? It‚Äôs crispy on the outside (but not to the extent of eating biscuits that kind of crispy), and soft on the inside. Prata is also done to perfection with very minimal burned areas which is good. It is also pan-fried on the spot unlike other shops that are prepared beforehand. This also means that waiting time is about 20mins.

You can select beef or fish curry, but our personal preference is beef curry because it‚Äôs more fragrant.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114358279135892939279/reviews
LP Pua,5,"A Google reviewer claimed this is the best prata in Sengkang, so I visited to check. I ordered 2 plain pratas. They were evenly cooked with no burnt parts. The pratas had a faint, fragrant smell and were a mix of doughy and crispy. The curry was thick, which I liked. Until I find better, this will be my go-to prata stall in Sengkang and Punggol.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews

Haven't been here for quite a long while, so I thought I'd make a trip to get reacquainted with the roti prata...

Well, it wasn't a satisfying meal today, I must say; what with the doughy pancakes being dished out! :(

Both egg and plain roti, while freshly cooked, tasted off somewhat üòÜ The kosong piece looked like it's been fluffed... Yet it didn't have a lighter texture!?

And the fish curry lacked the requisite oomph, though it's less salty than what I will get at Buangkok hawker centre!

At this rate, this can't be the ""best in Sengkang"" I reckon ü§î

Incidentally, #MHTamChiak has read about a certain prata stall in the West -- is it at Teban Gardens or something? -- which serves mutton curry by default.

And they are usually sold out like before 10am since they open very early for business and is rather popular.

I really wonder if waking up extremely early and making a 1 hour 45 min journey there is worth the trouble... Or could I be missing out on something great? üòÉ

Ya, have good food will travel! üòÅ

Hoong Wai Wong,4,"Came here for the pratas, not disappointed. I had takeaway for breakfast so it was less crispy when I ate them.

Plain and egg were ok, still soft and fluffy inside. The egg onion prata was great, nice contrast and crunchy to the soft dough.
Mixed with the 2 different curries given, nice little explosion of flavors.

Overall can eat, recommended to come earlier to avoid the long queue and crowds.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106237336061537561898/reviews
