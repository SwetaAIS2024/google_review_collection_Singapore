Alvin Chan,5,"Invited to Syun by two close buddies.
The attentive service staffs are great, atmosphere feels cozy yet classy.

TTT,3,"We ordered the premium lunch bento, and while the food was fresh, it was fairly average. The portion size is suited for smaller appetites, but the flavors fell a bit short.

We were seated near the hotel kitchen, which led to a lot of foot traffic.

However, the service staff were fantastic. Very detailed in explaining each dish and attentive throughout the meal.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117174446031825028588/reviews
Hamwichh,5,"Husband took me here as a surprise. The food was surprisingly good, it took me back to our trip last year to Nagano Prefecture with miso quality and sake similar to what we had. Definitely would like to come back here.

I gave it a 2 star in atmosphere because the lighting felt abit strange. I couldn’t take good pics to match the amazing taste. Anyway will add this to my list of restaurants that deserve a second visit!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117671339216291743687/reviews
J Li,5,A wonderful experience at Syun. High quality food and their lunch sets were of amazing value. Their signature beef with uni was divine to say the least!
