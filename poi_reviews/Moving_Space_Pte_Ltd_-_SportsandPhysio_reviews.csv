PW C,5,"What stood out most was Sharon's professional skills and holistic overall approach. From the initial evaluation to each visit, Sharon took the time to assess my condition. She is skillful and  demonstrated  not only a thorough understanding of my condition but also  able to tailor exercises that was targeted,  effective and manageable for me in my condition.  She's sharp and consistently provided feedback on my progress, adjusted treatments as needed, and ensured that I was always improving. I am thankful for her expertise and dedication in my recovery journey.

Sharon is a highly skilled and compassionate professional, and I would highly recommend her to anyone in need of physiotherapy services",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113399235999426978088/reviews
Ray Ali,5,"Had a physical assessment with June  specifically looking into my mobility for my golf game. I wish I had done this earlier as I not only know which part of my muscle that was over compensating my movement causing discomfort and limited movement, I’m now able to address and strengthen parts of my body that’s need to be activated. A very comprehensive examination with June who was patient and through in her assessment and recommendation for the exercises needed to improve my mobility.

Well done to the team.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113884065604457234363/reviews
Joyce Seah,5,"I have been going to Moving Space Physiotherapy for more than a year. Vivien has been my therapist and I have been extremely happy with how she has helped me with all my physical problems and pains. I  ruptured my achilles tendon when I was much younger and have been very careful about overusing it and injuring it again. However, Vivien advised that it was important to make it stronger with exercise and taught me how to do so. As a result ,  I can now do ballet pointe work confidently . Vivien is very professional and knowledgeable. I trust her assessment and she is always my first port of call every time I suffer from any form of injury . She is also very friendly and has great bedside manners. I highly recommend her as a physiotherapist.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110525649507743874960/reviews
Joanna Zhan,5,"Sharon and team have been integral in pain management regime for my chronic illness for the past year. Videos on follow up exercises are also sent and I can easily refer to them when I forget what to do.

I am also very grateful for their care of my mum when she got discharged from hospital, their recovery plan really ensured that she was able to steadily improve in terms of balance and strength at her own pace :)

Highly recommended if you are looking for a physiotherapy centre!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100453198663939897912/reviews
