Linh,5,"Great Thai foods, decent price, portions could be more generous though. Highly recommend the honey chicken and basil pork. Staff are helpful. Aircons could be stronger as itâ€™s a bit hot inside the shop.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115974072852898549548/reviews
Agnes Tan,4,"Came here with my family on a lazy Sunday for lunch. Tom Yum Seafood Hotpot smells so good when served (my mum loves Tom Yum Soup), and tasted good too, with a bit of aromatic coconut and lemongrass taste. Ingredients are fresh, especially the prawns and squids. Generous portions of seafood in the Tom Yum Seafood Soup. The seafood sauce goes well with the fresh cockles. For those who love extra servings of sauces, they are available on the self-service section. Kailan with oyster sauce tasted just great. Spoilt with lots of food choices in the menu. Will definitely come again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110310726536709023368/reviews
MH Tham,3,"It was relatively inexpensive but terribly mediocre. The egg was the best dish, but it was nowhere near fluffy. The pig trotter rice was slightly gamey (subjective) while the tom yum and green curry were too diluted for my liking. Will give this a pass the next time I see it on delivery apps.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112376174358198242550/reviews

SH Y,5,"Been visiting them and buying take away. The food is mostly very nice except for 1 day standard drop (maybe chef different) but in all food is authentic and tasty. Will definately come back for more.
Hope for a lunch time promotion or something similar as I just staying very nearby.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117900533784023420929/reviews
