      "text": "Our son has been attending playgroup for the past three months, and my wife and I are truly grateful for the care and dedication shown by the team. We‚Äôve been especially pleased with the attentiveness and detailed updates on his well-being and development. It‚Äôs clear that going the extra mile is part of the culture here‚Äîsomething we do not take for granted.\n\nWe were warmly allowed to celebrate our son‚Äôs birthday at the school, which was a special and meaningful experience for our family. The staff have been very accommodating with the activities, and we deeply appreciate the support. We‚Äôve also noticed how quickly and professionally the school responds to any public behavior around the vicinity‚Äîdemonstrating a strong commitment to providing a safe and nurturing environment.\n\nOur heartfelt thanks to Principal Zhiting, Vice Principal Jennifer, Teacher Eunice, Cai Laoshi, Li Laoshi, and Marife for being such an important part of our son‚Äôs early learning journey. We also want to extend our appreciation to the support staff for keeping the environment clean and welcoming, and to all the teachers from other groups who step in and support one another.\n\nWe truly feel blessed to be part of this community. Thank you.",

      "text": "Our experience with My First Skool at Blk 54 Chin Swee Road has been exceptional. From day one, the team provided a structured and reassuring environment, making it easy for us to entrust our daughter, Kara, to their care.\n\nThe onboarding process was smooth and well-organised, with clear communication at every step. Teacher Angel and her team are outstanding‚Äîattentive, patient, and genuinely invested in the well-being of the children. Their professionalism and warmth gave us complete confidence that Kara was in good hands.\n\nBeyond the daily care, the teachers paid close attention to each child‚Äôs needs, keeping us updated with thoughtful progress reports and photos. It was evident that Kara was not just cared for but also engaged in meaningful activities that supported her development.\n\nAlthough we eventually had to move her to a centre closer to home for logistical reasons, the decision was not an easy one. The trust and assurance we felt with the team at My First Skool, Blk 54 Chin Swee Road made the transition reluctant on our part. Their dedication sets a high standard, and we remain grateful for the positive start they gave Kara.\n\nAlso to note, the principal is very hands-on, often checking in at the infant care bay, which speaks to the commitment to maintaining a high standard of care\n\nFor parents seeking a reliable and nurturing preschool, this centre is an excellent choice. Highly recommended.",

They are very responsible and always provide us with updates. My kid have food allergies and they always make sure that she is given alternatives when necessary.\n\nThey are friendly and good listeners and at times listen to me vent about certain behavioral issues that we are facing with the kid and they take the time and effort to talk to the child and correct those behaviors.\n\nWithout a doubt, I can trust them and put my kid in their safe hands.",
