Joseph Ho,1,"Top notch dentistry and services rendered by assistant.
Zero respect for patients time... never again.

*update*
Q&M has since followed up on this matter professionally and I am fully satisfied with their explanation and response. Appreciate their patience in dealing with me.
In retrospect, i guess i should have tried to understand the true cause for that event taking place before passing judgement.
Thanks!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101204306075195074606/reviews

Kimberly G,5,"I had an exceptional experience at Dr. Kenneth's dental clinic, thanks to his outstanding care and expertise. During my visit, I was particularly impressed by Dr. Kenneth's thoroughness in explaining each step of the procedure, which greatly alleviated my anxiety. His compassionate approach made me feel at ease throughout the entire process.

Nurse Shan was an absolute gem! She could tell I was a bit anxious, especially since it was my first time getting an injection. She gave me reassuring pats on my shoulders and hands, which really helped calm my nerves.

Giving Dr. Kenneth and Nurse Shan two thumbs up for their exceptional care and kindness. They made what could have been a stressful experience into a breeze ♥️🦷",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114069817767276839371/reviews
