Sarah Khoo,5,"Mr Peng is a very patient and skilled teacher. His lessons are very interesting and he has shown many ways and tips to solve difficult questions. For myself, even though I started his tuition with a single digit score, he was always more than happy to guide me through questions and ensure that i understood my mistakes. He is also like a buddy to me, therefore his lessons were always very comfortable and enjoyable ! I am super thankful to have him as a tuition teacher and helping me regain my confidence in math !",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114343806772155708536/reviews
김혜진,1,"It's a center with no responsibility
The teacher just transcribed the answer sheet from class and taught them the wrong answer
I don't even have the qualifications of a teacher
I don't have any explanation or responsibility for the class that I haven't been able to do, but just send me a deposition
My child even went to science, but it was so ridiculous that everyone quit",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113063752198077262051/reviews

Outside of class, Mr Peng cares for our well being and ensures we are coping well with our life, even more so than our school teachers. He has been a fantastic role model and an even better teacher.
