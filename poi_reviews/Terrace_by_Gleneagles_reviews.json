      "text": "If the pricing does not, then food definitely does a good job at chasing customers away. (one piece roti telur for RM 7)\n\nWe ordered a few items today:\n\nNasi lemak ayam. The nasi lemak was severely lacking in lemak, rice was served cold on a cold plate. Also, the freshly fried chicken appeared juicy, but the \"juice\" was mostly oil.\n\nMeehoon was slightly undercooked and obscenely dry. It was rather bland, and dehydrated, but the colour did look good, fooling me into ordering it.\n\nRoti Canai and Teh tarik set, something you'd expect to be half decent, wasn't good at all. The roti was tough and doughy, and the Teh tarik tastes like it's been made out of an instant packet; I wouldn't be surprised if it was haha.\n\nOverall the ambiance was nice, we enjoyed the cooling sheltered alfresco with a gentle  morning breeze. The service was good as well, they brought the food to our table so we didn't have to pick it up at the window. However I wouldn't come back for the great fear of disappointing food ðŸ˜±",

I was feeling really down and didnâ€™t know what to do, so I randomly left a messageâ€¦ and the reply I received genuinely lifted my spirits.\n\nIâ€™ve always loved your food and packaging, but this small gesture made my day extra special. Please send my thanks to the staff member who did this. If thereâ€™s any way to find out their name, Iâ€™d love to personally thank them.\n\nI even shared a TikTok video on my profile about this moment it meant that much to me.
