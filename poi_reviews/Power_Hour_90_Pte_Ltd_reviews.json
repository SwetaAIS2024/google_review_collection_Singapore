Once Ruby knew your determination, he made sure I did it right and continuously giving me the right advice when I'm lost in certain ways. And realign myself and move on.\n\nFrom 83kg to 57kg. 9 mths. Thank you Ruby. Although we worked together virtually, your ways of motivation matters to me.\n\nI managed to reverse back my prediabetic issue and now I'm still maintaining. Almost 5 years and I definately will continue on.\n\nThank you Ruby",
