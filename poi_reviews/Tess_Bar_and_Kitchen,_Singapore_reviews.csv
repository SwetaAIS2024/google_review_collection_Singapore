Yap Hoe BENG,4,"April25, we came here for my younger son birthday. See the amount of food we order, everyone was very good. Definitely worth the good food & proving plus service was V good. They also have a good set of drink. Except dessert which was good, maybe have another 2-3 item add on to the 3 now.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116220693681278781294/reviews
cihan acar,5,"We visited as a group of eight for a weekend buffet brunch and had the chance to try most of the items on the menu. The overall food quality was quite good , with a great variety of dishes that were well-prepared and flavorful. The service was smooth, with orders arriving promptly, and the staff was friendly and attentive throughout our meal. The experience was well worth it, offering great value for the price.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101569283499953726408/reviews
Ruby Chan,5,"Been coming here for years and everything is always super consistent. Rarely does a bar have good food but the food here is restaurant quality period. I highly recommend the pork jowl linguine, chicken karaage, and grilled prawns!!! ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116661946737257819979/reviews
Kai Xiang Kuah,5,"All dishes were absolute bangers. We ordered the pork belly dish again as we finished it too quickly. Great place to have a chill hangout after work.

Drinks could be slightly stronger.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103110928445244344247/reviews
Samuel,3,"Went there for a birthday celebration and had their Valentineâ€™s special.

We loved the vibes and the service. But honestly the food disappointed as a whole

The beef tataki was well cooked and salad was fresh. The octopus pasta was honestly pretty good. Love the deep seafood flavour in the sauce and rather tender octopus.

The lamb looks nice but it was overcooked, abit tough and dry. Accompaniments were alright.

Bangers and mash was not too bad, but the mashâ€™s main flavour profile was butter. Like I get it, butter makes everything better but this was abit much.

Finally, thought we could end the night well with the cannoli but my god, we actually hated it. Really hard shell and a stupidly sour berry compote that was so hard to eat. Itâ€™s suppose to pair with the  tea ice cream (just tasted like vanilla) but itâ€™s still too too too sour. My face just reacts when I think of it. This dessert need to be looked at again.

Cocktails were fine, nothing special.

That being said, their service was really really good. They took the feedback well and did a service recovery. I hope the main menu is better than the specials I had.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114189927733977961245/reviews
