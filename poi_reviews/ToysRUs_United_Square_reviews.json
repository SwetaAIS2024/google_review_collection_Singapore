Prices for the mainline HotWheels are below the average price of other stores, surprisingly. Very worth the price!",

Thanks Toys R Us for causing embarrassment and disappointing little kids.\n\nNot the best outlet. Even out of stock for wrapping paper... and it's not even Christmas. (this was two months ago in late sept)\n\nAlso, it's kind of weird that you need to fill up your information just to buy a gift card? ðŸ¤”",

While checking out I asked for gift wrapping which has been a free service from toys r us for as long as I remember. Was told off there wrapping paper was out of stocks rather impolitely. Are the staff not trained to have better communication skills ? Or is this the service level of toys r Us these days ? Xmas around the corner and no gift wrapping ? Standard dropped . Probably everyone shopping online elsewhere for better deals.",

      "text": "Great toys, but the store is overflowing with boxes all over the place. They stock twice as many toys as the store can reasonably hold so boxes are strewn throughout the aisles; can be difficult to actually walk through. Their stockroom must be tiny because unopened shipments block the paths every single day and they do stocking during business hours (rather than before they open) so it's a giant mess. Nice to see TRU still in business though as someone from the US where it is no more.",
