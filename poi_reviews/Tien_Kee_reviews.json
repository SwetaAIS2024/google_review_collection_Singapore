      "text": "My dinner 🍲 at Tien Kee did t go as plan 📑 or as well as I hope it would go.\n\nFirstly, Tien Kee has been here for many years. They are often a 2️⃣ person team whereby the man cooks 🧑‍🍳 and the lady 💁🏼‍♀️ takes order and serve.\n\nSecondly, it is nested in the Lor 7 market’s hawker center so there’s plenty of tables and seats 🪑.\n\nNow here’s the problem 🆘. The ordering 📝 process does not give you a beeper 🚨 or a queue number 🔢. You order, give your table number and walk off 🏃‍♂️. When your food 🍛🍜🍲 is cooked, the lady will bring it to your table and then you pay 💵. That’s exactly what I did and went back to my table and waited. Then I started to notice a lot tables that came after me were being serve. I went back to the stall repetitive to ask what’s my queue number and she couldn’t tell 🗣️ me. Just kept telling me I’m next in line. …. 40mins later, I was finally serve.  A frustrating 😡 affair when I finally get to eat at nearly 8pm.\n\nFood: To review this, I have to detach myself from the events above. Food are in simple terms divided into 4 groups : 1) Lousy 👎, 2) Ok 👌, 3) Home Cook 🙌 and then 4) Great 😎 (Wok Hey) they are between the ok and Home Cook Range, you wouldn’t be like extremely impressed. It’s at best, a home cook meal. It lacks the Wok Hey 🔥 that you will get at Zhu Char stalls. (I ordered a take away Bee Hoon and it was tasteless 😤)\n\nI think the bonus that’s is gonna make this all up is the price💲. In today 2025 timeline, their prices are very, very low 📉. The plate of fried rice is only $4 and the sweet and sour fish is $6. I highly doubt you can find this pricing any where in Toa Payoh📍.\n\nI think the ordering process is totally messed up. The lady was polite and very nice but I could see she is very stressed up 🤯 too from all the delivering and rushing🏃‍♀️. Suggest they consider to get a beeper 🚨 so that she can focus at the stall controlling the orders 🧾 and just let the customers come back and collect when it is ready.\n\nI will suggest if your order takes too long ⏱️, go back and chase. If not you will end up waiting and waiting like me.",

      "text": "I was looking for a place to have dinner at the hawker centre and chanced upon this stall that’s still opened at 8pm plus. Decided to order the black beans with beef horfun.\n\nThere was quite a wait as there’s only one chef preparing all the dishes. I could see that the stall was quite popular as many patrons were waiting for their food to be served.\n\nEventually I decided to take-away which the lady happily obliged. The prices were really very reasonable. I paid $4.50 for my beef horfun. After tasting it at home, the food was actually pretty good. While waiting for my food to be served, I saw that there were a number of articles about the chef displayed at the front of stall. Apparently he had won some prizes for his fried rice. Very legit and good value for money.",

Their cooked food is extremely popular with the older residents in the neighborhood as it is economic and as close as home cooked that you can get.  Those who come should be prepared to wait patiently, as there is only one cook, and he does the tze char on the fly as the orders come rapidly in.  Recommended!",
