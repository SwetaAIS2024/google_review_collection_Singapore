The views are spectacular with Tanjong Rhu on one side and Gardens by the Bay as well as Singapore Flyer on the other side. Wonderful views especially at sunrise and sunset. Can get busy on the path during peak hours so please keep to the  respective pedestrian or cycling lane. Will be back soon!",

They should build another passenger bridge across but as of now, either you cross at the Marina Barrage or as far back as the sporthub to Pebble bridge.",

      "text": "A good variety of well-maintained plants with a lot of walking areas. Most of the time, the weather is very humid, but if you are up to burning calories, walking anywhere in Singapore would do that for you, so why not combine it with beautiful garden?\nIt's free, and now it's even more convenient from Bayfront MRT with a bit of walking.\n\nThis is also one of the good parking options for motorcycle, because Marina Bay Sands is too arrogant to provide motorcycle parking and other available parking space like Wilson (haven't used that for a long time, not sure how it's like now) is not covered. Here, it's covered and we always got a lot to park.\n\nWalking to other destinations like the hotel could be a pain in the butt because it's very easy to get lost if you are confused with the levels. If you come with elderly, make sure you get the bearing right because there will be a lot of walking if you don't. There were three occasions when the escalator from the bridge was broken, and there was inhumane queue for the lift outside the hotel.\n\nIt's hard to believe that we used to get cheap 12 dollars buffet in this sleepy seaside town with only one bus available and now it has turned into this. If you ask me, I miss the seafood.",
