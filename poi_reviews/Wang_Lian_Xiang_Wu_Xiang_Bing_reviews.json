      "text": "5 Spice Roll / Wu Xiang Xia Bing (SGD $12) @ Wang Lian Xiang Wu Xiang Xia Bing.\n.\nFormerly at Bedok South, this stall is now in 128 Bedok North Street 2. While the other stalls here (kway chap & curry fish head) are more well-known, I'm a fan of this stall.\n.\nThe 5 spice roll is moist and tender with balanced meaty savoury salty spice flavour, the tofu beancurd is wobbly soft with grainy sweet notes, while the water chestnut cake has crisp edges and a soft texture with nice earthy sweet savoury notes.\n.\nThe prawn cracker fritter is non-greasy with a crispy crunch and sweet savoury shrimpy flavour. I also like the snappy Taiwanese pork sausage with its meaty savoury sweet flavour.\n.\nThe fried bee hoon / vermicelli noodles is pretty good, and they're generous with the sliced cucumbers. The chili is spicy sweet with a light kick, and they serve the rare pink egg sauce with sticky sweet notes. Yum. Stall only opens for dinner, daily 4pm till 9pm.",
