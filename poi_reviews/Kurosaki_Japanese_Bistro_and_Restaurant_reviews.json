      "text": "Their food was super good , just the miso wasnâ€™t hot enough and miso paste not thick enough, specialised salad sauce made with mango, love their chicken recipe, they allow to let me change beef to chicken. Their fried chicken was fried till crisp super delicious. Their nanban tartar sauce was homemade too. Their miso chicken was a disappoint tho, they use packed miso sauce to fake miso. Love their chawanmusshi , generous ingredients served hot and the texture was silky and soft enough.",

Yakitori chicken wing got a strong chick taste which it difficult to swallow.\nPrice wise a bit over price, might due to location. Honestly you can get similar or better in some other place.\nThis meal cost us around RM300+ for 2 pax..",
