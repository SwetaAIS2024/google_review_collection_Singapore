The petite buns were warm with a crispy, not-too-thick crust and a soft inside.  We loved the food and the ambiance was perfect â€“ nice and quiet. ðŸ˜Œ #Food #Restaurant #Dinner #Foodie #Delicious #Ambiance #ComfortFood Japanese Food #yckcorp",

      "text": "Firstly, the place is too warm, even when it wasn't crowded at 2pm. Then the pancake was disappointing, too hard. Souffle was too sweet. Latte Macha doesn't taste good. Ice lemon tea is a relatively small glass, full of ice.\nMom didn't like the soup, I didn't like everything except for French Toast. Disappointed that the food has been getting from bad to worse.  I will not visit again.",

      "text": "I decided to try this restaurant for Valentineâ€™s Day, and while the setting and ambience were lovely, the food was unfortunately quite mediocre.\n\nWe ordered the 2th Anniversary Set, which included two mains (with a top-up for \"premium\" items), two drinks, and two desserts.\n\nWe ordered the Omu Rice with Black Angus Beef(with a top-up) was the standout dishâ€”the beef was tender, and the rice was well-prepared. However, the Omu Souffle Lobster Bisque Risotto was disappointing. The eggs were just a plain omelette, and the broccoli in the risotto was too hard. I wouldnâ€™t recommend this dish.\n\nFor drinks, the fruits tea was nice and fragrant, but there was a mix-up with my order hojicha latte. I was served a matcha latte instead, which tasted bland and lacked any hint of matchaâ€”it was essentially a cup of warm milk.\n\nDessert was the hazelnut souffle pancake, which was underwhelming. The pancake wasnâ€™t the fluffy, jiggly type I expected; it was just an ordinary pancake drowned in chocolate sauce.\n\nOverall, the food was average at best, and the only real plus point was the restaurantâ€™s ambience. For a special occasion like Valentineâ€™s Day,",

      "text": "Hoshino Cafe offers a delightful range of Japanese dishes, though the pricing leans a bit on the higher side. That said, the quality of their food makes up for it. I absolutely loved their soufflÃ©â€”itâ€™s light, fluffy, and packed with flavor. Itâ€™s definitely the highlight of my visit and enough to make me want to return. If youâ€™re looking for a place with good Japanese cuisine and donâ€™t mind spending a little more, Hoshino Cafe is worth a try!",
