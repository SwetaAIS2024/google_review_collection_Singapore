Flo G,1,"I love to eat Popeyes chicken but this is a ridiculous one. I love coleslaw and hesitated but paid $1.70 extra vs 30 cents for small to my set for an upsize Large coleslaw

Guess what I got ? A L size tub ! Content is less than 1/2 !!

So misleading & I may be able to take it to CASE…

Please review if this Is only ridiculous due to mismanagement at this outlet only!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113094459489500763998/reviews
John (Johnnnay),5,"Service staff were very sweet and friendly, was asking about how busy the outlet was and they were kind to answer my curious queries. I observed also for self service, they were very nice to let the customer know that their numbers were up and also helped them bring their food to the table. Nice friendly team, really recommended Popeyes outlet!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101088079447574736033/reviews

Our favourite fried chicken Popeyes has just launched their brand new 𝙏𝙧𝙪𝙛𝙛𝙡𝙚 𝙎𝙤𝙪𝙧 𝘾𝙧è𝙢𝙚 𝙨𝙚𝙧𝙞𝙚𝙨. 🤩It combines the rich, creamy taste of sour cream with a subtle earthy umaminess from the truffle that just keeps you wishing there was more! 🤤The sauce just coats the crispy skin of their signature fried chicken oh so delightfully, we couldn't get enough of it 👍

Have a sweet ending to your meal by enjoying their 𝗖𝗵𝗼𝗰𝗼𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝗛𝗮𝘇𝗲𝗹𝗻𝘂𝘁 𝗕𝗶𝘀𝗰𝘂𝗶𝘁𝘀 (𝟮𝗽𝗰 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗼 𝗮𝘁 $𝟮.𝟵𝟬, 𝗨.𝗣. $𝟰.𝟱𝟬), nutella lovers would LOVE this 🫶",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102701618033288060462/reviews
