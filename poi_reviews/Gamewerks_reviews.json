      "text": "Awesome service provided by Stanley! Was there initially to look for a PS5 console / switch games for our new home thinking it'll be a great addition to have fun together when there's guest around.\n\nStanley took his time to explain to us the main differences between PS5 games and Switch Games. And that Switch games are more suitable for our scenario.\n\nNot being heavy gamers ourselves, we're not sure on exactly what to get and Stanley have helped us in understanding what we need!\n\nWalked away with 5 games from his store and plan to get more stuff from him soon!\n\nTop notched service rendered! Wonderful experience! Don't feel pressured when you are shopping there unlike other places.",

He's friendly and approachable. Proficient with the product knowledge and took his time to explain clearly. Very helpful in assisting me. Thanks to both Stanley and Jason! Ended up purchasing it and walk out of the store a happy man. Rock on Gamewerks!",
