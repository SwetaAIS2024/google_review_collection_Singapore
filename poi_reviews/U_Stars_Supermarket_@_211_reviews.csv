Chris,2,"Very convenient place since they operate 24 hrs. However, their fruits sometimes are not fresh and some are already near rotten. Also, they often forgot to program some items (e.g. fresh Milk) where there are suppose to have discount if you buy 2 items, end up, consumers has to pay much more for no reason. I used to pay extra $1 for 2 bottles of milk that suppose to have discount, but due to their programming fault. Today, it happened again, and I refused to buy.
I hope their management could look into this matter.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110193342752842235843/reviews
