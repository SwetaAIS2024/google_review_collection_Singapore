The tea has a delicate yet distinct flavor, perfectly complemented by the fresh milk, creating a drink that isn't heavy. Even after a filling hotpot meal, the milk tea was thoroughly enjoyable. It seems they've truly mastered the art of brewing tea for a balanced and refreshing beverage.",

Confusing that they wanted us to download the app but you cant get the promos coz it is just for residents in Singapore. üòµ‚Äçüí´\nThe ordering and pick up of drinks  were very organized and people very trusting. That you just get your drinks when you see your number on the screen and cups.\nHope we can have the same system in the Philippines ü•≥",

There was only 1 person at the dispense counter and she was a little slow. The tea was prepare quickly but slow to collect. I wanted to do a review for this particular store mainly because of the access to the seating area. There‚Äôs a flight of stairs to get up. Hence not very wheelchair friendly. A friend had to take a big round to get up to the seating. Otherwise, everything is very good here. The milk tea was very good as usual.",
