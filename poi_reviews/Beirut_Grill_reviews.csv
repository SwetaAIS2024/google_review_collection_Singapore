Gwen,5,"We had our wedding reception here.

My now wife and I had eaten here a couple of times before and had a great experience. The food is very good quality and represents what middle eastern food should be: the hummus is very good as is the beef kebab.

There is a-lot of choices on Arab street and this place uses wood fired grille and serves German beer. That’s a win for me.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104354049431297107923/reviews

Vishal Shirsat,4,"We went for dinner at this place, and it was delightful to be here. Beirut Grill specializes in Lebanese, Middle Eastern, and Turkish cuisine, and it lived up to its expectation of being one. The staff is good and polite and also suggested some items, a few of which we ordered. The shish tawook, hummus, and falafel are our favorite items, and we also tried the beef kebab this time, and it was good. The ambience is decent for such a restaurant considering that this is a Lebanese, Middle Eastern, Turkish restaurant.  All in all, a good place for a nice sumptuous meal.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116744492848799178941/reviews
CHEEWENG TOH,5,"Came back 2nd time for dinner. Beirut Spicy Chicken is nicely charred with great flavors.Shish Taouk’s chicken kebab is a tad too tough ( will be nice if a little juicer), the saffron rice is flavorful and tantalizing that we keep craving for more!
Both the beef and lamb kebab are equally well marinated and cooked to the correct tenderness.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103291290486980778294/reviews
