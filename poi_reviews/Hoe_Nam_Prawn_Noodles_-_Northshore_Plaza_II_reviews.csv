annnee71,5,Came here on Sunday morning. The place clean cool. The waitress is warm helpful. Food is served quite fast as the place is not too crowded yet. Food is delicious. Firmness of noodles is just nice. Goes well with sauce.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112625903731334377077/reviews
Julius Tan,3,This outlet opened not too long ago over at Northshore plaza. Prawn noodle broth doesn’t seemed to taste as good as the one over at Changi City Point. The fried fritters selection are rather limited and prices are on the high side. Chendol tasted horrible and I didn’t appreciate the addition of liquorice(青草) in my dessert.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113038098593710664705/reviews
Cory Lim,5,"Very nice and friendly lady boss that served us. Homely feel, chatty with patrons to collect feedback to ensure customer satisfaction is met.  We had their regular prawn noodle soup, assorted Wu Xiang set comprising of sausage, spring roll, ngoh hiang roll, fried tofu, flat fish Hiang and cucumber and ala carte fried prawn cake. We also tried their homemade lemongrass beverage and cendol dessert!

Soup base is rich and prawn size is also bigger than normal. We like that the prawn noodle soup comes with kang kong and bean sprout. Another plus is they served their tasty pork lard on a served condiment dish. The tangy chili sauce complemented the wu Xiang very well. Like that their cucumber slices are very thinly sliced and crunchy.

Taking note that my mom is diabetic, the lady boss told their chef to make the cendol less sweet for her to satisfy my mom’s craving for dessert. Tried it and indeed her bowl of cendol is not as sweet as the regular ones.  The lemongrass drink is refreshing and cleanses our palette.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106613520687604621374/reviews
Angel,1,"We came in around lunchtime, 11am-12pm, sadly everyone got served before us. By the time we received our food, the restaurant was already EMPTY. Including customers that came after us.
We waited more than 20 minutes for the Ngoh Hiang for them to forget our sausages. Prawn noodles itself took over 40 minutes.
First bowl of noodles, pork rib prawn noodles, came after 42 minutes. The rest came at 47, 49, and 50 respectively. The food was quite good, some things mediocre. 50 minutes for the food and 10 minutes to finish? This wasn't really worth the wait.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115989134996727083354/reviews
