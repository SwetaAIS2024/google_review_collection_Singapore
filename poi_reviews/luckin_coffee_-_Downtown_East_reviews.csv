Denise Ong,5,"Was around the area for two days or so, thought to try the luckin coffee here esp while my account had discounts.

Really liked that I could order the drink before I reached so by the time I arrived I could just scan my order QR code and go with my drink. The staff was also great, the first day I dropped by, the staff said something like “enjoy your drink”. Thank you haha

Matcha latte was nice and I could taste the matcha more over the latte. I liked that. Matcha frappe was pleasant for my taste buds too! And of course, the frappe had more milk taste than the latte.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105885270396733702572/reviews
Crystal Chng,2,"I know that luckin is mobile order, but I think basic customer service still need right? I just wanted to check what’s PAIR HUG LATTE, if it’s the normal one. So I asked what’s inside. Haven’t even ask finish, the pink hair girl ask me to just order on the phone. I used my phone to check and it still didn’t specify what’s in it. Then I asked her again. Then she speak So soft? Who can hear? Then when my order is ready, she just left it there? Without calling number ? After I realised it’s ready,  took my own straw, my own cup holder, my own napkin. Then wanted to put MY CUPS into bag. Then she bothered to help me? Dk how ask before? Or her job just make coffee only. cannot do anyt else. Very irritating customer service",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115215434275291120530/reviews

Sadeepa Dahanayaka,2,"I recently tried Luckin Coffee and was quite disappointed. The coffee lacked flavor and was overly diluted, making it not worth the price. I expected a rich and satisfying experience, but it fell flat. The atmosphere was okay, but that couldn't make up for the subpar drink. Unfortunately, I won’t be returning for coffee again. There are far better options out there that truly deliver on quality and taste.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114011264821237491258/reviews
Mountain Warrior,1,"Served by a very unfriendly staff. 22 Sep 2024. At around 0935am.

Just because I forgot to select ""dine out"", I got a told off with a stern look. I apologized and she simply turned away and went on with work.

You have better staff who served me before (not this one). Perhaps this one hates or doesn't wants this job.  Unless Luckin' is not into customer service, email me if you want details. I will help you with this ""lesson learnt"" to help improve your staff's work attitude.

""It's not the price, it's always quality of product and staff"".
