The chicken with rice, flavouring maybe not as nice , because lack of sauce. Overall good options for lunch. Corn muffin is nice which is included",

He said the thigh part is bigger. I felt scammed, Kenny Rogers shouldn’t charge the customers extra $1 for a “big” part of chicken. Look at their “big” thigh part chicken portion.",
