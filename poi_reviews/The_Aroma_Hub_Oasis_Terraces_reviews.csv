Doraemon,4,"Kitty and I stumbled upon The Aroma Hub after dinner at Oasis Terraces.  Kitty was looking for some essential oils for her living room, and this charming little shop had a great selection.

The essential oils smelled wonderful, and the prices were reasonable.  Although the brand wasn't well-known, the quality seemed good. The owner was very friendly and helpful, offering recommendations for oils that would be perfect for Kitty's space.

We had a pleasant experience at The Aroma Hub, and would recommend it to anyone looking for essential oils and aromatherapy products.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112665277904119154671/reviews
