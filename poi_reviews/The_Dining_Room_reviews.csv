Derrick Tan,3,"Visited this place on a weekday during lunch. Was the only patrons at noon, so for a table for two, we were waited on by three staff members. Despite the high staff to customer ratios, refilling of water requires a degree of effort, which marred the dining experience. Food wise was decent, the trio of pork being a good value, but probably would not be sufficient for two big eaters. The serving of the course were well timed, and clearing of the dishes prompt. Overall, quite comfortable a place to dine, but could be perfect if staff could be more proactive in topping up of the water.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112374989511042561756/reviews
Ryan Martin Ang,1,"Appallingly poor food and service for the price, looks like all the staff worth anything must have jumped from the sinking ship.

Waiter didn't know what a rare steak was. Kitchen didn't know what a medium steak was. Pork rib was tough and leathery.

Eat anywhere else.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101919725578753359038/reviews
Jonathan Lim,3,"A small restaurant, slightly dated feel but you can argue the other way and say that there is some old world charm here. Delivers mainly angmoh food with a tapas menu, and for October they have an Oktoberfest promotion. During covid times there are a number of takeaway promotions. This is the flagship angmoh restaurant inside of RTC, not as posh as Churchill room at tanglin but also easier on the wallet",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114473725027611542564/reviews

Michael Tay,5,"Had a birthday dinner with wifey & son, both falls in April, 2 days apart. Small restaurant with private dining feel. Kudos to the crew who were attentive & prompt with their services.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114321825246166296034/reviews
