We started with “Honey, She’s a Gold Digger” (JD with honey & lemon) and “Cassis, I’m Stuck” (Dewar’s 12 with bacon) — both unique and well-balanced. It was the perfect place to kick off our evening, and the staff even recommended our next stop. Can’t wait to return!",

I just wanted to try something new at a place I always go to.\n\nI had the Smashed Onion Burger and it was really SO dang good. That was the best burger I ever had. The crispy onions and perfectly smashed juicy double patties were a dream come true. I still dream about it. The fries were also damn bloody nice. I just wanted to put this out there. More reasons to love Naga!!",

We ordered the Ramen Risotto, the BBQ Bacon Smashed Burger and Tater Tots. All were very good.\n\nThe sour plum shots were unexpectedly refreshing and some Thai Milk Tea ice cream to end the meal. I don't usually eat ice cream after meals but this was an exception because it was so good. Only downside was that the new menu provided on google is not updated, but with a bit of searching, it's available to view on Quandoo.\n\nGreat experience & will definitely come back again to try out other things on the menu.",
