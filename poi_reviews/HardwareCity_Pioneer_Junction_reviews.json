      "text": "Recently, I bought a M10 touch light from Soon Lee but accidentally bought a non-rechargeable one. Then, I went there for a replacement to a rechargeable one, but the shop in charge refused to return the items. Additionally, the price at this store is quite higher compared to others.\n\nA few days ago, I bought an electric drill machine from there too. Initially, they quoted one price for the product, but when I mentioned I was looking for a cheaper option, they reduced the price from $150 to $100, which is terrible because if I hadn't informed them, they wouldn't have reduced a single cent. I highly recommend not going there.\n\nThere are plenty of other stores where you can get your items. Moreover, the behaviours of the shop in charge is unacceptable. Thank you.",
