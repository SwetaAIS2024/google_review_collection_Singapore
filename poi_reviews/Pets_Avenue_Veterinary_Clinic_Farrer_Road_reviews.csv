Kennis Lim,5,"The staff working there are super friendly! I bring my cat (Manis) for treatment. The vet is super helpful. There is also medical onboarding available.

The staff would send daily picture of Manis to update me about her conditions. Manis stayed there for a week.

The clinic is quite clean and neat. I would totally visit again!!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108467940114198796587/reviews
Pauline,5,"I want to express my deepest gratitude to the entire team at Pet Avenue, especially Dr. Zen, Sara, and Joyce, for their incredible kindness and compassion during such a difficult time for our family. Our beloved dog, Mickey, was with us for 14 wonderful years, and saying goodbye was one of the hardest things we‚Äôve had to do. The care and patience shown by the staff made the process a little more bearable.

Dr Zen, Sara and Joyce were not only professional but also so gentle and empathetic, making sure Mickey was comfortable and at peace. They went above and beyond to support us, and their thoughtful gestures, including the beautiful bouquet they sent, meant the world to us.

Pet Avenue truly embodies what compassionate veterinary care should be. We will forever be grateful for the love and attention they gave Mickey, and for the support they provided to our family during this emotional time.

Thank you, Pet Avenue. üíï",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115364054688463044055/reviews
Jevarn Li,5,"I had a very pleasant experience with this clinic. My cat had to undergo surgery under GA and was hospitalised for 2 nights. All the vets (Dr Joyce, Zen and Dawn) were extremely friendly, reassuring and helpful throughout the whole process. Pricing was also transparent from the beginning. The vet techs also did a great job taking care of my cat.

Thank you to the pets Avenue team ü•πüôè",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110139405975040024878/reviews
