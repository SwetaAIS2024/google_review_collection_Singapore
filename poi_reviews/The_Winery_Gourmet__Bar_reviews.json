However what disappointed me was that i was here to celebrate my gf birthday (i did put in their note that i was celebrating my gf bday) I was hoping that they might have a little surprise on the house but nope nothing. I guess the only positive was the food but not the service. Doubt will be coming back here when the location is so out of the way.",

Their iberico pork paella ($62) tastes so good and they served amazing crispy bread appetizer with premium olive oil (smell and taste so floral and nice).
