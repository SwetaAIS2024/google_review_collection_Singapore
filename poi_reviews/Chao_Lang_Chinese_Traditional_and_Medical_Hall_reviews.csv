Sovanna Keo,1,"Visited this clinic after injuring my ankle. The TCM doctor said it was arthritis and proceeded to apply pressure in the area. He said I would feel better in an hour. But after an hour, I was in deep pain and had to use an umbrella to support myself. My ankle became bruised and swollen, when there were none of these when I visited. I paid $70 for 10 minutes of work that made my injury worse. He was also downplaying my pain, saying that it should not hurt based on his ""fifty years of experience"" when I was clearly in pain from what he was doing. He does not know what he is doing and may do more harm than good. I visited the polyclinic after that, got an X-ray and was diagnosed with a ligament tear. The polyclinic doctor said the added physical pressure from worsened the pain and swelling. Please avoid this place and go straight to the hospital or polyclinic for a proper diagnosis and treatment.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104877751116754073671/reviews
khaja mohiuddin,1,"I would not even give 1 Star if I can write my review without giving that star. Trust me, I m $320 poorer without loosing pain that I had. I thought old man is experienced and won't be greedy, may be he ll try to do best, I thought but he or his assistant is so greedy they charged $150 for 10mins and told I ve low calcium and sold me Activated calcimum Tablets 2 Bottles + Dandelion bottle for additional $170. I checked original price is $10 for activated calcium and $57 FOR Dandelion. This could have just costed me $77 and to them much lower could be. I ve never thought somebody can cheat to this extent. Feel bad and warning all to be careful. Dont recommend at all.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118438165015557831376/reviews
