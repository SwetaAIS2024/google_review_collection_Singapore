Dylan Li,5,"A very cute and cozy cafe tucked away in the corner of a building next to a preschool! I went to grab lunch and study, and the lady was very kind and friendly. My friend had a similar experience where he went and ended up talking with the lady there for a long time. The grilled cheese and ham sandwich was delicious and I really enjoyed the atmosphere there. I wish I had more time to visit again!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115227455027475284936/reviews
Haikel Yusop,5,"Nice quiet caf√© with great view of the park. Located at the back entrance of the preschool building.

Friendly auntie that cooks & serves everything by herself. Good place for a calming & slow brunch or late lunch.

Neha M,5,"The food and coffee are delicious. Had a grilled cheese sandwich with some chips and salad on the side. üòã It was delicious and took me back to my childhood days. Auntie Doris who runs the quaint cafe is super kind and always happy to chat and share about her day. Cute cafe up in the Clementi park in a part of the Chatsworth school. Definitely do pay a visit for some good vibes, good food, coffee and a park view. üòä üëç",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108196196743225021473/reviews
Lei Yvonne,5,"This chaming little caf√© is in the same building with primary school in Clementi woods park, a pleasant peaceful place. The food exceeded my expectations. I tasted the eggs Benedict and savory waffle. The Egg Benedict had poached eggs cooked to perfection with bagel sesame. Crunch Lettuce is a wonderful companion to the apple slices. The waffles were thick and chewy, satisfying in texture, and went perfectly with the toppings. The owner,  Doris is creativity and attention to detail. She is really a thoughtful and lovely lady. She adds unique ingredients to your preferences, such as custom salad dressings and a little bit of nutty crumbs, just by chatting with you.
Highly recommended to anyone seeking a personalized and exceptional dining experience!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100384939507156459173/reviews
Benjamin Tay,5,"Was in search of a quiet cafe away from the hustle and bustle, wow this place is a gem! Very cosy cafe! Excellent long black and home-made brownie! Very pleasant chat with Auntie, that gave me a very homely feel to this cafe. Auntie is a 1-man show, taking orders and serving food, but she would take time to chat. Will be back to try out the other items on the menu.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110241449837526510680/reviews
