Syahidah Rosli,5,"I had a great experience here trying out their different styles of hijabs! Friendly salesperson Soniya who helped me to choose which style suits me best. The hijabs are definitely worth the price cause you can wear the inner many ways! Some photos here to show some of my favourite designs.

If you think this is only for new hijabis, trust me even as a not so new hijabi myself, I would go for it.

Do come down and try it out yourself especially if you are looking for fuss free, pinless hijabs.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115103401076874424630/reviews

I was happy with my purchase and the designs are really pretty and easy to use!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103399740038800586155/reviews
