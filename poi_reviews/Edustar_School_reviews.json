      "text": "My eldest daughter has been going to Edustar since she was P4 as her English compo was almost failing. She loves the compo class at Edustar and her compo improved a lot as well. The teachers and the owner of Edustar are very kind and are always willing to lend a helping hand when needed. This year my girl added customized math class 1 term before PSLE to give it a boost. Highly recommended tuition center who cares more for the students than profit margins.",
