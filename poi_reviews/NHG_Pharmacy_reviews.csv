Colin,1,"It's a really hassle to buy online and collect from the NHG Pharmacy Kallang Polyclinic. Firstly, u need to wait for days for the items to be available at the pharmacy before they email u to go down to collect.

Secondly, they stated that the pharmacy will only keep your items for 5 days and afterwhich it will be forfeited/discarded without refund?!

Thirdly, when I was at the Kallang Polyclinic at 4.15pm they have already closed down the place (the operating hours are from 8.30am to 4.30pm). I have to knock on the door to get the security guard to open up and he only let me in when I told him that I am going to pick up my stuff from the NHG Pharmacy.

Truely a very disappointing experience buying online from NHG Pharmacy.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109920857467530131187/reviews
LWK,1,"Very bad service. Had to call hotline 23402300 many times before I spoke to a staff. She told me that she would get an expert to call me back on my query. Also sent feedback by enquiry form. Coming to 2 weeks, still no response. Why bother to provide both services if you don't intend to respond??? Absolutely hopeless and useless.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111580959013888380261/reviews
Richard Wong,1,"For goodness sake, please remove the hotline no from the webpage as it is a ghost no. If you do not have the intention to answer any queries at least be honest and not hide behind a phantom number.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113123713433977099379/reviews
Ng Hooisim,1,Tried calling the indicated phone number 6547 6456 for a few times after 2pm today (30/5/2022) but was rejected after 2 rings every single time. This number is totally unreachable. Please provide public with a reachable number. Thank you.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108216595434790910735/reviews
Kenny Chua,4,"Both the pharmacists and staff at the retail section are helpful and knowledgeable. Common OTC items are well organized and affordably priced. Certain items like the irrigation solution, Biatain foam dressing & etc, are slightly cheaper than those sold at the well-known pharmacies or even restructured hospitals. As for the purchase at the retail counter (excluding medicine & infant formula), one loyalty stamp will be rewarded with every $25 spent. ""Gift"" details aren't disclosed until you hit the jackpot or the 6th stamp. Not too difficult for those who frequent NHG polyclinics to fill up their first aid kits. Major credit cards accepted.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116297858667564013126/reviews
