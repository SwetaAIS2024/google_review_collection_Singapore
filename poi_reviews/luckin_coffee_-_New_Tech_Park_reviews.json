They also have some small desserts as well.\n\nThe original price is on a high side, higher than Starbucks & less options. But since they seem to have voucher often. Should be fine\n\nDo note that you can only pick up, no seat to dine in here",

Easy for quick order and if you are from outside area u can conveniently place an order and pick up as there is a big drop off area in the building and once u step out u will see luckin coffee. They also have first timer discount. Will recommend if you want a quick cuppa. Have good packaging as well.",

And, the latte has no coffee taste & fragrance too. What a latte tastes like sugar water.. so disappointing.\nNo wonder Starbucks always so crowded. McCaf√© is a much better and valued option too.",
