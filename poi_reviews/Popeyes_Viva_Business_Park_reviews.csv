Tian Chen Liew,1,"Is there no training for your staff? Or do you have to sleep at night at work? If you can't do the evening shift, please apply to do the morning shift! I happily ordered takeout, and waited for half an hour, but the food arrived, and there was nothing to give me, I ordered three salted eggs, pasta, only one, and I bought very little sauce, only a spoonful of your plastic spoon, this is your level?",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113777160477038684195/reviews
Gladys Goh,5,Kids love this place as its not crowded. This place is an educational hive of enrichment centres and food court. Popeyes is affordable and their chicken wings are not spicy for kids too. The meal is reasonably priced. They provide gloves so that your hands won't get dirty too. An alternative to other chicken fast food if in the area.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115856589257649706089/reviews
Didi Dadibiu,1,"$21 bucks for 16pcs of nuggets, 7 of them are disappointingly small.  ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž If you wanna charge a price like this, make sure all are even in sizes and now I felt being cheated, especially when I saw the real food which is nothing like from the photo they shown on grab.

Not even crispy and crunchy at alllâ€¦â€¦

Lexi,1,I ordered the truffle sour creme 3pc tender set which includes x1 mashed potatoes & x1 biscuit. I did not receive the mashed potatoes!!! Super disappointed as i really love the potatoes. No idea what the packer was doing but a SPOON was even provided ? Yet no mashed potatoes was inside. Pls fulfil the orders properly. We paid $ for that to be delivered to us in COMPLETE sets.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116914332512010017132/reviews
