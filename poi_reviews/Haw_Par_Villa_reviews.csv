CCS,3,"Here is one MRT station that seniors can pass through safely. There is even ONE parking lot for personal mobility device just next to the entrance. Very considerate.

Mostly deserted except during peak hours. No queues at ATMs, topping up stations - and clean restrooms.

Conveniently located next to the historical Haw Par Villa.

Huge crowds used to throng it for its Chinese mythological figurines and depiction of ""hell"" punishment chambers. But alas, not anymore - even after reverting back to free admission.

Guess times have changed. Singapore have changed. Values have changed as well.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113721018771927256976/reviews

Ma S,3,"Users of this MRT station seems mostly the tourists who wanna visit haw par villa park.
It’s really interesting and it’s worth to visit once:)!

But there’re many residential buildings and houses near to this MRT so I think during rush hours, the station will be crowded (?) though I am not sure anyway...
