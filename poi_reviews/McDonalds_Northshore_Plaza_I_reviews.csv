Ed W,1,The way all the staff here short change your customer cannot continue to go unknown to @macdonaldsg. This is the way you cut your costs by filling up your cheap fries on such manner evertime without shame. This is just one of what this outlet is capable. Hope your franchiser did not instruct you to do such cheap shots? Come on.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116751128011834363142/reviews

Seah Mark,2,"I visited this outlet for breakfast with my family and, unfortunately, encountered recurring issues that have yet to be resolved. These include missing orders, long wait times, and missing condiments. The staff often appear disoriented and uncoordinated, even when the outlet isn’t busy. On crowded days, the situation worsens significantly—you can expect to wait 45 minutes to an hour for your order.

During this particular visit, one of my items—the Breakfast Deluxe—was not served. When I asked about it, I was told it was on the way, but it never arrived. I stood near the kitchen and observed freshly prepared Breakfast Deluxes being handed out to customers who ordered after me, which was frustrating and disappointing.

That said, I would like to commend Auntie Susan. Despite the challenges, she remained calm, courteous, and helpful. Her patience really stood out.

While this location is convenient for residents in Northshore, the level of service needs serious improvement.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103775802027266575016/reviews
