Nat,1,"Our 3 bedroom unit bedsheets and pillow casing has hair strands over it, it was a disgusting sight.
I have to remove the sheets and although we informed the unit owner to pass us some new pillow sheet, I check there was hair strand again.... Was staying in tower B6-11.
The rest of the house are OK.
Facilities are great but we didn't frequent it.
I definitely won't stay here again.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117581909279476737976/reviews
Ian Png,4,The place has a great view if the surrounding is already finished furnishing. Currently many of the area are still under renovation. But it will be an exquisite view once that is done! 24hrs cafe is available so no worries about food choices.,6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100043512330583707434/reviews

Ryan Lu,5,"Be aware that Teega Residences and Teega Suites are two different buildings! For Teega Suites you will see the name ‘Teega Suites’ at the lobby entrance.

It is a great place to spend a holiday or family vacation, its almost like a 5-star resort, but don't go for cheap rooms because they do not necessarily give you good service.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113597156292222411099/reviews
Wai Onn Chan,4,Beautiful condominiums but the owner for our Airbnb unit did not particularly do a good job getting the place ready for new guests. It has a beautiful Entertainment Deck which your kids and yourself could spend a while day at,7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108370270557248913140/reviews
