Harida S,5,"Every time I visited Singapore, my sons and I have the the tradition of having pratahs as our first day breakfast. Weâ€™re lucky to live near two places selling pratahs. Love Saffronâ€™s offering. The pratahs are on the soft on the inside and a bit of crunch on the outside. The curry dipping sauce was great too. We also had the rojak, another favourite. Overall, a good dining experience and prices wise not bad. Will return!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117072309428452807983/reviews
S H,1,"Specifically said mee goreng without meat.
Still went on to cook with meat in it!
What is the purpose of specifying? And even putting 2 rubber bands to identity between meat and no meat!?
I have never left negative reviews but this is ridiculous! Have not eaten the whole day and end up throwing my food.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103970907132670065456/reviews
Mics,4,"This is is a fantastic spot for authentic and delicious Malaysian, and Indian cuisine. Teh tarik here is perfectly frothy, roti john is incredibly satisfying, with a rich blend of savory fillings, and the mie goreng is a delightful mix of spices and noodles. The cheese prata is crispy with gooey cheese in every bite.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102320748369684138586/reviews
KingKong 99,5,"Happened to pass by my old school . Been a long time since I was here. Can't believe it , since 1982.

Decided to pop in this restaurant to try.
Wow, it was really the taste when I was young. Very old school.

Triangle curry puff. The chilli sauce is the same taste made with chilli padi.
Spicy and good.

The bee Hoon goreng is really good.
Ingredients portion is generous.

The prata is crispy and soft on the inside. Fish curry is just nice to perfection. Have that tangy taste. Loved the sambal as condiment.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110180464205420002754/reviews
syed Ibrahim Yusoff,5,I had frequently visited Saffrons outlet at Tampines since many years. This was my first visit to the Swan Lake outlet.  The restaurant was very clean and tidy. The staff are friendly and helpful. Service are prompt. The excellent mutton briyani and the coffee and tea ginger were excellent too and the prata with egg. But I was surprised cos the price on the menu and on the receipt are quite different. The mutton briyani was $10.00 each whereas the menu states $9.00. The egg prata was $2.50 whereas the menu stated $2.20. Maybe they had increased the prices recently and they had not changed the menu list ðŸ¤”. I have no complaints about the quality and quantity of the food and service only the changes of the price paid.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110405930017936179870/reviews
