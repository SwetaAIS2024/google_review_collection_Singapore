Mings,5,"üòÄ/ü•π

San lou was actually very very very good! Super wok Hei. The fried prawn noodles had little bits of salted fish in it which was very delightful.

The pork two ways which we ordered was odd, but I‚Äôd still come here for the noodles. Easy to find a seat during a Friday lunch time",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114884899640823787488/reviews
Katherine Happiest,4,"I ordered two dishes
They tasted great. It was flavourful and not overly saltish

Service was prompt and quick partially cos were we having a late lunch

Portion was generous to me.

I like that the food was served to our table instead of giving us a buzzer to self collect

Atmosphere in this coffee shop is very vibrant
Well ventilated too",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103056298337699105255/reviews
Fred Ng,5,"One of the best zichar places around. Tonight's pork was perfectly cooked to delightful tenderness, and fish tail was super fresh with a succulent firmness. For vegetables, the ÂõõÂ§ßÂ§©Áéã (Four Heavenly Kings) is excellent - four different types of vegetables with a dash of fried ikan bilis.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115925074007073693178/reviews

James Ang,5,"Another jem hidden amongst the heartland!

Not many places sell Pig Trotter Beehoon, and this place does! And not only does it sell, its good! The sauce is has a very savory taste profile, and not overly flat or just looks brown and black. Serves as a good dish and main on its own with the family or even alone. Its Dad's fave and he'll drive down from Hougang just for this.

The potato leaves are well cooked and even though its not spicy the taste was so on point. The rest of the dishes are standard, quality zichar items and definitely all good.

Will come back again to try their Moonlight Horfan and Signature Tofu!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100655878992435360282/reviews
