What stood out to us was how patient and understanding she was with our kid. She never minded us bringing them along to our appointments, even when they got a little distracting.\n\nWe also appreciated the consistent progress updates, so we didn’t have to visit the site in person to check on the work. Overall, it was a smooth and enjoyable process. Highly recommended!",

      "text": "Gay World has become our family reno contractor! They did the reno for our HDB 16 yrs ago when we first got our keys and some further reno along the way as we had to make changes to cater to our growing family and childrens’ growing needs. They are thoughtful in their design and layout/ placement of every detail to ensure practicality and future-proofing to the best ability/ possibility. They discuss their proposal with their team of carpenters, electrician, plumbing etc to ensure plans are feasible and reasonable timeline for completion. Overall they  produce quality work and reliable hence we have also continued to engage them for reno of our recent new condominium. Our other family members ie siblings and cousins have also engaged Gay World for their reno projects after we recommended them.",
