It’s much quieter and comfortable since there’s fewer people patronising this one.\n\nService was pretty good, they told my partner and I about the discounts they had on the cake which was a super good deal in my opinion.\n\nI love both the carrot cake and the cake of the day, they’re really tasty and not dry.",

The hot drink inclusive in the set cannot be changed. The Hazelnut Americano served in paper cups tasted worse than long kang water. We are dining in so why no proper coffee mugs? Do not waste your calories on this.",

I was told that there were two CBTL in vivo city and i happened to be directed to this one. I enjoyed the pancake and eggs which we don't get at home. Service was poor as they were horribly understaffed and tables were not cleared, with customers having to bring our trays to the counter. I shall find the other CBTL the next round.",
