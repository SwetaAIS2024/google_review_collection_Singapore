Falsefast,4,"We were here at 9pm on a weekday night. The restaurant was not busy, but the service was slow.
Waited 15mins for our drinks to be served. Food came later but was good. Really hope that the restaurant can clean the fabric seats as the seats are just too gross, too dirty with stain marks and spots that we actually had to place a tissue paper (the one provided in the cutlery box) on the seat to sit on.

Koh,5,Had a pleasant dining experience at Pizza Hut Eastpoint. Love that they had a weekday all day dining offer! (Got our meal for $9.90 only!!). Vani who served us was also such a sweetheart and was so helpful. Love that it‚Äôs also not too packed and the ambience of Eastpoint Pizza Hut outlet is so cozy as well. Highly recommended,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110842125281707490882/reviews
Min HL,4,"had the weekday promo $18 for 2 which we chose 2 soup of the day, along w regular pan pizza and sweet and spicy drum-lets.

soup of the day was mushroom soup but taste rather salty with bits of onion and no mushroom. pizza came piping hot which was great.

overall, paid $21.58 after gst. wanted to redeem fraser points, staff scanned the qr code from our phone alr but in the end never received the points üëéüèª",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103965869018673563240/reviews
