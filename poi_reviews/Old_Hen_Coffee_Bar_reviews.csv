Chim Mei,4,"The coffee was okay—smooth but not very strong, and the small cup size left us unsatisfied. On the bright side, the avocado toast was delicious! The big breakfast was decent, though nothing extraordinary.

The café itself is quite cramped; we had to squeeze in to avoid bumping elbows with neighboring diners.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101044726506569224192/reviews
Latte x Ash Wong,4,"Cosy and compact, 1hr sit in time for dine in. Pretty reasonable for a break in the afternoon.
Ordered a hot dark chocolate, an iced white, buttered corn chowder and apple cinnamon waffles.

Ruth Go,5,"Cozy breakfast nook tucked in Rangoon.
Sticky date cupcake is moist and not too sweet, paired really well with their coffee.
