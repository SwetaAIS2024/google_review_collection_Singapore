Cynthia G,4,"A decent Yong Tau Foo spot with an average selection. The curry was more like a soup, pretty easy to drink. Service was quick and to the point, though not overly friendly. They didn’t bother to re-fry my fried items. A small plus - soy beans provided on the side as condiments.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110038244663695997045/reviews
Shu Zhe Ng,5,"Not sure what’s wrong with the low star reviews, the food is awesome, selection of ingredients were kept pretty clean, and the staffs prepared the food swiftly within 2 to 3 minutes.

The soup base is just nice, nothing much to nitpick about. Would be even better if there’s more ingredient options to choose from.

Definitely will visit again for more Yong TauFu!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107333158713312587720/reviews
Mad Mad Sid,2,"visited this stall early on the morning of 1 December, 2024. Unfortunately, I encountered a middle aged lady staff who was rude and displayed a bad attitude, which negatively impacted my experience. To Lim or the owner of this business: employing staff with poor customer service can harm your business!

Regarding the food, while it was decent, the condiments provided were insufficient and overly diluted. Condiments are a critical aspect of this meal and can significantly influence a customer's impression. I strongly recommend addressing these issues promptly to ensure the success of your business.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109344049672742513730/reviews
strawberry,1,"Terrible service. I told the auntie that the bowl in front of me was not my order and she told me that someone else may have taken my order and told me to just take the wrong order???? I was so confused and kindly asked if I could take my ingredients again because it was obviously not my fault that the person before me took my order, but she just rudely replied with a NO, my boss says even if its wrong you just have to take it. This is the first time I’ve ever experienced such rude service at any F&B in Singapore LOL. How can you expect me to take something I didn’t pay for, plus do you not consider people who have food allergies??? Please do something about your service LOL",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103450710712478760785/reviews
Jess Lin,1,"The service deserves no stars. Not expecting Michelin standards here, but at least have some decency to speak properly?
The Chinese auntie and other non-Chinese woman cooking the YTF were both incredibly rude. At one point even shouting at me when she first mumbled and I couldn't hear her so didn't respond. If you mumble, do you expect a response? And if you don't get a response the first time, do you then yell at the customer? I'm really surprised this stall is still here.
So incredibly rude that it makes me think what kind of treatment these workers get from their employers and even family. WHO talks like that? Flabbergasted.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114696240110446461011/reviews
