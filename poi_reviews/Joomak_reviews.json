Her friendly demeanor and attentive service made us feel right at home. Not only did she guide us through the menu with expert recommendations, but she also took the time to explain the different cuts of meat and the best ways to grill them. Her enthusiasm for the food was infectious, and it made our experience that much more enjoyable.\n\nOh æˆ‘çš„å¤©, where do I even begin? We indulged in a variety of BBQ options, and I can confidently say it was one of the best BBQ experiences of our lives. The marinated meats were bursting with flavor, each bite more delicious than the last. The beef was tender and juicy, while the pork belly had that perfect balance of crispy and succulent. And letâ€™s not forget the array of side dishes! å“¦çŽ©é‚£cry. The kimchi, pickled vegetables, and rice complemented the BBQ perfectly, adding layers of flavor that kept us coming back for more.\n\nTrust me, u wonâ€™t regret it!",

      "text": "Went there for our anniversary because of a lot good reviews on google map, but the meal was a bit disappointing.\n\nThey were a bit understaffed, only one lady running around to serve food and checkout bills.\n\nThe steam egg no way near the picture shown on the menu, it felt like made by someone inexperienced or made unsuccessful but they still serve it regardless. The BBQ set C portion size also feel not matching its 100 SGD price tag.\n\nAlso all the food was already half cooked when they brought to the table, not grilled from raw in front of you. Iâ€™ve never been to Korean bbq restaurants like this before, maybe they want to save time? Not my cup of tea to have Korean bbq like this because I donâ€™t get a chance to see the quality of meat and freshness.\n\nFood overall taste was good but I will maybe try other Korean restaurants next time given there are many options around the area.",

      "text": "Enjoyed a wonderful Korean bbq dinner at JOOMAK @ Beauty World Centre this evening with the family ! Found the food there to be very authentic and as good and tasty as those found in Korea , especially the soups . We ordered the Set C bbq combi with black pork and beef . The mixed meats set which is good for 4 pax at sgd 100 only came with sufficient portion of black pork and aged beef. I liked the idea of the half cooked beef short ribs prepared in advance as it cuts down grilling time . The combi set came with a steaming hot bowl of fluffy eggs and a choice of kimchi , soft tofu or bean paste soup placed in a bowl recess uniquely located at the centre of the grill plate so that the soup is always piping hot . They are very generous with the free Korean side dishes and condiments which were willingly served to us by the cheerful female service staff . The pleasant lady chef owner even gave us complimentary Korean milk sodas and red bean bingsu which were refreshing and went down well with the Korean meal . Overall it was a great eating experience there as the food is truly authentic , service very good and it somewhat feels like you are dining in one of those small restaurants in Korea . The price is really very reasonable for such a good dining experience .Will definitely go back there again for the bbq and also to try their recommended spicy beef bukbap ( beef and tripe soup ) which is prepared daily by the chef owner in a specially designed giant earthly cooking ware brought in from Korea .",
