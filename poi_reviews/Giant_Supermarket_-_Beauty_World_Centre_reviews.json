      "text": "BEST supermarket in Singapore.\nI think the manager here lead the team very well. The staff here is warm and helpful. Although this is a super busy supermarket but the queue is moving quite fast and they also have enough self serve check out counters so facilitate payments. One of their staff Radica was exceptional nice, she volunteered to lend me her trolley as the stuff I bought was too heavy to be carried by hands. The product range here are diverse and complete to every shopperâ€™s need. Staff also always make a point to remind the senior to present their discount cards so to enjoy their saving. Love the humanity here.",

The mart do carry a wide variety of local and grocery products, along with the essential range of general merchandise and household items you need. Service can be greatly improved from by fixing the self-checkout kiosk, and better labellings. Staff can show a greater interest in customer service to walk-in customers.",
