Steven Shen,5,"I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Ms. Nur'Afifah for her outstanding customer service. Despite my late arrival at the bank at 4:30 PM, when the branch was close to its closing time, Ms. Nur'Afifah went above and beyond to assist me with replacing my expired debit card.

Her willingness to serve me with such diligence and professionalism, even after a long day, is truly commendable. She handled my inquiry efficiently and with a warm demeanor, making what could have been a stressful situation a smooth and pleasant experience.

It‚Äôs rare to encounter such dedication and commitment to customer satisfaction, and I believe Ms. Nur'Afifah is a valuable asset to the team. I am genuinely grateful for her efforts and hope her exceptional service is recognized and celebrated.

Thank you, Ms. Nur'Afifah, for making a difference!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114337775278888205656/reviews
