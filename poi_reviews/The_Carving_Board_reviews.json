Food was so good that we had to order takeaways for family. I wished there were more variety of salad dressing. t's non air-conditioning, so be prepared to sweat a little. Staff were friendly despite the long queue.",

The food was average and service was prompt.\nThe prices here are notably higher than other eating house Western shops, but this is attributed to the use of superior quality ingredients.\n\nHowever, the steak was a above average - cooked with just the right amount of char and doneness. Worth a try, especially for the steak! when in this area.\n\nNote that this eating house is with only a handful of shops selling dim sum, drinks, and this Western food. When we arrived around, the other shops had already closed, so it's possible they keep limited hours.",

      "text": "This establishment offers a dining experience that falls squarely into the realm of \"average.\"  The food, while palatable, lacks the distinctive character to warrant significant praise.  Flavors are unremarkable, and the overall culinary execution is competent but not exceptional.  Pricing surpasses that of your typical coffee shop, positioning it within a slightly higher price bracket, though not necessarily justifying the cost based on the quality of the food presented. The inclusion of draught beers on the menu suggests an attempt to broaden appeal and cater to a wider clientele, but doesn't elevate the overall dining experience.  In short, a perfectly adequate but ultimately forgettable meal.",

      "text": "All the dishes were pretty good, but the mushroom risotto has to be my favourite. The grilled chicken and pork were both well-cooked and tender, and the mashed potato that came with the pork chop was really delicious. Mushroom soup was good with thick mushroom bits, but a bit pricey for the portion. Prices are really reasonable for such great quality of food! Love that it has a selection of wines and beer as well.",

Overall portion was quite huge and the 250gm ribeye was really good. $29 for a steak at a coffeeshop would mean that the steak was of better quality than those you can get in a cafe of the same price, another plus point was that the steak doesnâ€™t turn cold as fast! Will be back again!",
