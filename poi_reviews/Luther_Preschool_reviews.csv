Su Susu,5,"Personally, the litmus test on whether young kids should attend a school is whether they love or hate attending school.

I have a 3 year old who started at this school since Nov 2021, and recently a 18 month old who started in Jun 2023. So far they have very happy demeanor every morning when I send them to school. The interaction between my kids and the teachers & non-teaching staff at school is also very positive.

Earlier when I assessed the school environment, I like that because it is contained within Queenstown Lutheran Church, there is normally less strangers passing by on weekdays. Each class also has its own physical classroom - which was important for me esp it was during COVID times when I registered my 1st child. There's a small garden, swing, playground, scooter and tricycles all within the church premises that the kids can use. They also take the opportunity to teach the kids about nature and care for the plants in the garden.

Course content also has a lot of creative learning. Every term the kids have 1 field trip to learn about the real world outside school. For all key festivals and holidays the kids are educated about the significance of the event and encouraged to create an art n craft piece to take home.

The real bonus for us is that my elder kid has finally learnt to eat vegetables through the daily encouragement at school. Also independently brings the used utensils to the kitchen sink, then wipes away the food debris.

Teachers are very attentive to the kids, and you can see they work together to educate and watch out for the little ones. Keep up the good work dear Luther Preschool!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112365531106542150500/reviews
