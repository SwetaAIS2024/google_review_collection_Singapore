Wenxuan,1,"As a tom yum and seafood lover, I'm sorry to say that the Thai seafood cream pasta ($16) looked promising but smelled and tasted terrible. Hope my plate was an anomaly as this was supposed to be one of their recommended dishes.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117968968562466626832/reviews
Huh Dam,1,"This is a $14 Classic Cheese Bacon burger. Bacon much?

A bacon strip cut into half. Selective service standards based on who you are (students are self serviced, but outsiders gets full table service)

Funny place",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108385211343401034889/reviews
Yang,3,"Their food is alright some nice some normal. Got student price. The atmosphere quite dull and that is this smell that will linger on your shirt after going to the bistro. Self service order, take food, clean plate. If I will to recommend, get their juicy burger, it might be a little expensive, but damn it's good. For more budget, get their pizza or pasta set.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103078870952547064508/reviews
Simriti Bundhoo,4,"Easy food options for SUTD students who don't want to walk to CCP, eat from canteen or cook.

A bit more expensive than Saizeriya but a good alternative. You get the student discount if you flash your student card.

I remember it being a better deal before the price hike. But it's nice taste and atmosphere wise.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114463195551820846467/reviews
Satiyam,2,"I visited D’Star Bistro recently and had an unpleasant experience at the counter. The cashier seemed more focused on her own tasks and asked me to wait, which I understood. However, when I approached to place my order, she unexpectedly mentioned ""pasta,"" which confused me, as I hadn’t brought it up. It felt like she was making assumptions about what I wanted without actually listening to me. She even began explaining what pasta is, as if I didn’t know — which came across as condescending and unnecessary. The overall interaction left me feeling dismissed and a bit awkward. I hope the service improves, as I’ve heard good things about the food.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100049757304553492134/reviews
