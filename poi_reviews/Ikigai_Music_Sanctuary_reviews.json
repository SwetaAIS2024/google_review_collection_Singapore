      "text": "Mr Wilson has personally taught me so much over the past year and a half in preparation for my grade 6 exam. He has made learning music fun and exciting again for me, contrary to my former piano teacher. I believe that a teacher that is able to teach this well nowadays is extremely rare, so if anyone is looking for a place for kids to learn  music, I very highly recommend Ikigai.",
