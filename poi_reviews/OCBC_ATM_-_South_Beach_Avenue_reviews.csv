Flo Yeow,4,"Located right by 7 Eleven, the ATM stack is right by each other, close to the MRT entrance. It's kept underground, under shelter, closer towards Suntec side of the underground; so you'll unlikely run into inconvenience issues. Not the easiest ATMs to find, but if need be, just look for 7 Eleven and you'll likely be able to find them.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
