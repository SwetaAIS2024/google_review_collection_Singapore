Ben NG,3,"Wash and keep the toilet and bathing area clean is very important but the staff incline to use host and spray everything including benches, leaving no dry spot to put things and change clothes. Putting on pants is such a pain without getting it wet. Kindly improve. Thanks.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113231649844419081198/reviews
Feliz,1,"The pool is beautiful, spacious and when you swim, you really felt that you are on holiday. The pool surrounded with palm tree, unfortunately the bathroom area was the worst place. The cubicle number S1 for the ladies toilet when you enter, please do not go to the extreme left cubicle, there is no water at all,  after I have removed all my clothes and wanted to take a good bath,I was so mad. Then I just go to the next cubicle,the water came out as a midst water!!! My goodness!!!! At the end I just wipe clean pack and go home.

I hope the MP of  the Yio Chu Kang read this review, go and have a spot check.

Pls don't have a shower there ,just go home and bath.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116157125905421525141/reviews
John Espina,5,"Well... for the value of 1 dollar? What can I say?

The place is cleaned and well maintained.
There is a surge of people after 5pm but u can still swim freely.

The olympic pool has a lane designated for lap swimming.

Overall, a good place for a water work out. üòÖ",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107012492129398307500/reviews
