K Y Yow,2,"I like to share my experience of inadequate service attitude by the reception staff. Not the first time from my observations during previous visits.
I visited clinic on 6Mar for a simple blood test. Doctor was attentive and asked relevant questions. I knew test report from the lab would be sent to the clinic the next day, from date stamps on previous test reports. I told the counter to contact me for collection as soon as it is available. Next day, 7 Mar, I made enquiry and was told report would be ready 3-5 days and they would notify me. As I was anxious to see result, I dropped by this morning ; again met with same reply “ not ready”. I asked the staff to check and they found the report in the document tray, received 2 days ago. If I had not been insistent, the report might stay unattended for several more days.

I had better experience with another clinic where I was contacted the next day to collect the report.

I have had good experience with the doctors there but the reception service usually fall short.

Jov,1,"I had a very disappointing experience at this clinic.Doctor Ajeet Kumar was unprofessional and impatient when assessing my skin condition. I asked for a referral letter to see a specialist but he was clearly reluctant to provide one and when he finally did, the letter turned out to be completely useless.
After taking the allergy medication he prescribed, my symptoms worsened. I ended up with swollen eyes and a sore throat which weren’t as severe before the visit.
This makes me seriously question his medical judgment and professionalism.

I definitely do not recommend this clinic.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106538272371203801350/reviews
Winston Khoo,5,"Blk 431, Yishun Avenue 1. Very caring and patience doctors and staff. The counter staff are all very polite too especially Iuni (Malay lady that always does the dispensing). She show a lot of care and concerns for patients. Thank you so much Iuni.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111140944407893406223/reviews
Adeline Zhang,1,"This Doc Axel Chu Jun Ming basically he has no interest in diagnosing of the patient. He is not concern of what I using or what caused or triggered the eczema. Basically he just type on his computer and I have to ask for cream for my eczema. And he didn’t  want to listen to my doubts just steroid only that’s it. He sigh and sigh in front of me and give excuses like the mask very hard to breathe. And then he ended the consultation. I HAD TO ASK FOR antihistamine to stop the irritating myself. He then entered into his system.

Basically he can just be the med dispenser person or admin alr. Only when I ask for the item then he provide.

Damn lousy attitude doc and he is so young but so stuck up alr.

By the way the old uncle who entered before me also said he don’t even understand what the doc was saying. He can’t explain clearly to the patient what he is prescribing him.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106257053856938101328/reviews
vicky qi,1,"This is very bad. My daughter was measured at 37.9°C at the front desk, but the doctor said it was 36.9°C. I told the doctor that it was 37.9°C earlier, but the doctor responded rudely, insisting it was 36.9°C, not believing me, and didn't take another measurement. The doctor was very dismissive. I highly do not recommend this clinic or Dr. Ajeet Kumar Gupta.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102599643916699327656/reviews
