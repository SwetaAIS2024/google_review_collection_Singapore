Juz Ng,1,Worst hospital layout. After drop off you need to park at a car park that's  about 15mins walk to car park. If it rains its even worst. Finding the pickup location also difficult and traffic issues. To many curvy route to go to the pick up location. Pick up area are small and short and easily jam up to the main road. Even taking grab also difficult to drop off.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108441941737551756129/reviews
Sunny Sun,1,"Waited close to 2.5hrs to see doctor for less than 10mins.. Poor scheduling by the clinic. Nurses have bad attitude as well. Malay nurse got impatient with my mum during eye assessment and was rough while applying eyedrop. When we asked another nurse to check on our queue, nurse said okay but did not even bother coming back to update.

Gan Melvin,1,"Brought my mum eye consultation. Worst experience, just because we are subsidised by gov. We get subsidise service. Tell us to be patience. But when the team consultant came to talk to us, he was in a hurry. Even before we can confirm what lens to use, came another consultant also in a hurriedly manner. Only thing focus on telling us is, risk. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105269724458549788182/reviews
