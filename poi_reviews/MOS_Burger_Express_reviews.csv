Benson Tan,1,"Ordered via grabfood. 11 April 2025.
Everything was good until i almost finished my fish burger‚Ä¶ there was a piece of plastic inside my burger‚Ä¶. In the sauce‚Ä¶.. luckily i was chewing properly and felt something weird‚Ä¶ reached into my mouth and to my horror, out came a piece of plastic from my mouth.. and it was quite a long piece! Imagine a kid or an elderly eating this burger?? They could have choked on it! This is so dangerous! This is very unacceptable. Higher management should be more vigilant and keep this kind of BASIC food safety in place!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110968066148220734204/reviews

My 1st experience having MOS burger here, we order Yakiniku rice burger, Okonomoyaki rice burger, set meal with coffee. Total price $21.00, higher then my expectations.

Overall the taste of the beefs is well cook & tender, my wife didn‚Äôt like the sea food combination, she said a little salty.

Potato fried is good & tasty, sweet potato fried also very good taste.

Overall just a little pricy to me, and the paper wrapped the meal isn‚Äôt convenient to eat at all,

My wife used to order take away here on her way home.
Suggestion: if the MOS burger will consider install hand sanitizer‚Äôs will be better, because we used hand to eat French fries üçüüòÖ",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104017026296774707444/reviews
Ivy Poon,5,Today‚Äôs fish burger set was very well done! Very neatly stacked. Taste very good with the right amount of mayo. Fries nicely done not over fried. The place can be cleaner. If you use the same cleaning liquid as Japan will really feel like in Japan. Very good for an express outlet,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111185101717216248399/reviews
