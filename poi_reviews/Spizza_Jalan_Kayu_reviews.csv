double you.,5,"We enjoyed dining in yesterday. The service is friendly and attentive. We love the food too! Will be back :)

My personal preference is to have wetter tiramisu with stronger alcohol taste.

And the crab fettuccini pasta was a bit soft, my personal preference is to have more al dente.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108727712984626934623/reviews
Zelda Tatiana,2,"First of all, I've been a regular patron and the following has never happened before... But yesterday's order was absolutely disappointing!

The Mushroom Soup was NOT like the usual i.e. creamy, rich and fulfilling... It was WATERY and thin! As a regular customer, it's pretty obvious! What happened?? It seems like they had missed out some ingredients...? Like cream or milk or flour...??? It's so SAD!

Then, the pizzas - The crust were not as fragrant and soft as usual... The content were ok. BUT, the way the pizzas were 'cut' - absolutely HORRIBLE! It feels like a half-hearted job... (Or someone seems very unhappy with their job...) The cuts were SO IRREGULAR!! - which means you'll get an extremely large or petitly small piece of pizza!

SAD! Seriously, even if I order again, I'll remember NOT to order from this branch!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105719979530341757111/reviews
Marcus Ang,4,"pizzas were well made with a crispy thin crust with no burnt edges, toppings were given generously as well

calamari was light and springy, pairs well with the sauces provided but some pieces have the skin still on

the ravioli had the frozen powdery taste to it despite being served hot, that the sauce wasn't enough to cover.

will be for more pizzas",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111145722549856734783/reviews
Chiara Dela Cruz,5,"As someone who loves Italian food and considers Italy my second home, I can say that Spizza offers one of the most authentic tastes weâ€™ve tried. Plus, it is very affordable and generous with its servings. The staff are also nice and approachable. We will definitely come back for a third time or more!!!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117362964008729824033/reviews
