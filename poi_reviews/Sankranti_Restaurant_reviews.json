      "text": "When i moved to Tampines, was happy to see Sankranti here. I tried Veg meals once and Mutton briyani once. The veg meals was ok, but the rice was bit undercooked. The Mutton briyani was pathetic. The Mutton does not seem to be fresh and was very hard. Not cooked well. The briyani rice was ok, nothing great.  The worst part was it's $14.5 and for the ambience and quality of meat, it's a very steep price to pay.  I might visit them again but definitely not going to order the briyani again.\n\nUpdate Mar 2024 - visited here several times but the cost is too high for what we are getting. They are surviving just because there are no better options nearby.",

It was rice coated in yellow colouring, not at all briyani. The chicken has more flour coating than the meat itself. The gobi manchurian did not even taste of cauliflower. I was only eating coatings and coatings of flour. Only the coffee was good.\n\nPlease please don't eat there. I felt so cheated of my money",
