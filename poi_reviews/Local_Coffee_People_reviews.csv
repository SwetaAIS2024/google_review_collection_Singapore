Khye An Arhul,5,"Coffee and Tea here is much nicer than other local drink places nearby ;) I always come here for my post-lunch fix. Also, if you could add another grab QR code earlier in the queue that would be great, so we can prepare to make payment faster",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117473617103144627946/reviews

Monsieur Snow,4,"Decent tea, very thick. Ordered almond milk tea less sweet. You can smell the almond flavour quite easily, but taste-wise it is not as strong.
If you didn't say less sweet, it can be quite sweet so take note.
Located in The Sail basement, which can be accessed from Downtown MRT via Marina Bay Link Mall.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102118777920337503499/reviews
Yong Xin Khoo,1,"Super bad customer service and the drinks is really awful and disgusting?
Wanted to give the salted lychee tea a try and asked if the staff if the drinks is carbonated. But the first staff couldn’t answer me and I asked the 2nd staff whom also cannot answer me if the drinks is fizzy/carbonated. They had to ask another staff further in and they say it wasn’t. When I got my drink I was shocked because it looks like lemonade. And I was right because it just tasted like a salty lemonade?! I went back and checked with the staff and he just told me to stir. I stirred thoroughly right infront of him and tasted again it’s the same. And he just walked off. The rest of the staff also didn’t bother trying to remake or change the drink for me. They use their super eye p wer as if they are of any help. Outright disgusted by their rudeness and unprofessionalism. There are so many drinks places in Raffles Place and they had the audacity to provide such standard and service.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108369047230268941259/reviews
