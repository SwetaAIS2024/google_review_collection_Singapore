They even have a prayer room for  breast feeding mommies & those with pre-schooler kids.\n\nOne suggestion:: the divider partition at main hall between Muslim Muslimat need to be changed to a better one.",

By 1961, it became a mainstream mosque due to the contributions made by former Member of Parliament Mr. Ahmad Ibrahim who made most of the significant upgrading and major improvements to the surau beginning in 1959.\n\nToday, it has a silver dome on the top of its minaret that overlooks the nearby Springside landed neighbourhood.

It was then known as Surau Nee Soon Jalan Ulu Seletar and its first Imam was Imam Hj Katsir.\n\nIn 1959, Ahmad Ibrahim, Member of Parliament for Sembawang Nee Soon and Labour Minister, helped upgrade and improve the facilities of the surau.\n\nIn 1961, the surau was upgraded to the status of a Masjid to meet the growing number of Muslims in the area. In a vote for a change of name for the Masjid, the name of Ahmad Ibrahim was chosen to recognise his contributions to the Masjid. The first Friday prayers was held soon after in that year.\n\nOver the years, various other improvements were added to the Masjid, enhancing its capacity to a congregation of around 1,000 people.\n\nHow to get there?\nBus Services:\n167, 169, 171, 800, 811, 856, 858, 859, 969, 980",
