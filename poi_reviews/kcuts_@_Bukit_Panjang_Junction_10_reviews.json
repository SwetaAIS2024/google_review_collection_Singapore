      "text": "I guess not all KCut outlets are created equal‚Äîsome are wielding scissors like they‚Äôre auditioning for¬†Edward Scissorhands, while others are out here giving Michelangelo a run for his money with their hair-sculpting skills. Thankfully, the KCut at Ten Mile Junction falls into the latter category. The lady  stylist, Ms yee didn‚Äôt just¬†listen¬†to what I wanted‚Äîthey¬†understood. It‚Äôs like they had a psychic connection to my hair (or maybe I just finally found someone who speaks fluent ‚Äòbad hair day‚Äô). No awkward pauses, no ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what are we doing today?‚Äù followed by a blank stare. They just nodded, grabbed their tools, and worked their magic. I walked out with a haircut so good, I caught my reflection in a car window and almost proposed to myself. 10/10,\nI would recommend. If you‚Äôre tired of playing Russian roulette with your hair, just come here. Your scalp (and your self-esteem) will thank you.\" P.S. If you see someone outside the salon bowing to their own reflection, it‚Äôs probably me. Don‚Äôt judge.",
