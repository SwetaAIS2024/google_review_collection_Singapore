Iresh Alado,5,"Dr Noor Hanif is attentive, knowledgeable and caring. He listens to his patients and provides treatment accordingly. I have visited three doctors prior, but no relief.  I am delighted with Dr Noor Hanifâ€™s effective treatment plan. The specialist consultation and treatment cost is reasonable as I could see impressive results on my skin in 3 days after almost three weeks of suffering from eczema and urticaria.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103801228455453234769/reviews
