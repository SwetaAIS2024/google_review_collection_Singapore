2022 review: i don‚Äôt usually eat mee hoon kueh cos most places are the machine made ones - so when i saw these handmade ones i knew i had to try it!! got my dad to go down to tabao since i have covid. the noodles were sitting for a while but it was still fresh and didn‚Äôt stick together! im very impressed by the noodle - its al dente, chewy, cooked to perfection. the sauce is amazing for the dry! love the the soft boiled egg is perfect too! very delicious bowl hehe will bring my bf down to try too",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110802433937143802740/reviews
Y Ng,3,"Edit: Recently noticed 10pc dumpling increased price from $9 to $13 on DELIVEROO. Ridiculous 40% increase in price.

Original review:
Really umami soup mee hon kueh - a rare find in AMK.  Fried dumplings is also one of the best I've eaten. Ordered like 10 times in past 2 months on deliveroo. Chili given was generous too. Delicious üòãüòãüòãview",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114983945152024233237/reviews
Benjamin Tong,5,"Probably the best Mee Hoon Kueh you can get in this area and maybe the entire AMK GRCüòçüòç The dough is hand pulled into pieces and tossed into the aromatic broth. You can request the lady boss to make your Mee Hoon Kueh to be Al Dante or fully cooked. Add in Flavourful mince pork, spinach and crunchy ikan billis! Best of all, she add in a half boiled egg into your bowl! All these put together and look at it dancing in the broth. Served hot!

They also sells egg trio spinach and fried dumplings.

I love both the dry and soup version of this Mee Hoon Kueh. Recommend to come here and try.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114917436581267790072/reviews
Stanley,4,"Handmade Mee Hoon Kway found at this coffeeshop. These hand torn pieces were chewy and definitely better than those machine made. Soup was anchovy and egg flavored, which felt very homely. Recommended to give it a try.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109779294020772182875/reviews
Stanley SNG,5,"Ordered the dry mee hoon kueh @ $5.50. Lovely handmade mee hoon kueh with a solid sauce base that's flavorful but not too salty. The ""onsen"" egg was a pleasant surprise and added texture to the bowl. Good lunch.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103509652192563442316/reviews
