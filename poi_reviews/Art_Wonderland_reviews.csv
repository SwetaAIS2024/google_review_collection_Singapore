Jocelyn Yap,5,"My son truly enjoys his art class at Art Wonderland! We joined Art Wonderland in April 2023, and I've seen a remarkable transformation. Initially, he was reserved in class, but now he independently explores materials and uses techniques he has learned. He's even shown a keen interest in learning more about different drawing methods at home!

I appreciate how Teacher Grace is always welcoming and patient. She is open-minded, allowing the children to incorporate their interests into their art while applying the techniques they learn in class. The unique art pieces the kids create every lesson are truly impressive!

The excursions and exhibitions throughout the year also provide an eye-opening experience for the children. These activities elevate their art experience and allow them to see their work displayed in a gallery, showcasing their achievements.

Thank you for making art so enjoyable and inspiring for the children!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109961000699768395631/reviews
Danielle Wong,5,"My girl has been attending classes at Art Wonderland for more than a year. The curriculum is very interesting as different medium is used for each class like acrylic, water colours, chalk, ink, etc and the works they have created are not just drawing or painting. They can create models, clay art, trinkets and many more. And teacher Lena is very knowledgeable and patient. Instead of just diving into an art piece, she will explain the theme, how to use the different materials to bring out the different effects, etc. Strongly recommend this art school.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115045956170702695891/reviews
Alice Lee,5,"My daughter joined Art Wonderland since April 2023 and has never once reject to go for her art class. It is engaging, creative and the class allowed her to be exposed with a lot of art materials that we can’t provide her at home. Teacher Grace is god sent and she is very patient with all the children. I’m glad I’ve found this school/class online. ❤️",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109534773319217385656/reviews
Marilyn Lee,5,"My kids love going to art classes here. Each child will do their own art pieces according to the theme instead of a fix drawing or art worksheet. The school will organize excursion to museums and subsequent lesson will be based on the museum themes.

The whole group of teachers are also patient and friendly. They constantly give us update on the kids progress.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103496061164264914567/reviews
WP T,5,"We have been with Art Wonderland for years.  My son fell in love with it when he attended a Christmas holiday art workshop back in 2019 (which we got to know at Affordable art fair).  He has had various teachers and has zero complaints about the them.  They are nurturing and even if they are firm which they need to be to manage the class, he never felt it was overboard.  We love that the school has taken their art beyond the confines of the class; there were mini exhibitions, even a story book of their works! At art exhibitions, the kids get to see their artwork being displayed e.g collaboration with affordable art fair - it is an eye opener for the kids;  they see people (apart from their forever home supporters) touching feeling and commenting on their art.  The school also incorporates technology into art.  One exhibition was such that you can scan the art's Qr code and view a small narration from the little artist on his / her inspiration!
Thank you to all the teachers that ever taught my son, Teacher Lena & Teacher Grace, Teacher Stacey  to name a few - the team at Art wonderland is great!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110468596660461701834/reviews
