Lau Chorng Wey,1,"DO NOT BUY PROPERTY HERE! The management office does nothing at all. Some maintenance works take several months to complete. The roof maintenance work takes almost half year still not completed and the elevator always malfunctioned. And some rules are ridiculous, eg: my friend’s car cannot park overnight at the visitor’s parking spot. So what’s the purpose of the visitor parking spot? The space there so empty and yet not allowed someone to park overnight.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115450226391503882422/reviews

Chon Chat Tock,5,Beautiful and serene location. My newfound gem which offers quality food and excellent service. Truly one of the best place for great food and relaxation. One has to come here to experience it. If you are looking for hustle and bustle of things then I suggest you head for JB. This is a place for relaxation of the mind and to slow things down.

kopihao,3,"Nice night view, quite a selling point for hotel nearby but still not happening leisure place as Clarke Quey Singapore. The lakeside view could have more light decor and activity.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108442978615987987640/reviews
