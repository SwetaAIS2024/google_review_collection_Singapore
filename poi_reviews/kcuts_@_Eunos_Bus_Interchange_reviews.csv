huixian,1,"Just had a haircut at this outlet by Jennifer. Before i even get a chance to sit down, she was hounding me about entering the lucky draw by giving her 5 stars on the app. I couldn’t find it on the app and even showed her but she just keeps on asking me to do it. When i finally sat down, she used a shaver that still has the  previous customer’s hair on it. It’s obvious because it’s white hair on a black shaver. The entire haircut was very uncomfortable too as she does a very rough cut. I just can’t wait to get out of the shop. When i check it back at home, it’s so uneven i wanted to go to another salon to cut it again. It’s disappointing since i’ve been a regular customer at various kcuts outlet including this one at eunos, previous haircut by alan. Be warned if you see Jennifer there",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113491982440438747993/reviews
