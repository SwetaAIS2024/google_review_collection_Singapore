Nomnomnoted,4,"Cocktail Paradise: A Must-Visit for Drink Lovers

If you’re after a one-of-a-kind drinking experience in Singapore, this is the place to be! I’ve visited multiple times, and the creativity of the mixologists never fails to amaze me.

Here’s the magic: just share your choice of liquor, preferred flavors, and vibe (refreshing, sour, sweet, tropical—you name it), and they’ll craft a unique cocktail tailored just for you. My first visit? I asked for a berry, lime, and gin-based experience, and they created six incredible variations—tropical, refreshing, and more. They even handed me a box of fresh raspberries. Talk about going the extra mile!

Though the vegetarian food options are limited, the drinks alone are worth the trip.

Katie Kozuki,5,"This cocktail bar is a true hidden gem!  It's tucked away in an unassuming, casual space overlooking the colorful Haji Lane (look for the stairwell to the right of Habibi-san!).  There's no set cocktail menu, so come with your ideas and  preferences, and head mixologist Dave and his team will craft a custom cocktail to your liking.  Literally every drink I had was well-balanced, delicious, and really reflected the notes I had given.  You can order food off the Habibi-san! menu, which is a fusion of Middle Eastern and Japanese flavors - and it all works surprisingly well together.  I had the roasted brussel sprouts  with bonito, mentaiko labne with tobiko, babaganoush, and several kushiyaki skewers (pork jowl and chicken hearts) - and it was all delicious.  You can't go wrong with a place that melds exceptional cocktails, tasty food, and truly friendly + fun staff (Kalai and Dave were so memorable!) - I highly recommend this!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115646419272736659461/reviews
Duck,4,"I visited Bar Stories, a bar located on the second floor of a restaurant-bar combo. While I didn’t try the food, the dishes at neighboring tables looked quite appealing, and the place was packed, so reservations are definitely a must. Fortunately, we were able to secure a spot just 30 minutes before arriving and were seated at the bar counter.

One of Bar Stories’ defining features is that they don’t have a drinks menu, which allows the bartenders to get creative. While this could imply a higher level of craftsmanship, the result didn’t quite live up to the hype. We ordered two drinks, both of which were visually impressive—one with a flaming fruit garnish and another topped with a torched marshmallow. However, we noticed that the bartender repeated the same dramatic touches for multiple drinks throughout the night, which made the experience feel a bit less special. For the $30 price tag per drink, I had expected a more unique or personalized experience.

The bar was busy, and service was a little slow, but overall, the atmosphere was decent. It’s a place with a lot of potential, but the repetitiveness of the drink presentation took away from the novelty.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117904743162254979692/reviews
