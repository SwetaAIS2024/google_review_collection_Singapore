Debbie L,2,"The treatments at Aimin are quite good, and the staff are quite professional. However, booking sessions after signing a package can be challenging (even booking 1 to 2 months ahead). Weekend morning slots are often reserved for regulars, making it difficult for others to get appointments at preferred times. If you have a fixed schedule, this could be frustrating. While the quality of service is decent, I hope they can improve their booking system to be more inclusive and fair for all package holders.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117162129832783059775/reviews
