      "text": "Our daughter has been attending Brighton Montessori and we've had a very positive experience overall. The teachers are caring and attentive, and the Montessori approach has helped her become more confident and independent. She enjoys going to school and is always excited to share what she’s learned. The environment is clean and well-organized. Would love to see more variety in enrichment activities, but overall a great foundation for early learning",

My nephew always comes home happy and always has stories (that happen between him and Ms Nicole) to tell about throughout his day. He has learned so much and also had a big boost in his confidence and social skills! Good job teachers!",
