Emeli Mathieu,5,"Solace really saved my life. I was not sure about going to treatment in an unknown location but once I arrived I didn’t want to leave. I was surprised to know some of the clinical staffs are Singaporeans and I felt closer to home. The clinical team was very caring and professional and the treatment center is beautiful. The aftercare team stayed in touch with me every month now after I completed the program. Out there, I know I am not alone. I’m almost a year sober now and the only regret I have was how wished I had gone sooner to Solace Sabah.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708434052757066049/reviews

Errol Madsen,5,I was very impressed with the program that Solace Sabah provided for me. The entire clinnical staff is very knowledgable and extremely helpful. The counselors focussed on the deepest issues I had and camp up with a personal plan for me to tackle these. It was definitely a great new experience for me as I learned how to deal with sobriety and the hardships that I may face going into unhealthy environments when leaving treatment program. I would certainly recommend this center to Singaporeans!,8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115010984276569831012/reviews
