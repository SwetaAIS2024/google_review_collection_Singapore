Mason Tay,4,"M&S Café is my all-time favourite for a quick take away coffee. That’s hardly any space to sit and enjoy a coffee but the free seating high chairs are there in case you need a seat to sip your latte. There are lotsa pastries, muffins and shortbreads to go with your coffee.

My favourite are the cookies and shortbreads as they make a great combination with coffee.

This place gets very busy sometimes so don’t expect a friendly barista like Starbucks.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108195777674730720034/reviews
