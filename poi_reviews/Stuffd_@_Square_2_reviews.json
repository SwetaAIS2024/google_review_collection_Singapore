      "text": "I’m extremely disappointed with my recent order of chicken kebabs. The portion size was shockingly small, far less than what I’ve received in the past. For the price I paid, this is unacceptable and feels like a rip-off. The taste was decent, but the quantity left me frustrated and unsatisfied. If this is the new standard, I won’t be ordering again. It’s a shame to see a decline in both value and quality. I expect better from this establishment and urge them to reconsider their portion sizes if they want to keep loyal customers",

      "text": "This was the worst experience I’ve ever had with this restaurant. I ordered a chicken kebab, but what I received was closer to a veggie kebab with a few pathetic scraps of chicken thrown in. The portion size was laughable, and for the price, it's an absolute scam. It's insulting to think they expect customers to be satisfied with this disaster of a meal. I feel completely ripped off. This is unacceptable, and I expect compensation for this poor excuse of an order. Fix your standards or lose loyal customers for good",
