The food are fresh and well presented.\nThe overall experience was awesome. üëçüëçüëç\n\nWe ordered Salmon Mentaiyaki Bento, Unagi Chasoba Bento, Hokkaido Hotate mentai pasta and the Sashimi platter - 7 types of sashimi with Hokkaido Uni. The Bento set was well portioned and delicious. The Sashimi is fresh and juicy. The uni melted in the mouth.",

The staff were pleasant and helpful and were knowledgeable on their menu items\n\nOrdered the dinner set which comes with a dessert at the end. The portion seems huge for small eaters but surprisingly it was just nice. Highlights are that Sushi was fresh and the chaqanmishi favours with real crab meat was exceptional.\n\nOverall food and dining is great and will visit in the near future.",

Shoutout to their miso soup that was light, refreshing and included other ingredients such as konnyaku. Dumplings paled in comparison to the Salmon Skin which I would order again!",
