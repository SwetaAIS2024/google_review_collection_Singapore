Timothy Utteridge,5,"Chicken waffle (huge, filling, crispy slab of chicken on a soft perfect waffle), truffle fries (crispy and cheesy), truffle pasta (like carbonara, creamy, mushroom and bacon bits, really enjoyed this), black coffee (great brew, a little fruity, a little sweet, a little bitter). Service and food quick and sharp. Recommended for an all day brunch.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112984146789151884811/reviews
Ying Jie Han,5,"I've been coming here for years and just realised I haven't written a review! Well, it's a hidden gem in the Beauty World area with a lovely, cozy, yet vibrant vibe, with food that never disappoints and coffee that always blows me away! I come here a lot to do work on my laptop, and always end up spending a couple of hours here, complete with a full meal and drink. The staff are always friendly and welcoming as well :) I think I've made it clear, Revelry is great!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105854703119460047322/reviews
Max Chan,5,"“THIS IS THE BEST CAFE FOOD I’VE EVER HAD” - my mother in-law, several times that day

Max,5,"One word: Wow. I've never actually been served a big breakfast that was ACTUALLY big. Amazing presentation, food was absolutely lovely, super big juicy tomatoes, everything was BIG. Waffles were so tasty. Such nice staff and cozy atmosphere, I was impressed! A pretty hidden cozy café that more people should patronise. Thanks for the generous meal! I enjoyed every second of it.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116649591777141754932/reviews
Paul Toh,5,"Nice and quiet place to come out for a brunch. Brunch is served all day here. The waffle chicken was huge! Took 2 persons to finish. The pulled pork sando is tasty too. Food is really good here and coffee is also on point.
It’s a tad pricier than the other joints here but you can usually find a seat here and it’s quieter than the other joints on the same street.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110110584107240453374/reviews
