C L,4,"Served by a friendly Indian manager who refilled our drinks promptly and checked in to ensure everything was perfect.
It was a swarmed Friday evening and she solely handled by herself. What a gem employee!

We enjoyed the kashmiri naan ...tandoori chicken and Everest masala tea.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118360531237975759196/reviews

Sadthecat,3,"The place is small and cozy, the server was polite and gave us a free basket of poppadoms and water.

I got the chicken biryani and chicken momos.
The chicken biryani ($12.90) is nice and a bit spicy and the portion was generous

But I can't say the same for the chicken momos (8pc for $12), it was the saddest dumpling I've ever had. The momos have thick skin, very little filling and are quite tasteless.

The overall experience was very average because I ordered one of the not so nice items on the menu so I don't want to judge the overall restaurant too harshly, there might be some good items like the biryani.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112190744428413974148/reviews
