jair smits,5,"Very good Nasi Lemak Rendang with additional Sayur Lodeh. Perhaps the best Sayur Iâ€™ve had in Singapore in past 10 years. Rendang meat was good quality too!
I was glad to come just before peak hour (12:30); there was a queue afterwards which does justice to the quality of food.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102401699783013732733/reviews
Josephine Tan,5,"IVINS Bukit Timah (Post-Reno Visit)

1st visit after the reno â€¦ space is smaller but has a fresh, clean look. Menuâ€™s more compact now, but thatâ€™s alright.

The meal? A definite win.
Babi Pongteh was the star ðŸ¤©â€¦ tender & full of flavour. Loved the sambal potato leaves (a nice change from kang kong) â€” tasty without being too salty or oily. The Assam fish with ladyâ€™s fingers was also good.

Yes, Iâ€™ll be back to try the other signature dishes.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112348698048907176645/reviews
Samuel Lam,5,"Finally we are back for a great luncheon.

Love the new renovated place, feels very cosy but gets crowded over weekends. The food is like the good ole times and still is delicious.

Service is homely and prompt.

Our fav weekend perankan fix.

Enjoy.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103278705053675847980/reviews
Ben Teo,3,"Came during lunch on weekday and there were plenty of seats.
Ambience was somewhat old skool but cozy. Had the feel of a long run establishment.

We ordered the ayam buah keluak,
Honey chicken, sambal kang kong, chendol and bobo char char.

Food was alright and servings are small. Only 2 buah keluak seeds in the dish. We found it to be on the salty side. Desserts are not their strong point so will not recommend it.

Peranakan food is not readily available in sg, would come back again.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113516373342190358380/reviews
Rayant Yeo,5,"The more people you bring, the more dishes you can indulge. Very challenging to decide which dishes to order because too many dishes to choose from; furthermore, all are equally delicious!!

It offers small portion size so that you have space in your stomach to try other dishes.

You might wonder after having such a delicious and savoury dishes, you will burn a hole in your wallet? Fret not, it is priced reasonably. I paid about $85 for these dishes shared by 2 persons.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111160799570934501810/reviews
