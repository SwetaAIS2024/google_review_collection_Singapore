Lee Hong Rui,5,"This is a hidden gem in Bukit Batok/Hillview Area. It’s the only 24 hours Muslim Prata food stall operating in the area. The nearest alternative is the stretch at Beauty world which is always overcrowded, and those shops still close around 3am..

This 24hr coffeeshop is hidden inside a industrial building, facing the backroad so no one outside will notice it. You have ample parking here and never have to worry about waiting for lots like beauty world.

I work in the same building hence has the chance to try a number of their dishes, below are my reviews

Prata: Always freshly made to order, unlike outside stalls that have many plain Prata displayed there. The onion Prata is legit the most filled union Prata I have ever ate in singapore. They are not stingy with the amount of ingredients they put..

The Prata texture is just nice, dough is not too hard or overly chewy.. just nice and fragrant. The curry sauce is also sufficiently thick and nice..

The fried rice taste is reasonable, for the price you pay which is below what outside coffeeshop stalls charge, this is good value for money

Mee goreng is very tasty and also very spicy. Really love the complexity of the flavour.. if you prefer the chicken to have no bones, remember to ask them to debone for you first.

Today I was eating their mee goreng and they actually came to ask for my feedback. I told them about the bones and spiciness and they immediately said the next time they will make it better for me without bones and just a bit of spiciness.. it’s really hard to find such good customer service here in singapore for a coffeeshop stall.. I can genuinely tell they are very passionate in their work and truly want every customer to enjoy their food.. this is the first Muslim stall that treat me so well and ask for my feedback so I highly recommend it

Mee goreng $5.50
Ice coffee $1.50

Their expenses for operating 24 hours can be very high and hence I hope this review can help support their business and make this hidden gem known to more living in Bukit Timah, Bukit Batok, Clementi, hillview area..",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106821399237004595007/reviews
Peter Tan,5,"Probably the best prata shop. The pratas are fluffy, crispy, well spread out, not too thick and taste yummy. The curry is tasty as well. The drink stall's teh tarik and teh aria are nice and not to sweet nor overwhelming. Prices are reasonable, just that accessibility may be an issue if not driving. Definitely have to try if you haven't yet to.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108268972673669585561/reviews
