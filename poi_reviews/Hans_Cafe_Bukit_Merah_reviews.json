      "text": "First time to dine. Place is conveniently located in connection one building. Price is on the high side. We have tried the set meal that comes with drinks and soup.\n\nMushroom soup was bland with mushroom taste. Just a thick, creamy soup with Chopped Mushroom. It was hot, though, which is good. The garlic  bread, I supposed, was so thin and hard.\n\nRice was undercooked, as can be seen in the photo. It was harder than it's supposed to. The hainanese pork chop was bland and dry. The sauce was more of like sweet and sour. Chicken curry was very ordinary.\n\nThe exhaust in the place was not so good either. The smell in the kitchen is all over the place, which stick to our clothes after.\n\nOverall, nothing was good. Price is on the high end for its quality. Except maybe the service. It was kinda assertive and good.",
