It seems like this place is quite popular among airline staff.\n\nThe food was excellent. I had the green chicken curry on one visit and noodles on another. Both were delicious, nicely spiced, and generous in portion size. The price was fair for the quality and quantity of the food.\n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great Thai food.",

The prawn seemed undercooked as well, which is unacceptable. Even the tom yum soup was overloaded with salt. This is really poor quality, and I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone.",

      "text": "There is a dedicated menu just for vegetarians, with super wide range of options and delicious authentic thai flavours. Really accessible from Suntec area. Highly recommend their Green Curry & Thai Mango Salad that was refreshing & tangy. Good for both group and individual meals. But restaurant interior lighting can be quite dim. Along the shophouses so its expected that there is not much seating space, but sufficient- since unable to reserve seats, seats availability depends on timing you visit.\nProbably price of a zichar store",
