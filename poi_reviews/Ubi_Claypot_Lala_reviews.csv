samlivestoeat,4,"Comforting and satisfying meal! We can choose from a wide variety of fresh ingredients to complement the flavourful lala soup! My personal favourites are tiger prawn, shabu shabu beef, scallop, fish slice, chicken slice, burst ball and shiitake.

Jack,3,Saw on TikTok and decided to pay a visit. The lala broth is pretty good but feels like the clams are rather small and the shells took up a lot of space in the small pot. The ingredients are fairly fresh and also fairly priced. Beef slices are fatty perfect for hotpot. The prawn paste was also very fresh. Broth is refillable self service so it's good. The environment can be rather stuffy with the hot fire and smoke sometimes get in your face. Maybe sitting in the open will be better. We paid $75 for 2 adults and 1 kid which is alright I think.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288565584051666357/reviews

J Y,4,"Tried the lala soup pot, the clams are fresh but bit small. The rest of the ingredients which include pork belly, fish paste, mushroom, and vege were all fresh as well. Price is a bit on the high side but quite reasonable, total around $50 for lala pot, 2 vege, 1 mushroom, 1 pork and 1 fish paste. They also provide free flow soup refill and hua tiao!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113206062513146064024/reviews
