The wait time was reasonable, and I was seen by Dr. Darshana, who was professional and thorough in his assessment. He took the time to listen to my symptoms and provided clear advice on the treatment plan. Overall, I had a positive experience, and I appreciate the care provided.",

Despite waiting for nearly two hours, I was informed around 9.15pm that the doctor had to leave due to an urgent matter. This left me and several other patients unattended\n\nWhile I understand that unforeseen circumstances may arise, the lack of proactive communication was disappointing.The clinic staff should have informed us earlier if there was a possibility that the doctor would be unable to see all the patients (the clinic operations hour is end at 9pm) This would have allowed us to make alternative arrangements instead of waiting unnecessarily.",

I don't know what he was doing inside the office alone for so long. Hope the management will look into this. Otherwise, we patients should just stay away.",
