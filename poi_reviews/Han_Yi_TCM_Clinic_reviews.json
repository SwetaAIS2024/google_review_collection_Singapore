      "text": "I injured my shoulder and knee while sliding down a long slide with my kids. My right shoulder was so swollen that I had difficulty lifting it up. Went to this TCM doctor hidden in a Chinese medical hall. The TCM Doctor was very friendly and even offered me a pot tea as I waited outside for my turn.\n\nI did acupuncture for my knee and the doctor did a cupping to release blood from my swollen shoulder. After the treatment I can actually lift up my right arm! Total treatment time is about 1hr.\n\nAs per the TCM doctor it is due to internal bruising.\n\nTip: Do make appointment before going as there is usually a small crowd of elderly.",
