Rarely I get nasi lemak set under $4 nowadays.\n\nThe sambal is shiok.\nThe rice is fragrant with the right amount of coconut milk flavour.\nThe fried chicken wing is flavourful to the bone.\n\nMy only feedback is that the foodcourt is quite warm in the morning.\n\nThe uncle and auntie serving the food are also warm and friendly folks.\n\nThis place is located at Level 4 Sin Ming Autocare by the way.",
