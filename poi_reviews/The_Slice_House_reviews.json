To make matters worse, it wasn’t just the pizza—everything seemed to be frozen food passed off as fresh, and the prices were outrageous for what we got. If I’m paying premium prices, I expect fresh, quality food, not reheated frozen meals. Definitely not worth it, and I won’t be coming back.",

We settled on their What é Duck pizza, which was Chef's Kiss combined with red wine! It was delicious and flavorful. A perfect meal to share with friends and family on a chil day. Can't wait to go back and try their other dishes!",
