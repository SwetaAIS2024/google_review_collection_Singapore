      "text": "This staff member, who refused to provide his name, was extremely rude and dishonest about pricing. Typically, a vegetable-only portion without rice costs a minimum of $2, with a larger portion priced at $2.70. However, today he charged us $3 for what was clearly a $2 portion. When we asked for clarification, he responded with a bad attitude and even used vulgar language.\n\nHis own colleague even commented, “他就是很吝啬，全部人都知道” (He is very stingy; everyone knows it).\n\nThis is not my first time buying from this stall—I’m a regular customer, purchasing food here at least 2–3 times a week. I am very familiar with the usual prices and portion sizes, so I know for a fact that today’s charge was unfair. This kind of service is unacceptable. I hope Chang Cheng management takes appropriate action to ensure better customer service.",

      "text": "Don't ever order cai fan here. This stall marks gong bao chicken as a premium item ($2)but there is barely any meat, mostly batter and gluten. In fact most Chang Cheng stalls do this now. Coat their fried meat with mostly batter and gluten and there are scarcely any meat in them. Horrible experience.\n\nThey also started adding meat scraps to their mushroom so they can charge meat price. Cheap meat and veg are only nearer to the cashier so they're easier to miss. It is much cheaper (or more value for money) to eat at any other stall in this coffee shop aside from the cai fan",
