To my delight, there are still shops catering to hobbyists, and the people I've talked to are both helpful and friendly. They will suggest parts, alternatives, if you're not sure what you are looking for. It sure beats ordering parts online, even if I have to pay a bit more. And knowing I'm getting what I need instead of \"oh I'll order this just in case\" I'm likely saving money.",
