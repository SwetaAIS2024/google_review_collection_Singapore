      "text": "My all time favourite drink stall. Freshly made soya bean milk and bean curd. Soya bean milk sweetness is just right. Bean curb is silky smooth with perfect sweetness!\n\nThis is my first time trying out mixed soya bean and grass jelly. Interesting combination, not too sweet, not bad not bad!\n\nBest of all, the price is so much cheaper than other places. $0.80 for each item.\n\nPack a hot soya bean milk $0.80 yield 700ml. Good deal!\n\n25 Sep 2023\nEnquired from fishball hawker owner about this soya bean outlet. Apparently uncle had a fall recently. Good news is he has fully recovered. Since the hawker will be undergoing renovation in early October, uncle decided to take a break to rest and will be back after the renovation is completed, tentatively end of year, 2023.\nLooking forward for it! üòã",
