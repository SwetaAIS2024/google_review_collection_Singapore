However, I would recommend to make shelter as this stand will be exposed to sun and it will be quite warm.\n\nThe beach was very close to our stand, one thing has to be careful as there are broken glasses on the beach. Better do not go with bare foot.\n\nOur stand was not cleaned beforehand as there was leftover ash - others are cleaned. Not sure it was supposed to be clean or not. Overall still a good place.",

Super hard to book grab cause itâ€™s vv into ECP but good and peaceful BBQ pits it u drive, the bbq pits are also a walk away from the nearest carpark and not much shelter around, nearest toilet also abit far from 70 and below pits",
