Zachariah Jones,4,"Rojak is amazing. The red gravy is really good with the rojak. I‚Äôm not someone who likes Mee Kuah, however the portion and the ingredients and flavour is really good. So I‚Äôm happy I got to try it there. Price is more expensive than your usual coffee shop rojak. Even for drinks like teh or Milo.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105372704477553222680/reviews
Leslie Seah (bluerabbit),5,"If you enjoy Indian Rojak‚Ä¶ yum yum yum.  Super yum. Food is fresh but the gravy is where the magic happens.
I live the prawn offerings. Especially the crispy fritters (top left corner). Super crispy and the texture soaks up the gravy for an eruption of flavors in the mouth.

The mee goreng wasn‚Äôt shabby either but serving portion little disappointing.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116393990607644003981/reviews

Indian Mamak food stall was very popular recently, many new similar Indian eatery open Islandwide. Especially they are now upgrade to more franchise looks with clean and standardized modern meal experience.

Located at commercial building with air-conditioned, this pretty new Indian Mamak eatery provide wide variety of food selections and seats. Pick your favorite Rojak items, send it to counter and make all other food orders and collect calling device and pay upon food collection. But beverage counter at the right side you have to order, pay and collect on the spot.

As for the foods, I do like my Maggi Mee Goreng, an fried instant noodle with mutton. Yes. Very well stir-fry, not oily, got good wok-hey. Flavourful and not over seasoning. Simple balance and fragrance. Loved it.

For their popular Indian Rojak, I don't taste fantastic but just good. Lots of Rojak selections, it was clean and well fried. Not all are good, I am only like some of it, especially fried onions dough, it was delicious!

As for rest of the Rojak items, pretty common, can tell not specially fresh made, or maybe leave it for hours. Their chilli gravy was just okay, not outstanding. If you really like Indian Rojak, I must say, the best Indian Rojak in Singapore, still the two at West Coast Drive, they tucked at Ayer Rajah Food Centre. Try it if you have chance. But I can't deny that this AI Mahboob Rojak is much cleaner and more hygienic.

As last, their beverage, Ice Teh Tarik, it was very common, no tea pulling (Teh Tarik) action at all even I mentioned it. Charging at $3.30 is way too expensive. Not worth it. Teh Tarik no Tarik. So shame.

Overall, $6.50 for fried instant noodle with little mutton meat. Delicious and worthy.
Then 4 items of Indian Rojak at $8.70. Fair. But can be better.
Ice Teh Tarik with Tarik cost $3.30. Not worth it.
Total cost $18.50. $$$$

Honestly, Not recommended to pay a special visit. Unless you stay around that area.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111255682252678932891/reviews
Caroline Chan,4,"One of the few places that sells fresh & good quality Indian rojak. Nice, we had a large plate of fritters, fried bee hoon, soup kambing meats onlyüëçüôè. The fritters were fresh, crisy n yumz. The sauce could b less starchy and a little stronger & sweeter. On d whole, still good. Thanks.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115821823856278752753/reviews
Liyana L,5,"Super crispy Indian Rojak with a really tasty dipping sauce! The prawn fritters were my absolute favourite, along with the onion / shallot fritters. Presentation was good, everything was fried really well, and definitely worth coming back for.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114246289462574472150/reviews
