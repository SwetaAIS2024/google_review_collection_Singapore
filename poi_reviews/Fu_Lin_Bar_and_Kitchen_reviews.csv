Skye Cai,5,"Very unique experience for the Yong tau foo.
Fixed price for 6 pieces with thick bee Hoon noodle and with the meat gravy.
All the ingredients are fresh.
The Tofu is a must to order. after deep fried, with crispy skin and soft inner.
The bitter gourd is fresh and thick cutting. A little bitter but goes very well with the fish cakes.
Other fried items such as the fish cakes are amazing. The beancurd skins  of the fish cakes are like the handmade.
Very fast servicing speed, almost no wait for the food despite the queue.
In the morning it’s the Yong tau foo shop, at night it changes to the bar and kitchen.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
Jelita Jade Jaimon,4,"ordered the western chicken which was delicious!

other than that, we ordered the lobster paofan and the spicy sichuan dumplings (presumably hong you chao shou). the lobster paofan was average, but lacked a depth of flavour. the dumplings were mostly pure spiciness.

good service and atmosphere!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116549245882277745229/reviews
Hong Wei,4,"Dropped by in the evening when it operates a a bar. Ordered the carrot cake and yong tau foo. Both were absolutely amazing. Drinks were decent too.

The only discomfort I have is that the waitress is overly attentive and cleared the empty plates and cups the moment we finished it. It almost felt like they were hinting for us to leave as soon as we are done. But we were the only customers in the indoor sitting area…",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109534007215691056051/reviews
Kenny Yap,3,"Finally tried this place which was just a short walk from office. At 12pm, there was the usual long lunch crowd. It took about 20mins or so to get to the front of the queue where you select your ingredients and proceed to pay at the counter. They provide you a buzzer but you can just wait beside because it was super fast. The process was quite smooth and fast.

Minimum 6 pcs and you choose the type of carbs be it noodle or rice and soup or dry, the latter comes with a meat sauce. I selected 10 ingredients but one was a ‘counted as 3’ so total came up to $15+.

You should get a seat first before ordering, we managed to do so while in the queue.

Food was everything was fried, and drenched in a meat sauce, so it was nice yet felt super unhealthy. And after awhile everything felt repetitive since it’s all the same sauce.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105256927610815725781/reviews

One of my fav YTF. It’s a must to get dry and noodles as the meat sauce with minced meat is so delicious as it drizzles over the ytf and noodles.

They even re fry the ytf for you",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117334333033013121014/reviews
