The procedures, including the scopes, were smooth and handled with great care.\n\nThe clinic staff were just as impressive. They took the initiative to list down important points for me to remember, scheduled future appointments efficiently, and provided useful reminders to keep me on track. The entire experience seamless and reassuring.\n\nHighly recommend Dr. Lee and his team for anyone looking for excellent gut care!",

He is also customer focused, knowing I am sensitive to standard sedation, he modified the sedation to make the procedure comfortable for me without major side effect after the procedure. Really appreciate the effort to make my latest procedure a smooth one.",
