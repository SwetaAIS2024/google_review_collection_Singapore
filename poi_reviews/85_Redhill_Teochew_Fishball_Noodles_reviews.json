      "text": "Great tasting fishball noodles. Better than most other fishball noodles here in SG, but not one of the most outstanding ones. Best to request for “less oil” if you prefer your noodles meal to be ‘not too oily’. Otherwise, the noodles are a great staple for the fishballs and fishcakes that are included in the meal.",

Overall, the service provided to me was very good and I would love to try these other delightful dishes from other Encik Tan outlets in the future.",
