Ling Ho,4,"Fish steamboat- $35 which is full of veggies, fresh fish (three types to choose from), yam. The soup at the start tastes a bit bland but it deepens in flavour after a while. I liked the soup cos its flavourful and doesnt feel like there's much msg. Plus i liked that its ""clean"" - cos many other fish soup gets ""dirty"" due to remnants from other ingredients.

Sambal kangkong fairly decent. It was well cooked, the stems were crunchy.

Oyster egg- this was a pleasant surprise. On menu it looked normal but in reality the omelette was cooked in Thai street style.

Prices are reasonable; the total is just slightly above $60. For zichar in food court concept and also with aircon - I will return to try other dishes.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104662213360280912898/reviews
Boon Leong,4,"Went there on Sunday dinner.
Park at East carpark & go up by escalator to level 2.
Look for the signage that indicate 20.
1st find your own & then queue to order.
There is only 1 cashier or just 1 POS machine.  It’s formed a queue….they need to improve with QR ordering.
Waited 45 mins for the 1st dish to be served.
Thereafter the rest of the dishes are served promptly
Liked the steamboat broth flavorful with yam & umi. The rest of the dishes are tasty as well.
Pricing is reasonable",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118439101019407877742/reviews
Jesyn Ong,5,"We had an amazing dining experience at Tian Wai Tian Fishhead Steamboat—a true gem that has stood the test of time since 1983! Their signature Teochew-style fish head steamboat was a standout—comforting, flavorful, and filled with fresh fish and vegetables in a rich, savory broth that warms the soul.

We also tried the Sambal Lala, which was incredibly tasty with just the right amount of spice, and the Tofu Prawns—a delightful dish with silky tofu and juicy prawns bathed in a fragrant, savory sauce.
Every dish was well-executed and full of flavor.

The staff were friendly and attentive, and the restaurant had a bright, welcoming vibe.
With its delicious food and comforting atmosphere, Tian Wai Tian is perfect for both family dinners and gatherings with friends.

The beautiful flower stands at the entrance added a lovely festive touch. Definitely worth a visit if you’re craving hearty, traditional Teochew steamboat and more!

Highly recommended!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105902379890832527951/reviews
