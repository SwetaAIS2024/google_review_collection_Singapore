SB Lee,5,"Lao Jiang Superior Soup at Anchorvale Village serves comforting, home-style food that really suits my taste. The vinegar pork trotters have a nice balance of richness and tanginess, and the dry tossed hor fun is flavorful with a good sauce. I also enjoyed the double-boiled chicken soup, which felt nourishing and full of depth.

For dessert, the milk pudding with peach gum was light and not too sweet, which I personally liked. The place is quite spacious and gets busy at lunchtime. Overall, I found the food enjoyable and would come back to try more dishes.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113201991939539884601/reviews

Empowering Mindset,3,Good place to have some soup but personally felt just normal soup that we can get at hawker. But their dry source noodles are really good. They have special dry source for that. Addition to that is they have other food that like the pork leg dish.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113009080732159136694/reviews
M. Chen,5,"Came here on a Wednesday evening. First time trying and ordered the Signature Superior Soup with Dry Hor Fun. You can pair the Superior Soup with other noodles/rice but I choose their specialty Dry Hor Fun. The noodle portion was okay for me (some guys may find the portion a bit small). The chili was just fine, not too spicy. Was hoping that the soup bowl will be bigger then can drink more soup. Other than that, no complaints. Sign up for their membership to gain discount off your first purchase and on birthday.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117219980570993006062/reviews
Bryan Fang,5,"Random trying since the place just opened a few days.

Had the signature soup with add-on dry horfun, prawn-paste chicken and an aiyu jelly.

Tasted and felt everything was good. Soup was flavourful. Good portion, mixed of many ingredients for this order.
The dry horfun I went for the spicy choice which was mixed with hae bi hiam (dried shrimp chilli). Delicious, spicy levels not high can add your own red cut chillis. The sauce was good indeed.
Prawn paste chicken was tasty and smell of it is really fragrant. Menu states 6pcs but we were served 7pcs. Good stuff.
Aiyu jelly was served without lime on the side. My god, it was kinda sour on the good side and also some sweetness in it. Thought it was really refreshingly yummy.

Will definitely return to try the other menu items.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114490699769830179262/reviews
