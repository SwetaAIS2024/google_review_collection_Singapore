Not only did she provide an exceptional massage that relieved my tension and stress, but she also went above and beyond by giving me a short tour of the spa and took some lovely photos. Her friendly demeanour and dedication to customer service made my visit memorable. I highly recommend Jane for anyone looking for a skilled and thoughtful massage therapist üòç",

      "text": "I was craving a really good and relaxing massage for stress relief and I was so happy that I got one here :) I called in on the day itself and miraculously managed to get a late afternoon slot for a 1 hr Aramsa Touch massage. My masseuse was Taphine who was absolutely fantastic. I wanted a light/medium tension relief massage and it was exactly that. She also noticed when I was getting slightly uncomfortable during the session (my nose was getting clogged from lying face down haha) and made the necessary adjustments which I appreciated a lot. The whole ambience (lush greenery!), massage rooms, lounge and wash areas were modern, clean and really set the tone for a relaxing atmosphere. Worth every penny and I‚Äôll definitely be returning for future visits :)",

You get choose one essential oil from 3 options for the massage. My masseuse was Sun. She was very attentive and skilled. No hard-sell at all which I found very impressive. Worth pampering yourself or your loved ones here!",
