Came in on time and gotten my tooth fixed in less than 10mins. Price was reasonable for me. The dentist was also very kind to answer some of my questions about other issues regarding my gum and gave good advice.",

I had always felt pain and discomfort in my past experiences with scaling and polishing at other clinics, but I felt little to no pain nor discomfort with Dr Lau, which gave me a very positive experience. Thanks Dr Lau and team for making my session comfortable!",
