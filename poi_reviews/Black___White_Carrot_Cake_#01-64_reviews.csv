LP Pua,3,"We ordered the Black Carrot Cake. While the texture was smooth, the black sauce was not fragrant. If they had used a better black sauce, it would have made for a very good plate of Black Carrot Cake.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
peter SH,4,I have not given any 5 stars but this humble carrot cake stall is close to 5 stars. It's black white combo only $3.50 n if u like me want extra egg only 50 cents more. Black version is a tad too sweet but I still like n white version is tasty with cai por (dried radish bits) worth coming here from afar to try this simply fabulous dish.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105571249217054783261/reviews
JC,5,"5 stars because of old school nostalgia. Been eating this fried carrot cake at the very beginning when it was $1.50, up until now. The white one tastes better as it is crispy and also more consistent. The black one sometimes the sauce is too little and it reduces the taste, but most of the time it is good.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105403312120201214630/reviews

Bosch Xie,4,"Ordered the $4 black carrot cake and the amount was generous. The taste was quite consistent, and the food was still piping hot for takeaway. Not a bad plate of carrot cake, with the right amount of sweetness and fried egg bits. The carrot cake was not too big pieces which would help soak up the taste. 2nd time eating this and the wok hey taste was not as strong as the first time, perhaps it was the long queue on Saturday.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104650723552655383899/reviews
