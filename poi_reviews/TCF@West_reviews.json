      "text": "I am admitted on 20th Feb until 22nd March. During my stay here, I witnessed the nurses here worked very hard. Their patience towards confused and demented patients deserved optimal recommendation. No matter how verbally abusive the patients are towards them, they remained composed and professional especially nurse Elva, who  ran after the demented patient who was trying to run to another ward. I witnessed with my own eyes how verbally abusive patient was to her, with all her might she still show a bright smile to this patient and to other patients like us. She showed her love and tender care to all her patients equally. Since I am a diabetic patient, Elva made sure my insulin timing is accurate, and my food was served timely, to prevent me from having hypoglycaemia, this i really appreciate . Not forgetting Dr Gerald, Dr Ang who provide good medical advice and guidance during my stay. Last but not least the night nurses who looked after me while i sleep like nurse Nakiah, Nurse Rubina, Staff Lilik and Staff Norashima. U guys make me feel at home. Ur warmth and smile make my day. ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ I am going to miss you guys",

I may not be able to mention all the staff that I came across but the few that do their best for the patients there especially the HCAs Farhan, Ken, James, and the staff nurses Andrew ,Nicholas. Towards the night before my discharge, the Management arranged  a campfire by ACS Independent students to bring joy and laughter to the many patients in this facility.\nGreat effort by all and here's wishing one and all a Blessed Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.\nBest Wishes,\nVincent Lee",
