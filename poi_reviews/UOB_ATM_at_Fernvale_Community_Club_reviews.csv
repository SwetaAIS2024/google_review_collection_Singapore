Bosco Lim Hearted Moments,5,"Machine was very rude, but funny. Was keying in my password and it was scolding me each time I press a button. At least it did censor itself with beeps.

Before I end my transaction and receive my card, it give a series of beeps instead of a single one. Till now, I am not sure what have I done wrong to receive so much anger from it.

Anyway, I will come back again to be scolded.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114838669339026162946/reviews
