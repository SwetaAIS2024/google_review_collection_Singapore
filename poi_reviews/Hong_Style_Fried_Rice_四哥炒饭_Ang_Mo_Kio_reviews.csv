Sylar Burns,5,"When it comes to fried rice, I'm a little enthusiastic as it's snacky, yet it keeps me filled up. I'm so excited that I'm eating their fried rice as I'm typing this review lol.

At first it seems like any other stall. No queue during the evening time, and no crowd in the coffeeshop.

After taking the first few bites, The original garlic fried rice with pork chop gives you the familiar flavour of eggy and fragrance of garlic. Don't underestimate the pork chop, it's a huge piece.

The second plate, dark sauce fried rice with fried chicken chop. It is the ultimate favourite and must try for me, as the unami and aroma are through the roof!

If you are not looking for branded restaurants like Din Tai Fung, but yet wants a high quality, good punch of wok hey and aromatic fried rice, this is the place.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113446848821272550655/reviews
Stanley,3,"Generous slices of pork chop in the rice. Each piece of the pork chop was juicy and flavourful. But I personally felt it was a bit too salty for me. Their fried rice was really good, not too dry nor it not too wet, right texture. The service was quick, waiting time wasn't long. Prices was kept affordable too.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109779294020772182875/reviews
Matthew Lee,4,"Tried the Ipoh curry noodles the last time round and saw this stall but was too early and wasn't opened yet. This time went around lunchtime and decided to try after hearing it was opened by some ex DTF chef.
There was no queue but I guess there were quite a lot of orders before me so I waited for like 15 minutes before I collected the fried rice. Only ordered one which was the golden egg fried rice with pork chop. 1st look it looks similar to the one served in DTF, however it lacks the shiny appearance which is good because it tasted less oily than the DTF one. Can't believe the dish was so simple but executed so well. Rice was very well fried and fragrant and the pork chop was a rather big portion. Think its half the price of the restaurant and very worth it!
Would definitely come back again for the other options.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109397825257995094119/reviews
Xian You Lim,5,"Delicious Pork Chop Fried Rice at a very reasonable price! The serving of the pork chop was really generous. Good mix of fats and lean meat in the pork chop led to a chewy yet fulfilling experience. The fried rice was a little oily, but its strong fragrance and taste made up for it. Chili is available on the side, could've been spicier. It's a steal at $6.50!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103392631745003539210/reviews
