They recommended Sylfirm package which costs a 5 figure sum for me and my husband.\n\nAfter more than a year, I see slight improvement of my skin but I still have wrinkles, sagging skin, melasma and dark spots!!\n\nAs it was not effective, they tell you to buy other packages like yellow laser and other treatments. They should have remedy the situation by offering complimentary treatments to treat my skin and turn me to a satisfied customer. Not worth the money spent at all.\n\nUpdate in May 2025:\nPico treatments diminished some of my pigmentation and my pores appeared smaller. Perhaps the business model should provide a variety of treatments based on each customerâ€™s needs and allow customers  change accordingly instead of selling fixed treatment packages.",
