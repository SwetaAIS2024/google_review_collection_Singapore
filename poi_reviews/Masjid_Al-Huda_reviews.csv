Sten (Piqued Wanderer),5,"It was a first for us to travel to Masjid Al-Huda and we were in awe at its simplicity.

To also add, this mosque is part of a trail and is marked as a trail of Kampung Life. We were amazed at how pretty and simple it looked and agreed that this would be the cleaner version of any Mosque in a Village. The layout of toilets, ablution area, entryway, the door placements and more, looked similar to those village mosques in rural areas, in other parts of the world.

We were glad we stopped by and had one of the daily prayers here. Ok, let's go slightly in detail on the mosque itself.

Location:
One of the inner roads, so parking is very limited. It is located along side with the bungalows and terraces that shield it away from tall housing units.

Amenities:
Clean and very well maintained. So whoever is working on the mosque has done a very very excellent job. Fans make the place more cooling. There are also tentage set up, probably to accommodate the increased patronage. Not much public amenities but works sufficiently for a trail.

History:
Mosque construction started from 1925 and the current year is 2024. So it is almost 100 years old! Imagine the background story the mosque has, from the transition from villages, to wars, to SG's independence and more.. this mosque has seen it all.

We definitely would mark this mosque and drop by if we are near the area, for it's serenity and calm feel that we got from praying here. Check out our images..

Zahid Nawaz,3,"One of the centrally located Masjids of Singapore, al-huda is a small, single floor masjid, sufficiently spacious and has an ample ablution space which is clean and covered. Al-huda is located in the Bukit timah area and is one of the oldest masjid of Singapore. Al-huda was built in 1966. At present the only limitation is it’s poor connectivity to public transport as the area is quite residential.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108151676132477654344/reviews

Afifah,5,Went on 7th Apr 2024 for terawih prayers. Nearest mrt to sixth avenue. 2 stops away and 7 mins walking distance. Muslimah prayer hall is fully air conditioned. Very clean mosque & small area. Minimal parking space. Peace and quiet near private estate housing. Would visit again next time.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117364089406463150107/reviews
Abdul Jabbar Kachi,3,"Awesome layout from the outside and well maintain in the inside.
You will feel the calmness once you are in the mosque.
However, the biggest headache will be the parking area.
Once you allow people to park along the roadside,  you are actually creating g annoyance to all OTHER drivers who are driving. It maybe a matter of time, anger may erupt from the other drivers.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111491579706260073591/reviews
