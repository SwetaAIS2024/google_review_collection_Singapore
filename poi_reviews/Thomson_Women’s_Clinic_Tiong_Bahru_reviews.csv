YUTING LI,1,"A few months ago, I went to this clinic because of some pain down there. The doctor just took a quick look and told me I had multiple HPV infections, then prescribed some meds. I wasn’t convinced, so I went to another clinic the same day for proper HPV testing. A week later, the results came back — no HPV at all. Just a heads-up for anyone needing gynecological care: avoid this place, it’s really not professional.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115837303958805388006/reviews
J Hong,5,"This is my first pregnancy and delivery and I am very glad to have Dr Woo as my doctor, who helped make it a reassuring experience. He is kind and calm. Do bring any questions you can think of for appointments.

The staff are pleasant and communicate well. As a plus, it was convenient and efficient to go for appointments during weekday evenings (Mon & Wed).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103084948487873791597/reviews
Serene Yeo,5,"Dr. Woo delivered my baby 4 months ago in May 2023 by natural delivery. He is indeed a man of few words, but he never failed to thoroughly answer my questions. He has this calm demeanour that I find comfort in and at times, his responses catch us by surprise (in a humorous way we thought). Delivery was smooth and stitches were done professionally. Charges were reasonable, and staff are very friendly. Highly recommend Dr. Woo and his team and I would definitely go back should I consider for a second child.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101635419730002916875/reviews
Weiwei,5,Dr. Woo helped delivered both my first and second baby. I like his consultation style a lot - straight to the point and share all the reasonings behind. The evening slots are perfect since I don’t have to take leaves. The stitches were done very nicely. I would definitely recommend him.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107923081872478780652/reviews
Sandy Tran,5,"I had my 2nd cesarean delivery 5 weeks ago and I am very glad to have Dr Woo as my doctor, who also helped to deliver my first child and now 2nd child. He did a fantastic job on my deliveries. I felt that I recovered well after giving births. Dr Woo is very patience and answer any queries that i have. Beside that, clinic staff is very pleasant and helpful. Thank you for the smooth experiences. I and my husband definitely choose this place for my next pregnancy if we are blessed.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113737162018060783124/reviews
