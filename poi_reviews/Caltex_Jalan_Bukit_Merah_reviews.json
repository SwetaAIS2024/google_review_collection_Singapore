      "text": "The car workshop at caltex isn't honest. I went in with a punctured tyre. The Indian worker told me they charge $15 for repairing and I agreed. But after pulling out the nail, it was realised that it couldn't be repaired due to the placement. Then came a Chinese man in his late 40(slighty bald and slightly short) telling me he need to check the price of the tyre if I want a replacement. And I agreed. After afew minutes, he informed me that I need to get 2 tyres and they don't sell in one. Which I told him to go ahead for the repair so that I can get to my regular workshop which was nearby. After repairing the hole, he wanting to charge me $30 instead of $15. I questioned him why am I being charged with the price of 2 tyre repair prices. He took a sticker type thingy and show me  which i don't even know what the heck is that. Explaining he use 2 strips of  that, and need to charge me for 2 tyres repair. I told him I will paid for $30 but I will review in Google all the details. And he changed his mind about charging me $30. That was when he changed his mind and said i could paid $15. I insisted I'll pay $30. Which he insisted $15 in the end.\nP/s: Boss of that workshop, I stayed nearby. I'll glad to explain the whole situation, if you wanna know how your workers carrot customers. I emphasised, the Indian worker wasn't aware of the whole situation.",

The package includes dashboard & leather shine. I have spoken with the staff who is attending to my car. They have mention is was polished. I shall let the picture do the talking.\n\nI do polish my leathers and dashboard just that since I have purchase the package why not use it.",
