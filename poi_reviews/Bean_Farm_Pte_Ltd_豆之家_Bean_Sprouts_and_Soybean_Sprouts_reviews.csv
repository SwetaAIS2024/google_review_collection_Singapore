Linda Tan,1,"Horrible product. I bought the Sakura soya bean sprouts from Fairprice on 20 August 22, and alot of the bean sprouts in the pack seemed to be broke from the whole stalk and only left with the part to the root. This product is getting from bad to worse. Picture attached showed part of the broken bean sprouts with the root part in the pack.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101348156769709917922/reviews
