Each session was designed to be both educational and enjoyable, and my children always look forward to the class.\n\nThe students are taught not to just know the facts but to understand, apply, and extend to real scenarios. I definitely noticed significant growth in my child’s problem-solving abilities, creativity, and confidence to speak.",

      "text": "Quality preschool enrichment class. It's not those right brain training. In fact I think it's more logical reasoning training.\n\nThe founder is a Japanese expert and he believes in building a good foundation to prepare kids for primary school. That's why the program is only for preschoolers.\n\nThe class typically starts with a quick play to warm up. Teaching is generally fun for little ones. Class is modern and clean. The notes and worksheets is amazing. They are all good quality and in colors! A lot of these schools will just print notes in b/w.",
