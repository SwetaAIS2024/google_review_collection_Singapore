Jack,3,"First time tried  the nasi rawan at this stall. The serving size is generous for $5. Chilli is hot! Tried cow lungs for the 1st time today and I'd say it's quite mild taste and spongy like, unlike other organ meats which tend to have stronger and gamey taste. Unfortunately the fried chicken wings was flat and bit cold probably cooked a while back.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288565584051666357/reviews
Zulkarnain Subari,5,"Definitely one of the best if not the best nasi sambal goreng in sg. I grew up in marine terrace, so I had this since I was young which was 35-40 years ago (can't recall when I first had it. And i am on the wrong side of 40s now.. ðŸ˜…). Now I am staying in the west side, and I gave tried many NSG all over sg, but I still go here every now and then to get my nasi sambal goreng fix.. too bad, now the kerepek is no longer available though.

Portion size is a lot. Good value for money.. The sambal sotong is very highly recommended.. and the nasi rawon is not bad too.

Me and family go to place for nasi sambal goreng.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107975825124198519015/reviews
Kiagos Mohamed Faizal,5,After 25 years my last visit. Today I decided to have breakfast there. However decided to pack snd eat at my own home. Greeted by staff there very friendly and chatty. Food not only good but delicious. Surprisingly maintained its flavours and quality over the years. Will definitely come by again when I am around the vicinity.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107747836324064941926/reviews
