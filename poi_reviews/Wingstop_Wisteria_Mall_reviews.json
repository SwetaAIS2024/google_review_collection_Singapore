Can tell the staff couldnâ€™t cope with the huge influx of online & Grab orders with many upset Grab drivers & customers\n\nWings: While they were juicy and tender, I think Louisiana flavor is not bad but the Garlic Parmesan leaves a lot to be desired. Not enough garlic taste.\n\nFries: Voodoo fries live up to its name with a very interesting and nice fries with the sauce. Very easy make you full",
