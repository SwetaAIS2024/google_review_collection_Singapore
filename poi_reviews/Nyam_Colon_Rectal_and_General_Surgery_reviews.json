      "text": "This is probably the worst day surgery experience I've ever had. My appointment is at 8.30am so I arrived at 8.15am in the morning to register and wait for my procedures. However, I waited till 9.50am to get into the room to do procedures. Basically I waited for almost 1.5 hrs in the cold room with my mum who is almost 70. I asked the nurse on why my appointment is 8.30 but i can only start at about 10am and just waited for like 1.5 hrs for nothing, they can let me come at about 9.30 if the doctor is delayed. The nurse didnt comment anything. Furthermore, when the procedures started, the nurses need to give me the sedation medicine to put me to sleep. OMG, they poked so many times on my both hands and made that so so painful which i almost shouted and screamed, one hand was even swallon. Lastly, my insurance company said this clinic is in their panel and can settle direct billing but then i was told by the nurse that they are no longer in the panel and need to settle payment first, which is over $4300. This is really ridiculous and please please never come to this clinic for your procedures. Its really suffering!",

      "text": "Very professionally run clinic, with very efficient processes. Was referred to him by my other specialist doctor, and thought Dr Denis Nyam was very professional.\n\nIt was a quick visit as well, as he asked questions to discover and probed further on certain pointers. Was reassuring as well when he painted the likelihood of things, yet didn't want to tell me the downside too far later, too early, and said - when we get to there then we worry about it, for now don't worry so much. That kind of reassurance is definitely appreciated.",
