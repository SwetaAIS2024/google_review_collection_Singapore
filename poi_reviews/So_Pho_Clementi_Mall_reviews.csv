TNJ Housing Solutions Pte Ltd,5,"Like the outdoor seats. Air conditioned and “peaceful”.

Food standards are maintained. The sauce are so good! Like their lemongrass tea.

Artem Moshnin,5,"Adequate/big portions of food that are all very tasty. The pho soup is the best here, with a savoury broth, soft slices of beef and tender beef balls ($11.90). Seems too little sliced beef though. I also ordered the stir fried basil chicken with rice and it was delicious, except a weird mix of mint in it which was not the best pairing (~$11.50). Atmosphere was great, no crowd, peaceful and clean. Staff were so friendly.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114186673531048387843/reviews
Belle Oh,4,The softshell crab rolls were quite delicious but thought the dipping sauce could have been more authentic. Chicken chop pho was average and I should have asked to plate the chicken chop separately. Service was good as long as they didn't chase us out after we had finished the food.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111480789657010313446/reviews
