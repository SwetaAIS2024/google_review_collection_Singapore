J Lee,2,"I’m an occasional traveller to this area, and often felt that whoever planned the architecture/walkway for this bus stop kinda dropped the ball on many things. Here are some possible points of improvement from a layperson’s perspective, which could’ve improved the commuters’ user experience (UX) significantly:

1) Thickness
The pillars are way too thick, and the bigger base actually takes up much more space than it should, had they gone with a more streamlined shape
2) Quantity
There are way too many pillars to support an unnecessarily thick roof. The objective should’ve been to provide more shelter, and they shld have gone with a lighter material with a larger surface area, hence reducing also the thickness and frequency of pillars
3) Focus on the end user
For a customised shelter, the pillars feel haphazardly placed, often blocking important walkways or merging lanes, hence creating pedestrian “bottlenecks”. If the pillars were the legacy product, the walkway planning should’ve catered to the existing structures, bearing in mind rush hour human traffic since Sengkang is one of the largest yuppie towns in singapore.

Hope more care can be observed in future urban designs so we as the public transport commuters can have a better overall travelling experience!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104959184886426332756/reviews
Ratinan Leela-Ngamwongsa (Nat),1,"Way too many columns to support 2 levels of roof that obstructs views, very difficult to spot for the bus. The bus stop sign is also obstructing. I wonder the architect thought we could see coming buses through these obstacles? Oh… there are magics in Singapore?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117927907097211814161/reviews
