Would definitely recommend you to visit this gallery. You could easily finish touring this place in less than an hour. If you come with a large group, pre-booking I would say, is necessary.\n\nThe gallery staff/manager were very eager to show you around. Good job everyone!!",

      "text": "I really enjoyed the exhibits here. Stumbled upon the signage as I was leaving the hawker centre. This gallery while talking about diversity, focuses on diversity in terms of religion. The gallery starts off with a 3 minute video showing the numerous religious conflicts around the world. Thereafter, there is a poll about religious diversity in Singapore. The gallery is split up into four sections. I found the section on common areas across 10 religions to be extremely informative, but a bit exhausting to read. I liked the postal game from another section, which had scenarios to which the player could react to. The final section lets you make a pledge, which can appear on a digital tree, or you can hang a written pledge up.",

Walk in to the hawker center and looking for atm machine and there is a door with annexes b, walk in and take lift to 04 floor.",

At the edge of the hawker centre near the DBS ATM look for a door that says \"Annexe B\" and take the elevator to the 4th floor.\n\nGood exhibits to help one understand how important racial/ethnic harmony is to be fabric of Singapore.",
