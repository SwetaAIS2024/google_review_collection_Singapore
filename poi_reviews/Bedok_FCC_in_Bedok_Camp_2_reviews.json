      "text": "Came here to take my annual IPPT. I must say I really applaud the FTs for their work ethic and professionalism, explaining the entire process in detail, with a very easy to follow structured flow from in-pro, briefing, warmup, static stations to the 2.4km run and finally cool down and outpro. Whole process took no more than 1.5hours.\n\nFTs may seem strict but are very nice and approachable. Special mention to this female instructor Eugena who was very patient and helpful, giving us tips and encouragement while we did our static stations. Can tell that she loves her job and genuinely wants everyone to do well. The small actions she does really makes a difference and made my IPPT experience much more pleasant.\n\nThose coming to take their IPPT, remember to bring your water bottle. Somehow SAF makes us do water parades between every activity. And try to book the 6pm slot so that when you start your 2.4km run it‚Äôs not so hot.\n\nAll the best!",
