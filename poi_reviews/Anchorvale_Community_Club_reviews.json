      "text": "The swimming pool is in poor condition. The baby pool play area and the slides are closed for renovation for the longest time. The sheltered training pool and big adult pool is often super crowded w kids having swimming lessons on weekends and the number of life guards are pathetic in proportion to the crowd there. The toilets were recently closed for 'repainting' for so long and yet whn it reopens, it barely has any changes. Cubicles are barely enough for the crowds there resulting in long q to shower / to change. Since sengkang demographics was already known to have younger families since at least 10 yrs ago, and thy didn't even do something to plan to expand, it's unacceptable for the sengkang residents. The sheltered training pool will also be closed during lightning alert which I don understand as well. Isn't the point of sheltered pool? To be able to swim in it during lightning?",
