Edwin Petrus,3,"Sultan Abu Bakar Immigration is the Malaysia side of Immigration and Custom check point at the border between Malaysia and Singapore 2nd link. Most of the interstates express buses use this 2nd link for bus services between Singapore and cities at the Peninsular Malaysia. It will be very crowded on weekends and holidays. Public toilets are available for transit passengers. Vending machines and small food outlets are available for transit passengers. If you are travelling on express buses, you may have to remember your bus plate numbers to prevent boarding the wrong bus after immigration and customs checks.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114785935323023325370/reviews

Junhon Woo,1,"Most of the brainless and selfish immigration officers anyhow chop the passport (entry on the bottom page and exit on the middle page) , using up the whole passport page. Their attitude are so horrible that if you are a supervisor , you would scold them for their attitude. They even take their own bloody sweet time to chop the passport when system already gives them the green light to stamp the passport , holding up all the traffic , which shows their level of efficiency. They jolly well better improve their attitude and system. Hope they are given warning letters and lessons on how to properly chop a passport or if not change the entry and exit stamp to a smaller one , following other countries (eg. Thailand)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109925114374798519918/reviews
Dhivenya R,3,"Immigration counter: When it's not crowded, you can get through pretty fast, the immigration officers are quick especially if you hold a Malaysian passport.
- Improvement: Open up a short/small separate lane for tourists to allow smoother flow for daily work commuters

Bag check: Not sure about necessity to do this. Only 2 scanners are open at the most, not efficient when you have several lines merging into 2 scanning lines, thus causing traffic.

Bus frequency: The lines can be 3-4 fold when traffic is bad causing a 30-40 minute wait at times (based on my personal experience for CW4G GP). Might be due to tourist buses.
- Improvement: HIGHLY TIME TO HAVE A SEPARATE LANE FOR TOURIST BUSES TO NOT BLOCK DAILY COMMUTERS.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113121696706615877054/reviews
