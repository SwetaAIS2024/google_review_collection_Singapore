The service was okay; staff were able to address our needs and apologised when they forgot to serve our drinks. Ordered a taco and quesadilla, both of which tasted great. We also ordered a Berry Mint drink and another beverage. We liked how the drinks were presented, but we’re not a fan of their taste. The environment was quiet and suitable for chatting.",

Shared it with my partner and we were so full at the end. Recommend the Tabasco Mango drink, gets spicier from the Tabasco when you leave it out for long…love it!",
