      "text": "Curious about the overwhelming negative reviews across multiple platforms, including multiple delivery apps, I decided to give this place a try.\n\nPricing was average, which was a promising start. I ordered small portions of Hokkien prawn mee, black carrot cake, and white carrot cake for two pax, mindful of complaints about serving sizes.\n\nThe food arrived promptly for breakfast, and to my surprise, it wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad as expected. The white carrot cake was eggy with a mild crisp, while the black version was dark but not overly salty or charred. The best of the lot was the Hokkien prawn mee, which was moist, mildly flavorful with wok hei, and topped with a rather meh chilli and a generous portion of lard. Just two prawns though, so manage your expectations accordingly.\n\nWhile slightly above average, it certainly doesn‚Äôt deserve its bad reputation, as it is better than many delivery options out there.",

For $6 there's only 2 prawns though at least the prawns were fresh. There were a few pieces of squid and pork belly and that's about it. The chilli was fine too nothing to rave about but at least it had some heat.",
