CJ Ching,1,This has to be the worst branch I've ever been in! So many counters and only 3 were open. There were only two people in front of my number and I waited for an hour. One hour! Not moving at all! What the hell is going on? I saw one of the counters with a lady sitting over there but never do anything just open? ocbc can you please look at this issue straight on? Don't waste everyone's time. Time is precious. Understand?,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112919367097212186264/reviews

Lau Eng Choon (EC),1,"Hi,

I just couldn't believe the service level provided one of a few top banking provider in SG

The service hours mention 12noon closes and I was there by 11.05am on Saturday, 29 March 2025.

Customer service staff need help to improve on the CSR.

I was told banking hall closed, due to many customers.

My questions

1. I was here at the banking area 11
05am, How would I know there were many customers ?

I travel all the way to the bank from the Western part of SG and was told is closed "" before 12noon. ""

Every customers to be service if arrived before 12noon or you close the banking at 10am.

Suggestting the officer in charge to have a look at the processes.

Below satisfactory.

Sorry and disappointed.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108614154925252449802/reviews
