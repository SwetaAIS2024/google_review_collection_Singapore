      "text": "Food is overall good, especially the salmon pot pie. But service is lousy. Finished our food and asked one waitress to clear the table and serve dessert and coffee. She took some of the plates away and then never returned to clear the rest of the table. Called another waiter to clear. Again, he took some and didn't come back to clear the rest. The restaurant was only at 40% occupancy at best. It wasn't like the staff had to attend to other more urgent chores. Both proceeded to stand around the restaurant instead of returning to our table to clear the rest of the plates and cutlery. Only dessert was served even though we asked for both to be served. So we had to call a waiter again and request for the coffee. Place is not recommended for anyone who's particular on service. Even after they cleared away all the plates, they left the chicken bones (that one of them dropped from a plate as he was taking it away) on the table and didn't come back to clean it.",

Tried the seafood stew as well... delicious - and the seafood tasted fresh, but bit prudent.\nOther than that, the portions of the food were just nice. Service was pretty prompt as we got our food within about 10mins of ordering, but can do with bit more smile ðŸ˜‰",

Other than that, we are seated under the fan and it was not adjustable said the crew. Food got cold fast.",

      "text": "Brussels sprouts, risotto, mac and cheese, pasta -- all tasted great. Pot pie was disappointing -- nothing about it was good. Weird capsicum taste in potato mash and so little meat and soup in it. Entire meal was not value for money. Apparently there's a policy to not allow baby chairs at certain seats, but management and staff should be flexible and allow deviation where it makes sense. No complimentary water served. Service was slow -- we had to ask for our dessert 3 times before it was served. Don't think we'll be back.",
