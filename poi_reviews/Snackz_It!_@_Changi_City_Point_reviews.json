Tartar sauce was a bit bland, but plentiful.\n\nSweet potato fries although crispy, held no hint of sweetness.\n\nThe popcorn chicken was crispy and decent, although it was a bit more oily than the fish.",

That said, there's this Filipino guy who's always so friendly and warm,  which is quite the service level of Taiwan.",
