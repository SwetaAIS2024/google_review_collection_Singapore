      "text": "When you are at Tan Quee Lan Street, the stark juxtaposition of modern hi-rise architecture and traditional pre-war shophouses is very clear for all to see.\n\nOn one side, many restaurants have sprouted in the row of pre-war shophouses making it a very lively place to be in the evenings and weekends.\n\nOn the other side, construction is underway for Guocoland’s Midtown Modern and nearby Midtown Bay. These new buildings are next to Shaw Towers and are looking quite impressive before it’s even completed.\n\nIn the middle of these two sides is the Bugis MRT which is very conveniently located that once the construction is completed, you can expect that this MRT Station will bring air of foot traffic to this area for live-work-play.\n\nIf you travel along Nicoll Highway, we will see the construction going full steam ahead … even Shaw Towers jumped on the bandwagon and got itself rejuvenated so as not to pale in comparison with the sparkling Midtown buildings when it’s ready.",

This station which is Blue and Green Lines intersecting is above Bugis Junction which has all you can need from a shopping perspective, but also close to Hajji Lane for nightlife, Arab street for great food, and is in the Arab quarter near the Textile district so there are lots of textile merchants for all of your needs. Blu Jaz Cafe just above has good live music and there are lots of eateries near by.",
