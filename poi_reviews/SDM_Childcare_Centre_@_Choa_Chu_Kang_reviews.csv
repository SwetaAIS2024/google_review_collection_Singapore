Ingrid Halim,5,"Enroll my child for infant class here.

The teachers are attentive and friendly. They know the children well. Given that some children will develop preference for teachers, but my child has largely enjoy going to infantcare. They provide interesting and educational activities for the children and we receive weekly photos of children's activities.

The food is nutritious. They give sufficient food and they are able to pace with children's development for eating.

Daily updates are regular. The teachers also give feedback about my child's development through regular parent-teacher meeting

The room is air-conned.

They provide updates when there are outbreaks (e.g. HFMD, COVID).

Admin process is smooth and hassle-free.

Area of improvement: They could provide spare diapers for infants for when parents forgot to top up children's diapers.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100390119489840890846/reviews

Lisa Tay,5,"Our experience with SDM @CCK has been wonderful. My daughter joined the playgroup class at 18 months old, and she absolutely loves going to school every day. The diversity among the teachers, with Chinese, Malay, and Indian backgrounds, adds a warm and inclusive atmosphere that truly feels comfortable for her.

The teachers are very caring, and as a working mother, I feel completely at ease knowing sheâ€™s in safe hands. The school keeps us well-informed through their app, with prompt updates on everything, including even the smallest details like slight flu or minor scratch, often with photos attached. This level of communication gives me such peace of mind.

Thank you, SDM@CCK , for creating such a supportive and nurturing environment for our little ones!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103435966863053838872/reviews
