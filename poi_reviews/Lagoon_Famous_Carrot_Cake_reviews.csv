CP,5,"This is an iconic food centre that has been around for as long as I can remember, perhaps since I was a kid. It is also a favourite gourmet food place for many - locals and tourists alike. Though I have been here countless times, this is the first time I noticed this stall selling popiah and it is so good. I am sure I will have it more often whenever I am here.

Update: I am back here to have their fried carrot cake - and it is really good. I like black carrot cake with sweet soy sauce that produced that smoky flavour after frying. What is great is the soft carrot cake pieces and yet not mushy. I will be back for their crispy white carrot cake.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861923464679544218/reviews
Silver Lee,1,"White carrot cake tasted way below the average despite with so many awards and newspaper cuttings. The cook might have changed or they simply don’t bother because I don’t believe a single award or newspaper cuttings that are awarded to them.

When they are busy, they don’t even bother giving you chilli or spring onions. You have to ask and they give you that look.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103399009560973617124/reviews
Keith Lin Junyong,5,"The white carrot cake is nice, though less crispy than I would like for my carrot cake. But it's fragrant, and makes me want to go for the next mouthful, until I finished and was hoping there's more. The black carrot cake is slightly sweeter than the usual, but having both together gives it the contrast which made it enjoyable for me. But if I were to have only the black on its own, it'll be a tad too sweet. So do note about this when you're here.  Highly recommend to try!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106012121094601305934/reviews
MsOmNom,4,"A Must-Try Delight: The Black Carrot Cake

If you find yourself at East Coast Lagoon, make sure to indulge in one of its hidden gems: the Lagoon Carrot Cake. As a food enthusiast who has sampled many carrot cakes here, I can confidently say the black carrot cake here is a standout.

This dish blends flavors and textures that will leave your taste buds singing. The radish cake is fried with dark soy sauce, caramelizing beautifully to give it a sweet and savory taste. The exterior is crisp, while the inside remains soft and tender, topped with fresh spring onions and accompanied by tangy chili upon request.

The spring rolls are also noteworthy. Crisp outside and filled with lots of ingredients, they make a perfect snack.

East Coast Lagoon’s carrot cake, especially the black variant, showcases the rich culinary heritage of Singaporean hawker food. Whether you are a local or a tourist, it’s an experience not to be missed.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112478801214182052307/reviews
Stanley,5,Their carrot cake had a very soft texture with a crispy eggy exterior. Handmade popiah was very tasty too. Definitely must try if you are around here.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109779294020772182875/reviews
