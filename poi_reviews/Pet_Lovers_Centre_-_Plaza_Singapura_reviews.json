      "text": "Bought a dog toy, my cavapoo (3.5kg) chewed and broke the hardened ball on the same day. Not sure if she had swallowed any residual. Raised QC concern to PLC, response pointed to no toy is indestructible and supervision is needed. I agree with the explanation but I am of the view that this cannot be the case when it is a small dog having the toy for less than probably 15 minutes. Caution if you want to buy the same type of toy; I will refrain myself from buying from PLC. One star is minimal and probably deserving given PLC responded within next working day.",

Lim Au Nan and Jasmine and Elena were patiently handling the many customers flow, cleaning up the place and helping me with a warehouse order bec the shop didn‚Äôt carry the variety of pet food that I wanted. The login to your membership app was a disaster.  Please do something about it.\n\nYour three staff needs special mention bec they were patient, friendly and calm under pressure. In fact many of your staff in the BBC various outlets have displayed exemplary customer service. Keep up the good work and please reward them. Thank you.",
