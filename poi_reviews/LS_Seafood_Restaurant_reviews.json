      "text": "A family holiday dinner turned Bitter and Upsetting. I’m a pretty easy going person who seldom post reviews, maybe 1 or 2 in 5 years. we specially chose to dine here hoping for a pleasant last night of the holiday, ordered many recommended dishes but a short curly hair female manager took and serve the wrong orders, over order our size portion and gave sarcastic excuses when we checked our orders with her. Please don’t get me wrong, we are willing to pay for good food and ambient type customers but please don’t take us as fools. Totally ruin our dinner and first impression on this LS restaurant.",

Hence I’m giving only 3 stars for service.\n\nThe fish maw soup is very good. My mum likes it a lot. The lemon chicken is also good. Tried 3 types of bean curd. All not good. They are weaker in handling bean curd.",
