Darren,4,"Dropped by this Hong Kong-inspired cafe in Bendemeer for lunch,  and the interior was pretty spacious despite the nondescript entryway. We got the Slider Duo Combo ($20.90) and the Bolo Duo Egg Combo ($13.90), and each combo came with a drink.

For the slider combo, we chose the Larry Fisherman which came with tender and flakey battered haddock encased in soft brioche bun lathered with tartar sauce. Pretty good, pretty thick fish patty, but I thought the mushy peas could stand out a little more. For the other, we chose the Cultspicy which was fried chicken thigh in a spicy-tangy Comeback sauce. This was delicious, from the crisp coating of the chicken to the addictive sauce - highly recommend. The combo came with a generous side of fries which was fantastically crisp and tasty.
The Bolo egg combo was also nice, and we liked the contrast of the sweet bolo bun and kaya butter against the salty slab of luncheon meat. The half-boiled egg was also a nice touch - I saved some of the bolo bun to dip in the egg mix! As for the drinks, the matcha latte was passable but the masala chai latte was really good.

The main downside of the meal was that I thought the pricing could be clearer and the service could have a bit more initiative. There were multiple menus at the table and the waitress could have put in more effort to explain the various selections. For example, she only mentioned that choosing the crabby patty in the slider duo would be an extra $5 after we chose it rather than upfront, and only after paying did I realise the price of each combo I was charged was $1 extra from the menu prices. Was it for the drinks? I thought the lunch set came with the drink? Also, I had to walk up to the open kitchen to grab someone's attention for a refill of water, when it was just us in the eatery. Hence, overall there was cosy ambience with good brunch food, but I would hesitate to return.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116771157599704611382/reviews
Michelle Tan,4,"Tried the cha chaan teng at Lavender and really enjoyed the experience. The sliders were excellent and packed with flavor. Fries were crisp and addictive, the kind you’d keep picking at long after you’re full.

They serve burgers and brunch fare during the day, then switch to more classic cha chaan teng dishes at night.

One dish that didn’t quite hit the mark for me was the big breakfast with waffles—it had a bit too much going on taste-wise, like the elements didn’t quite come together. But overall, great spot with solid food and a cozy vibe.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108501805492361601592/reviews
Chua Bernard,3,"Unexpected Shop Front for a Hong Kong Cafe. Missed the shop initially and walked passed it without noticing the small signage at the side of the shop. Surprised to find a nostalgically decor bistro with a Long Bar, rather than conventional HK Cafe themed.

Lunch menu was limited to one page menu but can request some items from the dinner menu if its available.

Anyway, we went for a light lunch and ordered just Daan Zi aka Scrambled Egg Sandwich was not impressive as egg not properly beaten with salt and butter, thus some bites were way too salty.

Soi Do Si aka French Toast with Kaya and Peanut Butter was a better dish as compared to Daan Zi, it was better executed and good Peanut Butter ratio, but could have used a softer butter cube so that it will dissolve well into the bread when its served.

Our favourite dish for our lunch in this cafe was their Wan Tan Min (Dry). The thick cut of  char siu was tender with a tasty, sweet crispy outer layer. Mee Kia had a strong scollion taste which we liked and of course their innovative Fried Dumplings in hard outer crust that went rather well together with the dish.

As for their Daan Tat aka Egg Tarts, had layered & flaky crust, filled with rich creamy custard and top well caramelized, but bottom crust was sloggy and oily by the time we consumed them as our dessert.

Overall lunch experience was quite good although their simple food did not impressed us, but good enough for a Bistro setup. Service staffs were attentive & efficient, and of course cafe was rather cosy with nostalgic feel as retro dance music were played throughout our lunch.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116763827953354833238/reviews
Clair Webz,5,A vibey retro Hong Kong-esque bar with intriguing cocktails and great sliders jam-packed with layers of flavours! Highly recommended! Great place to hang and chill after a long day of work,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111067293289084666791/reviews
Fel Ong,2,"This was an interesting find in the area and found it novel. Aside from the overall lively interior space, kitschy menu and good cocktail I can't say I would recommend this place for the food. Presentation is great but portion and quality can definitely be improved. Limited choices for lunch.

The best component in the dry wanton mee was the 3 deep fried dumplings. Freshly fried and juicy, wouldn't have minded a whole order if this. The noodle portion could be better, it was gone in 3 bites. Good amount of the stewed pork but this and the noodles were way too sweet. The green chillies were good, not too sour and with heat.

Har gao is a hard pass, thick skin and full of flour. I don't like wasting food but didn't finish this. The filling is listed as shrimp jelly but at $13.90/5 pcs I'd expect something more substantial. Had the floral tea cocktail and I can see the appeal of the place, the cocktail was good. Their dinner menu looked interesting and perhaps would fare better.

Aside from that, I left disappointed with the meal and headed elsewhere as I was still hungry.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100958925358251731321/reviews
