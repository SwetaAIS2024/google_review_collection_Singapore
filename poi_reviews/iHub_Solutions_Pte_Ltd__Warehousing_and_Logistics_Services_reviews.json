I did inquired about my delivery as I received an advisory via SMS and the moment they answered the phone I felt secured that my items were in good hands. The item itself upon received were in good condition, proper documentation attached and the guy was very friendly. Overall, doing business with iHub was a smooth transaction and rest assured that your items be it small or fragile it is very well taken cared of. Kudos to the all the staff who look after my items. Thank you.",
