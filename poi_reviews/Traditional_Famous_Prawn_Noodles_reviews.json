Recently saw some discussion on lor mee and one of the recommendation was this same stall, but their hougang branch.\n\nThe lor has a herbal profile which I really liked. It's also full of fried fish and braised pork slices, as well as half an egg. All this for $5 (Oct 2024).\n\nWould recommend to give them a try.",

      "text": "Happened to be around Clementi west, initially wanted to try the porridge stall from the same coffeeshop however they were already closed for the day. Noticed there is a stall on the opposite end of the coffeeshop selling prawn noodle  and lor mee and decided to give it a try. I believe they have a few branches in Singapore. Price of the noodle starts from SGD$4 onward.\n\nI had their fried fish lor mee, it came with the standard ingredient of braised egg, pork belly and fried fish. As i opted out the pork belly, i was given slightly more fried fish. Gravy was has nice consistency. flavour wise, not bad. i suspect they added alot of msg as i felt very thirsty after eating the Lor Mee. Fried fish was crispy even though i believed it have there on the shelf for quite sometime.\n\nOverall, can eat. I noticed their prawn noodle is also very popular. Based on my observation, many people were having that.",
