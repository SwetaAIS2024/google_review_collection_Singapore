      "text": "Nice tranquil kampung vibes...\nThe boss and staff are very attentive, warm and friendly..\n\n$10/- Mutton murtabak (ONLY BEFORE 12NOON AND AFTER 4PM) tasted very flavourful. Better than Zam Zam. Much much better than Springleaf. The curry wasn't really required. 5/5\n\n$9 Mutton biryani.. super good quality basmati that is lighter in ghee but still super aromatic from the spices... Mutton was very flavourful. Better than Zam Zam.\n\n$1.50/- Teh Halia impressively strong and robust tea taste. Very consistent 5/5\n\nCome here if you wanna relak one korner with free parking good food and good vibes... Away from stuffy malls and over-rated places.",

I always come back once in awhile.\n\nIn my latest experience though, the staffs are a little less friendly as compared to how it used to be. The lack of acknowledging you when you made eye contact and just walking away... but of course this could be a one-off or a bad day for the said staff. I hope management would also care for staff if they are not feeling well to be serving.\n\nWill continue to support for the great Maggi Goreng.",
