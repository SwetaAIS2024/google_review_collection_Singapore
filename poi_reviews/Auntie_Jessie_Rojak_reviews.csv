Soh Wee Kian,5,"This is the best Rojak I had tasted in the Cheng San Ward Vicinity, I would boldly claim that it could be the best in Ang Mo Kio and its surrounding! Rojak is a traditional Singaporean Street Food made with fried bread Ê≤πÊù° roasted dried soya bean tofu Ë±ÜÂâ• DaoPok, cucumber, bean sprouts, pineapple, mixed with prawn head sauce, it may smell bad for the uninitiated, but when you taste it, you will know your taste buds are in food heaven paradise! It is a must try! Don‚Äôt let the disgusting looking texture deceive you, it is one of its kinds of dish found only in the Straits of Malacca and you will find yourself craving for more when you try it! Make sure the chef is a Singaporean or Malaysian before you order as only these group of people can make Rojak taste like Rojak! It‚Äôs a cultural delicacy!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106902344927258494810/reviews
Raphael Too,5,"The rojak is yummy üòã The sauce is good and there is a good amount of it and it tastes good. The you tiao and all the other ingredients are all done well.

I always get the small (which is $5) and add you tiao (which I think is minimum another $2). This review is based on takeaway order.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112983265295344584585/reviews
