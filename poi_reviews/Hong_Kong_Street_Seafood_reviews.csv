Akihiro Kurosawa,5,"Work from home, ordered San Lau Hor Fun and Broccoli with Scallops via Foodpanda. Extremely satisfied with the food. The hor fun has good ""wok hei"", the bean sprouts were sprite and not overdone and the chunks of snakehead fish were fresh and plentiful. Even the broccoli and scallops had been anointed with the breath of wok. Broccoli stayed green and beautiful, not yellowed and mushy. Lots of springy scallops in there, at least 12. Food preparation was prompt unlike other food vendors through my experience. Highly recommend.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116175157869786117677/reviews

I tried to eating it but I just can’t... time and money wasted...",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117476399391682167432/reviews
