Edwin Ng,1,"Asked if there's QR payment option, stall lady told me no, my wife is next to me I asked her if she got smaller notes, the stall lady abruptly said she got change.. okie done, nothing to fuzz about. Sat down to have my food, another customer came on and ordered, they no cash, this time another stall fellow told them they can scan pay??!!! Simi standard.
