      "text": "My son compulsorily took Higher Chinese Subject when he joined River Valley High School 4 years ago. As a non-Chinese student, studying higher Chinese is really hard although he did good in his primary levels. My son struggled with this subject during his early secondary studies and even failed the exam at one point. After joining Axcell Tuition Centre and under the guidance of Ms. Sherilyn, my son's grade was gradually improved. Today, he received O-level Higher Chinese Exam result. He gets Grade 3B (Merit). I can't help but express my sincere gratitude to Ms. Sherilyn and the Axcell Tuition Center for bringing the best out of my son. Thank you and God bless you all!",
