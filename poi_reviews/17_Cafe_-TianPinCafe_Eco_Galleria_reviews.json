      "text": "Love their wanton mee very much! Kopi O is good too. Mee Rebus is great too. Remind me of childhood taste each time I ate it!  The service here is beyond expectation despite that it is a simple cafe. I ordered my drink wrongly and it was replaced immediately without charging me extra. I felt really bad that I offered to pay them for my mistake but was happily declined. Ambience here is very good and the seat is very comfortable and fully aircon and clean. Price point is really very reasonable too. A must go place for me at least once a week if I m in town. Highly recommended üëçüëçüëç",

      "text": "Found this cafe when we parked our car at the first floor of Eco Galleria and came back for breakfast the 2nd morning.\nThe vibes here is very good and chills, not overly crowded. Simple menu, but good for simple breakfast. Price is also reasonable.\n- Mee siam with fried chicken & egg. It was quite a surprise it was chicken fillets, which I like, crispy outside but the chicken with a bit of frozen chicken smell which I am quite sensitive about it.\n- Wanton mee was average, charsiew can be better.\n- HK milk tea taste a bit bland and taste like normal tea.\n- Iced Kopi C was good üëç\n- Kaya butter toast was very good üëç",
