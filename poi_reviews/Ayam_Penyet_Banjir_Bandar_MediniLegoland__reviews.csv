Dion L,4,"So happy to find another nice penyet house around the area! I tried cili hijau and lemak cili api with ikan keli, and they both tasted very good! Both cili not too spicy so it‚Äôs great for me and people who couldn‚Äôt consume too much spiciness. Their tempe has daun selasih if I‚Äôm not wrong, which tastes even better than others. Lemak cili api goes very well with plain rice. Ikan keli fresh. And the teh  tarik, at first too sweet although I ordered kurang manis but after their staff adjusted for me it‚Äôs spot on. Rare nice teh tarik you could find around here (better than the mamak next to it I would say). So overall very recommended.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101836653562900623873/reviews
Victor Ng,3,"Lemak Ciliapi üëç
Very fragrant and distinctive aroma.

Ayam Penyet ü´≤
Nice presentation. Chicken not bad. Sambal chilli lacked punch.

Assam pedas ü´≤
Gravy was flavourful and well balanced. But ikan pari was dry and overcooked. Rm17.50 for 3 tiny pieces of fish not worth it.

Bakso ü´≤
Soup was good but the meat balls were of low quality.

Have to comeback here and edit my review mainly because of the staff.
Our latest visit early Oct, 3 times visits.

What we ordered.
Ayam Penyet: Same good taste.
Asam Pedas Ikan Pari: pari tu keras. but okay je la maybe dia guna pari besar tu and the kuah still nice.

Staff:
First visit
There are 2 staffs, a chubby and skinny.
They always sit around. Most of the time the skinny girl will assist with orders. Yet the chubby girl will sit the whole time while others do work. She will have loud voice when she go to the hall towards the kitchen talking!
There's another girl (the tall) was commenting my next table order. Might be she's a regular there and im sorry i misheard the conversation but i think its inappropriate . The staff was commenting 'tak bosan ke order benda sama'  i know it's uncomfortable for the person because her face didn't know how to react with that comment. They should know how to play with words, instead of judgement statement they can just suggest something else.

Second Visit
These 2 young lady (chubby and skinny) will play mobile legends in front of the shop, the chubby will raise her voice 'order wei' instructing others to take order from us. Might be its their rest time, but you should know anyone working in service industry that is not the way you show your behavior in front of customers.

The third time we came, the same girls. The chubby was on video call. Talk with loud voice and was talking bad bout her friend. I didnt care bout the talking bad abt the friend but its that the way and place you should do your personal things. Its making other people uncomfortable with your judgement and comments throughout the conversation.

Maybe they are too comfortable with the workplace till the point they have no respect towards the customers. I think its getting out of control. Even if the chubby girl is the owner's daughter/ niece or other relative, you should know how to have good manners during worktime. I took her picture but censored it with stickers for public but the owner or PIC will definitely recognise her.

Masak Lemak dia The BOMB

Tried few times sebab dekat je dengan rumah, around 10 minutes.

First glance, macam tak cukup je nasi n lauk. But when you ate it just nice and actually a recommended healthy portion.

Since we been here often, we tried mostly everything on the menu.

Masak Lemak semua the bomb, but daging salai tu liat sikit. But the taste and the smell just meet the delicious expectation. Macam orang tua Nogori masak.

There is 1 time datang, nasi mentah sikit (forgiven since its just one time)

Timing plak stated 10am, but i pernah datang 1010am and masih half of the shutter buka. I didnt bother to ask so i just left.

The owner is friendly, they always around to ask for any feedback. They didn't ask us, but it's okay. We just observe.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111761153277097722330/reviews
