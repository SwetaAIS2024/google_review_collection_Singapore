James Y,5,"Having been to both dinner and lunch, I have to say this is the best sushi in Singapore. Cannot think of anything negative to say about this place except maybe the price, but they are flying fresh ingredients from Japan couple times a week.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110677962612004162566/reviews
Kelly,5,"Best sushi place in Singapore imo. Each sushi was sliced perfectly and had amazing melt-in-your-mouth feeling.

Front of the house gave very clear explanation of how each fish is sliced, marinated, seared, etc.

However, since I went for 6pm service, the pacing felt a little fast since they had to clear the table for the second seating.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101941710499720703351/reviews
Agnes S,4,"Really good quality ingredients. Sadly, his shari was so inconsistent. Some nigiris’ shari was too hot…. Staff handling the shari is not well trained and chef was also rushing to serve the nigiris out .",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105327839170106314040/reviews
Ngai Wong,5,"High-quality ingredients and expert execution! Each dish showcased unique and fresh ingredients, many of which were sourced daily from Japan. A standout was the shiro amadai, which we had not encountered elsewhere; its delicate flavor and texture was remarkable. Overall, we highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking to indulge in an omakase.

Note: the head chef faced an emergency and needed to start service 30 minutes later than scheduled. The restaurant notified us around 12:15 PM, rescheduling our reservation from 12:30 PM to 1:00 PM. While it was surprising to experience this at a Michelin-starred establishment, we understand that emergencies happen.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112064446320026229856/reviews
James Lim,5,"Today I feel compelled to post this long overdue review as I have been a patron at Shoukowa since 2018. Since my first visit, I have always been impressed with the quality of service and especially the top grade tuna and abalone quality. These food items cannot be bought with money alone but with internal recognition and checks of reputation in Japan.

I fell in love with the place so much that there was a period I patronised the restaurant at least twice a week.

Thank you so much Chef Nishida, Desmond and team for making every visit a memorable and special occasion ❤️.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112306949825525606449/reviews
