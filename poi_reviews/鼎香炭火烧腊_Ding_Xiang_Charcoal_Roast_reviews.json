Use your cdc voucher at risk as they will over charge you. $4.30 but ask to redeem for $5 because they don’t accept part cash part vouchers. And when they charge $5 - no change given. And when you complain, grab food out from hand and throw away. They knew their scam were up when he gave back the cash.\n\nTake them off the cdc plan as they don’t deserve it.",
