Angelia Ong,5,"This dish is a true visual and culinary delight. The barramundi fish fillet is perfectly seared to a crisp golden brown, with tender, flaky flesh beneath. A bed of fresh greens and finely shredded cabbage adds color, texture, and a refreshing crunch.

Topped with thinly sliced onions, microgreens, and a glossy sauce, the dish balances acidity and sweetness, enhancing the fish‚Äôs natural flavors. The thoughtful presentation and vibrant ingredients make this a must-try for seafood lovers. Elegant, fresh, and flavorful‚Äîthis dish is a standout!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107075617145166914342/reviews
Ms Alina Maria,4,"Clean and spacious with a lovely peaceful atmosphere.
Food was great. We ate: beef burger with omu rice - quite an acceptable portion for the money - beef burger was juicy and tender; barramundi with shaved fennel and lunor potatoes - delicious,  the fish was cooked to perfection with crispy skin; sweet potatoes fries with truffle dip - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, best sweet potatoes fries. A jug of water was $2.50, however, it was the most refreshing water because of the lemon and lime slices.
The food is served quite fast from the moment you order it. However, a suggestion for the staff would be to pay a bit more attention to the dinners and their requests. We waited quite a while to get the water.
Overall a good experience.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109032073645433794478/reviews

Jacinth Lim,5,"I dine frequently with friends at TCC Vivocity, and it never disappoints! The food is consistently fantastic, especially the seafood Aglio Olio. It‚Äôs TCC signature dish, an absolute must-try. The drinks are always refreshing and perfectly complement the meal. A special shoutout to Raymon, whose exceptional service and understanding of our preferences make dining here a pleasure every time. Highly recommend this branch!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100390718147008944373/reviews
Florence Leow,5,"üü´TCC Coffee,
‚û°Ô∏è Level 2, Vivocity mall

üü£I went to TCC Cafe at Vivocity and had a coffee there.  üü© Located on Level 2, this cafe boasts beautiful harbour views that complements its elegant ambience.

üü° The modern decor, paired with plush grey sofa seating and soft lighting, gives off cosy and inviting vibes.

üíõ My Iced Cappuccino, priced at $7.80+, was reasonably priced, and expertly crafted with a rich & velvety texture. ‚óè The milky coffee was creamy and had a depth of flavours that shone through.

‚óè The gentleman who served me was warm, courteous, and added a personal touch to my visit.

‚¨õÔ∏è Overall, I am impressed by the well-crafted coffee, stunning views, and good  service at TCC.
