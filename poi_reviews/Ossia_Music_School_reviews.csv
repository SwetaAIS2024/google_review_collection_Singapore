Nathalia Setiawati,5,"My son has been learning acoustic guitar with teacher Sandry for more than a year now. He is always very encouraging and supportive of him, giving him a chance to improve at his own pace in guitar learning. Couldn’t recommend him enough for a guitar teacher for any level.  My other son learns piano from Mr Choon How and he is also a very supportive piano teacher who helps my son keep his interest in learning piano. Would recommend him for piano at any level.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105120962189477404935/reviews

burnolise ong,5,"Started the lesson with my boy as I am always interested in guitar as well. Teacher Pelvin came to Ossia Junction 10 when we were just starting our 2nd year of class. Love that he caters his teacher style to suit student needs and very thankful for his patient, esp towards my playful son. He is a very optimistic who makes the best of every situation. My boy enjoys his classes so much. His encouragement is priceless whenever we doubted ourselves while recording for the exam, cheering us on whenever we feel dejected. It is really a loss to us that Ossia had to transfer him to another school to teach. My boy and I had learnt so much and grown in both skills as well as passion in guitar. All the best to you, Teacher Pelvin Peter. Thank you so much for your patient and encouragement.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111305535424361398836/reviews
