      "text": "Well managed of the park, I never see so many butterflies flying in an open space in Singapore so far. Well done organising it's. There are few figs tree around the area. Very rarely we could see a fig tree in our living area. Pulau Ubin is worth a few visit. I and my friend went there with a group of Uni students from Florida. The students enjoyed the visit! Ferry ticket one way cost $4, each Ferry only can take 12 people.  Only cash accept in the island in case you need to buy snacks and drink. The price of things can a bit higher compare those shop at changi village which can buy some drinks or snacks before taking the ferry there.  Many rental bicycle shop upon arriving the island. Washroom not many in the island, the washroom are clean so far. Need to spary insect repellent if you easy attract mosquito.",

And there are so many fifteenth colors, designs, and shapes of butterflies, - with interesting names too.\n\nI even saw a dragon/lizard roaming around. I think he was trying to eat them.\n\nAnyway, I'd say the hill is a must pass by when arriving to the island!",
