ML Tan,5,"Chanced upon this stall after visiting a home based salon. The stall is clean and ordering is clear. I ordered chicken rice and add on roasted portion. The soup was surprisingly light and flavourful! Cabbage was nicely stir fry while retaining crunch! Acha was nice and tangy. ‚ÄúSteam chicken‚Äù was tender, smooth and savoury to bite. Rice was nicely cooked and firm! I enjoyed my meal a lot and it was really a decent vegetarian chicken rice! Stall lady was polite and friendly!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112148356576757035749/reviews
FionaMeini,1,"The food looks and smell really good. But I didn‚Äôt eat it. Fear of a stomach upset due to the vendor unclean way of treating food.
(It was a china lady)

But if it was a different vendor making it.  I would probably come again.

The auntie was cooking 2 hardboil eggs with their shell in the water that was meant to cook my wanton noodles. I don know if she washed the egg shell before dumping into the boiling water. Eggs are not exactly clean and sometimes with faeces.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110171015939985174618/reviews
Melvin J.,5,"I ordered the Vegetarian Curry Chicken Noodle ($5.50), and it was good! The curry was rich and flavourful, not too spicy, and had a nice, thick texture. The mock chicken tasted so real that I had to check the sign to make sure it was actually vegetarian! Really close to the real thing. Highly recommend this place for a solid veggie curry fix!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110204106470894976302/reviews
Sd Z,5,"Hearty meal nestled within a new looking Tampines estate and kopitiam - Broadway Coffeeshop.

The food didnt fall short of expectation and we had a very enjoyable meal trying out their curry chicken noodle and nasi lemak.

Affordable and delicious! For the nasi lemak do give their deluxe version a try, good review from non-veg friend.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108761929612887649195/reviews
