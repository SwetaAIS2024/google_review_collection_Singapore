The table can't fit the dishes, and true enough, one of the drinks was toppled due to the squeezing of the dishes on the table and drenched one of us. They need to learn how to pace the food and serve.",

It is our first time here.\n\nI like how generous the food portion is. coffee pork rib is super nice, should have ordered more for 3A1C. Sour spicy soup is nice too too our liking.  Veg portion is huge. Sum lor horfan is yummy with many fish slices. Desserts is packed with ingredients! Overall very good experience.  Well bring my extended family and friends there.\n\nGreat find!\n\nMissing the soup now!",

The food is delicious, the ambience is pleasant, and the service staff are excellent.\n\nI highly recommend their coffee pork ribs, cereal prawns, and yam paste dessert.\n\nIt's always crowded on weekends, so it's better to make reservations in advance.",
