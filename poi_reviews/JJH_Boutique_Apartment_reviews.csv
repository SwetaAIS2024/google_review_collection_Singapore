Bernd Hetzar,4,"Inexpensive and good: The hotel is located in the Chinese-influenced Katong district. I stayed there several times in November 2013. It is in a very quiet location, you walk about 10 minutes to MRT Aljunied and then drive another 15 minutes to the center. The accommodation is unbeatably cheap. There is absolutely nothing to complain about, the rooms are clean, quiet and well-equipped, although a bit small, but that's something you're happy to accept given the price. The staff is very friendly and helpful. You can also eat very well and inexpensively in the surrounding area.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103530816608631521359/reviews
