bearythots,3,"Freshly made crispy roti prata with not overly sweet teh terik are the best combi for a simple prata meal. Self-service chicken and fish curries are fresh and quite fragrant, but watch out for lingering flies and farting old PRC lady.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108454681619644276739/reviews

Cheok Olivia,4,"Has a wide variety of prata, thosai. There are also dessert pratas for those seeking a snack. Smaller than other branches of Springleaf Pratas but can find seats at non peak hours. You can refill the curry infinitely.
Certified Halal.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102626143264279184348/reviews
Yellow Bear,5,"Delicious Indian food with vegan / vegetarian options.
Their Vegan Impossible Murtaburger is heavenly, highly recommended; a must try for vegans/ vegetarians.
Vegetarians can get the Impossible Murtaburger with egg at the same price ( $11.20 ).
Will definitely try the rest of the vegan / vegetarian items in the menu next time.
Service here is friendly and fast.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489311735261065689/reviews
June,5,"Clean tables and environment. Food came quickly after ordering. The chicken masala prata set of $8 is worth it. Pratas are crispy and yummy. Teh Tarik with less sugar is perfect, not diluted and just nice. Will return again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105169174857655588987/reviews
