Florence Chan,1,"I was cheated by an auntie here. I asked her if she has ice kacang, she ended gave me a half bowl of ice flakes, 2 spoon of sugar, few pieces of red beans and 1 little scoop of peanut. Like in the pictures but my ice melted. And she charged me $2.50 too. I asked why her ice kacang look difference, she claimed that she is typical malacca version, but she use only brown sugar (not gula malacca) and condense milk only. How to be malacca version? Please donâ€™t get cheated by her.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108837960609500063695/reviews
MNG,3,"The peanut soup lacked in flavor as the peanut was cooked too long till it's mushy.

The glutinous rice ball was also cooked till too soft and peanut filling was very ordinary.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101526522889456924607/reviews
Kenneth Sim,1,"Review is based on Chendol & Ice Kacang bought.

Auntie was friendly but the desserts bought were blend and simply not what Chendol and Ice Kacang ought to be.

In addition to being tasteless, ingredients like beans, corns and attap seeds were lacking.

Used to have good peanut soup with sesame ah balling under another lady years back. Will not patronize again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101250411962792969001/reviews
