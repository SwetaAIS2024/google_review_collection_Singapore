      "text": "Ordered 2 large pizzas from grab - truffle Hawaiian and the teriyaki chicken.\nTasty flavours, something different from the usual pizza tastes\n\nBoth were yummy. Chicken one was a little too sweet. Slightly less sweet would be better.\n\nPrice is on the high side if you get their premium flavours. For the same flavours, if I got on their website would be ~$46 excluding delivery fee.\n\nWill eat it once in a while since it's nice but pricey\n\nNote:\n- their cheese packets are very little. Like only good for 1 slice of pizza.\n- pizza prices on grab are more ex than the actual shop (both the base price and the premium add on prices). Delivery fee is about the same as the shop's own.\nBased on their own website, delivery fee is 4.90",

One of the best truffle pizza i ever had.... the fragrance of the truffle and its savory sauce and ingredients,  combine into perfect harmony in your mouth.

      "text": "Our first time trying their pizzas as we were craving for a good pizza to end off a busy day at work so we ordered their large mentaiko ocean and large truffle hawaiian with their 1-1 deal online. Even with the deal, it was not cheap or half the price we were expecting, mainly felt like we paid for 2 large pizzas without any 1-1 actually. The pizza came on time which we were excited about but the pizzas were both quite sad looking. With the price paid, we felt that we could have gotten our pizza fix elsewhere with better quality ingredients. The pizzas were good but i just can‚Äôt justify the price for the quality given.",
