Interestingly I have never review on them.\n\nTheir roasted pork belly has a crispy skin and juicy meat, something that I‚Äôll always order. The wanton noodles are nice too, good portion as well. A very typical Singaporean food options when it comes to meal time. This stall is considered one of the better ones selling roasted meats around the area.",

V terrible.\n\nIt is like a $1.50, worth at most. Not a normal portion plus add Seow Bak portion.",
