Service is the most efficient and fast I have come across. Staff has my order keyed in before I open my mouth. I don’t understand negative reviews where they expect more than that. It is not the place to chit chat with the barista. They don’t have the time for that. And it is not what you are looking for in this kind of place. Great job.",
