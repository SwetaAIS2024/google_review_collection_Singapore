zahara bakar,5,Teacher Purwati has been the piano teacher for our four children and we have always been impressed with her dedication and professionalism. She takes the time to get to know her students and to introduce them to pieces which suits their interests and personality. Lessons with Teacher Purwati are anything but boring!
