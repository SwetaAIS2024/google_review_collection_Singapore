tushar prasad,5,"I am very delighted to share this review as I am very happy the progress my kid achieved.I will start with thanking amazing Mathematics teacher  IQ&EQ has.The methodical and focussed approached they followed , I liked the most. Focussed in class, checking kids work ,doing a followup , working on Parent feedback. I often interacted with Coordinator staff and with the teachers. They were very perceptive of the feedback and immediately incorporated them.
My kid achieved the goal and thanks for IQ & EQ for an awesome experience.

Sam Aw,5,"Thank you IQ&EQ.  Tried many tuition centres around Bedok/Tampines but results wasn't satisfactory.  Daughter was on the half way line in POA/English but after attending IQ&EQ, she was able to cope and most importantly understand what the tutor was explaining where the others couldn't.  KUDOS to IQ&EQ team !!!  You guys made a big difference and we sincerely thank you for it.  For others considering, don't wait !  IQ&EQ can make the difference (provided your child is willing)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106607862776137199661/reviews
