      "text": "We refused to fly out dogs via SQ which could cost us at least 2x more. ASPAC was recommended by another airline. The entire team which helped to freight our dogs was extremely professional. We started contacting Jane who was extremely helpful and even advised us on things that were totally out of their jurisdiction. She even told us that she could guide us on the paperwork for the lodging of the pets so that we don’t have to pay for additional agent support. However, we didn’t lodge the pet to the terminal ourselves and she helped to link us to another trustworthy agent. Elizabeta and Tricia helped us with the booking and they are extremely efficient. Cheryl handled the last part- payments, approval and AWB. She kept us updated in a timely manner. We are very grateful for the 4 of them!",

      "text": "I recently engaged ASPAC to help with transporting my 3 dogs from Singapore to Portugal.  Their customer service was top notch. Elizabeta especially had been helping me through the entire process and she gave me guidance, details and step-by-step of what’s required. On that day of transport it’s a Sunday and even though she didn’t need to, she turned up at air cargo terminal to help out.  During the transport process she kept me updated of every journey where the dogs were.\nRosman and Ali were equally  amazing making sure we including humans and dogs are comfortable on that stressful day.\n\nWell done and THANK YOU !!",
