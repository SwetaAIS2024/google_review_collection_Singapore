      "text": "Title: Disappointing Customer Service Experience at 99 Speedmart\n\nI usually enjoy shopping at 99 Speedmart, but my recent experience left me really disappointed. I was at the store looking to buy a few items and asked the cashier (who appeared to be of Indian descent) if there were any baskets available to put my items in. Instead of offering any help or a simple response, she just shrugged her shoulders and completely ignored me with a dismissive body language.\n\nI understand that everyone has off days, but the lack of basic customer service and the indifferent attitude left a bad impression. Good customer service goes a long way in making a shopping experience enjoyable, and this definitely wasn't it. I hope management looks into this and trains staff to be more professional and courteous in the future.",

Today I went in and the temperature check wasn't working and the girl said it doesn't matter. Then I had to ask someone to come to the till as they were all sitting on the floor at the back of the shop playing games on their phones.\n\nI wouldn't put a review but the staff at this shop don't seem to care about their job and it's annoying.",
