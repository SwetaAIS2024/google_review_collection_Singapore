Peter Tan,1,"Not the cheapest and definitely not the most efficient. Mostly local Chinese riders which may or may not be a plus for your needs. 99% of all personnel answering phones can't speak proper English except for a lady by the name of Elaine.

Had an issue with a cancelled pick up and was escalated to so-called ""senior"" who couldn't even pronounce her own name. Being unable to explain their procedure for cancellation and what constitutes ""too last minute"" it obviously was an effort in futility to even talk to them on the phone. I suppose they will survive and plod along but they can count one customer less and hopefully more lost business for anyone who reads this review.",8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112493980908820622718/reviews
