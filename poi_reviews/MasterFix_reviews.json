Realised I was overcharged when my fam member told me they paid much lesser than what I paid at the same place but by different staff. No receipt given either. What a scam! Side income or profiting? Are the staff underpaid so they resort to doing this? Unless duplicating keys also have CNY surcharge. But it was a week after CNY ðŸ™ƒ",

He can even raise his voice at you just to tell you to take out the items. I had 3 pairs that needs to be repaired but no thanks to such poor service. Once again, never again.  Masterfix administration needs to do a reality check on this staff.",

I was told that the success rate is only 60% and was given a refund. Subsequently, I visited Caeg Specialist at the basement of Beauty World, paid $15, took the newly minted key back and it worked like a charm. What the difference? Well, Caeg Specialist had a locksmith who used an electronic Vanier caliper to make precise measurements of the master key. She then selected the right key with precisely the exact dimensions and did a great job.",
