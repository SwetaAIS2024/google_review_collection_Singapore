Cynthia G,3,"Decent flakey crust curry puff ($2.20) if you happen to pass by the area.

I wouldn’t have tried them but they had a 50% off promotion today. Granted they are not freshly baked on-the-spot but a little bit of air fryer magic at home definitely made them a lot tastier.

The puff pastry was quite fragrant, but the portion of curry inside was quite lacking. Overall, a decent snack but wouldn’t really re-purchase.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110038244663695997045/reviews

But the lady there say can't give candles for small cakes can only.  Appalled by her reply as for a block cake need to provide birthday candles ...Then y run a bakery shop - put a board saying you don't give candles ..such small misery attitude from such outlet staff",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108346520345399375571/reviews
Wu Wai,1,"Your employees at Jurong Point displayed rudeness by loudly stating in front of shoppers that I lack common sense.

Additionally, when I inquired about offers while making payments with vouchers, she threw the leaflet on the table.

When questioned about the small wording, the response was to ask the company, prompting me to bring this matter to your attention.

Don't give us the copy and plate template.

Enjie Z,2,"Just completed some transactions at Jurong Point. Tried to redeem the singtel national day offer but wasn't well received. Rude and impatient even though I was very polite to her.
Not the first time. She was the only person in the store this morning",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118340877006788827241/reviews
