emerald manoj,3,"After reading reviews about the service here was a little skeptical to try this place out ...but was greeted with a smile and treated well at the counter , the person at the counter was very polite and tried explaining a every  small doubts...
but when it comes to the Pizza, can't say the same ... Cheese was so sparsely used , and the crust was dry too .. The Pizza as a whole lacked flavour but it was decent on the portion size !
The Pizza station was however not looking that organized and tidy ...
The store mostly concentrates on takeaways rather than dine-in and the person at the counter informed before hand",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116697614667332134047/reviews
Carmen xjia,5,"I would like to commend Rina at Pizza Hut for her exceptional service during my recent visit. My husband and I were quite confused by the ongoing promotion, but she patiently explained everything to us without showing any frustration, even when it took us a while to decide. Her cheerful demeanor and lighthearted jokes made the experience even more pleasant. I truly appreciate Rina's patience and positive attitude, which made our visit enjoyable. Great customer service like hers deserves recognition!
