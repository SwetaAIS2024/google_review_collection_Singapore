Huan Ling Yip,5,"Legit coffee. ü§© When I was greeted by Kenneth, I can smell the coffee aroma right before he hands over my order. My one shot black coffee was surprisingly good and the caramel latte which I stole a sip from my sister‚Äôs order was delicious. It‚Äôs a great boost on a sluggish afternoon. Happy that I gave it a shot when I needed it the most. üíØ",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109103110859919312992/reviews
