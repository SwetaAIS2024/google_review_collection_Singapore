Abdul Rahman,5,"I've fallen out of the habit of Google reviews but this place, without any incentivisation from them at all to do this, makes me want to give them 5 stars. Superb service, with amazing collections - Loved their Peach Momoko catalog and the owner was really friendly and encouraging, with great prices to boot. Would have gone and bought more, if it weren't for my budget (which I exceeded anyway), but this just means more trips there in the future and I don't mind that at all! Excited for future visits",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107882746299507831533/reviews
