R Wee,5,"Top notch ingredients used in this stall's nasi padang.  Apart from the rice, we also like the lontong (the serunding and chilli toppings are solid) and epok epok kentang here.  The latter is usually sold out by 8am (yeah!).  This is one of my 4 favourite nasi padang stalls (the other two being rendezvous hock lock kee @ central, pu3 @ bencoolen and Mahan Nasi Padang, right next to tiantian chicken rice at the east end of block 450 clementi ave)",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102304589695353947734/reviews
Jacob TAN,4,"The range of food at this stall is not very wide compared to many other Malay rice stalls. However, today I wanted to have beef rendang and it was available. Taste of the rendang is tasty and aromatic but the beef is not cooked long enough and a little tough. Also had the sayur lodeh which was light in flavour but flavourful. Very generous amount of vegetables. The other dish I had was the kupang ( mussels), which I enjoyed. This dish is not alwsys available at other stalls.
The sambal chilli that comes with the rice is not too spicy.
Service is quick and the lady is polite.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
WGL International,5,"One of the hidden gems in Pasir Ris, where itâ€™s difficult to find a good Nasi padang stall serving our daily neighbourhood fare like lontong, mee rebus, mi soto, Nasi lemak and more.

The service is good also, the ladies here are customer-oriented and friendly and honest in their dealings. I would support this small business that has been a staple for Pasir Ris / Elias residents for so many years already.

Their Nasi sambal goreng is also very nice.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105610453393169583111/reviews

Jun Kai Toh,2,"Nasi Padang
Prices are generally justifiable compared to the many other overpriced options out there, due to larger portions given. Great flavour overall though.
Rice $1
Sambal Goreng $1.50
Omelette $1.50 (there are some vegetables inside)
Beef Rendang $3.50? (portion is normal and while flavourful, is kind of dry. The only dish I don't recommend due to price)
Hard to revisit due to the price and excessive portion size.

Older lady wasn't too polite in explaining that their Ayam Bakar is not on the menu anymore, despite the picture on their signboard.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107198429972623127094/reviews
