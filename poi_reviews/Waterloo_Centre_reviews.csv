ET Seah,3,"It‚Äôs a very old building with shops on the ground and first floor, public residential apartments upstairs.
Would selection is rather poor in that building, that is only two coffee shops
There are a couple of dance studios, a modelling kit shop and automobile parts store.
It‚Äôs not really a shopping place however there are a lot of interesting go to places surrounding the building",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118100679546114163850/reviews
Richard Tan,5,"I have been here a few times to have lunch and to park my car for meetings nearby.

It is an underground carpark. Full at peak hours but turn over is quite fast. So worth waiting at the gantry for a lot. It is a HDB carpark. So the charges are lower than all other carparks in that area.

There are many retail outlets and eateries on the ground floor.

Upstairs are HDB apartments.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108098066731754425249/reviews
Ming,5,"There is a great Chinese eatery in the Waterloo Centre that offers really a cheap and delicious mixed vegetable rice. They provide student discounts too! How great! It is also conveniently located 2 streets away from the National Library, which is a bonus for people studying there. Clearly a hidden gem in the city centre!",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108486631776915056324/reviews
See Toh,5,"Very gd indian, malay n chinese local food.  Great tasting at low prices.  Must try the indian food stall for indian food lovers.  Its the real stuff, very gd toseh.  Very good rice n curry dishes too.  Curries r gob smacking good! Try it n tell me abt it.  For Malay stall, simply love their Kueh Lopes - the triangular glutinous rice coated w salted coconut n drizzled w gula melaka.  Here they got it all right, texture of kueh, freshness n texture of coconut n sweet saltiness of gula melaka.  $1.20 for a piece of heaven.
