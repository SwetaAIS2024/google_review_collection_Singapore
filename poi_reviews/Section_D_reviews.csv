Chew,5,"It was our first time going to a home bar and it exceeded our expectations. Like private dining, the draw of visiting a home bar is the cosy setting & conversations you can have.

Dannon & Jamie are awesome hosts; they radiate so much passion for their craft and are generous with their sharing. We love the little stories - inspiration behind the drinks, the techniques they use, and even what they do with by-products from production.

The drinks were great! Besides ordering from the menu (that changes from time to time), you can also go for bespoke cocktails, very exciting to see Dannon whip something up with the inventory he has.

Would love to revisit!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111904588034166976940/reviews
