The mazesoba was satisfying to eat and the ingredients complemented each other well, though it felt a little pricey, or perhaps I'm just ignorant of what goes into making the bowl of noodles. It wasn't crowded at all during dinner time, so I think one could enjoy a relatively quiet meal here in an otherwise busy mall.",

Generous portions to start off with.\nSoup broth is tasty and doesn't not leave a \"salty or thirsty\" aftertaste.\n\nAll you can eat refills for soup, hard boiled eggs, noodles and green tea. Legit! No questions asked!\n\nStaff are very friendly and don't give you frowns from refills.\n\nCosy setup. Corner store beside McDonald's.\nRestaurant does not have oily smell. You leave the place with a full stomach, and not with food stench on your clothes.",

I could easily down the entire bowl and so did my partner. Despite the somewhat steep cost (especially for students), you will leave feeling satisfied and satiated with the ability to add rice to the leftover sauce upon finishing the soba, and the free flow hard-boiled eggs\n\nThe service staff were amazing as well, always checking up on us despite us only being situated at one corner of the restaurant. They actively came up to our seating area and asked to refill our free flow hard-boiled eggs without us seeking them out for them.\n\nAtmosphere is slightly lacking due to the limited space Singapore provides, but the overall service and food fully makes up for that fact.",

Anyways, they offer a meal with free flow noodles, tea, eggs (hard boiled) and soup. You also have an option to get a portion of rice to eat with the leftover sauce. So honestly, if you‚Äôre really hungry, eat here because it‚Äôll definitely be filling and worth your money!",
