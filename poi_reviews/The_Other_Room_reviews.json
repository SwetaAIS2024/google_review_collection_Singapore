From the hostess to the bartenders, I had an amazing time and recommend this to anyone who likes a small intimate place with amazing drinks! Please note small and intimate is very serious, you may have to share space with others. But the vibe is very chill, and even if you have to share, Iâ€™m sure it would be an amazing time!",

As a fellow UIUX designer, I'm impressed with how User Experience is being delivered right from the start before you reach your table to when you foot the bill. It was my first time visiting this bar and I'm already arranging for future visits.\n\nAwesome, great job to all attentive staffs who were always checking if we are alright with the drinks and food served.\n\nI tried out Roa Ae today.\nLooking forward to my next visit to try moreeeeee",
