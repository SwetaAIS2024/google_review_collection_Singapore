Muffin was rock solid.  How old? The robot tray collector provided the best service. Should have checked the 2.4 star rating first.",

      "text": "Be careful with an Indian staff/cashier. I want to use all my SGD coins before leave this country so I look the the menu and make sure it fit with my coins. I gave him SGD 13.9 (10 + 2 and 1.9 coins) to buy a hot dark chocolate big size (SGD 8.9). He take my money and didn't give any money back (SGD5), at first I kinda confused because I tho he will give money back later but no, i reminded him, tried to ask why not give my money back. Even used my phone to show how much money I gave him. Then he gave back to me SGD 1.5 (1+0.5 coins), after that he said I only gave him SGD8.9 (5+2+1.9 coins). After that I gave up took SGD1.5 coins instead SGD5. If he was right, he didn't need give me back SGD1.5 lol.\nThat how I leave SGP with a bad mood. Its not about money, it is about the trust.",
