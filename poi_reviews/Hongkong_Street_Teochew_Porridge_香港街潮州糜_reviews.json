Price wise, $15.10 for 3 pax is definitely value-for-money.\n\nSeems like most people come here for their Teochew Porridge, and we will try next time!",

Breakfast set is very affordable at 2.80 for 2 soft boil eggs, 2 slices of thick toast with Kaya butter and a drink. Be sure to eat the toast while it's hot. Kopi was on a lighter, a tad too sweet side.\n\nOverall, easy to get seats, price is ok, but food is mediocre.",
