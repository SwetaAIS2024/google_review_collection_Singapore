Slavko Bevanda,5,"Reakella Café offers a great choice of delicious dishes and drinks. The personal is very friendly. The food is great! I had the avocado stack and the French toast. Hmmm and a cappuccino.

The only small downside is the atmosphere. It’s located in a lobby of an office building. But the food and team compensates that easily. Enjoy.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114557077008448653863/reviews
Khang Ning Loo (呂康寧),5,"Nice open cafe in the business park. Food is good and service excellent. The owner cared to tell us the food & drinks may be hot while serving and ask us to be careful, small gesture but show they care about customers",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108106678786180877843/reviews
Pilot Beta,5,"This cafe is located on the side of the mall’s lobby and has a simple, clean atmosphere. The latte art on the coffee was exquisite, and the taste was just as impressive. We ordered a breakfast set, and the portion was perfect for the two of us. The toast was crispy, exactly as I had imagined. It’s clear that this is a café built with love and care.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117844266651309151826/reviews
Florence Chang,5,"A nice cafe with view. Located on the first level nestled beside the lobby and escalator, I love the tall ceiling with four-level-tall glass view. It happens to be a rainy morning view today. A calming place to be for a breakfast. We love the french toast with thick honey and fragrant bacon. The honey mustard nicely combined the classic ham and cheese toast. The avocado stack is filled with egg and of course the creamy avocado. Interesting bits of feta(?) cheese dotting the plate. Goad this place is open for breakfast from 0730. I’ll be back again.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100142437865374193170/reviews
Grace zhao,5,"Today is my first time going there. I accidentally passed by the entrance. I was looking for the large window, which actually faces the business park. Reakella Big Breakfast is really good for sharing, I love the sourdough; it’s so crispy. The eggs taste good too, with a special flavor that seems like the aroma of sesame oil. I will definitely come back.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112385564491709375163/reviews
