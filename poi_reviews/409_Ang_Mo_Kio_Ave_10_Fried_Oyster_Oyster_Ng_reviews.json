      "text": "Very delicious! The portion pictured is for $5. The chilli is sourish enough to whet your appetite.\n\nThe only downside is that we waited 30 mins for this on a Sunday evening, 13 March 2022. There wasn’t any crowd at first but seems like the orders were taken down and then people went off and came back later. However, this warrants 3 stars due to the small portion for $5! We don’t really eat the oyster but love the flavour full flour and eggs so it’s not worth it. If you’re a fan of big, juicy oysters, then this won’t disappoint! The oysters were really big and juicy!\n\nMy mum got the uncle’s number so she can pre-order next time but he don’t give it out to anyone unless you’re a regular.",
