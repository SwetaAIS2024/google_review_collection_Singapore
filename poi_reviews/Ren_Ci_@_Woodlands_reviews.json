      "text": "A brand new NH since Jan 2024, blessed to get a placement for my brother with the help from the social workers. It is a household concept in compare to other NH, they name my brother as a resident instead of a patient. Each ward has a living hall with 4 beded attached with a cardboard at each corner. Though the ward team are foreigners from Myamar, Philippines but we feel their care and most importantly the patience  of coaxing the residents. The Care Manager in- charge of the resident's well being and the ward care team often walk her rounds at the ward.\nRenci has outsourced a security team at the entrance also giving their warm smile to welcome new admission and to guide patiently in the registration to the ward. All the best to Renci Woodland NH.",

      "text": "Is so difficuit to talk with the foreigner nurse as they don't really understand English. Staff nurse stared at me while i talked with her like i owed her 1m dollars. Their Nursing Team is üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª as they employ \"nurses\" without working experience in Singapore. I am wondering whether their cert is real, as they don't even really know what is the safety way of NBT feeding and just anyhow feed. They are not caring at all towards bedbound residents and rude to the visitors especially those indian nurses.\nThe sercuity guards never perform their duties, they allow more than 2 vistors to visit the same residents at 1 time.\nMedicial Social Worker also is a very irresponsible person as well as the doctor.\n\nHOPEFULLY THEY WILL CHANGE THEIR WORKING ATTUTIDE AND EMPLOYED MORE RESPONSIBLE AND EXPERIENCE STAFFS.\n2 NURSES LOOKING AFTER 16 RESIDENTS IN A HOUSEHOLD AND WITH THE STAFF NURSE WHO CAN'T EVEN REALLY UNDERSTAND ENGLISH AND THOSE ENROLLED NURSES WITHOUT EXPERIENCE WORKING IN SINGAPORE AS WELL AS SAFETY FOR THE RESIDENTS. I BELIEVE THAT THE RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS ARE NOT VERY HAPPY WITH THEIR STAYS OVER HERE. HOWEVER IS JUST BECOS THEY HAVE NO CHOICE.\n\nFeel that the nursing manager really dunno how to manage the team and just anyhow arrange the bed management for the residents too.\nSo regret to have my next to kin to stay here yet is hard to transfer out with such irresponible MSW working attutide.",
