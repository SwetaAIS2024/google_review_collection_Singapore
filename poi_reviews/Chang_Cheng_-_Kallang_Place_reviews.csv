Xenocide Duke,5,"Very bright and windy after renovation. Looks clean. Nice food stalls at reasonable prices. Can be crowded during lunch time as there are a few factories around it. So try to be early or later. Quite big with ample seatings. If you are feeling warm, can head to the individual western stalk that has its own air condition seating. Of cos only western food allowed. No very ex. Slightly more than typical coffeeshop western prices.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105145501408115852526/reviews

Yew Chung Chee,5,"Update 13 January 2022: except for one or two stalls, the rest are still around.  Safe distancing measures still in place, so some places marked ""x"" the diner cannot sit there.

Surprising crowded. Now has lesser place to seat due to social distancing measures. Do expect it to get more crowded with more people returning to work at the workplace. Food is still good.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109637640634901628234/reviews
