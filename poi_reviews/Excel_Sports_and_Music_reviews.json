      "text": "The gym located in excel centre is probably the best gym i have ever visited. They have a range of equipment brands from Cybex, RealeaderUSA, Freemotion, Hammer Strength and Hoist. This gym also has a ladies corner equipped with glute machines. My personal favourite machine was the HOIST CHEST PRESS machine, great stretch and squeeze on the pecs and it has a self lift-of system which is perfect. Gym has 1 toilet and male and female locker room separated. Really recommend if u are a bodybuilder.",

There still under some upgrading like more mirrors and etc. Overall I rate this place good for those around Yishun ,Punggol or Sengkang area it come with free parking for those who drive. And the canteen staff services is great and friendly will definitely come by again on weekends for my gym workouts.",
