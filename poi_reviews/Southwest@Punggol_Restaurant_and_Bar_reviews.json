      "text": "Visit here on a Saturday evening. There were not many customers.  I ordered the battered fish and my wife the bbq pork chop. Given the restaurant price, but when I asked for additional tar tar sauce, I was told that it cost 50 cents each. A bit turned off by this.\n\nThe battered fish is not crispy and tastes blended. It's not better than any other fish and chip you eat anywhere. My wife thinks that the bbq pork chop is good and well marinated.\n\nThere are large varieties of alcohol and also some non alcoholic drinks. We chose a table outdoor to admire the distance sea view and music. However, the smokers turned us off as we don't smoke. Feel that they should have a smoking corner further away.\n\nParking is quite expensive. We parked for slightly over an hour, which cost $4+. Not sure if it's a per entry charge during evening time.",

The beef steak was one of the juiciest i have ever tried and the fried pork cutlet was also extremely crispy and the inside was juicy and had no foul taste. Furthermore, the fried fish was cooked to perfection and not too greasy and not overdone. Special mentions to the mushroom soup which never fails to surprise us with its incredible taste. The quality of the food there is truly amazing.",
