Thusitha Kariyawasam,4,"Shilixiang Mala Hotpot is a decent choice for enjoying a flavorful mala hotpot.

The dishes are satisfying with just the right amount of spice, and the ingredients are fresh. The service is good, with staff being attentive and friendly, which adds to the experience. While the ambiance is simple, it's a good spot for a casual meal if you're nearby and craving mala hotpot.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111031053351929053721/reviews

Stella Koh,3,"I just ordered mala on grab and chose self pick up option. It's $24.80. When I reached home and open the container, there is no chilli and mala spice at all. The whole dish just look very white. Basically it just taste like fried noodles with ingredients. I can't even finish it because there is no taste and I just spend $25 on tasteless fried noodles. I'm so angry cos my dinner is ruined. Did the cook forget the chili and mala spice????",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113296749224209785726/reviews
