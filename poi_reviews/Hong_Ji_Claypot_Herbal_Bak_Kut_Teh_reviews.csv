Xling Tang,5,"We tried the Claypot Bak Kut Teh original, )($7.50), Claypot Meatball Soup ($7.50), and Claypot Braised Pig‚Äôs Trotter ($6.50), along with youtiao and braised egg. My favorite was the BKT and the braised pig‚Äôs trotter, which is rich in natural collagen üòç. It‚Äôs cooked to perfection, making the meat tender and melt-in-your-mouth. The flavorful sauce seeps into the meat, and the gelatinous skin texture was absolutely amazing. Perfect for pairing with rice or noodles!

The prices are reasonable, and the portions are generous, making it a satisfying meal overall.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103954248798037993511/reviews

Cedric Seet,4,"Very nice tasting herbal bak kut teh. Ordered liver mee sua, kidney mee sua, and bak kut teh original. Liver and kidneys were tender and not overcooked which I liked. The mee sua had a floury taste to it which I didn‚Äôt like but other than that everything was nice!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116120424406667932678/reviews
Tan ANGELA,5,Delighted to found out my hometown‚Äôs taste of Bak Kut Teh! With herbal soup. I love their pork ribs and also braised‚Äôs pig trotter. Very tendering and tummy. Plain Mee Sua soup also nice. Side dishes so cheap but big portion given. Much appropriated. Highly recommended üëçüèª,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110813304246653788688/reviews
