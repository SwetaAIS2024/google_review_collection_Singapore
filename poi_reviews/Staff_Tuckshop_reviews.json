But the chicken portion could be abit more? There were two staffs who does the servings and both give too less but charge more. I use to go everyday to buy food there and usually there is always a long queue but nowadays I see very less queue and now I understand why.",

However, I did not have nearly as bad an experience as some of these other reviewers - I paid $4.10 for 2 veg and 1 meat. That said, one would be better off eating at the nearby science canteen instead if one wants to be slightly more economical.",

I said no because I am not a staff a NUH. She then offered to give me back 70c as the correct price was $8.40. She was about to pass me the cash before saying \"cannot, in system already\". I could not reason further because she spoke in Mandarin. Unjust and unfair. My Chinese friend got what I got for $3 cheaper while I paid $8.40..",
