Fok Rupert,3,"Came to try because of the â€˜goodâ€™ reviews, but am disappointed after trying the top dishes myself.

Fish n Chips: batter of the dolly fish was fried till crispy, but this is the only plus point. As for the fries, not only were they soggy some were under cooked; you can tell from the photo that they arenâ€™t crispy.

Chicken Cutlet Nasi Lemak: rice, chilli paste and pickled cucumbers are normal. Ikan billis are crispy, the chicken cutlet okay.

Sorry to say I wonâ€™t come back again ðŸ˜…",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107959218445021115081/reviews
J,1,"I had previously eaten nasi lemak here and found their version too oily. Decided to give them a second shot.

Tried their satay, a mix of Chicken ($1.00 per stick) and Mutton($1.20 per stick). To my surprise they did not have ketupat at all. What surprised me more was when they took out the frozen satays from some plastic packaging that was definitely ordered from some supplier or central kitchen.

Meat tough, chewy and lacking flavour. Avoid.

After two tries, I will not be giving them a third try. Made my stomach act weird too.

Of the multiple Satays available in Toa Payoh, this is surely the saddest. Go elsewhere where they make it homemade.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100595339582418158434/reviews
Kenneth Ong,5,"Little hidden gem in a food court located in an industrial area. The Nasi Lemak is great - the owner has an interesting story on the origin of her receipe in Arizona, US. I enjoyed the pasta dishes - a nice modification from its western cuisine origins. I asked for ""extra meat"" for my orders as they are most flavorful.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112647320263812130622/reviews
Win Pan,5,"A returning customer although not that frequent. Itâ€™s indeed tucked away in an industrial food canteen area - an obvious sign that the service/atmosphere wouldnâ€™t be that of a cafe/restaurant. I cannot understand why theyâ€™re getting poor reviews on the fish & chips though. Itâ€™s IMO the better ones in Toa Payoh (battered and crispy!). So itâ€™s a quiet place, business might not be that good. Do give them a try if youâ€™re around the area. Ignore the reviews and come try with an open mind.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101107136927910351439/reviews
Muhammad Fauzan,1,"Ordered a ""Ramly"" Beef Burger for $7.50, which comes out like this. Taste is blend. It's just burger wrap with Egg.
Very disappointed. Please do some improvement.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117592797436300194108/reviews
