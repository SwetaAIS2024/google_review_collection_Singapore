Alvin C,5,Why is this stall only have 2.5stars? The dong po set A is awesome! The portions are big and the taste is good. Highly recommended to those who like braised meat!,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102181790026215103000/reviews
Simon Y,4,"Takeaway their $5 value set of Herbal Drumstick & Braised Pork Belly and found them pretty well executed and rather value for money.

However, having their Bak Kut Teh on site was a disappointment. Having meat balls and pork belly added to the mix doesn't made you a Klang style BKT, the broth was neither herbal nor thick, in no way resemble anything like those at Klang. And rather than providing multiple ingredients at such miserable portions(even the soup), would prefer to have just a decent portion of pork rib.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110316451866688483932/reviews
MaryHadASchlong,1,"You call this ""Klang Bak Kut Teh"" ?????

Tasteless. Bland. $7.60 with rice. We couldn't even finish it though the portion was minute. What an absolute letdown to our fellow Malaysians. Do NOT call this ""Klang"" BKT.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111030199655863836322/reviews
