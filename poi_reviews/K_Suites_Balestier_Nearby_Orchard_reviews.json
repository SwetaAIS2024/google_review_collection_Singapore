It was clean enough and large space. Everything worked (except one power point). Included kitchenette, bathroom and separate bedroom. Aircon. Fridge. Cooking and TV. Yes TV was basic viewing only but we did not book room just to watch TV. Food Courts locally. Bathroom was clean and functional. Just needs a lick of paint. Touch up repairs and a good scrub down. Good enough for sure.",
