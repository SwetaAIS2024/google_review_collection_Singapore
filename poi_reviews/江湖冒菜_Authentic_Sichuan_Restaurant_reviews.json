For the skewers, we went for beef, pork, chicken, and buns—each one flavorful and well-prepared. All the dishes were enjoyable, except for the bullfrog, which wasn’t as fresh as expected and was overly spicy for my liking. The menu offers a great variety, making it a good spot for those seeking diverse Chinese cuisine.",

      "text": "A comfortable setting for families. QR code ordering system and help yourself to the soft drinks and beers at the fridge. Many mainland Chinese selection and prices of beers are attractive.\n\nTwice cooked pork was dry and tough. It was half eaten. Don't waste calories on this.\n\nMouth water chicken was probably pre-cut and left in fridge. It was cold and hard. The seasoning was average at best.\n\nGrilled fish with peppers was of average quality and taste. For half a fish of this price, it is noticeably expensive compared to the big brands / chains. The fish was way overcooked and tough in texture. Not something I will come back for.\n\nBBQ squid was pathetically tiny for its price. It was on the overcooked side, save by its seasoning.\n\nPork and chive dumplings were better amongst the dishes.\n\nEggplant with garlic was the standout amongst all. Then again, difficult to mess out this dish.\n\nA comfortable setting but let down by its quality of dishes. Service is prompt.\n\nUnfortunately we were super thirsty after the meal throughout the night.",

The staff is exceptionally friendly, making the overall atmosphere warm and inviting.\n\nWhat makes this place even more unique is its affiliation with the restaurant next door. As a sister company, it offers a diverse culinary experience. I particularly enjoyed exploring the distinct flavors—Sichuan cuisine in one restaurant and Dong Bei cuisine in the other. It's a fantastic concept that caters to different taste preferences, and I appreciate the effort in bringing variety to the dining options.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this establishment for its cleanliness, spacious setting, and the delightful staff. The dual focus on Sichuan and Dong Bei cuisines adds an exciting dimension to the dining experience. Looking forward to returning soon!\n\nTotal damage for 6 pax S$200",

Perfectly executed.\nTheir chuan chuan also pretty reasonable priced and meat has no 骚味。\nBeer also cheap! $5 for the big bottles.\n\nAlways long Queue. Space in restaurant is pretty small. Largest group is 6 pax.\n\nGood for supper.",
