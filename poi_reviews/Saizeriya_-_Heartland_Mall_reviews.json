Around $25 for the food in the pics.\nAll time favourites: Carbonara pasta, Garlic focaccia, Bacon Risotto.\nPacked during lunch and dinner peak hours.",

      "text": "Came during peak hours on a weekend. Got a seat quickly. Service is no frills and efficient. Just scan and order via a QR code. Food was served within ten minutes. The chicken salad was especially quick, three minutes!\n\nChicken Salad: 2/5. While it's relatively cheap, servings were too small and lacked variety. While vegetables and chicken are fresh, the vast majority of vegetables were lettuce with only two cherry tomatoes and a little corn. The chicken meat tasted fine but was tough. Wafu vinaigrette tasted weird and a tad salty.\n\nMilano Gratin & Four Cheese Ravioli: 4/5. Servings of both similarly were too small. Cheese sauce is Saizeriya's strong suit. Though different sauces were used on both dishes, both tasted exceptionally good and creamy. The gratin and ravioli was well simmered in sauce, soft and well cooked.\n\nBlack Pepper Chicken: 3/5. The chicken was cooked and tasted like those in glutinous rice.  Spaghetti was typical at best and servings were reasonable.\n\nJapanese Curry Chicken Rice: 4/5. Servings likewise were too small. The dish felt premade and was just heated up. The turmeric rice and curry sauce were decent. The chicken tender strips felt processed and  soggy but otherwise was fine. The chicken and curry sauce was likewise salty too.\n\nMushroom and Bacon risotto: 4/5. Servings likewise were too small. The carbonara sauce was amazing too but salty, and rice likewise was well simmered in sauce, soft and well cooked.\n\nAll in all, I can't complain much given the price. While you don't get exceptional food at Saizeriya, it's good enough for a casual hangout with family and friends without burning your pocket.",

I was eating by myself and only would have gotten 1 item and would have finished way before their closing time. The person that refused me as a customer was a manager of the outlet. I think this is unacceptable and your staff needs more training than running an outlet to their own benefit of closing and going home earlier.",

      "text": "This is a casual family restaurant that we frequent especially this outlet since it's near our home.\n\nThe food are nice and prices are relatively reasonable, but it's always crowded especially on weekends.\n\nWe came by here for our lunch and as usual, we ordered our regulars, shrimp aglio aglio, pepper chicken, grilled salmon and mushroom bacon pizza. Yum yum. Food were nice. We topped up $2.90 for free flow of cold and hot beverages. We had the ice cream lava cake to complete our meal.\n\nHowever, there's only one coffee machine and had to queue quite a while for our hot drinks and the milk was very fast depleted, but was not replaced promptly, ended up in our dark black coffee that's so bitter :(\n\nService staff were generally friendly and helpful but the serving of our food were not in tandem. Some were served pretty quick, others had to wait quite a while and by the time they came, we already finished our mains!\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our dinning as it is without GST and service charge!",
