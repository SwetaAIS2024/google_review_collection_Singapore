      "text": "TL;DR - Recommend SLS due to current improvements and advancements in administration and management. Review also includes experience pre-administration change, and quality of study at MDIS-SLS.\n\nI've been a student at MDIS and SLS (School of Life Sciences), and have just finished my BSc in BiomedSci. I have to say that as an honest review, the year during and post-covid (2020-2022), the course management, student support, exam unit processing and the lag in communication b/w MDIS and the awarding university was highly lacking and frustrating.\n\nHowever towards the end of 2022 and currently in 2023, there has been a change in management and there is increasing efficiency in student issues resolution and the handling of the course overall. I believe that future students have the privilege of studying under a capable new administration and HOS.\n\nMajority of the faculty are very capable, with clear teaching outcomes and excellent content delivery. I felt that one or two lectures lacked the aptitude in delivering theoretical content properly across modules, and had to depend solely on notes - but this could very well be just a personal opinion.\n\nFacilities are managed well, and the labs are well stocked and maintained. We mostly did not face any major difficulties due to absence/malfunction of facilities that could not be rectified immediately if caught on time.\n\nIt was a bittersweet experience at SLS, but I have managed to enter into a reputable masters program in the medical field overseas, hence the accreditation of the course is undisputed. Shoutout to Dr. Ang, the new HOS, for making sure that atleast my completion phase of the course was smoother than the early period of study.",
