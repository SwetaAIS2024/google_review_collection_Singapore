A must-visit for those who appreciate exceptional cuisine with a purpose.\n\nThank you Anne!",

I love how they turned an ordinary vegetables (cabbage) into a star dish! Amazing! Want to try their dinner but understand dinners and weekends reserved for private events!",

I particularly liked the ribs. Today there were only sets available, salmon and ribs.  Both very nice. The staff are kind and friendly too. As an added bonus, this is an inclusive establishment.",

And the three course meal is so value for money at just $35 nett. The menu changes every week. If only they open in the evenings and weekends. Both owners Anne and Gerald were extremely friendly and made us felt at home. The other staff were great too.",
