Aydan Joshua Chan Jan (Rafflesinst),3,The people here are half half. On one side of the spectrum there’s those dissing others from different schools and gossiping with others about them (either because they’re jealous or have beef) then on the other side there’s those really nice angels who are actually nice and literal angels. I don’t have much friends here as compared to other schools but the diversity here is pretty good so yeah. 3/5.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106120520234822920672/reviews
djejilke,3,"The facilities are nice, but people talk behind your back and stuff. I don't rlly think the Christian education works for most people, but it did for me. The class is also really competitive, but once you find your group of friends, things aren't so bad :)",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116277011868972652792/reviews
Carrot Carrot,1,"ok so like Im speaking from a personal POV. First things first, people here treat people that are not from MGS like bs. I was once close freinds with a person from MGS sec and then she suddenly started acting weird and dissing me. When I asked her to come to a consensus with me, she didn’t even bother. Very immature people. NYGS is so much better( speaking from a guy pov from a good school)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105709493453855741753/reviews

Calwin Tong,5,"I'm not from MGS, still in primary school.I went there for a exposure or something like that programme and the students and teachers there were really nice!
