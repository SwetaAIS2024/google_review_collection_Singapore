The taste was unique with a little bit of saltiness and sweetness not overpowering the coffee and texture was bold and smooth. Hot cappuccino was really good too. Friendly service. Will be back again!",

      "text": "Really lovely spot at the City Gate shopping center. I had a pretty good soy matcha latte and a crispy cronut... so good! Nice ambiance with soft K-Pop in the background and on a Saturday late morning also very busy, but I managed to grab a seat and my order was ready surprisingly fast.\n\nTo my surprise I received all my items in biodegradable packaging. What a nice surprise! That's not at all common here in Singapore and very much appreciated.\n\nVeredict: instead of running to Starbucks across the street at the Concouse, show your support to this local business that's doing everything right. It won't disappoint.",

Usually I have coffee, but for some reason felt inclined to get a Dirty Matcha Latte hot. Ho man was it good! I was expecting so-so, but was I pleasantly surprised! So surprised that before driving off, just felt moved to leave a good review! Gotta have to try the other stuff now.",
