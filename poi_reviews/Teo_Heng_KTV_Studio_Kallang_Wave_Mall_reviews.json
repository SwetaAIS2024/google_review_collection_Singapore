      "text": "Great spot for karaoke! The mall isnâ€™t crowded at night since itâ€™s not in a residential area. Service was good, and the equipment is well-maintained. Pricing is also reasonable since itâ€™s based on the room, not per person. The small, air-conditioned room I used had 2 mics and could comfortably fit up to 4 people.\n\nLooks like they have a snacks area (you need to pay for it if you want) near the counter. This karaoke spot is also family-friendly. Will definitely patronize their outlets again!",

I feel this outlet really need an improvement in their equipments otherwise it's really hard to keep up with the other competitors. Drinks are still at $1/can which I have to say is a real steal.",

Nothing correct appears. Then all artists/songs are NOT sorted in alphabetical order. Totally impossible to search.",
