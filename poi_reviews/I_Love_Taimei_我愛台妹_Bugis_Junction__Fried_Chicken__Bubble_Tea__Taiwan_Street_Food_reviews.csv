Benjamin Tan,5,"The staff were very friendly. Love the original chicken although will be amazing if we can pick a flavour for it. Milk tea are decent, just like any milk tea out there. As for atmosphere, you can't expect much for a take away kiosk. Generally good üëç",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105010101002593317757/reviews
WL Lee,5,Love the crispy fried chicken cutlet bento which comes with pickled veg and a lava egg on braised pork rice. The Mala seasoning has kick!,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103239701894589553988/reviews
Azel K,4,"Good overall but the older lady staff didn't prepare my drink even though she was idling. She only started making the drink when my food was cooked, was unapologetic, and caused me to be late. Then I found out it's 0 sugar although I asked for my usual less-sweet. It didn't even have the usual sticker on it. Can tell she didn't care what was ordered and just winged it. This staff is not doing her work properly, will avoid store if she's on duty.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117120374128211605361/reviews

RCSC,3,"Lady staff was nice. Drink was average. Annoyed as they enticed people to buy the grape series voucher on Shopee in March and April. But I was informed the grape series will only be back end April. Then what is the point of selling the voucher? Just to earn money but your customers do not get what they purchased the voucher for. End up I gotta drink some random milk tea. I think it is wrong for a business to sell Shopee vouchers for a drink that is OOS for a month. By the time the drink is back in stock, the Shopee voucher would have already expired.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101381356185028377091/reviews
