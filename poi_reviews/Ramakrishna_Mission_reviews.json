      "text": "The temple opens its doors at the break of dawn, welcoming early risers with the melodious chants of Mangala Arati at 6 am. From then until midday, the temple remains accessible, offering a sanctuary for those seeking quiet reflection and meditation. In the evening, as the sun begins its descent, the temple reopens from 4 pm to 8:30 pm, providing another opportunity for visitors to immerse themselves in its tranquil ambiance. Each day, at 7 pm, the ethereal Sandhya Arati ceremony graces the temple, a time when the atmosphere is imbued with a sense of sacredness and reverence.\n\nNestled beneath the temple's serene halls lies a hidden gem â€“ a book stall brimming with the wisdom of Ramakrishna Vivekananda Vedanta. Here, visitors can explore a treasure trove of spiritual literature, enriching their minds and souls with the teachings of these revered masters.\n\nRamakrishna Mission Singapore is more than just a place of worship; it is a sanctuary for the soul, a haven where one can seek refuge from the chaos of the outside world and find inner peace. Whether you are a devout follower or a curious seeker, this is undoubtedly a must-visit destination for anyone in search of tranquility and spiritual enrichment in the heart of Singapore.",
