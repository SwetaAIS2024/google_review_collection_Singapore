Manasi Kumar,1,The receptionist checked my appointment confirmation form and without properly reading it and tried telling me the doctors were busy and I had to come another day. I asked her to check again and then she realized her mistake and proceeded to help me. If you don’t ask them to check their mistakes they will waste your time. A doctor later entered an incorrect weight into an important application and I only happened to double check. Not sure what’s wrong with everyone here.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102479836241326225564/reviews

Rachna Sapehia,1,"It takes a lot of time to receive medicines I have visited here multiple times (bcoz of insurance). But everytime I have to wait for more then an hour to collect my medicines. Somehow today was a bit quick. But then I forgot to collect or doc forgot to provide me with the medical Certificate. So to fix this, I have been calling every number given to me. Its  more then an hour. And its frustrating to have no response.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115869975496286923487/reviews
