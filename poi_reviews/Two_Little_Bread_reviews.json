      "text": "TwoLittleBread@Eco Botanic, the waffles are crispy outside and soft inside, with a great balance of texture. The portion is just right, and the flavors are well-balanced. A cozy spot for a relaxing tea break. The cafÃ© has a nice ambiance, making it a great place to unwind. Their drinks complement the waffles well, and the service is friendly. Worth a visit for a light and satisfying treat!",

However after communication , they waived off.\n\nThen subsequently we added spam fries for snack. When food comes we all stunned . How come it charge us rm 17.90 for 9 spam fries ? We all look at the spam fries all ???\n\nOverall the food and environment are good we will definitely be back for sandwiches and not for their spam fries ðŸ˜…",
