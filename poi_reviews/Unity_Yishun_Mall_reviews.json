      "text": "Not even worth the 1 star! Visited the Unity pharmacy at Blk 417 Yishun Ave 11 at 9.35pm on 28/06/2022. Very disappointed to see the shutters already halfway shut. The staff was very busy pushing in all the trolleys back into the store. All the walkways were blocked by the trolleys. The stuff showed a frustrated look when she saw customers waiting outside, wanting to enter the store. Opening hours clearly states that the store closes at 10pm. If customers were to go in at 9.50pm, it might make sense to see the shutters down, but not at 9.35pm! I was there to purchase some medication for my 2 year old who was not well. I‚Äôm very disappointed and frustrated at the same time.",
