Mikumo Osamu,5,"Long time customer; the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable about different supplies. They let you sample brushes before buying very patiently.

If you aren't picky, they have a discount bin for slightly defected paints or other misc art supplies.

Would highly recommend shopping here for Chinese art supplies over ArtFr13nd for lower prices and better products.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108500982069430813628/reviews
