Shaolin Leong,5,"This stall has been here for 40 years or more ! Ran by an old couple that refused to retire. ðŸ¤£ already 70 plus 80.
I remembered when I was much younger they were the earliest at the market starting making their bean curd at 4 plus in the morning ! The smell of pandan leaves is so wonderful  !
They sell soyamilk and grass jelly drink.
When I shifted here 40 years ago they are already here.90 cents for a big cup ! Where to find ?
Opened on Monday when everyone else is closed !!!
Newly updated timetable is inside 3rd pic.
People come people go but these are the real true heartlanders ! Thank You uncle & aunty !",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116211953093285724040/reviews
