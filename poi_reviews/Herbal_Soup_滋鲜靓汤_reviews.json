I ordered close to closing time, the lady boss always gives me extra ingredients or swaps them out if the pork ribs or the ingredient in the soup run out. I can ask for extra lotus roots without any issues! How come there is one comment by STephy so special one leh, never kena extra ingredients one.",

      "text": "Ordered a lotus root soup at 8plus pm. The taste is alright. Not the worst but nothing spectacular as well. While I do understand that I’m purchasing the soup near to closing hours, I would greatly appreciate it if the owner would kindly pre-empt that there’s not much ingredients left. It’s the FIRST TIME EVER, that I had soup with 2 slices of lotus roots, 2 tiny pieces of pork ribs and 2 huge chicken feet (which I unfortunately don’t eat). Upon feedback to the owner, he mentioned that he typically only give 2 slices of lotus roots to all customers. Wow! Could customers who patronized this store before validate this? I’m quite amazed not in a good way.",
