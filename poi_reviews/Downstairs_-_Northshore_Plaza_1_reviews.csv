CF Chai,4,"One of my favourites brunch place. The price is reasonable and the coffee is good (except sometimes they will forget to add sugar). Usually I go for breakfast set. Luncheon meat bun and coffee cost around $5.50, the bun is crispy, and the set is quite filling. Most of the time the bee hoon will be sold out quite early, so need to be there early if want to eat.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111678080780719700310/reviews
Lyn Tan,4,"Came for lunch at about 1pm++, have to wait awhile to get a table. There is one and only self ordering koisk which isnt that touch sensitive. Curry Chicken taste similar to what we have at homeüëç, but the Chicken Chop Hor Fun was so-so. Still a pleasant dining experience. Kitchen oblidged to more pork lards when we requested for our hor fun. Help yourself to sambal and belcan chili. (Take what you need, dont waste).",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103475245792825286443/reviews
Steven Soo,3,"Overall is good but unfortunately can't experience the retro decor as generally the space was occupied by staff as resting area at 10am +. One of the staff seems to be ill as kept coughing when she was standing at the counter waiting for her food / drink. owner should provide mask if their staff are ill. I had to walk / detour to avoid her coughing to my food when I go collect at the counter üòÇ

It's co sharing space with Song Fa Kway Chap hence you can enjoy different cuisine at one place. The salted chicken (@$9.20) was abit hard and seems like overlooked or was frozen, for it price its definitely not worth it. Maybe next time just order coffee breakfast set instead to avoid disappointment.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102309295159637658350/reviews
Kenneth Khoo,3,"The food options were limited by 7pm. It is recommended to order the food with some additional items. The taste of the food is decent, and the portions are generous. However, be prepared to wait for around 20 minutes as the kitchen is understaffed with only 2 people working at a time. The place is decorated in a vintage style. Overall, if you're looking for a quick meal and are not too particular about high standards or time constraints, this place is suitable for a meal.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103093501586049252845/reviews
KKT,4,"The salted egg chicken ($9.20) is tasty and have crispiness in it, will be good if more gravy to it as eating the rice alone is too dry. Prawn paste chicken ($8) also tasted well, just kinda small and abit dry. Chicken chop hor fun ($7.50) quite nice overall. Larva egg ($1.70) not bad, but sunny side up the York is fully cooked so not as great as it looks in the picture when ordering..",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399770588752359508/reviews
