Elijah Tan,4,"Tried Monster Curry for the first time, and I have to say—the curry is amazing! The flavor is rich, and the spice level adds a nice kick. The portion size is huge—I actually had to pack some to go! Definitely great for sharing or for someone with a big appetite.

The only small downside was the salad; I wish it had more dressing to balance the flavors better. Other than that, everything was delicious. One improvement I’d suggest is for the staff to walk around more, especially in the inner seating areas, so customers don’t have to go all the way to the entrance for assistance.

Overall, a fantastic experience and highly recommended! Will definitely be back for more!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109287346354369266778/reviews
Noah J.,5,"Had a great time at Monster Curry with their different levels of spicy curry.

Surprised to see only 1 server, who acts as the person welcoming you at the entrance, the person who attend to your query and also the person who serves your meal.

Although service was subpar during a dinner service, the food is a great redemption for it.
My choice was the teriyaki chicken. There was crunch and tenderness in the grill.
Will definitely visit Monster Curry again.

Food : 5/5
Service : 3/5 could be improved by adding more staff during dinner service
