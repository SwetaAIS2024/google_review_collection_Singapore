Within the Seed Bank Centre itself are Live laboratories working on seed cleaning and preservation. The Seed Bank centre is fully air conditioned with working elevators and clean washrooms. Admission is free.\nSeveral Seed-theme sculptures were strategically located around the compound of the Seed Bank centre.\nSome interesting displays among them are:\n- Double coconut aka sea coconut seed 海底椰 that look like the female lower body torso. It's the largest plant seed.\n- Water caltrops seed aka buffalo nut 菱角. Water caltrop has been used for worship as prayer offerings by the Chinese.\n- Cheng Tng Plant seed or Kembang Sa-mangkok, 胖大海 is a key ingredient in the Singaporean dessert.",
