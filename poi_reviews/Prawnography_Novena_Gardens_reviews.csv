Billy Lim,5,"Chance upon this shop near the revenue house and tried their hokkien mee & prawn noodle soup.

The hokkien mee is flavourful with wok hey taste, and topped with pork lard and their chilli is superb üëçüèª
For the Prawn noodle soup, the soup is super nice but their noodle is normal.

Recommend for those who like hokkien mee üòãüòãüòã",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109558301923399742564/reviews
MightyFoodie,4,"Prawnography Novena Gardens is not just about Hokkien mee or prawn noodles. Their kaya toast is crisp, buttery  paired with rich, fragrant kaya and creamy butter.

Kinda of disappointed with the Hokkien mee as it should be their signature there is no wok hei. Overall like quite a normal plate of Hokkien mee.

cycelia lim,1,"Have been here a few times previously and the flavour has changed. Dry prawn noodles tasted like tomato sauce from canned sardines.
Hokkien mee does not have the same level of wok hei as before.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112749696231618604039/reviews
Han Wong,3,"The taste can't compare to their branch at balestier Plaza, the chef here could not cook the hkm with the strong wok hei. And the hkm at this branch is wet compared to balestier branch. Photos one from Novena the wet one, the other one is from balestier, you can see the difference in the color of the noodles.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116837239724454897655/reviews
K,5,"Best Hokkien mee in singapore

What's great?
Same quality in return visit after one year. Tiger Prawn Deluxe Hokkien Mee for 2pax ($15). This is absolutely yummy, full of wok hey you can smell when served to you. Can feed 3 pax if you are small eater.
Yang Zhou Fried rice with chicken cutlet. Fried rice is much better than those in Cze char. Chicken cutlet is big and crispy.

What's to improve?
Nothing yet.

Visit again?
