      "text": "üìç Kovan MRT Exit B (5 min walk)\nüí∞ Expected damage $5 - 15\n\nInitially the store was Fat Cat Ice cream but now rebranded to Fatto Catto. Specialised in serving ceremonial grade matcha that is sourced from Japan and China. I tried their signature Maneki-Neko and the matcha is bitter and incredibly smooth. Once mixed together with the milk, it has a nice balance between the bitter notes and the sweetness of the milk. Honestly, I am not experienced enough to tell you the finer nodes of matcha.\n\nThe waffle on the other hand is so perfectly crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. The outer layer is slightly burnt which gives a hint of bitterness but the drizzle of maple syrup masks the flavour. Very underrated for waffles from cafe to hit this level of perfection.\n\nI have tried the watermelon and yuzu sorbet flavours which are very refreshing and good to combat the hot SG weather. Overall, definitely do come check this place out for a drink and snacks along with all the cafes around the area.\n\nThe staff are very warm and welcoming. I can see they are dedicated to their craft at serving quality goods to their customers.",

One of the best matcha I've had in Singapore. Would be perfect if there were more seats, but still worth the visit!",
