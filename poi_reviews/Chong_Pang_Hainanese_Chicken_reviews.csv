Agnatta Teng,5,"1 of the better Hainanese Chicken Rice around. The chicken meat is very soft and tender. The sauce that comes with the meat is really tasty and goes very well with the rice.

Only $3.80 for Chicken Breast meat with rice and $5 for Chicken Thigh with rice. Honestly, it’s not only nice, it’s also cheap.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102986467512829632835/reviews
