Meat given was meagre and amount of chilli given is stingy!\n\nWhen asked how much, she was unable to even tell me verbally with such simple calculation. She had to punch out the numbers using calculator!\n\nRead the other reviews and you will know what I meant! I only found out after trying to google about this stall.",

After so many years, I tried looking for it again when I happen to pop by AV. Right at the corner of the hawker center and opp back of Ah Seng Durian stall (AV branch). I recall there used to be a tyre shop and I think it's gone now....\n\nOrder a plate of char hou fan which consist of char siew and roast pork. The char siew is the dark type....probably using slightly darker sauce and well marinated. The roast pork could be crispier. The sauce is thick and might be overly sweet.\n\nWon't say it taste bad but I thought it used to be better.....different from the usual char siew rice but with so much sauce on it, might not be a healthy option..... Guess with age, getting  more health conscious now. üòÜ",

The dark sauce is dark and taste ordinary. Sorry but it‚Äôs just not that good. Hope they find out how to improve it to how I experienced it when home delivered.",
