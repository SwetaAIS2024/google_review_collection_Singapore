Doraemon,4,"Today, on my way to work, I made a quick stop at the canteen in Pioneer Sector 2. It had been a while since I visited, and there were some new stalls to check out. I decided to give Roasted Delight a try, and I'm so glad I did!

Roasted Delight is a simple stall run by a friendly Chinese national.  I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious their roasted meat and char siew were.  I ordered a mix of both, and they really loaded up the portions.  It was incredibly generous for just $5!

The meat was tender and flavorful, and the char siew had a lovely glaze.  It was a perfect combination of savory and sweet.  The owner was also very friendly and welcoming, making my morning routine even more enjoyable.

It was a great way to start my day, and I'm definitely going to make a point of stopping by again sometime.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious and affordable breakfast option in the area.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112665277904119154671/reviews
