      "text": "Feel like the reviews are exaggerating on their poor experience so I’m here to share mine and some “instructions” on how they operate.\n\nIt’s a small tuck shop run by neighbourhood aunties and uncles, they’re polite and they do their job but don’t expect first class treatment and friendly chit chat (unless you are a regular). I haven’t had a bad experience and the aunties are usually very nice, in an Asian auntie way (one time she allowed me to exchange some vegetables - I bought the wrong ones and went back 5mins later to check if she wanted to take it back while I bought the right ones. She took back the “wrong” veg, didn’t charge me for the new ones which were slightly cheaper and even refunded me the difference).\n\nThe prices are also slightly higher than large chain supermarkets but that’s expected, I would say it’s just a few cents more for most products and worth it for the convenience if this is nearer to your place. They also have a wide selection of stuff from fresh produce to snacks and canned food.\n\nIf there is a long queue, it usually forms outside the shop along the corridor as there isn’t much space inside. Join the queue from there! If you are collecting the parcel just join the queue and inform them you are collecting along with your pin.",

Approach the uncle inside supermarket for my collection showing him the details but all he uttered was \"hmm hmm?\" and raised his voice later asking for pin code. Man doesn't know how to speak human language at all. If your day isn't bad enough and would like to get some nasty attitude/treatment, highly recommended for you to check out this place :)",

Cashier uncle's attitude was extremely bad, raised voice for no apparent reason, no clear instructions whatsoever. He asked for the order number but did not specify what order number or OTP and did not clarify himself. When I tried to clarify, he started to raise his voice. Never patronise this place, do not ever send anything from Shopee/Lazada for collection. I would rather pay more for doorstep delivery and walk to Sunshine Place or Lot 1 to purchase groceries instead of patronising this place.",
