They even help by fetching my child from school after enrichment classes and keeping them engaged with many different activities during holidays and HBL (home-based learning) days. The teachers and staff at RTC are incredibly friendly, accommodating, and always approachable. I truly appreciate their dedication and care for the children. Thank you, Mindspace @ RTC, for your excellent service!",
