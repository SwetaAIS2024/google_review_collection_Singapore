Eng Siong Lee,3,"Nicely decorated and clean. However, it is stuffy inside and AC is like non existing. Service is fast and prompt. Kopi O if good and reasonably priced at $1.40. The curry puff however is expensive and without much filling as you can see from the picture. Don't think I'll come back again.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117619938862194347916/reviews
Katherinei Ng,3,"I ordered a cake and to be collected at this outlet. I stood at the cashier there for awhile and the male and auntie staffs seem busy‚Ä¶ they saw me, but ignored at first‚Ä¶ so i thought to myself, maybe they are busy, so i shall wait‚Ä¶ the auntie, saw that i didnt walked away, asked me ‚Äúwhat u want‚Äù in non friendly tone. I showed her my order email and told her that im here for my cake collection. She turned her back away, told me she dont rmb got any cake collection. I explained to her that its a mango cake, and if she liked to see the email.her face turned black immediately, then from then, she muted all the way, from cake checking to asking me to sign the order paper. I can sense such a huge unfriendliness from this outlet. The guy staff also not helpful at all.

To add on, i saw the responses from polar are always we will improve and let us serve u better in next visit, since years ago‚Ä¶ i shall see if they will respond this again‚Ä¶ and be frank, seems like their service didnt improve despite so many ppl complaining‚Ä¶
Bad service for compassOne and sengkang hosp outlet.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103027662668546879572/reviews
GH L (Zora),3,"I had a very disappointing experience at Polar. When I politely asked about the cakes, the staff shouted at me to ""ÊéíÈòüÔºÅ"" ‚Äî even though I was simply trying to ask a question. This is not just a one-time issue; I had saw a similar experience at compass one Polar. It‚Äôs clear that this company lacks proper management and has no sense of customer service. I won‚Äôt be coming back, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone who values respectful service",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104843795075014263706/reviews
Warewofs,5,"Update: The long chairs have been replaced now, so you don't need to worry about sliding off one.

The long chairs need to be changed to heavier ones because I almost fell off one üò≠ I sat on one side so the other side lifted up and I almost slid/fell off. Otherwise the food‚Äôs alright and service is alright too! I love the atmosphere as well, clean and quiet spot to relax at.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113539159241749420147/reviews
ÈòøÂÆù,3,"It is a quiet cafe located in the Seng Kang General Hospital (SKGH).

No crowd on a Sunday afternoon so is good for people who visit the patients before or after visiting hour.

The coffee& snacks are served in paper cups & plastic plates. Save water as no washing is required  but bad for environment though‚Ä¶

Just an average cafe but good enough to spend a couple of hours if you happens to be in SKGH.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews
