suwei lim,5,"Really delicious katsu, the chef really knows what he is doing and he guides the customer into eating each dish to properly enjoy it. I ordered the fatless pork, and it was surprisingly good because fat usually adds more flavour to a Katsu, but the fatless one was just as good. The sashimi was really generous, one of the thickest pieces I ever encountered and the breaded scallops were mesmerising as well ✨✨. Reservations have to be made beforehand due to the small number of customers, but I believe the restaurant format where the chef cooks in front of you makes this experience a pleasant one.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105490851083336024318/reviews
Jonathan Ang,5,"Fantastic katsu. We tried 2 kinds of meat cuts - both were fantastic! The Hire cut was especially impressive - it was perfectly cooked such that it was amazingly tender and juicy despite it being a leaner cut. Your orders come with free flow rice and cabbage salad, both of which were surprisingly great! Overall a great dining experience!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101193920295862962205/reviews
Joshua Mei,5,Had the rosu katsu and the unagi katsu. Both were delicious; the meat was tender and not dry and breaded just right. The meat is breaded and cooked on the spot. First time trying an unagi katsu and we were pleasantly surprised at how well done it was. The rice is also refillable.,4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103509151453836901120/reviews
Feng Yi Chew,5,"Edited (Jan 2025) - the standard of the food and service is consistently stellar. You can never go wrong with any of their spectacular katsu offerings!

Tried the dory katsu and ebi tarutaru (fried shrimp with homemade tartar sauce and leeks) for the first time this visit, and both were excellent. Was particularly wowed by how moist and tasty the dory katsu was, given that it is a less-oily, milder-tasting fish by nature.

Best place in Singapore for katsu - no horse run!

Edited (July 2024) to add on to my original review:

Have been back twice in the last two weeks, and feel as though I could return on a weekly basis - it’s just so delicious (and not oily or surfeiting in the least, which can be the case with some katsus or deep-fried food, generally speaking).

Dining at Katsuya is truly a heartwarming, homely experience - Chef Kervin and Candra are unfailingly jovial and welcoming, which is even more impressive given how the two of them are basically doing everything by themselves, and all at once.

The lamb and Hokkaido rosu katsu remain my favourites, but like I mentioned, you can’t go wrong with anything you pick. I thought the unagi was even tastier this time round, and was also fortunate to try their curry sauce on my past two visits.

The curry sauce has a vegetarian base so non-beef eaters can savour it too (very thoughtful of them). I wouldn’t have guessed as it is rich and hearty, and pairs a charm with the leaner hire katsu. Please pre-order this (along with their other off-menu specials like the lamb, hotate, and salmon) - you won’t regret it!

Enjoyed chatting with Chef Kervin after our most recent meal and learned about his affinity for Japanese knives and sharpening stones. Greatly appreciate and admire his passion for his craft - especially his unwavering dedication to quality.

Katsuya will continue to have my full suppork! 🔪🐷👨‍🍳 >> 😋

Original review (May 2024):
Nothing but praises for this cosy, counter-seating only establishment, where Chef Kervin single-handedly dishes out what I daresay is the finest katsu in Singapore.

Assisted by his wife Candra, who made sure our teacups never ran dry and happily acceded to my (incessant) requests to top up rice and shredded cabbage, Chef Kervin offers a wide variety of katsus - from the traditional hire and rosu pork cuts, to seafood like unagi and scallop.

Whatever you opt for is bound to be deliciously crispy with absolutely no hint of grease or rancidity, as Chef Kervin has mastered deep-frying at its finest. The golden-brown panko coating is delicate and not stodgy at all, resulting in a lovely crunch as you bite into the tender protein within.

I am partial to the Hokkaido rosu katsu and the off-menu lamb katsu (please order this ahead), as the thin strips of fat in both of these cuts add an even more satisfying richness to the overall mouthfeel. That being said, I enjoyed everything else I tried as well, and would not hesitate to reorder just about anything on the menu.

Bonus points for the steaming hot and fluffy Japanese rice which I would happily eat bowlfuls of (and did) by itself, with pickled radish - and the thinly-shredded Japanese cabbage drizzled with the house-made sesame dressing, which provided an incredibly refreshing counterpoint to the katsu.

Katsuya’s prices may appear steep compared to other katsu places out there, but is absolutely justifiable given the sheer quality of the ingredients and Chef Kervin’s craftsmanship. He is exacting about how you should enjoy the katsus (try plain, dab in salt, etc etc), and I suggest listening to him as he definitely knows what he’s talking about.

Really enjoyed chatting with Chef Kervin and Candra, and appreciated their warm hospitality. Will be back again for sure!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116313414378881716551/reviews
Maycia Hong,5,"Delectable quality pork cutlets, good sake and warm crew service that made our evening joyful. The pork cutlets were well textured with flavors and crispness. Nice Ebi dish too.
Our 2nd time and we're  with friends. All of us love it especially your off menu Scallops. Thumbs up for good food and sake.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100431621895525705597/reviews
