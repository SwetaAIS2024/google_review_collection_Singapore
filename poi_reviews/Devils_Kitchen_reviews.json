We tried the battered fried shiitake mushrooms, mushroom soup, pan seared halibut and salmon served with 2 sides (mashed potatoes & barley salad), and carbonara, they did NOT disappoint! Though the bill came up to ~$90 but the dishes were tasty and to my liking, particularly the fish (I’m a foodie and fussy with fish). I’d go back again from the north.",

However, this burger for example, had a really big portion, and definitely will be enough for you to feel satiated for a long while.\n\nDo note that there is usually only one person working, so waiting times may take a little while if there are other customers dining in as well.",
