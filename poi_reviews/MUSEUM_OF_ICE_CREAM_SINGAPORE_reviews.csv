Gopi Nallaiyan,3,This is just a ice cream stalls with kids play areas. Five type of play areas for kids with free unlimited quantity of the limited available flavours of ice creams in each areas. Overhyped tourist attraction with nothing for an adult tourist. Definitely not worth for the money paid to visit this tourist attraction.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117717395531505414734/reviews

We indulged in 𝐔𝐍𝐋𝐈𝐌𝐈𝐓𝐄𝐃 𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐦 (seasonal flavors) (yes, really!) with treats in 𝟓 𝐝𝐢𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 from Denzy, Ben & Jerry’s, and more — plus surprise popcorn station too!

The place is bursting with 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐦𝐦𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐬𝐩𝐨𝐭𝐬, laughter, and sugar-filled smiles.

Pavethira SN,3,"An obviously over hyped spot with a pricey entrance ticket they won’t accept cash. Remember if you are going as a group you can’t mix premium and standard tickets in the same bookings, they will ask to upgrade the standard to premium in spot. Not well connected with the metro and you got to relay on taxis. The themed rooms were picturesque whereas the taste of the ice cream was nothing special. Even though it is unlimited ice cream you won’t be in position to eat much due to the design of the menu and the place. The sprinkler pit was enjoyable but if you miss your belongings the employees will not definitely not help you as they have already mentioned. Be care with your mobiles, wallets and any other valuables while entering the pit. It’s a uni directional museum where one can’t re enter the past rooms.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110456655737767856951/reviews
