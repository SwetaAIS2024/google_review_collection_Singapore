ÈòøÂÆù,4,"If you want your food fast & hot to be served quick on a busy day, this place is an ideal one to go.

My girl has tight schedules on weekends and we always dine here in between her tuition classes because from taking order to serving food to cleaning up the table, the staff really work very fast and which is what we need & like ü•∞ü•∞

The food dishes economically priced & also in good portions, which is another reason why we like it :-)",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108495315646650484631/reviews
