This CS Fresh is large, convenient, and holistic. This outlet does have the core things that most other CS Fresh outlets would carry (fresh produce, groceries, etc), including fresh food stands (salads, sushi, ham and cheese, grilled meats).\n\nLocated on the basement of Raffles City, it's connected to City Hall MRT and all the transportation options around; you really can't complain.",
