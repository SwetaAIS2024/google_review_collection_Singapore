Sudhir Mane,5,"Overall, a great place for a budget stay in Singapore. The hotel is located close to the Rochor MRT station (downtown line).  The dormitory and washrooms were clean. The staff was quite helpful. Hot water for making tea/coffee or cup noodles was provided. The AC provided sufficient cooling. Every bed comes with a locker that can fit a duffel bag. They also offer luggage storage facility.

The bathroom was spacious and hot water was available in the shower area.  The hotel is located close to many eateries and supermarkets. It'd have been nice if drinking water was also provided without any additional charge.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100698493822099177043/reviews
Brad Lee,5,Affordable stay in a central location in Little India. Right next to the Rochor station on the downtown line and bus stops that can take you to most places you'd wanna go. Staff are very friendly and helpful if you're looking for ideas on things to do!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113479817472066394727/reviews
Benny Octavian,5,"I spent 4 nights for family holiday in Singapore, we rent family room with bunk beds, bathroom & toilet inside.

Located just in front of Rochor MRT station and nearby bus stop it is very strategic and ease our trip around the city.

The lodge has  Air Conditioner, hot water and strong WiFi connection, the room was clean and dry, perfect. Only a bit noise came from across the room where there's KTV/music lounge that last until midnight but not really that noisy.

Staffs was very friendly and helpful. Overall it was very good experience staying here.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108265442404003260936/reviews
Ilse,3,"Fine hostel on a great location. The hosts are really great as well, and have many tips on where you can go best in the city and what to see and how to get there. However, it was pretty expensive, but Singapore is expensive.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104017541663753405167/reviews
Nenek Kembar,5,"Ini dia hostel yang aku ingin kan. Yang walaupun sharing bathroom tp ada di dalam kamar masing2. I love this hotel. And so clean. Sangat bersih. Petugas baik dan ramah. Kekurangan satu aja, ga ada breakfast. Yang lain nya? Ok banget. Bakal kesini lg kalo ke singapore. I think adamson lodge one of the best hostel in singapore. MRT in front of hostel and so near with mosque. Thats what I need. More halal food too. U will get all what u need. Love it.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107537326972164730477/reviews
