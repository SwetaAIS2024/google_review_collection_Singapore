Q. A'yuni,5,"I had warm experience during my visit. The doctor was exceptionally kind and friendly, making me feel safe and validated throughout the consultation. The staff was equally professional and cheerful, creating a welcoming atmosphere that lifted my spirits even though I wasn’t feeling my best. Visit on 12/1/25, around 1030am.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112636408647452832324/reviews

Chan Junhao,4,"Despite reading the recent bad reviews of this clinic, I still went ahead to this clinic for consultation as I was feeling too weak from being ill and was reluctant to walk too far.

I arrived at the clinic at 10:38am, did the usual registration and was given a queue number 4 patients away. At 10:53am, I ended my consultation with Dr Kenneth who was knowledgeable and showed thoughtfulness for his patients. Then at 10:58am, I collected my medicine and made payment and went my way home.

In and out of the clinic in 20 minutes with diagnosis and medication collected. Quite efficient if you ask me. Sure you can always expect/demand a higher standard of service, but I think today’s experience served my needs reasonably.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118191285460277322025/reviews
Phoo Phoo Htike Htar San,1,"The doctor was professional however the front reception has the worst attitude ever, they act as if I owe them a living.
Honestly very disappointed, with the lady in glasses who seems to be very rude. Please train your staff properly, saw so many bad reviews about reception, and they were right.
If only I have gotten her name, I will mention her name but she looks chinese with glasses.

If you are not happy to work, please resign.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103070139621989396686/reviews
