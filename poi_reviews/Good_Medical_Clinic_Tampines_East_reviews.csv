Nadzirah,5,"My child was seen by Dr Wei & it was indeed a pleasant experience. Not only was Dr Wei gentle with him, Dr Wei explained our concerns throughly. As a FTM, his answers & advices made me more confident in caring for my sick child. Thank you Dr Wei for the excellent care.

The receptionists (Jannah & another malay lady) were also helpful in making sure the registration was smooth. I noticed that there was a crowd of ppl but they cleared them swiftly.

Definitely recommended for families with kids. There's also a small area for kids to sit & read books.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103384157607013589452/reviews

ong si qi,5,"Went to Good Medical Clinic to get my parents’ LPA certified. Doctor Wei can converse well in Chinese and the entire process was fast and smooth.

Jolyne Ang,1,"Visited the clinic again because i was there a week ago and i didn't get better. Registration closed at 10.30am when i arrived, but opening hours was 8am-12pm. Made a wasted trip, not very nice for patients who are feeling unwell so i think if you were to close registration earlier than stated, it would be nice to state it online. Thank you",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103783360133327665591/reviews
