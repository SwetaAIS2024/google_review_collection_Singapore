Ken Peh,4,"Had the zhi char here at this Kim San Leng kopitiam. Was really surprised! I ordered the standard hor fun. The minute I had the first mouthful, a sudden nostalgic wave went through my mind, and I find myself back in the 90s or early 2000s, which the real Singapore zhi char taste, before the current flavors are diluted by fusions or too many foreign cultures. The wok hei of the Hor Fun was so strong it was unbelievable. How can such a good zhi char be located within an Industrial Park!? Highly recommended. Words cant express the taste. Come over and try it.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113975004215945002265/reviews
