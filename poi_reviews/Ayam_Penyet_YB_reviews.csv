owen,4,"Ordered the Boneless Chicken Sambal Taliwang ($6.50) for jasmine rice. Additional $0.50 if coconut rice.

The Sambal is the main star, holding the dish together. Portion and offerings are normal in any penyet store. Soup was nice, tauhu and tempeh were also great.

The sambal had a slight kick, had a nutty essence to it. Only drawback was that the boneless chicken had more of a flaky breast meat texture, which did not really hit that hard with the sambal. Its decent, I wouldn't say its anything out of the ordinary.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101656162678057556658/reviews

Muhd Fawwaz,5,Best Ayam penyet around . Been heading there for years . The taste from the sambal to even the soup is just awesome . Not even the 'ayam penyet giants' are close to this in term of the taste .  I would recommend to buy ayam penyet mozzarella for the best experience.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111595016601026248671/reviews
