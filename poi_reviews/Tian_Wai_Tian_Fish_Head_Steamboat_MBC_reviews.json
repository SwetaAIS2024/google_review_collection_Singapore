      "text": "Fish steamboat- $35 which is full of veggies, fresh fish (three types to choose from), yam. The soup at the start tastes a bit bland but it deepens in flavour after a while. I liked the soup cos its flavourful and doesnt feel like there's much msg. Plus i liked that its \"clean\" - cos many other fish soup gets \"dirty\" due to remnants from other ingredients.\n\nSambal kangkong fairly decent. It was well cooked, the stems were crunchy.\n\nOyster egg- this was a pleasant surprise. On menu it looked normal but in reality the omelette was cooked in Thai street style.\n\nPrices are reasonable; the total is just slightly above $60. For zichar in food court concept and also with aircon - I will return to try other dishes.",

It’s formed a queue….they need to improve with QR ordering.\nWaited 45 mins for the 1st dish to be served.\nThereafter the rest of the dishes are served promptly\nLiked the steamboat broth flavorful with yam & umi. The rest of the dishes are tasty as well.\nPricing is reasonable",

      "text": "We had an amazing dining experience at Tian Wai Tian Fishhead Steamboat—a true gem that has stood the test of time since 1983! Their signature Teochew-style fish head steamboat was a standout—comforting, flavorful, and filled with fresh fish and vegetables in a rich, savory broth that warms the soul.\n\nWe also tried the Sambal Lala, which was incredibly tasty with just the right amount of spice, and the Tofu Prawns—a delightful dish with silky tofu and juicy prawns bathed in a fragrant, savory sauce.\nEvery dish was well-executed and full of flavor.\n\nThe staff were friendly and attentive, and the restaurant had a bright, welcoming vibe.\nWith its delicious food and comforting atmosphere, Tian Wai Tian is perfect for both family dinners and gatherings with friends.\n\nThe beautiful flower stands at the entrance added a lovely festive touch. Definitely worth a visit if you’re craving hearty, traditional Teochew steamboat and more!\n\nHighly recommended!",
