Victor Ng,4,"Mee Siam 👍
Balanced taste with great sambal tumis.

Begedil 👍
Aromatic and tasty.

Beef rendang 🫲
Meat was very soft and tender. But rather salty and lacked the smell of daun kunyit.

Longtong 🫲
Flavor was more curry than lemak. Gravy was very well infused into the toufu and vegetables but too much MSG used.

Sambal goreng 👎
Very salty.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115343125507441223772/reviews
Sam Abdul,5,"As it was difficult to find Malay stalls in Ang Mo Kio, especially around my area at block 30*, I googled & found out about this Malay stall, Rosnah's Family Kitchen, at Blk 628. The reviews about this stall were quite good, hence I proceeded to try it out. Well, it does meet its reputation as an affordable & good Malay cuisine. It has quite a range of dishes that even look enticing. I ordered a plate of rice topped with chicken in spicy coconut gravy, sambal brinjal & fried egg that was quite cheap compared to some other stalls that I went to &, well, to put it simply, it was good & tasty, unsurprisingly! I would definitely come again & would recommend it to my relatives & friends. The service was outstanding, the servers were good, friendly & wasn't stingy with the servings. They even banter with their customers whenever they are not busy. I even took some pictures of them! I would recommend this stall to those who want to have their hungry stomach filled with sumptuous Malay dishes that are tasty & affordable 👍👍👍.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103330093236737396961/reviews

Dawn Lim,4,"The Nasi Padang here is not bad and reasonably priced. I bought two sets of Nasi Padang with a total of 7 dishes (3 meat, 3 veggies, 1 fish cake) + another 2 fried chicken on the side for $20.50. This is considered quite reasonable for Nasi Padang today. In many other places, $10 will get you 1 meat and 2 veggies.

The dishes are on the saltier side though so be sparing with the sauce. I added too much gravy and it was pretty salty. Quite sure my BP went up after the meal 😂.

The queue here can get quite long during weekend lunch hours.

Overall, an acceptable place for Nasi Padang.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113563695447323499189/reviews
Lee Jun Hao Kelvin,2,Went down to buy the chicken set in the morning. Several patrons before me got their orders and it’s frustrating to see the owners accepting new orders while I wait and wait.  I ran out of patience when  my order is not even being prepared after 35 mins. The food is good and if their service does improve I might consider giving this another chance.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113534905163726185656/reviews
