Z Z,4,"Dr Grace has been our trusted PD since our 1st child was born. She was recommended by our gynae Dr Claudine, just around the corner.

She‚Äôs able to put parents at ease and so far has been great in treating our kid.

My recommendation is that a proper queue management system should be invested in, something that can least give a number or phone call to prevent parents waiting around. This should be a key consideration given the amount of intermingling happening at the waiting area.

Dr Grace is a good PD but the admin management should definitely be improved on üëç",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107239336495023646939/reviews
Casper Sim,5,"Very clean, bright and conducive. Am here for baby‚Äôs vaccination and the overall feeling makes you feel comfortable and at ease. The waiting time is also reasonable. Recommended.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117252573451981576119/reviews
Wanga,1,"Tbh this place is a scam. The doctor did not examine the baby and just brush off whatever worries we had with a ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs usual‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs normal‚Äù comments. For that, we paid close to $300. There was NO medication given.
So normal and usual, why is the bill so high?

Not sure why the doctor was highly reviewed or if the reviews were paid.
The doctor gave off a laid back vibe that she is just there to earn your money and couldn‚Äôt give more thought to anything else.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109266329478172341849/reviews

Steph,5,"Dr Grace is a very professional, kind and great pediatrician. She was able to diagnose our child‚Äôs illness accurately and quickly which allowed us to get immediate attention and care. Her staff and nurses are very caring and friendly as well. She has always been our go to pediatrician since both our boys were born and my eldest is turning 6. We are truly grateful for Dr Grace and her team. Thank you!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118199508860633802118/reviews
