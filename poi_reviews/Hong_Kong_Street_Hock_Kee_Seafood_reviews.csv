Yong L,1,"- Poor staff attitude.
- Poor service.
- Food quality and quantity is just like any other zhi char stall.
- No cutlery but it is ok with me.
- Ordered and paid $1.5($3 in total for 2x eggs) for a fried egg each to both rice. Came home only to find out there is none. Called the stall and they requested for a photo. Your cook and staff left it out and you have the cheek to demand otherwise. I will take it as giving $3, doing charity to your business. $3 is a darn “big horse chariot wheel” to you.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107225568265737125930/reviews

Xavier Chng,5,"Had a great meal here. Service was prompt and friendly. Ask for their recommendations. It'll never go wrong. Fish soup, chilli crab, fried chicken wings, sweet and sour pork were executed well. Will definitely go back again!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116551972140038991660/reviews
Fab C,4,"Decent food at typical Singapore prices. Small cereal prawns $20 and only got 4 prawns was a disappointment,  chicken was tasteless, sweet potato leaves over cooked. Pleasant atmosphere.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107660703838315074541/reviews
