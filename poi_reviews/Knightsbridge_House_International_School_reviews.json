      "text": "This is the first international school my son ever attended that builds confidence, forms best impressions and makes all kids feel valued and supported. Adherence to the best values helps kids develop a global mindset,   build friendships, help those in need - it's exactly the environment you want the kid to develop within. Thanks to wise leadership and forward thinking strategy, the school has grown fast, got Cambridge accredited and onboarded the best teachers. If I had to choose, I'd select it as an entire kindergarten through university school for my child, the decision you'd never regret.",
