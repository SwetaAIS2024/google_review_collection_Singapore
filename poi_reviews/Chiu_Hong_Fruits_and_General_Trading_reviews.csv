Henna K,1,"I bought cut fruits from them twice (2 weeks ago and yesterday). Two weeks ago ones, 2 out of 4 pieces were few days old, not fresh. Yesterday, out of 5 pieces, only 2 pieces were fresh (see photos). The other 3 pieces (watermelon, rockmelon and papaya) were few days old and can't be eaten at all! I have to throw them in the chute! Wasted my money! The woman boss look like she's not interested to do business. Don't waste your money here ;(",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101337172765115801834/reviews
chew irene,1,"On 13/4/25 @8am ,my mum n me went to Blk 57 Marine Terrace #01-107 fruit stall to buy fruits. My mum ask the  Chinese lady to pick for us 10 mangoes that cost $12 .
5 dark red plums $5 n 5 peaches $6
Charges us $21
But when reach home, realise it’s only 9 mangoes n 4 dark red plums n 2 peaches.
My mum went back to the stall n told the lady but she insist she didn’t gave us wrong amount.
I found it when I came back from church services.
This is to inform public not to purchase from the stall or a lesson for us to pick n take ourselves.
Cheating to regular customers is very bad!!
We will not go back to the stall anymore.
The fruit stall is located at Blk 57 Marine Terrace #01-107 Singapore440057
The stall is located at the second shop next to POSB ATM n in between the Blk 59 Coffee shop .I hope the boss of this shop please take seriously on your staff not honest n to look on this matter carefully. It’s will run away all customers .",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117857104446223187253/reviews
kayden Tan,1,"I asked a staff member if the watermelons were ripe, and she confidently said they were. Wanting to be sure, I asked her a few times how I could tell if a watermelon was ripe. After dodging my question, she finally snapped and said, ""All the watermelons are unripe, don't buy.""

Her response was rude, and it felt like she was deliberately misleading me from the start. The lack of honesty and respect was really disappointing. I definitely wouldn’t recommend buying from here.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107161627903667025602/reviews
