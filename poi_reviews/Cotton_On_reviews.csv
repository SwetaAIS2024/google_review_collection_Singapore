Ilisha R,5,I absolutely love cotton on. I think it's one of the best stores to buy clothes. I'm very small and skinny and generally find it hard to find things that fit well.,8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116487511097713937117/reviews

Fariha Khurshid,1,"Horrible customer service! There was only a small heavily pregnant girl - the only staff handling this mega store, & the item I needed had only 1 in stock in my size, according to the website & their system. She went into the store room, & shortly after coming back she said that the buttons were unravelling (which I didn't mind) from that piece. I wanted to take a look at the item condition but then she said that the stitches from the lining were unravelling. When I still insisted on seeing the item, she simply refused to show me, even after a lot of request. She said she won't sell it (like she owns the store). She didn't even want to look for the item in the storeroom, & she took off her mask to talk to me louder to make her point. If it was tough for her to lift heavy items in the storeroom as she was highly pregnant, she could have just asked for help or could have delegated the job to her next colleague & or could have advised me to come back another day so she could have more time to look for it. Instead she kept lying, & changing her statements. And after all that she kept asking me to look at her computer screen, showing that there indeed was 1 in stock. What was the point of that? Why wouldn't she show me the item?",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111629169781208540891/reviews
