Jeanette,4,"Be prepared for some waiting time as seating is limited even during off peak hours. They offer a variety of ingredients and soup bases to choose from, catering to different preferences. Their signature is the collagen pork broth soup, which is rich and flavorful. While the broth is enjoyable, it can feel a bit too rich and thick toward the end of the meal. There is a 10% discount for your next visit upon making payment at the counter.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106802533129560931521/reviews
Nathania Callista,4,"I‚Äôve try several soup to compare and all is good, tasty ! The tomyum one so fresh with the lime and the broth also thick ! The chicken aroma so strong you can feel it so nice! Just the -1 things that not good is the veggie too much boiled so it‚Äôs mushy like overcooked. Overall worth to try!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102199711526848937980/reviews
Cayla Tan,3,"Overall disappointed with the mala here.

They don‚Äôt have normal mala tang, they are all flavoured (tom yum, beef, collagen). Additionally, the dry mala was not what we expected at all. The mala was not stir fried; everything was boiled and plain. The mala sauce was given at the side and for you to mix it in. While the spice was indeed nice and ‚Äúma,‚Äù the texture of the noodles and ingredients really ruined the entire taste. The noodles had gotten so soggy and mushy.. Really not your usual mala. Maybe some might like it (their ingredients are decent!), but i was disappointed and would not come back",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113251348641070023350/reviews
Ken W,5,"The beef broth was spicy even when I ordered ÂæÆËæ£, but it was perfect after I added the plain soup midway through.

The ingredients are fresh and tasty üëç",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111469334813473591346/reviews
bethany,2,"food was okay. service was so horrendous
my friend and i decided to eat ygf around 1.30pm++ on a thursday afternoon. we wanted to sit at table with 4 seats by the window.

right after the people sitting there left, the staff started cleaning up the tables and blatantly took out a huge ‚ÄúRESERVED‚Äù sign to put on the table even though we were waiting right in front of it??? huh??? so we decided to seperate the tables into two-seaters since we wanted the window seats.

after leaving our bottles on the table, we went to get our ingredients for our mala. however, the staff that put out the ‚ÄúRESERVED‚Äù sign on the table came out and scolded us harshly for it. in her words: ‚Äúthe tables are for 4 people and cannot be seperated. how will people sit if you seperate them??‚Äù then proceeded to move our bottles and dump them on some random table even though we followed her and wanted to move our bottles away ON OUR OWN.

apart from her rude behaviour, what made us even angrier was that there was NO QUEUE as it was a random weekday afternoon. there were so many empty tables around, what was she fussing about for?? plus one of the other staff on break was seating ALONE on a 4 seater table?? like the hypocrisy please???

after we got our food, we witnessed another 2 older ladies going up to sit at the 4 seater table‚Ä¶ why did the staff not direct them to the many other EMPTY 2 SEAT TABLES THEN???

this was actually such a foul and ridiculous experience. please train your staff better. service staff are not supposed to show your freaking attitude and be rude because you think some younger customers look like pushovers.
