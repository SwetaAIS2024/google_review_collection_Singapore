Annabel Joy,5,"My biggest thanks and gratitude to the entire team who attended to my 8 year old daughter earlier this evening.

She had a pretty bad fall while cycling down the slope and sustained a couple of cuts and bruises.

Thankfully, the team was around today to assist her in getting medical attention, not to mention the fact that while treating her wounds, the staff in the team was kindly reassuring her and was really gentle in bandaging her wounds for her.

These are services that you never truly know that you need until you’re caught in an emergency situation.

Thank you for all the hard work and your dedication to helping the people and commuters in the area! We won’t forget your kindness!

Best,

Kevin Tay,5,"To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to express my deepest gratitude to the six Red Cross first aiders from Punggol / Coney Island who provided exceptional assistance on 17 August 2024.

My friends and I, a group of ten, were cycling at Coney Island and along the Punggol Park Connector Network when one of our team members unfortunately had a serious fall and was badly injured. The prompt response of the Red Cross first aiders was nothing short of remarkable. They treated my friend swiftly, assessed the situation thoroughly, and coordinated the activation of an ambulance and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), recognizing that the terrain could hinder direct access to the casualty.

I was truly impressed by the efficiency of the response system that the Red Cross has in place. The way these first aiders managed to reach the injured person quickly, administer the most appropriate care, and facilitate the rapid arrival of the ambulance and SCDF ensured that my friend was transported to the nearest hospital as quickly as possible.

The six heroes I would like to commend from First Aiders on wheels @ Punggol are:

1. Ian Chia
2. Kashif
3. Dave Ng
4. Carmelo Yabot
5. Ming Wee Goh
6. Tan Kah Ooi

Additionally, I would like to extend a special thank you to the ambulance staff and the SCDF team for their vital role in assisting on 17 August 2024.

Your dedication and professionalism are greatly appreciated.

Thank you once again.

Sincerely,
[Kevin Tay, the one who approached first aiders]",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116514734235775077254/reviews
Xin Ying,5,Not sure if I'm reviewing at the correct page! Chanced upon the red cross first aid tents along Punggol Settlement after I had a fall on my bicycle. Had initially wanted to just get some antiseptic cream after cleaning my injury but they went the extra mile to wrap my injury instead. Appreciate the help!,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100778902714059102384/reviews
