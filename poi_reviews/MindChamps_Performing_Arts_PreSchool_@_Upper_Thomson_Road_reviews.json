While scouting around for a preschool that could accommodate my son's food allergies, MC@Tagore was the best choice and both principal and teachers were so warm, welcoming and formed a high-spirited team. The academic excellence that the school upholds and experiences that the school provides the children with is nothing short of exceptional. Rigour is infused seamlessly into the curriculum! Highly recommend this outlet of Mindchamps where everyone feels like family!",
