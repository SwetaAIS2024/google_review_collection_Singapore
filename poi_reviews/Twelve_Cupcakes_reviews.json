      "text": "Went there to buy ice cream at around 820pm or so coz my boy wanted it.\n\nCounter was not manned and this lady came over after a while and was not very welcoming, till I had to ask if they were closing (apparently closing time is 930pm after checking online thereafter).\n\nShe just glumly said “No” and proceeded to take the order and scooped the ice cream. After scanning to pay, without even waiting a while to confirm payment, she just walked away with the terminal machine.\n\nErm… This location, RWS not only represent your own branding but also SG as a whole for tourists. And the staff literally had zero customers to serve at all 3 counters. Might really need to consider the training for such staff.\n\nIce cream was nice though.",
