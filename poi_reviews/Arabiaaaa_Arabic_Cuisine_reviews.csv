souljermilitia,5,"Dined in. I ordered  Chicken Kebab with Rice. Food price I felt was slightly cheaper compared to other Mediterranean foods and the portion was generous. It was served warm when I was dining in, and tasted great to me.

What looks like the owner seems to be quite fierce looking but was generous when i asked for extra mayo for my son. Worth a try",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106830862414893812164/reviews

Virgo Gemini80,1,Arabiaaa Changi Village! Ordered KEBAB MIX WITH FRIES and was served bland food-stir fried steamed chicken & stir fried sliced beef whilst claiming it's KEBAB?! Fries seems refried ðŸ¤¢. Food wasnt warm at all! A wasted trip & $$ here. Had a bad diarrhoea!,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107628015426986458891/reviews
Lynn Teo,3,New stall at the food market! Haig Road Putu Piring - tried their original flavour (Gula Melaka). Itâ€™s a little too sweet for my liking. All flavors comes in a box of 4@$3.50. The shop gave me a box of kueh dadar to try. The coconut filing is quite sweet but the skin is not too thick. Goes well together.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103665553977215246019/reviews
