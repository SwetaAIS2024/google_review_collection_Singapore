ninit akilla,4,"The location is on the 1st floor, the outlet isn't too wide. All seating is indoor. The tables are not too many and the capacity is small, a maximum capacity of 4 people.

My order:
* Ice Hojicha Latte
It's milky & can still taste the Hojicha though it's iced.

Drinks are ready quite fast even though it's busy. The staff in the cashier is friendly and the other baristas are just moderately friendly.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101359345526072633084/reviews

Sherman Fu,1,"Made an order for 2 drinks 8/4/25 at about 7pm.
Had the 1st drink prepared, notice that at least 3-4 customer had their orders completed who made their order after me. Wait was at least 20 mins later.

Cup which was labeled was placed near the cashier register, no apology or anything was made. Employee ""Sha"" just made the order and place it on the counter. Poor service and bad attitude.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108712925309565596328/reviews
