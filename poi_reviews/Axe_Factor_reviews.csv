Sim Scarlett,5,"I can't thank Axe Factor enough for allowing us to host our ROM at their incredible venue! From the moment we walked in, we knew we had made the right choice. The space was perfect for such a special occasion – it had a great mix of fun energy and uniqueness that really added something extra to the day.

We worked with an external ROM setup company, and the coordination between the setup team and Axe Factor was seamless. The team at Axe Factor went above and beyond to ensure everything went smoothly. They were so accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed.

Not only did we get to enjoy the space for our ROM, but the added bonus of the axe-throwing experience created a relaxed and fun environment for all our guests. Everyone had such a blast! The venue itself is vibrant, welcoming, and has such a cool vibe. I can’t recommend Axe Factor enough for anyone looking to host a memorable event.

Thanks again to the entire team at Axe Factor for making our day even more special – your generosity, hospitality, and excellent coordination truly made it a celebration to remember!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102981571610188442253/reviews
Rachel Lee,5,"WE HAD SO MUCH FUN HERE!!! Bought tickets (and therefore a time slot) in advance as I didn't want to be disappointed. Best idea, as even though it was a weekday afternoon, a swarm of groups came in after us, and some were disappointed there were no lanes available for them.

A thrilling new experience - no experience necessary. Staff were most helpful and had clear instructions as they brought us through the safety briefing, and were diligent to help correct our posture or throwing as we went along.

I had booked a 2 hour session, and another staff who happened to be available came to teach us another way of throwing the axe. It definitely brought a different challenge and made the learning that much more exciting! For the 2 of us, we were so engrossed in getting it right and enjoying the practice that we were pretty shocked when time was up. We were sad to leave, but i was so glad I booked the 2 hours - totally WORTH IT.

Really thankful to the watchful staff who came to observe and guide us. It really would have been a different experience if not for them.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111701172499580628303/reviews
