Jin,2,"The taste of the food is acceptable. However, it is extremely pricey for a restaurant like this in a neighbourhood environment.

Veggie itself costs $15.90 for such a small portion, and it doesn't look like what the picture shows. I attached the menu photo and what we got for both the HK Kailan Ginger Prawn Paste, it shows to have some fried seaweed on it and some floss, but all we got is just fried shallots. For the Prawn Paste Chicken Wing, it shows to have some sauce on the menu, but it's just the usual fried chicken wing. Taste wise is good, but just disappointed at the misleading photos.

Overall, I wouldn't come back again. For the price we are paying (we spent 70++ for 5 pax), I could go to a better restaurant with a better atmosphere, and enjoy the food even more.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108966694894367613583/reviews
JingJie Lin,5,"Super worth it! The seafood is fresh from the tank, and you only pay for what you choose-they weigh it before cooking. Very fair prices and the cooking is spot on.

jc,5,"Overall: Good flavour, fresh seafood, big portions, family-friendly place, friendly staff.

Garlic Prawn: Prawns were fresh and juicy, cooked perfectly. They also give a generous amount of garlic crumbs!

Steamed Crab: Very fresh, can taste the natural sweetness.

Spinach with Trio Egg: The broth was rich and flavourful, and I love the texture from the century egg and salted egg.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118191134909841103111/reviews
Huei Syuan Liao,5,"â€œCanâ€™t believe we found a live seafood stall with full-on restaurant quality in the neighborhood! The plates and bowls are even chinaware instead of plastic.
Each type of live seafood has a different living environment, each tank has its own specific temperature, oxygen level, and salinity to keep everything just right. And the prices? Super reasonable for the quality youâ€™re getting.

The staff were lovely â€” so friendly and even checked if we liked the food. They noticed we didnâ€™t finish the kailan and asked about it (we had just done some dental work and couldnâ€™t chew it ðŸ˜…).

We were honestly too blown away by the seafood to take photos, just got one of the oysters. But the soon hok was also amazing. Highly recommend checking this place out!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104206232486427175877/reviews
