Malcolm Lee,5,"Most Bak Chor Mee are salty, but not this stall. The fishball is springy to the bite and the Mee
Pok ( a commonly used flat noodle for bak chor mee, similar to the tagliatelle ) is evenly coated with sauce that is not salty or MSG laden. The ingredients- IMO is generous for the price. There is usually a long queue starting well before the lunch time rush- so you really cannot give this stall a miss. Let us hope that they‚Äôll maintain their excellent taste.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100196955314378126014/reviews
Capture Asia Photography,5,"For guys need to get the $5 portion, is a generous portion in my opinion. Taste wise i give 4.9/5. Pork lard not suitable for my taste. Mushroom is savoury too.

Might close after lunch (1.30pm) if visit too late.

Taste and service is subjective.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113796572659279486041/reviews
YY,4,"Visited this unassuming stall filled with excitement as we had heard lots of raves over the food.

Ordered the traditional teochew noodles, and it turned out to be a decent bowl of noodles. Sauce was flavourful too.

It‚Äôs a pity that this stall (entire Tanglin Halt market) will no longer be around after 1 Aug 2022.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108380785134773252341/reviews
Michelin Inspector,5,Who would think their laksa was so delicious! It gets sold out relatively quickly (before their non laksa noodles). Uncle plates the laksa out beautifully üòç he gives delicious cockles with the laksa too.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108167496990200967081/reviews
Supreet Kini,4,"Visited this stall at the erstwhile Tanglin Halt Market. They had a long line at lunchtime (around 12:30PM) and there was a wait time of 10-15 minutes.

Chose the sliced abalone noodle with mee pok. They also serve minced meat and black fungus mushroom along with it.

Chili is mild (I prefer stronger). All ingredients are well cooked. Noodles is slurpy and mixes well with the chili. Soup is soothing.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105328280516267995599/reviews
