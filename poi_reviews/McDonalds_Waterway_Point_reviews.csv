johnnykuochung,5,"As I sat there, enjoying my meal, I reflected on the day. Working in F&B means constantly serving others, ensuring they have the best dining experience possible. But this moment was for me‚Äîa well-deserved reward after hours of hard work.

The Mala Crispy Chicken Burger wasn‚Äôt just a meal; it was my escape, my way of unwinding after a hectic day. It reminded me that even in the busiest of days, taking time to enjoy something you love can make all the effort worthwhile.

To all the amazing people working in F&B:
You are the heart and soul of every dining experience. Your hard work, patience, and dedication keep kitchens running and smiles on customers‚Äô faces. Whether it‚Äôs prepping food, handling busy shifts, or serving with a genuine smile, your effort doesn‚Äôt go unnoticed.

It‚Äôs not an easy job, but your resilience and passion make it extraordinary. You bring people comfort, joy, and connection through food‚Äîa gift that means more than words can express.

Thank you for what you do every single day. Remember to take moments for yourself, celebrate your efforts, and know that you are truly appreciated!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110803765536711118720/reviews
Farrhan Nyong,4,"Product or Service Quality
In general, McDonald's products are good and meet expectations for taste and quality.

Customer Service
Customer service was non-existent as everything was done through a self-service machine. The speed of food preparation may be less than desired during busy periods due to the high volume of orders.

Value for Money
The price is acceptable and may be considered cheap when getting their $5 meals.

Cleanliness and Environment
It's really crowded on Wednesday and Saturday nights. The cleanliness could be improved.

Consistency and Reliability
They're quite consistent.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100618397564321501047/reviews
Sally Salihin,1,"Photo for evidence that I did dine/take out in here. Staff taking own time to make orders. When asked, they claim they are closing the store hence it's taking a long time, when I first arrived informed them about the order but ignored me.

Unacceptable service at all costs.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109229408154915903071/reviews
Alief Hamdani,5,The Cheesecake and Himalayan Tea Combos is the BOMB! The Malay staff here is very nice to me. She let me sit down first and she sent the order to my table. So worth it!!! üòÅ,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106575068855432897132/reviews
Alyssa Low,1,"I ordered a mc cafe drink. The app showed that my order is ready for collection. But I can't find it from the shelf. So I asked one of the staff if my order is ready. She looked at me but said nothing and kept quiet. So I thought that she might not have heard me. I repeated my question again a few more times. Everytime she looked at me and turn her head away, plainly ignoring me. I am not trying to chase her knowing that Waterway Point has always been a busy branch, I simply just want to know the status of my order. Even if she simply told me that she is she is busy and she will check later, I will be totally fine. But instead she ignored me. I feedback this to another lady staff, she also just simple brush me away by ""sorry mdm, we are busy"". This is just a basic manner, nothing to do with service. This is totally unacceptable. I will not ever come back to this branch anymore.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104198687868984423423/reviews
