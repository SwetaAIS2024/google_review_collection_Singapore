Damaris Revell,5,"A friendly *budget* hotel in a super location - friendly staff, clean room and bathroom and very near Maxwell’s for superb eating choices. Also near to MRT stations. Good WiFi.

Budget means small but perfectly functional.

There is a 7-11 further up the road on the same side as the hotel.

We had a front facing room with a tiny balcony. Lovely sense of city bustle and a view of the beautiful Hindu temple and lovely sounds of ritual.

There is also bar noise - but it stops promptly at closing and didn’t bother us

Tip: the hotel reception is near the yellow table; can also use this to signpost Grab pickups.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105142725262737421025/reviews
Alex F,1,"So, long story short, i think a lot of reviews are fake and done through SERM services, i add a screenshot of a review where they didn’t even bother to copy/paste a given review correctly. Also, odor is bad, mold, and overall everything looks horrible. I understand this is a budget friendly option, but I don’t know how it was possible to manage a place to have this condition. Pictures online are misleading, so i add my own from a room that we got.
Ps: check in is at 3, not at 2pm as it is advertised on agoda.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106025225797725022598/reviews
Shannon Gardiner,2,"Get a what you should expect for a budget stay.
Rooms aren’t the cleanest, paper thin walls and windows, but of an odd smell around the place.

Location however was good! Decent choice of you just looking for somewhere cheap to sleep",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101570675060630739690/reviews
Veronica Ika,4,"Finding affordable but comfortable accommodation in Singapore can be tricky – hotels are on the pricey side, and I wanted a private bathroom and my own space. I found this hotel and booked it for 4 nights, even though I saw a lot of mixed reviews and honestly didn’t have high expectations based on the photos.

When I arrived late at night, there was no one at reception, so I had to wait a bit, but the staff member who checked me in was friendly. She assigned me a room on the fourth floor, and, surprisingly, it exceeded my expectations! The room had two beds and a spacious bathroom, was clean, and while a bit dark and windowless (with only a skylight), the AC worked perfectly, and there were no weird smells.

The location is fantastic – close to MRT stations, bars, and restaurants, which made it super convenient. Even better, my room was high up, so I didn’t hear any bar noise at night and got a good night’s sleep every night. Overall, it was a nice stay that ended up being much better than I’d expected!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107431808285133248063/reviews
Edwin Cheung,3,"If you are tight on budget this hotel is a good option. But I believe I won’t come back since I can’t really use the desk for work. There is some musty smell that I don’t know where it came from.

Location wise, it is wonderful. So close to MRT.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109075155172862622697/reviews
