Probably just below average\n\nTaste ⭐ ⭐\nKuek cut into tiny bit not easy to eat without a spoon. No eggy taste or smell.\n\nSmell ⭐ ⭐\nDon't have the nice chye tow kuek aroma aka wok hei. Don't have the char flavor to it.\n\nPrice ⭐ ⭐ ⭐\nJust average\n\nNote - this is based on my personal taste bud and opinion doesn't represent all individual.\n\nFollow us for a gastronomic experience and discover the world finest in its purest form",

I ordered and got a pager, went to order coffee next door and read my news.\n\nThe pager buzz about 10mins later.\n\nGood stuff. The consistency of the kueh is just right. Not mushy yet melt in your mouth. The umami from the fish sauce was delicate and just right.\n\nReally appreciate these disappearing hawkers. I understand the current owner took over from his parent. Grateful to still have these successor willing to run a hawker stall. Truly our unique Singapore culture heritage.",

The fried egg with the sauce gives an umami taste that still lingers in a mouth after the carrot cake is swallowed. Yum!",
