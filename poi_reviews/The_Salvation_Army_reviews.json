      "text": "Easy to locate at the corner of a busy street along Bishan and Sin Ming road. Hard to miss. Regular donor of my items at the back within their tent setup. Please do remember to categorize your items beforehand and place them in the allocated red boxes accordingly to avoid extra hard work by the volunteers later on. There’s a small parking area just at the tent but it’s mainly for unloading of items and can get jammed up sometimes. Area is also under CCTV surveillance for extra security. Not too convenient for MRT commuters as it’s pretty far from either Bishan or AMK station. Have to take a bus and walk slightly. Best if you can do private transport especially if you have bulky items. I believe it’s opened 24/7 for donations as it is essentially an open area.",
