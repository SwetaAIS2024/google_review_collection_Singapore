Esther Lin,5,"I’ve always had good experience with Chang Clinic, the receptionists are nice and polite and makes the first-hand experience as pleasant as possible. Dr Chang greets and never once make me feel like I’m just another transaction in his clinic because he takes time to ask questions to do the diagnosis and shares transparently the medicine that’s required and the functions. He did ear syringing for me to clear the earwax which no other doctor did when I see doctor and also offered to go through my health screening report patiently. My family goes to Chang Clinic too. Thank you Dr Chang and clinic :)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110689804211429713311/reviews
Dulji_Wak,5,"We always have had a pleasant experience in Chang Clinic with both Dr. Chang and Dr. Gouw. the staff is helpful and kind . Both doctors take time to examine and explain the situation and why the medicine is prescribed. prices are reasonable. But the waiting time maybe longer especially during the mornings and Saturday. The clinic is well maintained and clean and the atmosphere is welcoming..The nurses are prompt and courteous. There are so many interesting books and magazines to read while you wait and this is one reason I don't mind spending time there.

The clinic is closed on Wednesday evening, Saturday Evening and Sunday. And there is a lunch break from 12pm to 1.30pm and consultation does not happen during those hours. Will visit this clinic again to take treatment Incase unwell.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101320407941178314953/reviews
Thien Phu Nguyen,5,"Dr. Chang and the clinic staff are very friendly and attentive to my need. I visited his clinic multiple times to have my dressing changed periodically; he and his team always pay great attention and offer solid advices to my condition at a very affordable cost. Lastly, you can never go wrong when you have a wall full of pictures of cats. :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107684165713268179232/reviews
Pudzie,5,"Doctor Chang & his staff are friendly and helpful. Though the front counter staff sometimes a little blur, keep shouting patient’s name across the clinic (for whole 5min) just for a report, instead of going in to search for it directly. Apart from that, they still tried their best to serve every time. Still glad that this clinic is very near my place!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112321281981069979277/reviews
Rayah M,1,"The female doctor here is very proud and nervous. I was deeply humiliated by her unkindness and rude manner of speaking. She yelled at my little one to be quiet and still. I asked her to write a referral letter, but she didn't. I still don't understand why the patient asked to her write it, but she didn't. Perhaps she felt that I trying to go to the special list was ignoring her. She seems to have problems with her self-esteem.

Be a human before a doctor. Worst doctors and hospitals, not worth a single star. I will never go here again.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109409570376657100652/reviews
