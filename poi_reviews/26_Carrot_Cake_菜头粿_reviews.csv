Jacob TAN,3,"Not really the style of fried carrot cake that I like. I prefer those that have the carrot cake completely covered by the eggs. The carrot cake is tender and quite tasty though. The chilli that is at the side is nice with a burnt taste, kind of those type used for nasi lemak.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
Alex Tan,5,"Finally got a chance to try it.
Reasonably fast at 8am on a weekday morning. I ordered and got a pager, went to order coffee next door and read my news.

The pager buzz about 10mins later.

Good stuff. The consistency of the kueh is just right. Not mushy yet melt in your mouth. The umami from the fish sauce was delicate and just right.

Really appreciate these disappearing hawkers. I understand the current owner took over from his parent. Grateful to still have these successor willing to run a hawker stall. Truly our unique Singapore culture heritage.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108249944013054916657/reviews
Ronald Ho,3,"Food is really slow and so so. About 30mins wait on a weekend. Taste was ok only. Personally feel not worth the wait as the cook just take his own sweet time cook one by one, but the taste not one by one taste. Price is same with others in the food centre.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100844085419397093873/reviews
S Wun,5,July 2022: one of the better carrot cake that I have tasted! Queues are long for a good reason! Well worth it. The sauce is sweet yet not overly sweet and the portion size is decent. The fried egg with the sauce gives an umami taste that still lingers in a mouth after the carrot cake is swallowed. Yum!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110012229164046535881/reviews
