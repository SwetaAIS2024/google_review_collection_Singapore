Florence Leow,5,"üü© I like eating Kin no Mame's Wasabi coated peanuts. üü¶ I have come across their pop up kiosks at various malls at Orchard Road before.

‚ú≥Ô∏è It seems they have a permanent kiosk at Paragon Mall B1 Level food hall. ‚óè I recently bought a packet of their wasabi powder coated nuts again from Paragon mall.

‚òòÔ∏è The shell of the peanut snack is crispy and the wasabi powder can sting your mouth and nose at the same time. But I really love snacking on these nuts:)",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews
Ch Mu,5,Today they had a stall in Cold Storage. Amazing vegetarian options are available. They also give sample pieces to taste. The person available behind this stall was very patient and kind and allowed us to pick our  choice of Chips. I would highly recommend this place,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110731538618194632252/reviews

Bright Eyes,2,"Kin No Mame, Plaza Singapura.  Products are fine but staff attending at the counter needs retraining. She pulls a long face when I enquire about a certain product. With such an attitude, she should not serve customers at the counter. Please let her work in the storeroom or else please ensure she can handle enquiries with appropriate manners.
