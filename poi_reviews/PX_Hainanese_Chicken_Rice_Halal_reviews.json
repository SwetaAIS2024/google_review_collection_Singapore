      "text": "This Roasted Chicken Rice ($5.50) features tender roasted chicken, fluffy rice cooked in chicken oil, crunchy mustard greens, and cucumber slices, with a side of clear chicken soup. The rice has a soft, fragrant texture enhanced by soy sauce, and the roasted chicken thigh offers a plump, bouncy texture with a distinct roasted flavour. The chilli sauce adds a spicy kick, but the absence of ginger sauce and dark soy was disappointing. While satisfying, it's slightly pricey due to the airport location. Overall, a decent but standard plate of chicken rice that might be more affordable and flavourful elsewhere.",
