But the staff told me that she can’t as we didn’t give the school 1 month notice period.\n\nThen I told her how about $100 since I only give you 2 weeks notice. She has rejected me and said that the management decision.\n\nFirst of all, we are not aware of the new term starts in February.  And she claimed that this was informed in late\nDecember 2022 when the school was closed during that period.\n\nI really hope the management should look into this. This amount should be refundable as our new place is too far from your current location which will take us more than 1 hr to travel to your school to attend 45 minutes lesson and another hour to travel back home.\n\nAnd the first week of January. My daughter didn’t attend the class too. Please reply me soon.",
