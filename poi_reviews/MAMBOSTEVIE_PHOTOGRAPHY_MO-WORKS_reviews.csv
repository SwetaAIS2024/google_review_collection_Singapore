Chan Jia Yi,5,"Had a full day, two-session event today with Stevie and his team and it went amazing! Thanks Stevie for being so prepared, responsive, flexible and professional! We encountered some tough spots in the past so I ask for backup plans with backup equipment, and he was able to reassure me that he will be prepared and he knows what to do - and he delivered. Sorry if it was a bit demanding, but thanks Stevie!
The photos were nice, great framing and lighting; plus photobooth was nice with a lot of fun props neatly laid out. The print quality was fantastic and everyone looked so happy. And lastly, the whole team's attitude was great! üëçüèª",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108101795249053406705/reviews
