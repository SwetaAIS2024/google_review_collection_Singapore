Fantastic atmosphere, luxurious choice of drinks, incredible music from the 80's and 90's, classic soft rock and excellent pop.  Two floors of pleasant noise and music, darts! It turns out that the regular guests even organized a challenge, who will drink beer faster!\nCool! The martini cocktails were excellent, the mini-burgers were very tasty, the whiskey was strong and timely! Thank you so much to the Ice Cold Beer team for a great job and great mood! We will come to your place more often!",
