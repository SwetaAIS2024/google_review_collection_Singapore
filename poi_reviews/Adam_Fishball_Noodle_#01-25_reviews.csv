Zhenxi Ong,5,"Very good service by the friendly stall owner. I enjoyed the Hong Kong Pop songs in the background too. The fish ball noodles is good. The sauce non spicy for kids is tasty, better than many stalls that is only tomato sauce. The noodles is the starchy kind. The fish ball is good. The meatball seems to be handmade? Not sure. Seem to taste shallots and/or tee pok in the meat ball. The laska is delicious. The laksa style is like EAT, quite thick taste is similar but better with chilli paste and laksa leaves. The tau Pok is cooked till very soft and soaked. I loved it. It comes with 2 full sized medium large prawns that is delicious. Fishcakes is normal. Price for laksa is $6 but quality is very good with the prawns. The stall owner very accommodating. Really great service.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115603941718627345391/reviews
Elaine C,5,"Assorted fish and meatballs, including two meatballs-inside-meatballs, with dry and comfortably spiced mee pok with minced meat, shiitake mushrooms, and some greens deck out the house special. Delicious and cooked to perfection; the signature fishballs have just the right springiness. Very happy with the noodles!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108678594333994361733/reviews

Paul Young,5,"Had the minced meat noodles first. Excellent with the mee pok done up to perfection. Everything was well done. Meat balls and the add ons were prefect. 4 dollars for a small bowl is sufficient- so that i can also try their laksa.
Round 2- laksa. The laksa broth was tasty! Everything came together very well. Prawn was very fresh. Comes with harm so if u want a harmless experience, remember to say so. Overall great. Well deserved 5 star.
Note that good food take time. So be prepared to Q.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109729405213634414664/reviews
