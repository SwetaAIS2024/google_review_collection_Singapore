Rodney Robert,1,"The food is good there. But the servings are pretty bad, i only got 1 big chunk and 2 small chunks. I paid $5 for this, understand the friend tofu is expensive. But the chicken portion could be abit more? There were two staffs who does the servings and both give too less but charge more. I use to go everyday to buy food there and usually there is always a long queue but nowadays I see very less queue and now I understand why.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111282075206930439758/reviews
Spencer Paw,3,"Slightly pricey despite being labelled ""Staff Tuckshop"" which should imply affordability. However, I did not have nearly as bad an experience as some of these other reviewers - I paid $4.10 for 2 veg and 1 meat. That said, one would be better off eating at the nearby science canteen instead if one wants to be slightly more economical.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106133221641148569526/reviews
Hamad Azam,1,"Older lady Chinese staff charged me $3 extra and when I tried to reason my friend got what I got for $5.40, she gaslighted me and said ""why didn't you say you were army"" when ACTUALLY she asked earlier ""are you a (staff) here"". I said no because I am not a staff a NUH. She then offered to give me back 70c as the correct price was $8.40. She was about to pass me the cash before saying ""cannot, in system already"". I could not reason further because she spoke in Mandarin. Unjust and unfair. My Chinese friend got what I got for $3 cheaper while I paid $8.40..",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111386515847395757631/reviews
Calvin Liew,1,"Don't be fooled by the name 'Tuckshop', place is seriously overpriced. Supposed economy rice came to over $8. No price indication, no warning. Food portions miserable and judging by the ubiquitous round steel food holders they are cooked somewhere else in a central kitchen anyway.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115880645302625792587/reviews
