C,5,"I know every school is a good school but I am of the view that TMS is better than good. The all-round support for the students is great. With its relatively long history, the school is definitely a school of choice for many, especially for families living in the east. This could also be seen from the cut off points in recent years and one needs to take into consideration the fact the school is not affiliated to any primary school. Certainly no regrets imho. ðŸ™‚",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100217769972319672089/reviews
