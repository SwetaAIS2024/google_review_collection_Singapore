salsa capri,4,"Very impressed by this School.  They cultivate 13-16 years old with skill to cope with livelihood.  A fantastic monthly pop up store to showcase sales of students' creative crafts. Beautiful professional works! Luv it that their cafe is also served by special staff, so much love and compassion here...",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106901350971965618182/reviews
Hector,5,"Hidden in the inconspicuous corners of Simei Street 1, this is a gem of a place - for they are not just any school, they are the torch-bearers for schooling kids with special abilities. At this school, the kids don’t just go for getting education but also hone up life skills - this school takes the giant leap of faith and believe in their abilities to train the kids in baking such sumptuous, gourmet cookies, cakes (even eggless!!) and a whole gourmet of dishes that you just can’t stop at one!!

And what surprised the most is the humility and gratitude that you witness from every single staff and students of this school. They truly believe in life-long learning and going extra mile to secure equal opportunity for kids with special abilities at par with any other kid. My best wishes for their noble endeavour.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115179526697030818054/reviews
