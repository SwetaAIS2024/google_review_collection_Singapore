Now the chicken batter is hard and no longer crispy, chicken is stringy and dry, they are not generous with the sauces, and the mash potatoes is a pathetic amount compared to the past. They should review their policies since their sales figures should be an obvious indicator of their failings.",

Bought the 4 pc golden mala spicy chicken wings for almost $10, and the portion was PATHETIC. Went to the counter, and the staff explained it was because the supplier gave them SMALL WINGS. I think she pitied me because she added 1 more wing for me. The picture shows 5 pc but in actuality it was MORE PATHETIC than the picture.\nDO NOT RECOMMEND THE WINGS. PATHETICALLY SMALL.
