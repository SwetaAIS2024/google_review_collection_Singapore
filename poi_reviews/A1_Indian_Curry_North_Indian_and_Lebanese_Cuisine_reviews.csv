Joel John,3,"Good corner place for a quick bite. We ordered lamb shawarma which was ok. The portion size is a bit small. We also tried chicken schezwan fried rice which had a medium size portion. The rice was not to spicy, so people who do not like spicy food would like it better. Overall, decent place which is very near to the mosque.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105553516819331245392/reviews
Leelee O,4,"One of the most aromatic falafel, so lightly crisp on the outside, and so aromatic with herbs and spices inside.
The chicken shawarma also tasty despite it looks very ordinary. The salt lassi is nasty though.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105830018905282151762/reviews
siti sulaihah,1,"I couldn't eat the lamb chops, I ate one rib (can't even say it came from a lamb) and threw away the other. The tandoori roti was hard, uncooked and inedible. Worst $21 meal ever. At least the lime tea was nice.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109206855983793457028/reviews
Kenneth Sim,5,Nice and peaceful ambience at 12.30pm on a sunny Tuesday noon. Delicious briyani (we ordered chicken and mutton) plus chicken tikka. Reasonable pricing. Will be back!,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101250411962792969001/reviews
