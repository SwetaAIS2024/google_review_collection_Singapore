Calbee Cracker,4,"Completely surrounded by greenery and natural light, what a beautiful space for a meal on a sunny day. Lunch option has recently been narrowed to a shorter list. Only have pasta for mains.
The food is delicious but the portion is modest. Excellent customer service by Joe and team. Would love to be back to experience the night vibe with live band. Ample parking. Best to bring some mosquitos patch or repellent along.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110229110724135670872/reviews
Perry Poehlmann,5,"A really nice open style restaurant within a tropical setting of the park connector.
The food was really nice, I had the Tokyo burger with the sweet potato fries.

Looks they have a live band, not sure when they play, but great open setting",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117274845187779436762/reviews

Celine Tan,5,"I had the pleasure of returning to Wheeler’s Tropikana for a second visit, and once again, it did not disappoint. The food is exceptional — every dish was flavorful and beautifully crafted, showing off the culinary expertise of the kitchen.

The service was just as impressive as before. Raymond was warm, knowledgeable, and ensured that everything went smoothly throughout our meal. The staffs’ attention to detail really stood out, making for an stress-free and enjoyable dining experience.

The ambience continues to be a major draw. The atmosphere is inviting and stylish, perfect for a relaxing night out. To top it off, the live band created a fantastic vibe, playing just the right mix of tunes without overpowering conversation.

If you’re looking for a great meal, stellar service, and a fun, lively atmosphere, Wheeler’s Tropikana is definitely worth a visit. I’ll be coming back for sure!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100477988968155329270/reviews
Ong Wee Ho,4,"We had our wedding lunch here with Jasmine from Tropikana as our coordinator. The venue has very Bali-esque and chill vibes, which was what we were looking for.
She accommodated to our last-minute requests readily, gave us practical advice on how to best provide a wonderful experience for our guests.
Interactions with us always had positive vibes even when we had requests that were not possible. These positive vibes were also apparent and brought out by the Tropikana crew on the wedding day itself.
On top of that, there were raving reviews from the guests:
Twice cooked pork w sweet chilli tamari
Ondeh ondeh
Slow cooked beef stew with potato, carrot and spring pea
Roasted organic chicken with confit garlic and lemon",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108944194754067404128/reviews
