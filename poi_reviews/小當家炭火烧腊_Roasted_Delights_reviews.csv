Gator,4,"A very friendly stall owner that constantly greet each customer. Always visited them and ordered most of their items by now. Interestingly I have never review on them.

Their roasted pork belly has a crispy skin and juicy meat, something that I‚Äôll always order. The wanton noodles are nice too, good portion as well. A very typical Singaporean food options when it comes to meal time. This stall is considered one of the better ones selling roasted meats around the area.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331842318070680564/reviews
Will,1,"From bad to worse. Packed back, all bones for the chicken. Added roast meat, and roast meat can see a little. Cost $5.30.

Photos shown are showing the portion that is YET to be eaten. All 3 photos, I have yet to touch a mouth.

Chicken only bones and membrane mostly. So so so so little. V terrible.

It is like a $1.50, worth at most. Not a normal portion plus add Seow Bak portion.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118119525043286062929/reviews
