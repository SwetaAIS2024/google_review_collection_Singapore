khrhms,5,"So so good! Value for money buffet with amazing sides, meat options and broths. Came here on a weekday night and reserved via their online website. Fuss free. Even though there were a lot of people at the time the food was unlimited. Sides were fresh and tasted great. Meats were seasoned well and the even had squid! Staff were attentive to our table when we needed the plates to be cleared. Dinner for 4 including a 20% discount was $110+. Will come again!!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104014469499009095905/reviews
Melissa Anne Tan,4,"Dined here cos saw so many good reviews. Reservations are a must cos they get really crowded! Dining limit of 90 mins.
I was seated promptly upon arrival. The food selection is really wide and quality is good.
Everything was marinated nicely.the honey chicken and short ribs were my favorite.
The fried chicken was also tasty, and the cheese fries surprisingly good! The kimchi soup we had was flavorful too.
As for that pandan dessert everyone was raving about? Yes..it is indeed as delicious as everyone said üëçüèª

Izz Zafir Jeffri,5,"Highly recommend this spot! $28 is a steal for the amount of food you get. The bulgogi beef is TO DIE FOR - tender, flavorful, and absolutely addictive. The chicken wings are also a highlight, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Plus, it's Halal certified, so you can enjoy with peace of mind. Service is efficient, and the atmosphere is cozy. Don't miss out on this hidden gem! 5/5 stars.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100056031966163771916/reviews
