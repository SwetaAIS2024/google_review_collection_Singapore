MH Tham,5,"Northshore Plaza II is super chill, open-air, and right by the sea, great for meetups with your dog who probably has a better social life than you.

There are wide walkways and pet-friendly corners to hang out, though you might get the occasional side-eye from folks who don‚Äôt vibe with the pet-friendly idea of the area.

Some cafes and eateries have outdoor seating, which is great for meetups with pet friends, the ones where you have no idea what the humans are called but know every detail about their pets.

Around the mall, there are green spots where your dog can pee, poop and sniff around. Do remember to clean up after them so you don‚Äôt give the side-eye intolerant folks any more grief.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112376174358198242550/reviews

Marklin Ho,5,"A peaceful neighbourhood mall with all the basic essentials like food, entertainment and household items üåº serving the needs of residents and students in the area, there‚Äôs a spectacular view of nature which should be cherished ü©∑ and remain untouched if possible. Definitely a great place to stay if you like natural beauty and serenity üëçüèª",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108645548840717486453/reviews
siangbro,5,plaza 2 is better than plaza as there is some retail shops and of course lots of restaurants and even a giant supermarket for your daily groceries needs both plazas are ideal for viewing the beautiful sea view,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102008562487452577043/reviews
Xin Hao,4,"The extension of Northshore Plaza l was completed just near the start of 2022 and visitors can now access Plaza ll via an overhead bridge from Plaza l Level 2 or cross the street on Level 1 instead.

Some of them are yet to be officially opened but more will come in Q1 2022. Some famous brands include A&W (super long queue but confident hype will diminish in a few months), Daiso, 4Fingers, Dancing Crab. There will be a newly opened food court as well run by Kopitiam. Similar to Plaza l, it has an open air design concept with three levels. Walkways are very spacious and there‚Äôs even a full view to the sea at the end of Level 2! Really great place to enjoy the sea breeze!

Will be sure to visit again after Q1 to visit the rest of the stalls. Really convenient for adjacent housing apartments. Great for elderly, kids, families and dates!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101038177603319548234/reviews
