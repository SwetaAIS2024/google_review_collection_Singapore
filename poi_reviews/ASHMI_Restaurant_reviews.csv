Sasi Kumar,5,"Delicious food..!!
One of the best briyani I have had in Singapore.
Tender and juicy meat mixed with adequate spices in the curries makes you crave for it.
As soon as you sense the aroma of the briyani, your mouth starts watering.
Value for Money...!!!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102328291887923852425/reviews

Zhen Qin,1,"Very disappointing, quality is worse than hawker center and staff not very happy to serve. Ordered a simple rice meal with 2 curries and a veg, plus mutton. The mutton is so hard to bite that I need to ask them for a knife to cut the meat out from the bone. Better go across the road to pasir pajang food centre.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108880969129301512034/reviews
Man Mohan Kapur,1,"The service is very very bad. The waiters have glum faces and do not seem to care about customer service

The food is terrible. Oily, undercooked and very spicy.

The atmosphere is terrible. Aircon not strong, walls dirty, dull look and place is rundown.

I wish I can give ZERO stars

There are so many places around; I suggest everyone goes to other restaurants.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102532623415823012358/reviews
Victor Zhiyu Lee,4,"Pretty good quality and quite affordable when compared to eateries nearby. Rice with Masala Chicken, Dal, Papadom and Curry Puff + Ginger Milk Tea for $8.20.
Once you come here frequently enough, the waiters remember you by name. If you have tried other more famous eateries nearby (like Fatty Prawn Noodles), this is not a bad place for a quick dinner/lunch.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118350326119557980646/reviews
