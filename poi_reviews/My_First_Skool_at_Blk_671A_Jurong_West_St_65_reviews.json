      "text": "My boy enrolled to JW2 since 2022.\nAll the class teachers are very friendly and patient, they will also keep us updated on children health conditions, class behavior or even emotions, so that parents could check and talk with the child.\n\nSurely, I sent my baby girl to JW2 infant care without 2nd thought. The teachers are alwsys caring and love them.\n\nRegarding the K2 graduation ceremony, I felt warmth and so touching to see my boy (introvert) done all the performances without stage fright. From here, you could see that how much efforts and patience from principal, teachers and staffs to guide and encourage them. Last but not least, the decorations on the ceremony such as props, photo booth and the soft toys so nice and memorable to all families!\n\nThank you very much JW2ðŸ’•",

      "text": "Our experience with MFS JW2 has been outstanding! I enrolled my 2 children in MFS JW2 in 2016 and 2019. First child graduated in 2021, while the second graduated this year. The principals and teachers have always been warm, caring, and deeply committed to the children's development. The learning environment is lively and engaging, making each day an exciting journey for our kids. The curriculum strikes a perfect balance between play and learning, nurturing creativity, social skills, and a love for education. I've seen remarkable growth in my children's confidence and abilities.\n\nI'm especially grateful to the teachers for recognizing signs of selective mutism in my eldest child. Thanks to their attentiveness, he received early intervention at MFS before starting primary school, and he continues to receive support. Additionally, MFS offered targeted help through the FLAiR program for K2 students needing extra support in language and literacy. This helped my child excel, scoring over 90% in his first literacy test during the initial weeks of Primary 1.\n\nThank you MFS JW2 for being nurturing and supportive environment for my children!",

Special learning experiences are also curated to allow application of learning to real world context - through learning journeys and special activities like opening a cafe.
