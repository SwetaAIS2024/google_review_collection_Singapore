In fact I enjoyed the soup. The carrot cake was also above average. Will return again easily. I hope their business will pick up.",

      "text": "I love coming here on weekends for lunch! It's clean, airy, and the staff are efficient and friendly. You can sit and chat comfortably while eating.\n\nAll the dishes I've tried are better than expected-- the fish soup is flavourful with firm, fresh pieces of fish, and they do the fried fish in a unique way here that remains crunchy. There are even other fillings you can customise your fish soup with, from different types of noodles to special ingredients like fish eggs.\n\nBut my top choice in the surprisingly varied menu would be the crispy pork noodles where the pork has been flavoured with fermented beancurd. The noodles are springy and delicious, and I'm so happy they include lard. The sweet and sour chicken, curry pork ribs (quite special), kaya toast, half boiled eggs, kopi, and teh are all good here too.\n\nA really pleasant and reliable place for breakfast or lunch! Will keep coming here and hope more people give them business too, it's a good spot.",
