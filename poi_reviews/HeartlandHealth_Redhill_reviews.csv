Selin Tan,5,The staff name Ke Xin is very friendly and nice. She explained all the medicine to me patiently and nicely. The doctor and the staff service so far so good. Recommend,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113115977012377140196/reviews
Kay Foo Sim,5,"Dr Elton Chee was patience in explaining my medical conditions to me. It was very informative and clear. I was so lucky to be his patient today. I won't say it was a good trip because I was sick, but it definitely made me feel better üòå
And the 2 receptionists were polite and helpful too. Thanks!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112721173073173100915/reviews
Ruby Abdullah,1,"Was there less than 10 mins before they reopen at 6pm and i was waiting just right outside when there was a staff who was repairing the ramp who asked me to just sit inside, that was already 5.56pm. So i went to sit inside and the malay lady at the counter right away told me ‚ÄúNot yet‚Äù when all i did was sit down because her other colleague told me to. I just told her, her colleague was the one who asked me to come in, and she then said ‚Äúok‚Äù. She went to another room, and told another colleague ‚Äúthere‚Äôs already a customer who went in herself and sat down, and i heard her colleague, who apparently is a chinese young lady, LET OUT A VERY BIG AND LOUD SIGH I was very offended at this behaviour bcs it really wasn‚Äôt my intention to ‚Äòhelp and sit myself in‚Äô. After the clinic officially open which was 4 mins later, another customer came right in, and the chinese lady attended to them FIRST and ignored my existence? I‚Äôm really taken aback with the standard of service here, and if it‚Äôs not bcs this is the only nearby clinic i could get to in the area, i will do my best to never come here again. Reading a few more bad reviews about the service at this clinic, i would highly advise the management to review their young staffs here. The chinese staff is Key Xin while malay staff i was referring to is khadijah. However, Dr Swee was extremely nice and professional.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105617608605095754404/reviews
Maple,1,Rude and inconsiderate Malay lady over at the counter. Not the first time she has behaved rudely to patients who encountered similar attitude. And only ever talks nicely to patients who are speaking to her in her mother tongue language. She does not even treat patients who are unwell with respect and lies about how she behaved to the management.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114364876140314272718/reviews
juliet tan,1,Clinical assistant asking redundant question and was absolutely rude. Not only that she made me stood at the registration area without explaining why. Legitimate waste of time.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103282739951721821897/reviews
