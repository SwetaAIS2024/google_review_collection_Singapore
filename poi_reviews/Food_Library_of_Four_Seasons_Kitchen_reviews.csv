Jack,3,"1st time trying this. They have a huge selection and today I tried the sirloin. Since it was new to me I didn't dare try medium but opted for medium well. Turned out well done, which may not be a bad thing. Taste is frankly quite average but at least it wasn't overly chewy or tough to bite. Quite a generous portion as well including both fries and mashed potatoes. For $13 it's good value for $ to get your macros in.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106288565584051666357/reviews

James Xie,2,"ordered grilled chicken with mushroom sauce for take away. Lady at cashier was friendly and patient to explain menu items.

Taste wise its pretty ok. Mushroom sauce was pretty strong and flavorful.  Mash potato a bit dry but sauce is good. Grilled chicken was a bit dry and slightly overcooked.

overall pretty normal.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101949940079070812431/reviews
Fluffy Jing,5,"Had the half spring chicken, it comes with mash potato, fries and salad.

Spring chicken was well seasoned, you get the garlicky flavour and spices, served to you crispy and hot.

Really value for money!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110495169180327661915/reviews
