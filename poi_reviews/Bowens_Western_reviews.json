Staff still can say, if u dun wan service charge, can order through other food platforms. As a resident staying nearby, why the hell would I order through platform? Understand business is difficult nowadays. But be upfront about it.",

      "text": "Thankful for this gem at Pandan Gardens near my home! It's our go to place for a quick Western treat with our toddler. The food has been consistently good and reasonably priced. For me, I always have the fish and chips because it's fresh, tasty and comes with crispy fries and hearty salad. Their homemade mushroom soup is also very delicious. Have to make reservations if you're visiting during the weekends cos their seating is quite limited. Hope they can improve on the air conditioning system.",
