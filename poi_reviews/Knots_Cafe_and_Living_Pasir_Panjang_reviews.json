My guests were really amazed and pleased with the unique experience.\n\nWorking with Maria and team was a breeze - they were accommodating and provided additional support in our planning.\n\nSafe to say we had a great time here. Highly recommended for any events!",

      "text": "Amazing cafe for its atmosphere! It's not easy to find places with good atmosphere and is quiet at lunch hours on a Saturday. However, the food variety is not as much as I would like, little options for vegans. For a price range of above 20$ for mains, I feel that it's slightly overpriced, especially since the food is alright, nothing unique or special about its flavour.\n\nI have to say this place seems to be great for a study date üòä",

The service was great and attentive for such a large crowd and they did a great job putting on the wedding. The food was just so so and the coffee was great. The venue was a little bit difficult to find because there are no other restaurants nearby and it's in a office building area so it took us some time to find it and find parking",

With a few meetings, she took time to understand our needs and curated a package perfect for our group. On the day, the staff helped us decorate and set up the place. They were also helping us conduct the events smoothly without us having to take too much charge and still enjoy the event a lot. The venue, open space and the ambience was something we already loved üíó Everyone enjoyed the food a lot especially the desserts ü§≠",
