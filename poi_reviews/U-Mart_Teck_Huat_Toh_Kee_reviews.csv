Julian Zhuo,1,"Extra 20cent for cashless.

Edit: Now I saw your reply. Anyway, u don't have to make your sentence to be so courteous. U are definitely right. We have a choice to buy or not to buy. So in your words, I would have my right to  asked why the 20cents extra. U replied in your words "" nothing is free"". U are also correct. Nothing is free, even asking a question is also not free. It's your business. Not mine. How u reply to customer is your problem. Not mine.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110884164771973731816/reviews
