      "text": "Love the atmosphere and environment of the store. Clean and well organised, everything was neat and tidy.\n\nThey don’t charge GST or service charge, so you’ll just have to order and pay from their QR code on the table, collect your meal in front and return your tray after you’re done.\n\nThey offer self service water, and there’s an array of condiments for you to use at your table.\nI would say it’s good for customers looking for a fuss-free meal, especially solo diner friendly.\n\nOrdered the regular broth Hokkaido ramen ($12.90). It came with bamboo shoots, black fungus, seaweed, half an egg and 2 slides of char siu.\nDecent bowl of ramen, but nothing outstanding. Enjoyed the addition of bamboo shoots and the char siu was so tender.\n\nSoup was slightly too salty for me unfortunately.",
