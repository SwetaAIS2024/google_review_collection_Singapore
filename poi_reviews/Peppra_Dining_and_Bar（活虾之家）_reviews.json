Served hot and well-presented, this dish is definitely worth trying if you enjoy a little spice with your seafood.",

We ordered pepper, garlic and lemon special cooked prawns. The prawns were so fresh, flavourful and cooked just nice.. not too tough.. black pepper crabs, cabbage and even chicken were soooo nice. Will return again!\n\nKeep it up chef!",

      "text": "Tried the pepper prawn. It was one of the best pepper flavored dishes I've had in Singapore. Unfortunately, the size of the prawn could have been bigger given that they take supply directly from a freshwater prawn supplier. They should have opted for bigger prawn for their dishes (50% of the prawns served were the size of a chicken wing drumlet)... I think it's reasonable to increase the price to cover the cost of bigger prawns.\n\nThe staff were great, and the atmosphere was good too!\n\nI'm looking forward to another visit to try their pepper crabs, which were sold out, unfortunately.",
