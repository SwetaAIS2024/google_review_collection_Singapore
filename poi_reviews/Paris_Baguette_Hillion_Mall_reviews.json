French delights to whet your palette.\n\nDo try the coffee and croissant.\n\nTake away or dine in. Seats are limited, though. Will try more in my next visit.",

The croissant with avocado and tuna has no tuna taste. Quite expensive for a food that doesn't taste good. Will be difficult for me to return eating here.",
