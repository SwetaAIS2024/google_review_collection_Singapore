      "text": "Highly recommended! Dr Lim is skillful and patient. He explains the current and possible future dental problems properly. Not pushy nor rush you to end the session quickly. He answers the any questions you have and explains. He tells u when he is going to start on a sensitive part of your tooth and properly pace the scaling so you have intervals to rest your mouth and rinsing. Polishing is done tooth-by-tooth which I really appreciate. I've been to many different dental clinic, many lousy dentists rushes thru appt, don't care if their patients feel u comfortable and even jus use their finger to swab some sweet tooth polish and tells you to leave. Many years ago I've always hated going to the dentist but then my fren introduced me Dr Ong at Ko Djeng lucky plaza. Dr Ong is amazing too! Very nice person. But this clinic is closer to home and gladly Dr Lim is great too! Nurses and assistants are skillful too. Thumbs up to all at Ko Djeng!!",
