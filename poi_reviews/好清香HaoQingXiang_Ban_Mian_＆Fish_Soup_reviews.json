      "text": "Had the special Mee Hoon Kueh, dry noodle, dumplings and bitter gourd double fish soup. I'll start from Mee Hoon Kueh. First of all, the portion is really generous! I'm a big eater and I find it's enough for me. It's the most special Mee Hoon Kueh as the shape and is similar to Ravioli but with a better texture. It absorbs the gravy evenly and hence it taste better. Mee Hoon Kueh and noodles are hand made daily by owner too. Fried fish coated with a very thin batter too with good amount of fish. Fish soup makes me think of home cooked soup without the usual MSG. Highly recommended if you're near that area.",
