CT liaw,3,"The breathtaking panoramic views from Tóng Lè Private Dining, situated on the 10th floor of OUE Tower, are undeniable, particularly the night view of Marina Bay. As a revolving waterfront restaurant, the experience is memorable. However, the 'Sawn' set menu at SGD 198++ per person didn't quite meet expectations in terms of food quality. The lobster salad was a standout dish, but other courses were average. Service was also a concern, as it was challenging to find staff when needed.""",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115843697549679461073/reviews
S Wun,5,Mar 2025: revolving restaurant in Raffles Place area serving good Chinese food. Set menus available for business lunch. Very well executed. We added the 48hour slow braised pork belly to the set and it was yummy. Not too fatty and yet very tender.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110012229164046535881/reviews
Jia Ling Wong,4,"Came for the Chinese New Year menu named ""dawn"" in 2025 in a private dining room, which was revolving and you could see the whole area in one revolution which took 2 hours.
Dishes was towards the more flavourful side and I requested mine to be drizzled with less sauce after the fish maw broth, disappointingly this was not done.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103878817923490011381/reviews

H C Lee,5,"Brought an overseas friend to the restaurant for dinner and my friend loved it. The restaurant overlooks the Marina Bay Sands and the Central Business District and provides stunning sunset and night view. Environment is not noisy and conclusive to have a nice chat with friend.

Service is top notch with staff making sure that we are well taken care of. We ordered the Dawn set dinner and portion is just right and delicious.

Overall, it was pleasant dining experience, whether it is the environment, food or service provided, it deserves a 5-star rating.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113658636534896586191/reviews
