Be sure to call ahead to make sure they have the meds you need as not all Guardians will carry the full inventory.  This is a neighborhood outlet, and the pharmacist is sometimes not around, so be sure to call to make sure you're not making a trip in vain for meds that they don't carry or to find the pharmacist out to lunch or a break.  Otherwise, the retail offerings are pretty standard.  If you can't get meds here, you might check at Guardian Holland Village 5 minutes away.",
