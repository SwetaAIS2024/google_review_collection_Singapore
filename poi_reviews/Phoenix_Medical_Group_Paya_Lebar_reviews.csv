dee sy,1,"I'm extremely disappointed with the receptionists at this clinic. They seemed unfriendly and uncaring, refusing to see a patient just 15 minutes before closing time. It's clear they're more focused on business than genuinely helping people. I won't be returning.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109957278833819364380/reviews
KAREN,5,"Great Experience at Phoenix Medical Group

Had a full-body checkup at Phoenix Medical Group, and the experience was excellent. Booking was easy, and the waiting time was minimal. Staff nurse Michelle was friendly and made the process comfortable, while Dr. Angela provided a clear and detailed explanation. The service was professional and efficient—I highly recommend them!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103302273606682463888/reviews
Jace Peh,5,"Just did my AMD @ this clinic with Dr. Angela Foong. Dr. Angela is very professional as she explained fully and clearly regarding AMD and made the whole process is very fast and smooth.
Also need to thank Jerene Lau as she made arrangements for my appointment. She is polite and courteous which made my visit felt welcome.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102995724032050976633/reviews
Ryan Wang,1,"waiting time is very long. The front desk staff was very unprofessional, with a poor service attitude, and didn’t ask whether I wanted to use my insurance. As a result, the charges couldn’t be processed through insurance, and it couldn’t be changed afterward. Extremely irresponsible service. I strongly advise against going there.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105114284109386380706/reviews
Lynn G,1,"I've visited the clinic a few times, but today was the worst experience. The doctors were very kind, professional, and explained everything clearly. However, the front desk staff was unfriendly and failed to provide clear instructions about the queue. Their tone came off as disinterested and rude. I won't be returning to this clinic.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107112247294414205257/reviews
