Lambmonade,4,"Clean outlet and food was displayed neatly for customers to choose. Very pleasing  to the eye.
The seasoning of their dishes are of the right balance.  Not too salty nor oily.
They also have a wide array of buns ( plain, meat filling) to accompany the savoury dishes.  Each dish is $2per portion(meat), $1 if its vegetarian option and I find it reasonable for the quality and amount given.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105557596709402106966/reviews
