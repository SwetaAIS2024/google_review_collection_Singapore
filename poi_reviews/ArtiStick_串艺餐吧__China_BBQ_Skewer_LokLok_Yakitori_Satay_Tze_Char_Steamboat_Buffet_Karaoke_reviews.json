      "text": "The buffet is very good value for money. Best place to try all the 3 types of cooking styles, Japanese, Chinese, Malaysian. All of their skewers are very well done. Their Chinese cooked dishes are a bit lacking, but Malaysian dishes are very good.\n\nI did not try their hotpot, but I see almost every table ordered their hotpot, so I think it should be good as well. Highly recommend this place as I love places that make use of similar ingredients in different cooking styles. As what the other patrons commented, the place is crowded and noisy. Not for those that prefer a place for chatting.",

The service was top-notch, with friendly and attentive staff who made sure our dining experience was exceptional.\n\nBut what truly stole the show was the food - authentic, delicious, and a wide variety to choose from. The local dishes were expertly prepared and presented, and we enjoyed every bite.\n\nThe best part? Amazing value for money! For just $28, you can enjoy all the steamboat dishes, and for an additional $10, you can top up for sticks and dishes from their menu.\n\nAnd to quench your thirst, they offer a variety of drinks, including:\n\n- Beer tower available for purchase\n- Free-flow juices (blackcurrant, fruit punch, orange juice)\n- Water and ice, available at no extra charge!\n\nWhether you're a foodie or just looking for a great meal, Artistick Restaurant is a must-visit. Highly recommended!\n\nWhether you're a foodie or just looking for a great meal, Artistick Restaurant is a must-visit. Highly recommended!\n\nFaye",

Food was not bad and service was ok. $38 buffet must add $6 then got steamboat. They should have told the waiting time before hand so that customers would know whether to dine in. At least the guy serving was helpful in rushing the kitchen but i hope they have a better ordering system",
