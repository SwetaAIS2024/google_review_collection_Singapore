Waseem Yusaf,4,"Good place for local Teh or Kopi, cupcakes or chiffons plus other local food. Few seating places inside and ample outside in the Lobby of the building.
Prices are reasonable and service is quick enough. Muffins get sold out early in the day, but the rest of the things are generally available. Chiffons are definitely recommended in this place. They are light, not so sweet and fresh.
A practical location for people working in the offices in Alexandra TechnoPark",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101912017134881903928/reviews

Bluebird Review,5,"Auntie treat every customer as friend and quite surprised that she remember my usual order after I only visited twice in a row..and when I only returned like a mth later to patronise,she still remember me and ask where I go..the chiffon wise is ok..usually eat the packed lunch and their laksa and mee siam are very nice and popular..drinks also not too sweet and nice

Anyway I think the rating not important here as it is located in atp where only office workers will usually patronise the place",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106699103123775971577/reviews
