Master Song, Master Kwong and all the instructors are always very patient and kind to the children and they make the classes fun for the kids, always encouraging them. Yet, they do emphasize on discipline and respect, instilling the right values in the kids. My son loves TKD classes and really genuinely look forward to classes every week. Kudos to Master Song & team. Tops!",
