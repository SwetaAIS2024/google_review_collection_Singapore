Mabbel Elroy,3,"Free parking is available on Sundays for visitors. There’s no GST or service charge, but that also means you shouldn’t expect any service.

The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor play areas for kids, which is a nice touch, though they don’t seem well-maintained.

Utensils were quite oily, so if you’re particular about cleanliness, you might want to give them another rinse before using them.

As for the food, the taste was average, and the dishes we ordered had a very watery texture. A portion of rice costs $1.60.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102879096020874056848/reviews

Chelsea Ting,5,"Always a good lunch spot for people working around here. Have also been here for dinner as well, and they are usually crowded. Food is consistent and yummy - favourite for me is the fish bee hoon, seaweed soup and rice, and of course their tze char dishes.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103717394878131271715/reviews
whatoeatagain sg,5,"It’s was a raining evening and I had my dinner at JB101 Firewokz at the new science park outlet. It is a popular zi char restaurant in Singapore, renowned for its authentic Johor Bahru–style dishes infused with rich wok hei flavors. They have live band too! Awesome place to chill over the weekend indeed!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106207226579330854237/reviews
S Wun,3,Oct 2024: quietly place during weekends with ample seats for large groups. Food is above average but nothing to shout about. For birthdays they play happy birthday song through the restaurant when the cake is served. The cereal prawn was below average as the flour was very thick. The ingredients generally also tasted like they were frozen.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110012229164046535881/reviews
