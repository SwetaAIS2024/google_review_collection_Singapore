      "text": "Our 5 year old daughter has been seeing Dr. Serena since she was around 3 years old - and Dr. Serena has always been amazing.  Incredibly our daughter is actually excited about going to the dentist (!?!) which is a testament to how friendly, fun and altogether painless Dr. Serena makes the whole process.  Over the years our daughter has had a couple of small fillings - and it was handled so smoothly that my wife commented afterwards why can't her (and my!) fillings be as smooth and uneventful as our daughter's fillings were!  I'd recommend Cluny Court Dental and Dr. Serena to anyone with children.",

So grateful to Dr Serena and her team for the amazing care given to my boy, fixing his broken tooth and made it look like nothing happened to his tooth. The process was so comfortable that my boy didn't cringe and feel any discomfort throughout the 1hr+ we were there! Thank you Dr Serena and team!",

Because we like her so much, we followed her to Cluny Court. She is extremely professional, super kind and friendly. We always felt she advised and treated our children very well. I highly recommend her.",

Been going back to her since then for the past 3 years, and my younger son is also under her care. She is really good with kids and very professional. Being open over the weekends is a bonus as well.",

She has demonstrated nothing but professional and caring services to her, especially when many dentists have refuse to tend to her dental issues due to her young age.\n\nAs expected with working with any 3-years old child, it is not easy and takes plenty of patience to handle her. Dr Serena went above and beyond all expectations and has helped resolve her dental problems and gave very good and practical tips on how to care for her teeth. During these few years, she has built a wonderful relationship with my daughter, who simply loves to visit her favorite dentist.",
