      "text": "i love this place so much everyone is so nice although some can be mean or rude and the toilets recently got renovated and now it is way better than before , the library has also finished renovating so it is now very spacious and has more seating space .i also enjoy the activities there and all the teachers will go the extra mile when organising these activities . the teachers are also very supportive and will help u succeed but ofc u will expect some of the teachers to be strict . and if u are lucky some of them may even stay back to answer any questions (shoutout to Ms Aw Yong ) The canteen is also pretty big . football field may need to be bigger tho . And as i was reading the other reviews i find that some of them are ridiculous and the ISH did not go on fire for your information so stop spreading false news . West Grove is wonderful and i fully recommended this place.",
