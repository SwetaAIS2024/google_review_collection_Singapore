It was shitty service for 5 mins, had no people skills or showed any care. He also could not properly diagnose or prescribed an effective medication. Harshly overpriced! I would recommend the panel doctor a review of whoever that covered his duties on 5 May.",

How hard would it be to implement some form of callback system? Occupancy load was quite light, too (note attached photo of practically empty clinic).\n\nWould not visit again, and would strongly recommend against visiting.",

So with just 6 patients in front of us, we had to wait 1hr. But I think having a patient doctor is worth the wait, unless you're the type who just wants an MC and go home. There's a shengsiong supermarket and coffee shop nearby to while time away if needed.\n\nReception staff were very polite, friendly and helpful. Gave me a free plaster for my open wound when I'm not the patient, just an accompanying caregiver.",

And even though I asked but he would not. However this clinic charged the highest in the west vicinity for consultation. Does not carry enough medicines such as the basic ibuprofen.",
