Paul Henshaw,4,"It was empty of customers Saturday lunch time, so service was nice and fast.
The size of 6 pieces was quite impressive and a good amount of kinako powder given. The texture was slightly softer than I prefer, but  overall enjoyable.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112860560500116079814/reviews
Teck Boon,4,"Located in the basement just outside NTUC Finest. Quite a nice place to sit at for a dessert after a meal. The warabi-mochi while quite decent, still canâ€™t beat the one in the next building. Not as fragrant and the texture isnâ€™t as nice also. The seating area is nicer here though.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105978834231481267643/reviews
wendy khng,4,"Went early on a weekend, the ambience was nice and peaceful and the cashier was friendly. I ordered the original warabi set. I like the texture. It was soft but still abit chewable and the kinako powder was generous. It's a good hideout at town area to relax from all the mad shopping.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117269757961738095610/reviews

Chloe Hang,1,"Bought the original warabi mochi to-go. When I got home to try, it was mushy?? So bad :(

I had the one at VivoCity before and it was alright.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114588026845584866705/reviews
