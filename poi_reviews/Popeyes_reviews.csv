khrhms,3,Not the best outlet as the flavours were somehow lacking as compared to other stores. Mac and cheese wasnâ€™t as good as the ones I had before too. Food was ready super quick though and plenty of seats available for lunch around 1 pm. Good thing is that the tenders were not fried too oily.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104014469499009095905/reviews
Freddy,1,"Food quality & quantity have deteriorated over the years. It was great at a point of time when food served was always hot & juicy. Today I visited this outlet again, management have seem to change since - franchise to Fei Siong Pte Ltd.

I ordered 3x 3 piece meal, the serving was pathetic. 2 sets came with super small piece of chicken wing, chicken breast & a drumstick. The 3rd set difference was the chicken thigh over the breast. The chicken were tough and cold, this was the same for the Cajun fries. Tap at sink is damage.
Not recommended. Avoid this outlet at all cost!!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113533906938342017824/reviews

Fenny H,4,Went for lunches here for its Fried Chicken and Spaghetti. Simple and yummy. Long queues during lunch times. Hence do ask the counter the expected waiting time if you are in a rush. Recommend to go before or after the lunch crowds.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102744812983796676091/reviews
