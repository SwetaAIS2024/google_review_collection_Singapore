As a result, very slow service. Unlike the other drink stall operated by a husband and wife team, this stall is operated by one person. As a result, preparation of food orders takes a long time, as the staff is 'distracted' by customers who come after you and order drinks, and ends up making the drinks and neglecting your food order. We are talking 25min+ wait for food items.",
