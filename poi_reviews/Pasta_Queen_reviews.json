      "text": "Ordered their signature chicken chop as they call it, it costs $9.50. Look at my picture, small piece of normal tasting chicken, taste of coleslaw isnâ€™t fantastic, very small portion of baked beans, and typical fries. Serving portion for $9.50 is very disappointing and the overall taste was not even impressive. Sorry but for the price, taste, and quantity, this place is not recommended.",
