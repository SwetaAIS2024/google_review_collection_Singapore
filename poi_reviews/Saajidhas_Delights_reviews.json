The meal is made even better by the warm and friendly service. The staff is attentive, always ready with recommendations and a smile, making the dining experience feel welcoming and personal. Whether it's ensuring the sambal is just the right level of spicy or offering extra sides, their hospitality adds to the enjoyment.",
