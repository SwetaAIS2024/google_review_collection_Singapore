She was very friendly and smiley, makes you feel very welcome and happy to support this business. They have a small menu of sweet treats but all very nice. They use Farm Fresh fresh milk, but they also have vegan options without cows milk. There is also a retail section at the back selling Farm Fresh products. I ordered a kurma milk with brown sugar boba and it was delicious. Happy to come back again to try other drinks and ice cream or yogurts.",
