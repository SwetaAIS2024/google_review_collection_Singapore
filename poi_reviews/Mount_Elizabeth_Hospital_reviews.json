All the doctors in Mount Elizabeth value money over patient well being, so watch out if you decided to enter this hospital for operations etc. They will try to forcefully persuade unnecessary operation into you when there isn't need.\n\nWhat worst is when all the patient scans are perfectly fine, the doctors still purposely visit patient say some nice words so they can collect $300 daily.",

      "text": "I recently had the pleasure of staying at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Orchard, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience. The service provided by the staff was outstanding—they were attentive, compassionate, and always ready to assist with a smile.\n\nOne of the highlights of my stay was the food. It was absolutely delicious, with a variety of options that were both healthy and flavorful. The meals were well-prepared and thoughtfully presented, making my stay even more comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nI would highly recommend Mount Elizabeth Hospital to anyone in need of medical care. The combination of excellent service and delightful food makes it a top choice. If you ever have the chance to stay here, don't hesitate! Hope you get your chance soon!!!",

      "text": "I did not imagine my first day as a tourist in Singapore would begin with a sudden rush to the hospital with stomach pains. So I was quite scared and confused. I picked Mount Elizabeth Hospital because it was closest to my hotel.\n\nOutstanding service. I only spent 15 minutes in urgent care before receiving a consultation with a doctor who had a very calming vibe and good sense of humour. My needs and concerns were answered, taken seriously. I was sent to a gastroentologist for a further assessment who was also the same. Once again, very minimal wait times. They knew I was a tourist, and every staff member I saw was very quick to assist me and knew how to go about asking for my travel insurance details.\n\nWhen I got sent for a CT scan, I got in 40 minutes before my scheduled appointment! and I hadn't even got the IV drip out before I was given the clear from the doctors that I didn't need surgery. Within one short afternoon, I was given very quick and easy treatment, medication, and reassurance. And I was able to continue the rest of my holiday in singapore pain free thanks to the amazing and fast help I got at this hospital.",

      "text": "Did an overnight sleep study test for sleep apnoea, and commenced my pre-admission at 6pm. There weren’t many patients at that time so I was surprised when I had to wait 45 minutes to be attended to.\n\nDuring my pre-admission, I mentioned that I did not want to be warded immediately as I intended to head out for dinner before returning. It would have been helpful if the administrative staff informed me that dinner would be served.\n\nWhen I returned to the hospital’s administration area after my dinner, I also enquired if the hospital provided a complimentary limo service upon discharge, but the administrative staff were unsure about it and told me that the service was only available to patients who just conceived. I later found out that the limo service is a complimentary service available to all patients discharged on weekdays.\n\nThey ran out of single rooms so I was given an upgrade to the VIP room. The room itself was clean and spacious, and the nursing staff were friendly and professional.\n\nIn general, my stay was pleasant and I had a good experience, which would have been made better if the administrative staff was better informed on the post-ward services. When unsure, they could have informed me to check with the nursing staff instead of offering inaccurate information.",
