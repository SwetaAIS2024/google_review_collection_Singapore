Gek Cheng Tan,5,"Iâ€™ve been a client of Aesthetic Works for several years. Dr. Sim has been treating my face and friends have commented how wonderful my face looks. I notice the difference when I stop my treatments. The staff there are very experienced and friendly. Li Li attends to me all the time and she knows my preferences. She also tells me about new products and services which are available. The staff is very knowledgeable.

I feel very confident with Dr. Simâ€™s expert touch whenever he treats my face and I strongly recommend Dr. Sim for all kinds of aesthetic treatments for your face.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107545773584076928214/reviews
