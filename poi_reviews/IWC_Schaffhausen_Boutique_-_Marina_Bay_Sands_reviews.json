      "text": "Was in the IWC MBS boutique recently to collect my Pilot Chronograph Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One watch, which I ordered online.\n\nWas attended to by sales advisor Ms Catherine Li, who was courteous and patient in her service. There was no rush throughout my visit.\n\nShe explained to me the features and functions of the watch such as the IWC proprietary “EasX-Change system” - a quick & easy strap change function, and helped to register my watch for the additional 6 years extended warranty, and all that was necessary to ensure that my purchase was perfect.\n\nShe took the time and effort to explain about the brand and collection. And was very kind in showing me various other pieces, including a hard to find Mojave Desert pilot, which I am contemplating for my next purchase.\n\nIf you are in the market to buy a new watch or an IWC, would strongly suggest that you pay the MBS boutique a visit, to check out their impressive collection and enjoy the warm and friendly service.",

He is friendly, welcoming and passionate about watches. We managed to try on some new Big pilot watches and also some rare Mojave desert edition. At no point was there any pressure in buying, Jonathan was more thn happy to let us experience IWC watches. We spent a good 2hrs and would love to stay longer next time! The seating area really adds to the luxurious experience. Thank you once again to Jonathan!",

Ended up buying the Big Pilot 43 which wasn’t on my wishlist but blew me away when I tried it on.  A dream to wear!  After the sale Jonathan was very patient explaining all the finer details of the watch.  Coming from the USA I am not used to such a high level of customer service.  I highly recommend visiting IWC Marina Bay Sands!!",
