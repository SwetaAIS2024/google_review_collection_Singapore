Patamah M,5,"We celebrated Hari Raya 2025 at Yi Residence. The venue is elegant & well-kept. Comfortable for 50 people spread across two levels. Positive feedback from guests & relatives. Owner was also responsive to our queries prior to event.

Nigel Ooi,5,"The location has ample parking & the place is tastefully done-up with plenty of space to entertain my guests.  The wine list is very French with value $.  We have our lo-hei which is quite unique in itself, unlike the typical restaurants.   We enjoyed the dishes & Pen-Cai by Chef Eric.  With a party of 9, throughly enjoyed the experience of private fine dining.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108583811667301974807/reviews
Kenneth Wambeck,5,"Had dinner there yesterday. The A4 Waygu which was my main was cooked perfectly. It was juicy, tender and beefy. Enjoyed it very much. The wife had the cod which was great as well. I'm not usually a fish person, but I have to say it is something that I would want to go back again for.
Dessert was bird's nest. Tasted as good as it looked. Not overly sweet which was great.
The best dish for me though was the starter. We had a pumpkin bisque that came with a seafood wonton that was topped with a clam. It was fresh and had a lovely texture to it. Would definitely recommend it.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110167001509155375588/reviews
Priscelia Wong,5,"Held Makeup Masterclasses in this beautiful space. It’s well lit in the afternoon and perfect for conducting lessons. Vibes are so good, peaceful. Service was excellent and we received lots of support on the back end in terms of seating arrangements and drinks. The events were a success and I would recommend everyone to book with them. ☺️",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114222281489986537112/reviews
