Maximise,5,"Had a great time here each time.
Love the ambience. The location sits nicely around the Marymount Bishan area and it's very relaxing whether you are seated upstairs, down stairs or outside.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104515881866273770873/reviews
Keng Fai,5,"I've patronized the previous establishments at the same location before. By far I had the best time at Gold8. I've always liked this location as it's sort of hidden and quiet and away from the more crowded area like Upper Thomson.

Mrt station near by so it's accessible. Many supper locations around as well.

Extremely friendly staff and owners, good sound system. Especially loved the second floor.

Would be patronizing this place very often.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109358264531479235776/reviews
Sherlyn Tan,5,"Fun KTV experience with a wide variety of songs in different genres and languages. The sound quality was great, and the karaoke equipment worked flawlessly, adding to the overall enjoyment.

The staff at Gold8 Bar were friendly and accommodating. They promptly attended to our needs and provided excellent service throughout the night. The drinks menu was diverse, offering a good selection of beverages to suit different preferences.

The dim lighting and stylish interior created a vibrant ambiance. I highly recommend the Gold8 Bar for anyone looking to have a memorable karaoke experience with friends or family.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105125574131834260816/reviews
Hsin Yin Tan,5,Went on a quiet Sunday. Very nice place! Nice lady boss and the only other table present (regulars of the pub) were also friendly. So the culture at Gold8 should be good. Sound system was a-okay,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103279005673562282849/reviews
