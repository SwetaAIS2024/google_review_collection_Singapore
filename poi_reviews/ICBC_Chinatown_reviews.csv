Zheng Shiyao,1,"Went in to check on business banking, asked the lady sitting at the help desk, she’s so negative at the first answer, and I wanted to ask some more, she simply tells me that I can find more info on website! Not willing to explain or share anymore other informations, worst experience ever in Singapore banking industry! So sorry for the guys working behind the counters, I didn’t even have a chance to talk to you.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104884840169069778680/reviews
Lance Tay,1,The worst retail bank in Singapore . Credit card Customer service non existent including Chinese language. Scam line no one picked up. App /internet banking  still needs token or physical printed password via branch. Why even bother opening in Singapore?,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117886280855414337323/reviews
Shuan Yang,5,"Before going I was bit down by the comments below by others, so I was not expecting good service attitude and profeciency. However, I was amazed by the guard  who had helped me and prepared me with everything and got me all set. Then I was waiting and not expecting to be served soon, thus to my surprise, within 15 ~20minutes, it was my turn then. The nice clerk said I need to provide my STP in paper print, which I didn't have, and the guard and the clerk just assisted me on the internet and got it done in about 5 minutes and I was told I could come back and collect my card in 14:30. Everything went super nice. At 15:00, I went back to collect my card after some paper work signing. I have to say all procedures are smooth, sound and effiecient. So just come over and open your account and enjoy staying in Singapore while using the card.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100503452936295292653/reviews
Y.C. Chan,4,I’ve just applied for the ICBC credit card and I couldn’t logged in. So I decided to visit the Chinatown Point branch and I was served by Ms. Zou. She was very patient and lead me all the way to the whole process of the application. Keep up the good work,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110076042452851657476/reviews
Yan C,1,"Got the Zodiac card quite many years back and have been mostly a satisfied customer despite overzealous scam prevention causing card to be blocked with almost every other Google Pay transaction. Till today it still offers the highest unlimited cashback (1.6%) with minimal exclusions. However, I have recently pivoted to the airmiles-camp and this is where it went downhill. I called in 2 weeks ago to cancel the Zodiac card but yesterday I logon to ibanking only to find the card still active. I reached the outlet and got  a queue number at 2.01pm, waited for more than an hour before my number was called. To my dismay, I was informed they couldn't process the cancellation unless I had a physical I/C (Singpass isn't accepted). So I made the trek back home which is 4 MRT stations away and back to the bank. Worst still, they need a whole month to process the cancellation. Other banks will send a confirmation letter informing of the successful card cancellation but not ICBC, they said to me ""try logging on to ibanking a month later and if it fails, it means your card has been cancelled"".",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115892214339377097616/reviews
