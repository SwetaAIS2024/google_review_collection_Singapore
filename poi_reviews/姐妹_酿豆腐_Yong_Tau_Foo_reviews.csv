Big Roy [eatwithroy],5,"Stall recommended by my mother. Known to the people living and working around the area. Love how they make their own YTF and using minced meat with water chestnut for some items. Really yummy! Will be back for more!

M P,5,"My favourite ytf

Usually order the dry one and you’re supposed to add your own choice which I prefer 1 scoop chilli n 1 scoop sweet sauce   I don’t usually ordered dry ytf but I keep going back as the sauce is very delicious

I also like to order the seaweed n they put it in their soup which makes the soup very nice too.

They are very good with their flavours and they also know how to cook cuttlefish to be very tender.

Highly recommend to try",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112908652574347918174/reviews
