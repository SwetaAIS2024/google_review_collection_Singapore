Christopher Leong,5,"Wonderful cafe serving Thai and local fare. Came for dinner with family, we absolutely loved the Guniess Beef Stew, Hokkien Mee and Basil Chicken. Highly recommended for a good meal if you are in the area.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103939193283593924638/reviews
Kah Wang Tan,3,"Got a garlic pork with rice and though the pork was fragrant and not too dry, it was a little oily which seeps down the rice. One more thing was that the garlic was burnt which I didn‚Äôt enjoy.

I think other dishes from this store should be better based on the reviews, and it gets crowded during lunch time, so be there early or prepare to wait.

Oh local coffee isn‚Äôt that bad here too.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117624172714283499367/reviews
