Kenneth Tan,4,"Ordered Kopi & Tarts for my company event, & my colleagues enjoyed the food. Went there early as our meeting was early in the morning. A pity that they did not accept drink orders for bigger purchases and said only advanced orders can get drinks also… … but… … I only wanted one box or 8 cups of hot drinks. Anyway, they did not wanna offer me an alternative. So we bought drinks from reliable Ya Kun instead.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110528624870751528904/reviews
William Chua,1,"I'm usually a fan of their coffee and pastries. But had a really bad experience ordering coffee to go.
My takeaway cups were leaking coffee as I walked around the mall and into my car. It was a very frustrating experience trying to clean the inside of my car and only to spill further as I drove.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115850770246163536420/reviews
Aik Peng Ng,4,"The curry chicken came prepacked and the server put into microwave to thaw then cut the packet and pour into bowl.  Head back to microwave again to heat it up real hot.

Taste great but without the coconut milk.  Chicken was surprisingly tender.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113242941318889107118/reviews
Maricris Guevarra,1,"Visited your outlet to have a drinks since your product is worth to buy. I am surprised when I ordered to this lady, she’s not happy to serve the customer. She bang the cover of ice container I guess, all the act that she’s doing makes her customers disappointed and unhappy. This not even deserved any star. This lady is so rude to the customer and not even felt sorry for her rudeness! Totally disrespectful. I have been to your other brach but all is kind. Please look on to her, she will push away your sales and customer. Thank you",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116190921279692695215/reviews
