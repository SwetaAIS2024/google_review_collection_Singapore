My wife cant interfere , cant ask anything , and cant stand beside me while the  doctor examined me.\nDoctor also didnt  give me any Conclusion at the end about what exactly happened to me. This is the worst doctor  I have ever been in Singapore. No suggestion on how to prevent cough , how to reduce cough , etc.  Seems like the docter lazy to explain anything to us .\nNot Recomended",

      "text": "I consulted with her about my cough taking long after Covid last year 2021. She was not patient with me at all even for taking notes about my medical history. When she was listening to my lung and I keep coughing, she didn’t like it and told me to control. Of course I can’t control my coughing especially when I breath deep in and that’s the reason I came to see her. The worst thing is that she didn’t answer my questions with patient and good attitude. I find her very rude as a doctor to her patient. Won’t be ever coming back again.",
