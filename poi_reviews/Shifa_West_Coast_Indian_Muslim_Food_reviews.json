      "text": "This Indian Muslim stall had been a long-standing fixture in this kopitiam since Day 1. Only like the prata, which is not too oily and pretty good. The mee goreng is unpredictable; depending on who is the cook of that hour - it can be nice or a miss. Of late there is another Indian Muslim Western Food set up next to it. Was attracted by the signboard. Ordered the \"signature burger\" at $8.50. Later, I realised it was the same stall as the original - menu had the original stall menu plus the Western food. We ordered the chicken chop from the original stall and the burger. Strangely, you had to pay at the 2 separate stalls. Well, the chicken chop shocked us with the red colouring and chopped up small pieces of chicken(signboard display was not what was presented) i dare not even try the chicken. My burger was acceptable although the meat patty was bland and half the size of the bun. Fries were alittle overdone. I think I will stick to just the prata.",

I have to say that their food is good and the price is reasonable.\n\nI always buy the Nasi Goreng Ikan Bilis for lunch and Roti Prata for Breakfast.\n\nRecently they have expanded their business and are selling western food. I have tried the fish and chips and it was good. The fish and chips consists of a single fish fillet, seasoned fries, coleslaw and tartar sauce.",
