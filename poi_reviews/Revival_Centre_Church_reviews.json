Thank you to pastor Mark who I met at the lift and the usher lady who I met at the parking area. Jesus knows their heart. Both of them are the pillar of this church.\n\nI agree with the convenient chairs. But you won’t fall asleep because the sermon is powerful. Lot of teachings that will strengthen the congregation.",
