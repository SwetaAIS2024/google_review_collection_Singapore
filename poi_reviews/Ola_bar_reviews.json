      "text": "We had a fantastic experience at Ola bar on Siloso Beach on a public holiday Sunday for our Mother’s Day celebration. Thanks to our reservation, getting in was smooth and hassle-free, even with the crowd.\n\nA special shout-out to Ann for her extra sweet and super-fast service — she truly made our day! From the moment we arrived, her attentiveness stood out, including the lovely gesture of bringing water for our dog. It was thoughtful and heartwarming.\n\nThe food was amazing, the sunset music added a magical touch, and the family-friendly vibe with kids enjoying the pool and beach made the atmosphere feel so lively and joyful. We loved the music, the setting, and most of all, the service. Ann’s hospitality was the feather in the cap of a perfect day.\n\nHighly recommended — we’ll definitely be back!",

All they ask is you buy a few drinks which is understandable, we had a few drinks and lunch was great. Just before we were w leaving there was a storm and they gave us a lift back to the bus station in a golf buggy so we didn’t get wet (Amazing Service) loved our day.",

This beach and bar is a pretty place to hang out, but if there were another option open on Sunday night, we would have taken it. Anyway, the beach was nice and a nice place to hang out.",
