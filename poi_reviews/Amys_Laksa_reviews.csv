Rajen Arasu,2,"Was there for takeaway Laksa and  Prawn mee on a Saturday morning, was informed that Mee Siam was no longer available. Both takeaway order costs SGD 3.50 The noodles and broth / soup for the Laksa and Prawn mee was packed separately.  On dishing our both takeaways for consumption, it was found that the prawn mee soup and Laksa broth given were so little (amounting to half a bowl) that it could not sufficiently cover the noodles for both orders. (IS THIS THE NORM FOR TAKEAWAY ORDERS OR AN HONEST MISTAKE?).
Prawn mee consisted of two halves of a prawn (sliced lengthwise), a few pieces of sliced pork and fish cakes and a few strands of kankong.
Laksa consisted of half a prawn (sliced lengthwise), a few slices of fish cakes and a few cubes of dried bean curd. Taste wise for both dishes were very underwhelming and over rated considering the stall's past reviews. Highly disappointing.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113317460774650179369/reviews

Panna Metta,2,"The bee hoon is not fully cooked and the gravy is not even warm. The seller is “very careful” with the amount of gravy given, making the mee siam a bit dry and the bee hoon unable to soak the flavour. For $3, only half an egg is given, it is considered expensive for the amount.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113331481375789850945/reviews
Princess Mania,3,"My 2nd time here coz I wanted to give it a 2nd chance. The last time I tried, it was $2.50. Now it is $3.50 for the same bowl. My mom commented today's bowl have no cockles. Verdict? NOT WORTH THE HYPE AND QUEUE. Taste so so and gravy abit thin (mom agreed standard has dropped too). Laksa gravy also on the sweet side. There is always a long queue probably because it is one of the cheapest laksa around.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107320587807657797918/reviews
Sean Goh,3,"There always a long queue forming at this stall and they usually sold out quite early. To be honest, the laksa was average, the reason for being so popular is probably due to its affordability.  Besides Laksa, they also served Prawn noodle in both soup and dry.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113608706305591448585/reviews
