Chin Zhi Hui,5,"The mee siam gravy was flavourful and delicious, and the vermicelli waa very soft.  The chives were very nice.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103912139510084459318/reviews
Luke He,3,"3⭐️ (average dish) something new but not to my tastes. This mee siam is quite simple, with just soup, noodles, and a boiled egg. The soup is the only element with flavor—a sweet and sour profile. The noodles are pre-made, and the egg is hard-boiled. While it may appeal to some for its simplicity, it didn’t quite work for me.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110015207538201248895/reviews
Victor Ng,2,"The gravy is very dilute. Lacks tanginess and umph. No tau pok or bean sprouts. Just bee hoon and an egg.

Lady proprietress is super grumpy!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115343125507441223772/reviews
Yi Ling,3,"Ran by an old Chinese couple, this store only sells Mee Siam for $3 and I had to try. Quite a rare sights for shops to only sell one item!

Don't know why mine doesn't have taupok compared to the other Google review pictures... but there is a generous portion of Chives.

Broth is light and tangy (lady boss squeezed the calamansi in for me) and not very flavourful like the ones in Muslim owned stores. Would say its towards the home-cooked food type of mee siam which is charming on its own.  And most importantly, the broth is piping hot which I love.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115707001285123682601/reviews
Ken Loy,4,"A stall selling Mee Siam in Whampoa, Singapore?? And a stall selling only mee Siam and nothing else!!

But this one is really good. This is not the typical Malay style mee Siam you'll find in most eating places. This is a version that is distinctively different. Less lemak or not lemak at all. This means no coconut milk.
The bee Hoon is nicely tossed and the egg is fresh. But the best has to be the gravy.
Go try.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112924617196913570011/reviews
