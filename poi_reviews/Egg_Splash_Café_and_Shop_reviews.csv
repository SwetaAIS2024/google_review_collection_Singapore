Shuren Lin,5,"Food is like fast food. Price is super expensive but you won't expect otherwise for such a place. For fast food, taste great and portion is quite ok. Staff was v polite and helpful, especially in informing of promotions. Only bad thing is it's too small and v chaotic because of the constant crowd",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116848753776391265221/reviews
Eliza Flynn,3,"Food is pretty grim so as adults, we didn’t really eat. There’s two areas to order food from here - the kiosk outside which has some simple fried chicken on sticks (avoid the chicken with seaweed, it’s such a weird combo - to my tastes anyway) and corn dogs. For items from the menu you have to order inside but can bring it to the outside tables. I ordered the chicken spaghetti which two children quite liked and one child downright rejected, and the potato wedges without the paprika seasoning. i quite liked that the spaghetti came with quail’s eggs but of course the kids refused to touch these (I ate them instead).

The best bit about this place is that you can sit and have some nibbles while the kids are in the splash park.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104256008764112524116/reviews

CP Chow,4,"Food is average and a bit pricy. But it is expected for a tourist spot. The service is very good, though. We have requested the staff to turn off the fan as it is very cold, they did it in an instant. Kudos to the team. There is a gift shop beside the cafe that sells cute items featuring chick and eggs, becareful for those with children since u might end up paying more than just food.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111764219477151309975/reviews
Waffles Xiao,4,"Food actually was pretty impressive, didn’t expect the egg Benedict and pizza to be cooked so well to be honest, However waiting for the food for quite awhile, that I almost even missed the bird show, seats was also hard to find and not very comfortable, else would have more time to enjoy my meal!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108295932080486085875/reviews
