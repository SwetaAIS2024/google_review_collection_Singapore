Forest BK,5,"🍁🍂Jering Trail is another wooden boardwalk set above the reservior's water.
🍂Walk comfortably along this short trail and take in sight of the tranquil calm waters.
Feel the occasional breeze and the rustling of the tree leaves.
🍂As you leave Jering Trail, you have the option to go further by taking the Golf Link, or to return either by Lornie Trail or by the very same Jering Trail.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
