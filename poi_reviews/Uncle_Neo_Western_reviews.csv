Han Han,5,"Old school western food like many say. Old charm. Tastes Old school. Really bring back good memories of eating comfort western food. Delicious and affordable too in today's time and price. Worthy to eat once in awhile because the food is greasy good. Fried chicken, butter rice, fries, chicken chop, wings, steak and their packet chili are reminiscent of the good old 90s.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102743297642573771671/reviews

Jeff Seah,4,"It's within the coffee shop, so there isn't much atmosphere. Lots of people ordering but waiting time isn't too long. About 15mins.
Cutlet portion looks ok but it seems that there's more flour than chicken.
But the taste is good. The old-school western food.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104430652156502803551/reviews
