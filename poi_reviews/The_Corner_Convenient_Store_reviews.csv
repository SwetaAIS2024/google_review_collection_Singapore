Rajeev Thakur,1,Went there to buy an emergency item. I found the prices are very high even more than 7-11. The lady at reception was helpful. This store doesn't accept payment from credit card. Only PayNow is available. Recommend to go there only in emergency situation.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111856903121567121172/reviews
