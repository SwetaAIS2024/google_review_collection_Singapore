James Elliott,5,"Just tried this place today and I was very impressed. I lived in South Korea for 4 years, so I have been looking for a place that had the authentic taste I was missing. Crispy Crown is almost exactly the same! The spicy red sauce has the legit KorFC taste, too.

Another thing I love about this place is that they make the chicken to order unlike KFC or other chains. You get fresh, crispy, out-of-the-fryer chicken, and the chicken is cooked to perfection.

As for the staff and dining area, everything was very clean (couldnâ€™t eat-in due to MCO) and the staff were very friendly.

My only complaint is minor, and it has to do specifically with my order. I ordered the Korean Chicken set (~RM46), but you have to pay extra for sauce. This may be a franchise policy, but I feel that for a large order of chicken, at least 1 sauce should be included. Other than that I was extremely satisfied!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101577914170719625392/reviews

Leonard Teo,4,"A nice cool place to have a really good chicken meal! The fries are good and so was the seasoning sauce (red spicy). You might need to wait a while for your food so don't go there if you're absolutely starving.

I'm happy to see reusable cups, trays, and utensils. However, please, no need for plastic straws.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108378507127098537837/reviews
Abdul Wahab,5,Nice environment feels like in Korea cause the owner is Korean. Soy fried chicken is very recommended. Now having chicken burger promo till 31 December.

Genesis John Dibble,5,The chicken breast set was so nice. I enjoyed having it at home even i was not able to dine in due to MCO 2.0. Restaurant staff was so nice and they followed the SOP given by Malaysia Govement. If im not wrong they also do delivery service. Try them and you will never regret.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104088434464400715041/reviews
