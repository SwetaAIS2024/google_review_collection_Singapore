Agnes ‚ÄúManKiller‚Äù Sem,4,Their cheeseburger so nice‚Ä¶ their truffle fries so yummy too! Place to chill drink n play pool. Only wish the place is more cold than it should be. üôÉ,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102450729339573474785/reviews
Jessie Quek,5,"The whole ambience was pretty aesthetic, definitely a picturesque place for gatherings. We kept saying ‚Äòdaebak‚Äô the moment we entered the premises, as it boasts a tropical urban jungle with wooden furniture and rustic setting.

The highlight of our meal at Tigress - Korean Honey Soy Fried Chicken. Each piece of chicken was perfectly prepared, as it was super delicious on the inside, while crispy on the outside!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105293969423604614925/reviews
Jorynn Tan,5,"First time visit for dinner with my family. A very nice place for eatery or even chilling out. The foods are really very nice in Korean western foodies style. The taste of the foods are really savoury good!We had ordered a few dishes like, Honey Soy Wings, Hawaiian Pizza, etc.

My kids love the foods too. Even if you are not going for dinner and to chill with friends only. They have quite a number of selected drinks and bites to eat together. And can also go there to booked to play some pool game too.

And the service is on point! Kids friendly too!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103641131822855603540/reviews
Hugh Mungus,5,"Truth be told I think Tigress is missing out by not introducing a boozy brunch billiards package on weekends. It would certainly be quite a unique attraction that makes the most use out of Tigress‚Äô well decorated, light filled space.

The Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon was decent, but needed just an extra element to make it memorable, and the same goes for the squid rings. The drinks, both alcoholic & non alcoholic, are plenty strong.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113775061812684286329/reviews
Scribbling Geek,5,"Had a networking luncheon here and first impression is how airy and spacious the restaurant is. Lots of natural lighting too. The food is very generous in quantity and beautifully plated. My main was Bulgogi Ribeye Rice Set and I enjoyed it, esp the Kimchi Soup, which wasn‚Äôt too spicy. (The beef was lovely too although it might be a bit too sweet for some). Tigress also uses a pretty nifty cashless payment system, Qashier, which generates QR codes; you just scan and pay. All in all, a great dining experience here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111562642484326521942/reviews
