      "text": "The service is wonderful, especially Ada, who was very attentive and polite. Everyone had a smile on their faces and when serving my steak, they made sure I checked to see if the doneness was to my liking before leaving the table.\n\nThe watermelon juice was sweet and icy cold, and with the juicy sweet large slice of fresh watermelon that topped the drink off, it really was such a delectable experience.\n\nThe only thing I'm not impressed with was the lack of seasoning. I struggled to finish my steak, partly because I can't eat a large portion at one go anymore but also because there's barely any salt. I did enjoy the rosemary brown sauce they added on the side but I truly was expecting better flavor on the meat.\n\nThat being said, this would be beneficial for those who need to maintain a salt-free diet. And that's just not for me\n\nOn the whole, I would eat here again but next time, I'm going to ask for the salt.",

The staff were warm, attentive, and went above and beyond to make our visit memorable.\n\nIt was my sonâ€™s birthday that day, and the team surprised us with a birthday cake and sang a birthday song for him. We were truly touched by their thoughtful gesture, and my son had a birthday he will always remember.\n\nThank you, San, Jenny, Eryan and Nandar, for such a wonderful experience! If we have the chance, we will definitely choose to dine here again. Highly recommend it to anyone who loves great food and excellent service!",
