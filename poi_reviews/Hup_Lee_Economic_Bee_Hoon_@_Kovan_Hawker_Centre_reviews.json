      "text": "Ordered nasi lemak with 1 fish and 1 sausage and it cost $4.20. Not friendly auntie asked if I wants to add an egg and I replied no. When I asked her how come so ex since the picture is showing 1 fish, 1 egg for only $3 and the individual price is showing hotdog for 70cents while egg for 80cents. She replied in a hostile manner that she already asked if I wanted egg and she mentioned set is cheaper if I ordered like this will calculate accordingly. I asked if I can still changed since I have yet to pay and rice not packed. She replied no. Totally don't make sense, if I ordered a set which is $3 and added a hotdog which is 70 cents will cost only $3.70 eith 3 dishes but no she is charging me 2 dishes for $4.20 and don't even allow me to change by adding the egg.",
