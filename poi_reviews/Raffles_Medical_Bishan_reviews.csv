Hilary Kindle,1,"Had a frightening experience when a huge lump (hematoma) appeared on my left forearm soon after my blood was drawn. The male nurse had told me to stop pressing on my puncture wound while he got the plaster ready. But somehow he fumbled with it before throwing it away. But by the time he got the second plaster ready, about 20 seconds had elapsed with no pressure being applied to my wound. He should have told me to stop pressing only when he had the plaster all ready and poised to stick. All the reassurance I got from him was “Sometimes this happens.” Well no, I’ve never had such a simple procedure go so wrong. A scary mix of incompetence and indifference. Hope nobody has to go through what I did.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109196870722088838421/reviews

S K,2,"Less than desirable wait time for a health screening that was booked 4 days in advance. I understand the need to serve ill patients but to wait more than 1 hour 30mins just to see the doctor and take my blood was not acceptable. This was just the basic, draw blood, take height and weight and eye test. I declined the other tests due to the long wait.

When I made the appointment over the phone, the nurse could have offered an alternative date/time. My advice to patients, there is no need to make an appointment in advance since the clinic’s system doesn’t honor it anyway. Many, many other patients who came 20mins after me had their vaccinations, consultations done and left within 50mins. I sat for so long that I knew the patients’ Q numbers.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102707033955142382213/reviews

Iris Ong,5,"I have been visiting this clinic for a few years. The counter staff are very friendly especially Nurse Ling, she is very experienced in her job. I have seen a few doctors before, but recently I have chosen to see Doctor Ang. She is very patient with me and always explains to me about my condition. I have faith in her. The blood test results are also a plus point, I will always get the results the next day. My mother and my son have visited this clinic too. Overall, very satisfied with their service n care.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109645163122676083974/reviews
