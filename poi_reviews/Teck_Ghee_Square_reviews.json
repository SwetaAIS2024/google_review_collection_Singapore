We were hesitating for quite some time in front of the shop as the drinks are quite special and after that, the guy over the counter came to assist us and recommended us some drinks and offer to give us a small cup to try out the green tea.. We tried and it was so good.. it is very similar to the one I drank at Chatuchak which the green tea is very thick and not too sweet! We ended up buying ice lemon Thai green tea(without milk) and it is so refreshing! Good one!!",

      "text": "the food is bustling with flavour. fresh sugar can options afforable\norh luah which is fried egg and oyster gooey and slimy so delicious. Fish soup takes very long you will not want to wait. I tried their food before it was ok ok only. Then, the western options. Fried half spring chicken only 10 bucks not too oily portion is reasonable. Then, there is desserts options like soy bean and ice kachang. There is a bakery nearby which sells amazing soft donuts coated with sugar usually sold out within an hour so you gotta hurry but aunty usually makes plenty and there is a 24 hr value shop nearby quite big not bad got alcoholic drinks somemore, facial, luggages, food and more etc.",
