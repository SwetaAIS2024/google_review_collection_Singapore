The spouse is making things to happen letting the vulnerable to play with solvents and other chemicals and release to the neighbours unit.\nPolice cannot find anything. HDB cannot bother to do thorough check for those hidden pipes and setup by the spouse.\nResidents cannot do anything when is done behind closed doors and exhaust vents approved by HDB.\nThis been going for decades till the spouse knows no agency will able to get them. Where is the protection for all with such mentally ill spouse taking care the vulnerable?",

They said they are on the neutral side (as what they claim) but obviously they are on the women side regardless what those mothers said.",

Even when coming to the office to just submit documents also the security guard doesn't want to open the door to take and not bother to ask why we are here. We have to waste our money to print the documents and waste our bus money but these people are not helping us!  Seems like the social worker has no feeling. Help will be given only one is gone! Thats why so many people write bad about your organization in tik tok and Facebook! So frustrated",

When I asked what is the purpose of the helpline, she said it's for child abuse. So I said that's what's happening. She told me to call the police instead.\n\nWhen I said, \"Okay, so you don't want to take the case?\", she got defensive, and started to be condescending.\n\nWhat kind of a ministry are you if your specific hotline for child abuse doesn't even take a report seriously, or even try to investigate?\n\nHow many child abuse cases have you actually overlooked?\n\nAnd seriously, why put someone who's impatient, not bothered with explaining things properly, and condescending to attend the helpline?\n\nSeeing as how your ratings are abysmal, it seems your ministry truly does not have qualified and passionate personnel that actually want to serve the families and community in Singapore.",

      "text": "MSF should be an organisation to help people that are really struggling financially, mentally, physically and emotionally. If you guys cannot help  please do not intervene in Peoples private matters even all the families have reunited and said we don't need any help. If you think, you have the power to do anything beyond the will and giving you any consent for whatever you can say and intervene and we have no rights to say anything. This purely a bully and rude organisation to be shamed of. Which family in Singapore do not have arguments, misunderstanding, stress and quarrel? I had a very bad experience with this lady Ms Nadia, she scheduled me for the first time for an interview in my family matters. During the interview she doesn't know the head and tail. She assume and started questioning me as though i am a criminal. When you start to interview a person be mindful on your tone and voice. You accuse something that is out of nowhere but still i was patient enough to answer your question. When i ask you questions, you are not able to give me the correct answers and insist you are right with the rude behaviour. When i ask you questions for my rights and talk to you the same way how you humiliate me you take that very personal and have revengeful in your heart. You came to my house and also did the same thing even as a family we don't need your help. You intervene in someone's private matters even without our consent. Is this justice? Or can i have a clear KPI and protocol in where in your website or in Singapore context of law that describes about the attitude to attack an emotional mental health person? Even after my wife pleaded her to just withdraw and let us move on and see the future she keeps reminding my wife about the past and made her suffer with mental condition. We wrote to the minister and the directors about the conduct of an officer who had caused mental distress and even showed them that we need to pay almost $600 for a psychiatric evaluation and examination due to the stress that caused my wife to went through. When we showed them the bills and the doctor reports they refused to pay? Are you MSF trying your very best to break up families and make things worse for divorce and so on? Actually, this is unnecessary and unacceptable. If you think by helping people just give money will do. We don't need your advise. We can manage any problems when arise in future. Help family by giving out cash on their needs I believe there are so many families who are staying in rental flats need this financial help. Since you guys are very concerned, I suggest helping others to give daily allowance and pay their whatever bills will be a great help. Is this how a government sector works? Breaking up and destroying families?\nDear MSF Ministers, look at the reviews of people's frustration all have been giving 1 star if only you guys investigate the misconduct of your officers thoroughly before making any changes in this organisation many families have survived happily and would not have all these unnecessary reviews. I am a tax payer and a Singaporean who served the army for long time. I protected the country and have my standards that i uphold throughout my time in the army. I will protect my country interest even i need to sacrifice my life. I feel ashamed to say that this organisation has done damages and distress to many families out there. It can be seen in one look on your reviews. Ms Nadia if you have any personal problems with me come directly to meet me and address your concerns. Don't hide behind the bush. What you have done today to me and  my family 'kama' is always there waiting for you my friend. You  also might have a failed marriage one day and you will also go through with difficulties that you cause to others. Put your hatred and revenge aside. I wonder did your parents brought you up to uphold the standards and behaviour you are having today? You really need mental help. Please don't do this.Just pay us the cost you have incurred and say sorry to us. Be humble Nadia. Growup",
