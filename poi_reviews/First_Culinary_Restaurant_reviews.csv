Choon Kit Leong,5,"Came here for a lunch meeting. A special room was catered for us. The main dining room was huge and adequately spaced. When i visited on a Saturday afternoon, the entire restaurant was full yet not too noisy.

Understand that this restaurant is also used for the training of students in the college. I stand corrected.

The appetizer and the soup were just wonderful. If it is really prepared by the students, then these students must be superbly trained.

The main courses were just as nice. It can rival many good Chinese restaurants in town.

Overall, had a most wonderful dining experience and would highly recommend anyone. The location is right in the centre of Singapore.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105403566482999279179/reviews

WM Chan,3,"We dined on 9 Feb 25, and it is still the CNY festive season.

We drank beer and ordered a set menu and, as expected, they were prepared beforehand, for example, braised meat pot, double boiled soup, roast char siu, duck, pork, etc.

Taste wise, nothing to shout about.
The only comment was the tasteless steamed Soon Hock. Even though it was covered with sauce, the fish just tasted like it had been frozen for a long time, bland.

We can forget the desert.

But the braised pot was star of the night. Well done and tasty.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116438527944123888910/reviews
Ling Sg,5,"We celebrated my parents' birthday here. The restaurant is wheelchair-friendly. Eight of us ordered eight dishes, including Peking duck, and the bill came to $320+. The food was generally tasty. The service from the senior ladies was good—friendly and accommodating to our needs.

The staff, in general, were friendly and nice, except for one lady in a jacket (likely a captain or supervisor) who was going in and out of the VIP room. She appeared stern and was quite rude. When I politely approached her to ask for directions to the toilet, she didn’t acknowledge me and simply pointed in a direction before walking away. I wanted to ask if there was a handicapped toilet, but she ignored me and went into the VIP room.

A note for anyone visiting this ITE building with someone in a wheelchair: the handicapped toilet on Level 1 was locked. I called the number provided outside the toilet for assistance, and while someone answered and said they would come to unlock the door, no one ever did. I waited for nearly 30 minutes. Eventually, my helper and I had to bring my father to the Gents. As we are female, we had to continuously apologize to the men who wanted to use the toilet.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107153795203347743102/reviews
H W,5,"We happened to be nearby and were looking for a Chinese restaurant. Google brought us to this hidden gem at the ITE AMK campus.

I loved the Peking Duck— the duck meat can be cooked to your liking.

The food is tasty, especially if you prefer it on the saltier and more flavorful side.

What I really liked was the spacious dining area and the attentive staff.

I will definitely come back again!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116227057716701202386/reviews
