HC L,4,"Value for money. Many choices of ingredients and they’re served piping hot. The man will replenish the more popular items (chicken wing, fried egg etc) constantly. Besides nasi lemak rice, they have fried bee hoon. I love their otak and yu liu (flat fish cake) and their sweet nasi lemak chilli. The chilli was so popular that they’ve started charging if you want more.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105381120259821237733/reviews
Stan L,5,"This is one of the main draws in this food centre. Their chicken wings are crispy and coated with one of the tastiest batter around, and the rest of the menu is nothing to scoff at. Can’t beat them for price either!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103246641418990496624/reviews
Cheong Yew Ng,5,"The fried noodles were not too oily. Fried chicken wings were juicy and well-seasoned. Eggs were perfectly half-cooked, with the yolk solwly oozing out upon puncturing. Fried fish cake was also good.

The chilli pairs well with the noodles and ingredients.

Ordered fried noodles + fried egg + fried luncheon meat + fried fish patty on 4 Nov 2024 for S$3.00. This is really VFM (value for money).",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105539408712371132699/reviews
Jacob TAN,4,One of the cheapest nasi lemak you can find anywhere in Singapore today. Rice is fragrant. And the chicken wings has good taste but it is not hot. Otah is tender and flavourful. Chilli is the correct type for nasi lenak.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
