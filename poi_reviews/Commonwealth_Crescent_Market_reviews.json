      "text": "Tucked away in an unassuming corner of the hawker centre, I stumbled upon what might just be one of the best bowls of minced pork porridge I’ve had in a long time. It wasn’t planned, nor was I expecting much—just a quick meal to tide me through the day. But oh, was I in for a surprise.\n\nSurprisingly one of the best minced pork porridges I’ve had! The uncle was super generous with the meat, and the porridge was smooth and comforting. Added an egg, total came to $5.50—not the cheapest, but absolutely worth it. I can’t stop thinking about it!\n\nThe hawker centre is also clean and dry. The cleaners are also very polite and friendly!",

Surprisingly one can find many local delights here and it is also my first time eating here; definitely not the last.\n\nTried this BCM stall the taste is very good too.  Ample parking in the open air carpark!\n\nAB GRILL Western food price is reasonable; decent meal for the price.",
