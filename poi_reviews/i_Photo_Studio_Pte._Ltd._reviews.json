Adjusted her hijab so roughly and without her permission to do so eventhough my mother's hijab was already fine and wasnt going against any guidelines. Charged $14 for 4 pieces of photos eventhough their photo was unclear and bad quality. The lady took her picture so insincerely. Wont repeat taking pictures here again.",
