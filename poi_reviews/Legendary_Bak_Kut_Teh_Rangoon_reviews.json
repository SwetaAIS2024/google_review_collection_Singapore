      "text": "Legendary BKT, wouldnâ€™t say itâ€™s the top few, but it is just right with reasonable quality. The soup can be more peppery and the pig trotters feel somewhat off.\n\nService was fast and prompt, and they topped up the soup quickly as well. There js also public parking nearby if you are driving.\n\nOverall, would rate the lunch a 4* as I feel Founder BKT to be better in this area. Maybe worth a first visit, but likely wonâ€™t be a frequent hangout for BKT.",

      "text": "We recently visited a Bak Kut Teh shop near my workplace and found it quite accessible due to its convenient location. The ambiance is cozy and makes for a comfortable dining experience. The soup had a rich flavor, though it leaned slightly towards the salty side for my taste. One thing to note is that the wait time was a bit longer than expected, but overall, it was a pleasant visit.",

Reminded me of the good service weâ€™ve experienced in Beijing and Guangzhou recently. He was very attentive but still gave us our space. He even brought toothpicks to my Mrs even though she didnâ€™t ask for it and just stop eating to clear some food stuck in her teeth. Been a long while since the service here has been this good",
