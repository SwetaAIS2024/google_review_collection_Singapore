Sten (Piqued Wanderer),5,"One of the quiet mosques around and one of the tranquil places around hougang.

Grew up going to this mosque on a weekly basis. It has been n was one of the memorable mosques we had been to. They made changes to the place to accommodate many other mosque go-ers.

As a foundation, there isn't much changes as it retained the overall look as how it looked like.

The view may scare some as the trees growing around the area are rather thick. So it could be imposing but well it could be some, not for all la eh.

Nonetheless, we find peace at this mosque, so do drop by for a short prayer.

Cheers!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115011929186540431052/reviews
Nur Iman Rostam,4,"I did my Asar prayers at this Kovan (Hougang) mosque located along Tampines Road and Hougang Avenue 3 along the four-point traffic junction.

Built in 1983, this mosque is a two-story building that can accommodate up to 2,500 worshippers at any one time. It is quiet and HDB-friendly because of its proximity to Block 252 HDB Hougang and Kovan Grandeur Condominium complex.

Buses that serve this mosque (the nearest bus stop is in front of Block 248) are 25, 51, 55, 87, 115, 151 and 854 connecting to Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, Bedok, Hougang, Jurong East, Kent Ridge, Kovan Hub, Sengkang, Upper East Coast Terminal and Yishun.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110287485091231667131/reviews

Amar Koul,5,"Alhamdullilah. What a lovely mosque for the Hougang residential community - it is located at the corner of Tampines Rd & Hougang Ave 10. The compound is expansive and the prayer hall is large, airy & comfortable for you to perform your prayers. The sound system is also very loud so the imam is very clear. If I stayed nearer, Iâ€™d frequent here much more!

For drivers, you either can park at Blk 253 (Hougang Ave 10) or along the private residential properties along Tampines Rd.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100276120372481396557/reviews
