      "text": "Sri Mariamman Temple, located in the heart of Singapore’s Chinatown, is the city’s oldest and most significant Hindu temple, established in 1827. Dedicated to the goddess Mariamman, revered for her healing powers, the temple showcases intricate Dravidian architecture, with a vibrant gopuram (entrance tower) adorned with multicolored sculptures of deities and mythological figures.\n\nVisitors often highlight the temple’s serene atmosphere and spiritual ambiance. While some note that the temple is relatively small and can be explored in about 10–15 minutes, its rich cultural significance and ornate details make it a worthwhile stop, especially when exploring Chinatown.  The temple is open to tourists, who are required to remove their shoes before entering. Photography is permitted for a small fee.",

      "text": "Location is in the Chinatown area and is very easy to spot even from a farther distance. It’s free to enter but there are basic requirements to enter such as leaving your shoes outside which they have added a shoe rack spot to the right of the entrance, dress in a respectful manner, and no video recording in some areas of the temple.\n\nThe temple’s inside and outside are gorgeous with colorful paintings on the inside walls, color scheme just pops on both the inside and outside and the temple just stands out from it’s neighboring buildings. Definitely recommend to visit when you’re in the area and have some free time.",

The rituals, chanting, music created such a lively atmosphere. The temple itself is colorful and decorated with intricate figurines and designs. Pretty impressive details. Very welcoming to visitors, I was invited to join for lunch, even as a guest. It was such a thoughtful gesture and really added to the experience. I was a little worried about leaving my shoes outside, but everything was fine, and they were exactly where I left them.",
