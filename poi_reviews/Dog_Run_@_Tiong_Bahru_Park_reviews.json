      "text": "A nice and small dog run that’s situated right in Tiong Bahru park, directly opposite Gan Eng Seng. I think it’s a great space that’s close by housing estates to take the fur friends to interact with other dogs, which helps to stimulate them.\n\nIt’s really nice that it’s also situated in a park, because you can take your dog to walk around Tiong Bahru park to get some energy out before taking it to the dog run.\n\nOnly gripe I have is that the ground in the dog run can get a bit muddy/retains moisture despite it being very bright, sunny & hot. Not sure if it’s because of the type of ground/soil used. But it has ever since gotten better overtime",

A water tap & benches have also been installed.",
