Tony Ng,5,"7.10.22, my master bedroom basin , water unable to flow down freely, I opened the draining parts n cleared all choked items. while trying to fix back. due to wear n tear, part of the draining pipes cracked n unable to fix . I found via Google, A Home plumbing, Ah Hock, n spoke to him rgd my issues  n luckily, he was free n able to come down n fixed my my issues. He changed the whole sets of drainage pipes, within 35mins, it was fixed.
Not only fast, his charges was very down to earth, not expensive at all.
As it was a Sunday n he came down in less than half an hour, I gave Mr Hock additional money as a appreciation.
