FC,4,"Came here for dim sum and it didn’t disappoint. Piping hot dim sum were served in minutes upon ordering, tasty with fresh ingredients, great flavours. Absolutely love the young coconut almond dessert, but the Peking Duck did not impress.

The service staff were friendly and attentive, refilling our tea regularly.

Overall it’s a good restaurant worth checking out and we will return to try their top 10 dishes menu with friends.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106301949549138828191/reviews
