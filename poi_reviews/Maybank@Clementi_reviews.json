      "text": "I came here to open islamic savings account, the staff was patient and helpful. In the middle of the process I needed to leave the bank for an urgent matter, and they waited for me even though I came back exactly at the time when they were supposed to close the bank. When I arrived back, my account and debit card was ready (i thought the process would take more than a week), and the staff explained to me nicely to complete the process and use the online banking app.\n\nI gave it a 4-star because initially it seemed to be a bit challenging for student pass holders, especially when your current address does not match with your student pass address. But thankfully, the process can still be continued, and my account can finally be opened on the same day (so relieved because I only had one day left to give details of my account to my institution).",

Closing accounts in other banks took me 1min via the app. Tons of people at this Maybank branch waiting for their queue with only one officer attending?! If only I could take a picture of the current situation.",

Had to raise my voice at her for scrolling up and down on her laptop and not knowing how to open an account. No apology given. She even had the cheek to ask “are you guys in a rush?”. Spent more time collecting our income and employment data even when we only wanted to place a time deposit. Not to do an investment.\nShe has a long way to learn to be customer centric !",
