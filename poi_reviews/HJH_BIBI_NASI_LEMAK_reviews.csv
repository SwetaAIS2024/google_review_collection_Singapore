Hamzah Alsagoff,5,"This one is all about blessings. Let's begin with the beautiful soul presumably the owner of this small corner stall called Hjh Bibi Nasi Lemak at Lorong 8 Toa Payoh.

To say she's effusively friendly and kind you'll know once you come to this simple charming corner. And mind you I worry for her as this corner has changed hands many times. It's a challenging spot. Not many Malays and Muslims around here to keep patronisation and support at a sustainable level but she's undeterred. Having been blessed to have gone to haj and gotten all the blessings she doa'ed  or wished for she's all about giving back, and paying it forward. For that alone I not only admire her but love what she's about. It is something to personally dear to me.

The food is not spectacular but the selections are familiar favourites done wonderfully satisfying and well. I would have tried more but alas after Friday prayers at the mosque nearby I'm alone. It used to be we do not have much selections so we not only appreciate but give thanks to ‚òùüèª and to her for kindly serving the community.

The Mee Rebus I had is authentic good and even better when I added both the delicious sambal kerang or cockles done homestyled so familiar to my taste bud. The paru or spice cooked lungs too. Trust me when paired they elevate the simple humble Mee Rebus to a satisfying great special meal.

Please pop over to support her and the stall. Even as we're chatting the lady is talking about how she wants to prepare food to contribute to the mosque and help the needy with her food. What an incredible soul is she. And what a blessing I got a beautiful Friday.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110350566909335567625/reviews
