High tea at 2.30pm, seafood dinner at 6pm, BBQ at 9pm, next day seafood porridge breakfast at 8am. Needs to bring toiletries for sure. Including towels. Powerful air-conditioning room. Place considered clean. Mostly small fishes for fishing friends.",

I dont get why people review it to be good perhaps management changed? 32people only have 2 bread on the table and one kaya and butter for one person portion? so ridicuous. 32 person squeeze in one table and the food portion is so little? cannot refill too? Got empty table but they dont allow us to spread out? Room is so dirty i dont even think they ever clean. I will give 0 star if i can. Some of our friends complained and the person in charge the cheeks ro reply \" 我说的算\" whatever i say is right. Such bullies",

Rooms aircon was strong.  For food wise, the bbq was not so good as only 5 items. Breakfast will be fish porridge.  Dinner was not bad, there are prawns, crabs and veg and soup. But no meat at all.",
