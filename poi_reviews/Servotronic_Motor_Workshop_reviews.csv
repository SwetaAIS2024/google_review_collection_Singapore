Ryan Hong,5,"Philip has been looking after VWs for a zillion years. Super experienced and can diagnose the issue by just looking at the car. I would define him as a specialist!

He sorted out my Mk7 Golf mechatronic (usual issue) in 4 hours (replaced and tested)! Prices are decent and reasonable.

And BTW, thanks for looking after my car!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110805405815693306182/reviews
