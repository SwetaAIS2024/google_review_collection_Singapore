Raphael Kang,5,"My wife and I came for the lunch and were blown away by how tasty the food was.

We both had the beef lunch set which was so value for money. The vegetables were so flavourful and the beef was so soft and tender.

Ricky served us and was very friendly as well. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a affordable lunch trppanyaki",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110172991217719580524/reviews
Ivy L,4,"Small place but the female waitress very friendly and helpful and got us a seat inside. Food is good, set to be shared is good enough for 2. The male manager seems a bit grumpy maybe too crowded.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116481361859991556004/reviews
Celeste Wong,3,"Food was average and no showmanship. Service was not great.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a not so friendly staff that told us a large family came and there's no more counter seat.  Told us to come back 1hr later and he will only hold the seats for 10 mins.  But the resturant was not even that crowded when we head back 1hr later. Nothing great, will not go back again.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117676584835706569300/reviews

Siti Nurmaisarah,5,"My fav place to eat everytime payday with my husband. The food is so good! The staff, manager, and even the chef are so nice to us. We ask the chef to help us reheat our friend's food and he said sure! Even change to a new plate. Will never stop visiting here ♥️",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108288665557971859725/reviews
