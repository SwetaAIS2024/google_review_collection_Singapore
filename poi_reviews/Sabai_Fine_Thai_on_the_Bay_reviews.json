I dont't recall asking for a vegetarian version of pineapple rice which had too many pieces of carrots and pork floss for my liking (see photo). Wished they had prawns and cashew nuts in it and served in a pineapple.",

The red beef curry was also great and recommended. The other dishes like the fried fish, fried rice and desserts were average. As expected, the price is high for the location.",
