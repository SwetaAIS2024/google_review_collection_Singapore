      "text": "Bedok Town Park is a narrow but long strip of park space between Bedok North MRT Station and Bedok Reservoir MRT Station, and parallel to the PIE. There is a Dog Run, an Allotment Garden, and a Play Corridor; and I saw at least 4 pedestrian bridges linking the park to the HDB flats across the PIE. If not for the noise of the vehicles coming from the expressway, I would say that it is an excellent park to be in. Certainly envy the residents staying in those blocks just next to the park.",
