The library is conductive enough for studying and there are rooms available to  use your computers. It would be good if all desks had changing ports for convenience. Nevertheless, the library is quite a good option to study as well. What caught my eyes was this machine that is able to dispense cards by redeeming some points. I think this machine has been here for quite a long time and there are kids crowding there every time.",
