      "text": "The Kenzone team is amazing. Right from the beginning, Akinaâ€™s service was impeccable from the initial assessment to the preparation and coordination prior to our big move. The execution on the day of our big move was like clockwork- experienced and polite crew members who were quick, efficient, patient and super nice, completed our move with care such that every item was intact and unharmed, down to my potted plants. Akina also gave really great advice on pre-moving in cleaning for my new home, carpet, mattress and sofa cleaning and post disposal and handyman services. Truly customer-focused. I refuse to move house again without Kenzone :)",

      "text": "Kudos to Kenzone on my recent house move. We chance upon this company when I saw them moving another house, impressed by the way the team wrapped those big items, we decided to give them a try. Indeed, we are very happy & satisfied with their service and professionalism. Very special thanks to Akina & her team for helping us with our move. We have lots of big furniture and were all nicely wrapped + well taken care of during the entire move. Most importantly, the movers have great working attitude & friendly throughout the entire process. All labelling were nicely done and items verified before move. We know our move will be in complete good hands. I will rate them 10+ star! Well done :)\nWill not hesitate to recommend to my friends & relatives because you can be assured of a stress free move.  Once again thank you Akina & Team!",
