We won’t forget your kindness!\n\nBest,\nAnnabel",

      "text": "To Whom It May Concern,\n\nI am writing to express my deepest gratitude to the six Red Cross first aiders from Punggol / Coney Island who provided exceptional assistance on 17 August 2024.\n\nMy friends and I, a group of ten, were cycling at Coney Island and along the Punggol Park Connector Network when one of our team members unfortunately had a serious fall and was badly injured. The prompt response of the Red Cross first aiders was nothing short of remarkable. They treated my friend swiftly, assessed the situation thoroughly, and coordinated the activation of an ambulance and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), recognizing that the terrain could hinder direct access to the casualty.\n\nI was truly impressed by the efficiency of the response system that the Red Cross has in place. The way these first aiders managed to reach the injured person quickly, administer the most appropriate care, and facilitate the rapid arrival of the ambulance and SCDF ensured that my friend was transported to the nearest hospital as quickly as possible.\n\nThe six heroes I would like to commend from First Aiders on wheels @ Punggol are:\n\n1. Ian Chia\n2. Kashif\n3. Dave Ng\n4. Carmelo Yabot\n5. Ming Wee Goh\n6. Tan Kah Ooi\n\nAdditionally, I would like to extend a special thank you to the ambulance staff and the SCDF team for their vital role in assisting on 17 August 2024.\n\nYour dedication and professionalism are greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you once again.\n\nSincerely,\n[Kevin Tay, the one who approached first aiders]",
