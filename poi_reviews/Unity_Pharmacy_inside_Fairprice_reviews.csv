Yan Chung,1,"Completely oblivious of people standing in line waiting for payment. Only interested in serving the current customer in a difficult and long winded conversation. If my medication does not have my personal details stuck unto the box I would have just left.

This is at around 430pm.

Told the cashier, she said ""no choice la."" Thank you for that.

Go there if you have plenty of time to wait or when there is absolutely novody in the store.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102713577753449498524/reviews
