Although I shifted elsewhere, I would still go back once a month to eat this nasi lemak which just reminds me of my childhood.\nThe egg and chilli is something you cannot find anywhere else. I always order just egg and rice with chilli.",

      "text": "Breakfast full filled with treat (rudeness) from lady attending to customers!!!\nLady who takes order grumpy, rude and always rushing customer placing order (can understand she maybe tired, but that’s her business. Nobody’s job is easy, especially in Singapore.  Twice over  I went there to buy & given order to her for take away, but she couldn’t understand.  Is it difficult to understand what I mentioned?  3 PACKETS - 2 chicken and 1 fish yet she didn’t understand, I never had issues with other stalls placing orders, however, most stall holders if they don’t understand they ask again politely.  This lady has Bad customer service etiquette.  Food is acceptable but not fantastic, patronize it because is convenient for me.  Male chef friendly always wearing a smile.  Lady tending should improve her customer service attitude. Maybe she’s just rude to me because I am old…not up to the speed she needs.",
