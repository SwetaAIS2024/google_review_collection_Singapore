Heard it was an opera theater before turned into movie theater and now, a mall.\n\nWon't it be nice, to turn it into a heritage museum to in-store all the Chinese rich cultures here. The location is really tragic, symbolic you're in the central of Chinatown.",

      "text": "The Majestic was built in 1927 by Eu Tong Sen, a tin mining and rubber magnate, built a Cantonese opera house for his wife who was a Cantonese opera fan (echoes of Mumtaz Mahal). Which was turned into a movie theater in the age of celluloid, then as a mall where people can still enjoy the art deco structure while they eat at restaurants or shop within the mall.\n\nCame here too early while raining sadly just caught the exterior of the building across the street and before ducking inside the MRT station beside it. #RP",
