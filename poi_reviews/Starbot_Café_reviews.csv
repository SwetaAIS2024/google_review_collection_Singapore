Santosh Ojha,2,"It's not that great and taste is not that great. Just a fast food place and for chinese chefs to get their fried rice wrong , must be very bad. They gave some deep fried item in our veg meal, not sure,.what do they use to deep fry. It's expensive but food doesn't stand for the price. There was simple ask salt pepper and were not able to find in complete store and didn't see any interest from staff to locate.Staffs are rude, My experience was not great and least recommended place to go.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110172574477303134392/reviews

Ericka Delos Santos,5,"Letâ€™s start with the service - the staff were so polite  and greeted us with a big smile :) when we first enter. She led us to our table and make sure we are comfortable. I like SYLVIA service and she is really great staff to have.

Food - the food serve was hot and the portion is big enough to share with my kid. The ice cream portion is big too. My kid enjoys it and will be back again for the ice cream ðŸ¥°",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103026070331783397529/reviews
