X Y,5,"I was at this terminal 3 Hudson coffee.
Actually the lady who was at the counter said they need to close for the closing sakes and start at 12am.
I was here around 11.50pm.
She told me it will take 20 mintues .

I and my sister in law we are travelling to Turkey.  We are very hungry then later the lady open the cashier and she served us what we wanted.

I was touched by her kindness .

Russell Griggs,3,Really good coffee (flat white in a sensibly not-oversised cup) and the service was friendly. But I was horrified to see plastic straws - oversized and covered in a plastic wrapping.

Ferdinand,3,"First of all, coffee was ok, on fair said.
Service was slightly rude in my opinion.
Asian Girl with blonde hair who was serving me showing like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna be here‚Äù attitude.
Usually I‚Äôm a piccolo person.
Since Singapore was hot and humid, I decided to try their cold drink option.
Left board is local coffee option and right board menu is normal Italian/western option like latte, cap, piccolo and mocha
I admit it that I might took around 30-40 seconds to decide what I want, and yes I might took long when you waiting and still not so sure what I‚Äôm going on I order I did asked ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your recommendation for ice coffee‚Äù
She mentioned left is local and right is western .
So many option, evaporated milk, condensed milk, etc and I think the term also in local such as Kopi gaw, Kopi c dao, etc it‚Äôs take too me to see and understand as I‚Äôm  just visiting.
At the end  just said strong mocha please medium, just little time to wait and happily zipping my mocha in the corner to cool down üòÄ
Service for sure there is big room for improvement in the future",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107441330762022545927/reviews
