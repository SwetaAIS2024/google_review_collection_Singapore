Emily Lim,5,"Went to get personal pan pizza set during weekday lunch. Restaurant is very quiet and has a few tables for dine in option. For the personal pan pizza set, you can choose 2 sides. We chose cheesy mash potato, cheesy penne, chicken wing and tenders. I think the portion is quite huge, I couldn‚Äôt finish and had to takeaway. Value for money! $8.90 food taste awesome! Pizza super yummy because it is fresh from the oven. Will definitely come back again ~",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107718291129479357568/reviews
