Jeremiah Su,4,"Really fun, quaint, cozy little karaoke bar!

First visited this establishment at the tail end of 2023, and have been going back since.

Do note my review will probably be biased because Iâ€™m a karaoke addict.

Outlet is quite easy to find as itâ€™s right in front of the escalator on level 2.

Compared to the other places, itâ€™s quite small so best to drop the owner Jamie a message to gauge the availabilities of the place.

Variety of drinks are adequate but Iâ€™m not a fussy drinker.

The vibes though is great when it starts to be at 70% capacity. Lively, loud, and legendary!

Space is a constraint though as there is an odd pillar right at the back of the bar, although there are tables there too.

Also the aircon gets turned off at 10pm due to centralised control. Jamie has mobile aircon and fan units scattered across the bar though. Surprisingly it doesnâ€™t get hot, humid, or stuffy, unless itâ€™s that kind of night with dance music and a mad crowd.

Overall, really enjoy coming here and if you ever go, bring me along. Iâ€™ll be your chief entertainment officer for the night ðŸ¥³",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112933973478443365951/reviews

Leeanne O'Donnell,5,"Love the place, itâ€™s cozy and nice atmosphere, songs can pick from YouTube too so even if they donâ€™t have your song you can search. Drinks always worth it for town area pricing and always have good promos. Owners are so friendly and nice and fun to drink with even if you go alone!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109862066824022684973/reviews
