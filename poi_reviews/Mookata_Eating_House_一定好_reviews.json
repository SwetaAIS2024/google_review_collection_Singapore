Fish ball with roe is good. Marinated meat is good. Environment is windy, clean and comfortable.\n\nWhat's to improve?\nVery thirsty for whole night.\n\nVisit again?\nYes, but would probably skipped those with more salt/ msg.\n\n*HOKKIEN MEE seems to have stopped*\nThis stall primary business is mookata. At the side, there is a small opening where you can order Hokkien mee (4.50/ 6.50). First time ordering this, and what's a surprise. Well cooked Hokkien prawn mee with 2 of the largest and freshest prawns I ever got for my Hokkien mee anywhere in Singapore. Generous with their chilli, this is a must add.\n\nWould try their mookata next.",

The stall offers a fantastic array of fresh ingredients that made our meal truly memorable. Prawn paste is a must order and the soup is full of umami! Not forgetting how reasonable the price is too!\n\nWhat stood out the most was the service by the boss himself. He would greet you with a genuine smile, hold small talks with their customers and tries to remember your name so that he can greet you by your name the next time you visit. It‚Äôs so rare to find such personal connection in a dining establishment.\n\nIf you're looking for not only delicious mookata but also a dining experience with a personal touch, Mookata Eating House is the perfect choice. A big shoutout to the boss for making our visit memorable, and we can't wait to be back for another round of delightful flavors and warm hospitality!",
