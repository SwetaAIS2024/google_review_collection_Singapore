      "text": "Would highly recommend Cpt Noah Hardy! He was my practical lesson instructor and PPCDL refresher instructor both of which were great. His teaches clearly, patiently and is also very friendly.\n\nWent for a one hour refresher course before my PPCDL practical exam, (I would recommend the two hour refresher but I could only make time for one hour) and passed my practical test right after!\n\nAlthough administration by Jamie could be improved. I was given confirmation for a slot previously but it turns out she had given my slot to someone else who also received a confirmation. I was forced to give up my slot. While I was given a refund for the refresher, I did waste time and money travelling down. I would advice all to email to ask for a second confirmation closer to the date to confirm your slot again.",

Ive got my own boat and grew up in singapore as a kid on Pulau Bukom so fair to say I know the waters fairly well but learnt a lot of new things from them. Their sessions are the practical side of boating that everybody should do before heading out. Great day and I highly recommend it. Harry Boot",
