Elizabeth Choy,4,"A group of us (about 20) purposefully planned a visit this morning to PPWC. It was nice cool weather with everyone so excited about what they would see and buy.  Although we have read about some reviews made in recent weeks on the centre as filthy and messy, we have a very different experience.

Wet markets are ""wet"" (as the name suggests), not the usual, fanciful, and aircondtioned supermarkets. It is expected to be ""wet"" because sellers are busy unpacking their wares from their original packaging for eager buyers like us. The atmosphere and the smell of freshness are not to be missed.  Though there are some rotten fruits and vegetables here and there, this is expected. Empty carton boxes were strewn around, a norm in such a busy environment.

It is a good learning journey for both young and old.  The sight, sound, and smell, the real world these wholesalers are going through daily before your grocery are delivered nicely packed to the supermarkets or your homes.

Of course, forklifts are driven every corner, so you have to be careful. Parking lots are ample and convenient.  There is an eating area (kopitiam) that also housed a zhichar stall (Shi Xian Feng Live Seafood) in an air-conditioned space.  Food served here is deliciously prepared. Our group thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes our team leader selected, and the price is reasonable.

Our group would visit this PPWC again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100195077904925878486/reviews
Wei Yeo,1,"Bargain hard to around 50 to 80% of asking price depending on items. Buy in carton will be worth your petrol and time. If buying a few pieces or few kg, perhaps go to nearest market or supermarket. Not suggested for faint hearted as the place is quite filthy,  messy with lots of rubbish.

Wong C.L.,4,"Went there for Mao Shan Wang durian which cost $14/kg. Pricing & service was ok, setup tables & chairs specially for 10pax. Disposable gloves is provided, washing point is available as well.
Compensated us 1kg as 1 durian not good.
