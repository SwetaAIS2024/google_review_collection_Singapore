vivvv,1,"this place is not only a provision shop, is also a shopee collection point. Collecting parcel there feels like hell, is always a frustrating experience. the owner always takes an unusually long time to assist each customer. Whether it’s finding a package, scanning a code, even tho the owner acknowledge someone at the counter, he still wouldn’t assist, Even when there are only a few people waiting. Although i have expressed my impatience, the owner continues working at the same pace, making every pickup feel like a test of patience. this is very disappointing.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112965260032995783290/reviews
