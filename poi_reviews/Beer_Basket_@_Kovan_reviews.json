      "text": "Ordered creamy sambal pasta and pepperoni pizza using Burpple 1-1 deal. The pasta was amazing! Could already smell the sambal when it was served. Very spicy and delicious, and there was a lot of bacon as well. 10/10 would get again. Pepperoni pizza was also great! Very cheesy and fragrant.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the food and ambience. Loved that everything was served piping hot (from my experience this is not a given in many places lol) Can‚Äôt wait to try the other dishes on my next visit :)\n\nUpdate:\nCame back again and tried their fiery crab & shrimp aglio olio. Spicy kick with a slight charred taste, overall great! Fries came piping hot and with a generous portion. Will definitely return for more!",

      "text": "Popped into this joint coz I recently purchased an apartment in the neighbourhood and I liked at the first impression.\n\nIt just opened, had 4 people inside including me. I requested a window table but I was told it was reserved but I was willing to move later and booking was for much later (if any at all). I felt that the staff overly cautious and I felt it was unreasonable to accommodate my request.\n\n3 hours later I left and the no one came to the table and when asked about the table vacancy, I was eluded that the booking was pushed to later.\n\nOverall a great experience but somehow I felt cheated and unfairly denied a very simple and small request üôÅ\n\nThus I am at best give the rating assessment as such, sadly I might add. This could have been a regular haunt for me as it‚Äôs walking distance from my apartment!",
