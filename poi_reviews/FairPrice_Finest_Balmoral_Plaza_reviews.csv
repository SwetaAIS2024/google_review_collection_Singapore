Alan Leong,5,"A great place to shop for premium food produce at fair prices. A relatively decent selection & range. Could be better, but constraint due to its size.

Edwin the Team Leader has always been helpful.

Hopefully the NTUC gourmet at Balmoral Plaza will be able to further expand soon in our neighbourhood.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103030531928357504760/reviews
Lily G,3,"I know itâ€™s not meant to be an eatery but the outdoor seating area is absolutely gross, infested with ants on ground and pigeons which will land on your table as you eat something. Every Saturday an irresponsible family of 3 tends to hog a table reading their newspaper, son doing homework for the whole morning while just having one cup of coffee among 3 persons.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109083844157516114966/reviews
Jake Jhin Kai Chin,5,"Excellent service staff on day of visit.

Was served by Kim on 6 August, noon time - asked a question about gluten free pastries and he went all in to look and enquire when he did not have the answer - could tell their staff truly cares of the customers.

Great vibe - lovely to have a supermart around the neighbourhood",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106091162869944116661/reviews
Kevin Lee,5,"Great to have a supermarket in the area considering the other available options are convenience shops like 7 Eleven and petrol kiosks.
Not your typical Fairprice as it is smaller and it stocks higher end premium products.
Basic necessities like bread, milk and eggs are available.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106327652794826960167/reviews
