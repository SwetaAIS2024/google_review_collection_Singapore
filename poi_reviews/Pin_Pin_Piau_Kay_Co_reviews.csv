Phil Bull,5,"After a short hiatus the new store is due to open on 1st September. It’s located in the Seng Poh Lanes, just behind the previous location and is painted a bright red. (You cant miss it!)

As always, the owners were warm and welcoming allowing me to view the new space as they were setting up.

I look forward to them reopening as they stock many items that are harder to find elsewhere.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113753055185045671402/reviews
