Black version is a tad too sweet but I still like n white version is tasty with cai por (dried radish bits) worth coming here from afar to try this simply fabulous dish.",

The white one tastes better as it is crispy and also more consistent. The black one sometimes the sauce is too little and it reduces the taste, but most of the time it is good.",

Not a bad plate of carrot cake, with the right amount of sweetness and fried egg bits. The carrot cake was not too big pieces which would help soak up the taste. 2nd time eating this and the wok hey taste was not as strong as the first time, perhaps it was the long queue on Saturday.",
