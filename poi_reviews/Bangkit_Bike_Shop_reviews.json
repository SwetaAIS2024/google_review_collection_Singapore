Not exactly cheap, but if you canâ€™t be arsed to get it fixed yourself, he will do it for you in a jiffy for a small price (including parts). Highly recommended!",

      "text": "My tyre cap broke and the air leaked totally, so I searched for the nearest bike shop and came upon this shop.\n\nThe technician was an old uncle with very little words. I told him my issue and all he said was \"have to change\" (the tube). And so he did it plus he checked my gears for me. All in all, only $10 spent for a tube and free gear check within 10 mins. Quick fix, and I learnt from him how to change it on my own during emergency.\n\nAs I have mentioned, he is a man with little words so dont expect very welcoming service attitude, after all you are paying cheap amount to get things done as well.",
