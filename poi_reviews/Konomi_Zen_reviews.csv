Wen Xi M,5,"So impressed by the price-quality ratio. Totally understand why this store has always been popular for years and years after finally trying it out. Uncle is friendly too and very focused on cooking good quality food. Will definitely keep returning!

M L,5,"Overall: great food at an affordable price. Highly recommend!

Pros:
- Great portion for its price ($4.50 for Teriyaki Chicken, as of Dec 2024)
- Delicious seasoning and tender meat
- Uncle is a genuine, sincere chef who takes pride in his cooking

Cons:
- Age has caught up to the chef. His hearing is not as good as it used to be. Recommend speaking louder and in simple English.
- His imperfect hearing leads to some to perceive him his tone as ‚Äúrude‚Äù. Recommend being patient and speaking with empathy as uncle has aged.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112069890397648337013/reviews
kong koh,5,Have been a regular devotee of their tempura set for the past 5 years. It's basically sushi teh quality at hawker center prices. So  reasonably priced that you can patronize every day. The boss is very hard-working and friendly don't be taken aback when he talks loud because the environment is noisy. I also recommend their salmon dishes which are very popular. Do visit early as there will be a take out queue that form during peak hours. Highly recommended and a culinary gem that showcase the best of Japanese food at down to earth pricing. üíé,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102087629395632135808/reviews
