Jaya Kasinathan,1,"It was our time visited the shop as my son wanted a pair of new glasses.
There were 2 men in the shop and one of them was attending to a customer whilst the other one was busy doing his stuff.
So lack of customer service and completely ignoring our presence.

Finally, one of them decided to open his mouth and approached my son.

He asked my son to try those glasses before they test his eyes sight.

He also added after testing his eye sight and no glass frame is chosen then there is a charge for the eye sight.

We decided to walk out of the shop.
