Gabby Fantasy,4,"Rating for the claypot stall which is quite new after I went there for dinner. $5.50 was the damage down which was pretty ok considering that the cook behind the counter was eager to do business. The rice was only 50 cents a bowl which tasted good and clean. Have you tasted yellow looking rice before.
The chicken soup I ordered did not leave a salty after taste. So I will be back again to try the rest of the claypot variety.
The garlic was a good condiment to make Dracula stay away from me.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101655359401510706082/reviews
Liwei Chiang,4,"To me, this is a hidden jem. Their banmian and yee mee taste the closest to those I tried in JB. One of those ‚Äúnothing fanciful‚Äù yet ‚Äúsomething taste diff‚Äù kind of humble savour. There is no air-con. Fan is sometimes on and sometimes off. But all constitutes to that kopitiam feel which we miss as border has been closed for so long. MUST try their curry noodles. Have no idea which part of Malaysia it comes from but I am grateful it landed somewhere here. The soup stalk for banmian is also simple but flavourful (with no MSG). But if u want to come after reading this review, please take MRT to Tai Seng. Leave the limited parking to us please. üòÖüòÖ",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110831823629358579813/reviews
Jackson Ngoo,5,"No queue when I went on Saturday morning. The dry noodle tastes really close to Malaysia style, especially with the bean sprouts. The deep-fried round scads are boney, be careful when eating them.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100700170382435236140/reviews
