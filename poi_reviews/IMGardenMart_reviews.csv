Arunaa Devan,1,"Purchased potting soil on 15 April from this seller who were having a pasar malam stall along Yishun GV. The plants on display weren’t exactly healthy looking in the first place. I enquired with the Chinese male seller, 30s-40s wearing glasses who sold me a bag of potting soil. He assured me the potting soil is mixed by his company and is a best seller. Told him this was for my new pot of roses. He reassured me again. The soil was in light brown colour. Extremely heavy bag to carry. Lugged it home with so much difficulty. Didn’t understand why Until I got home. Really lumpy and the shocking discovery was finding rocks and charcoals in it. A big chunk of rock made the entire bag so heavy. The soil doesn’t loosen up despite raking them.
Already had a bad feeling about it. Still went ahead and Potted the roses. Horrifying shock was the soil repels water. Soil is hydrophobic. A pool of water was formed on the surface the following day. I tried removing as much water as I could. The roses died in the next 2 days. Was feeling depressed at the sight of it. Felt heartbroken and miserable. I think I’m scarred for life by this incident. This is a cursed company. I’ve been cheated out of my money. Efforts wasted and my new pot of roses were beautiful with plenty of buds. All dead now. Extremely livid with this company, unethical and cheats who fill up the bag with rocks making the bag super heavy. Anyway the soil was lumpy as well. I’d urge everyone to stay away from this seller and their wares. Please buy from other trusted vendors. This vendor is scamming customers actually. Not sure how they have so many good reviews here. But please beware. Don’t lose your money, peace and your plants over these people claiming to be plant vendors. They should be exposed for cheating.

Kalisia Shops,1,Do not buy from here!!! The bunny ear cactus I purchased arrived at my home in this state - rotting and infested with thrips! Imagine treating your customer as your biohazard waste disposal. Disgusting ethics. The new gardening tool set I purchased from them had soil and the plastic packaging had some thrips on it as well. This shop is a seller with Noah Garden Centre so please avoid them if you're using that marketplace.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108162175094851917462/reviews
