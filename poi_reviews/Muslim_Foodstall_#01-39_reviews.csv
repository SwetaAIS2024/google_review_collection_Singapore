TTT,3,"I’ve been coming here for Malay food, and it used to be really good. However, I was a bit disappointed today. The lontong was diluted and lacked flavor, the potato cutlet was cold and hard, barely tasted like potato, and the chicken wing was cold and soggy.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117174446031825028588/reviews

M P,2,"It’s long queue on weekend so I got curious.

However I find all the fried food too oily and the chilli are more sweet than spicy

Didn’t enjoy and it’s quite pricey to add cuttlefish alone as $2",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112908652574347918174/reviews
Caleb Lim,5,"This has the best Lontong that I know of. For $3, I get rice cake, tofu, hard boiled egg and sayur lodeh with cabbage, carrot and french beans.

Mildly spicy, right level of lemak and complete with the sweet sambal chilly that atop the dish. Perfect for breakfast!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114360608933061462525/reviews
