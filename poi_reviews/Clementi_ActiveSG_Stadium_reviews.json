      "text": "I think it’s overall a decent stadium although I only use the running tracks. The physical corner looks quite adequate too. Why I gave it such a low rating is probably due to the management who I feel is out of touch. They are still wasting resources putting guys outside for check in and out. The gates were all closed except the main one. The concrete steps and sitting area is still cordoned off for people to put things and stuff. For goodness sake, the Hawker centres have already released all the barriers. These guys are totally out of touch or trying to create some self importance?  The seating area should let people rest and put their stuff. One of the two washrooms are usually closed. Users using the far end have to walk all the way back to use. And last December they decided to close one whole month to some unknown football tournaments. Again for their convenience, they decided to shut off the entire day the entire month without communicating. Just imagine I set aside time and took a bus all the way down to discover it. Really do not know what they are paid for.",
