      "text": "If you‚Äôre looking for one of Singapore‚Äôs best spots for a hearty and authentic Teochew-style meal, Zai Shun Curry Fish Head is an absolute must-visit! Known for its incredibly fresh seafood and perfectly executed dishes, this humble eatery has earned a loyal following over the years‚Äîand for good reason.\n\nTheir signature Curry Fish Head is a showstopper. The fish is always fresh, tender, and cooked to perfection, while the curry strikes the perfect balance between rich, tangy, and mildly spicy, complementing the fish without overpowering its natural sweetness. It's a dish that keeps diners coming back for more!\n\nBeyond the curry fish head, Zai Shun is also famous for its steamed fish selection, featuring premium options like Soon Hock, Parrot Fish, and Red Garoupa. Each fish is expertly steamed to retain its delicate texture and natural flavors, paired with a light soy sauce that enhances its sweetness. Their homemade tofu, bitter gourd with salted egg, he bi hiam (dried shrimps in sambal & spices) and chap chye are also crowd favorites‚Äîsimple yet incredibly flavorful.\n\nDespite its popularity, the prices remain reasonable for the quality you get. The eatery operates in a no-frills, hawker-style setting, so expect a casual dining experience with quick service. However, do come early, as their best dishes sell out fast, especially on weekends!\n\nSince 2017, Zai Shun Curry Fish Head has been consistently recognized in the Michelin Guide's Bib Gourmand list, offering high-quality food at reasonable prices. This recognition underscores the restaurant's commitment to delivering exceptional Teochew-style dishes, including their renowned curry fish head, in fact the owner of this infamous restaurant confidently assured me that he only served fresh fish to his patrons.\n\nIn summary, whether you‚Äôre a local food lover or a visitor hunting for authentic Singaporean flavors, Zai Shun Curry Fish Head is a must-try. One taste, and you‚Äôll understand why it‚Äôs one of the city‚Äôs most beloved dining spots!\n\nRemember to also try the unique refreshing ‚Äúhand beat‚Äùlemonade / lime juice while dining here.",
