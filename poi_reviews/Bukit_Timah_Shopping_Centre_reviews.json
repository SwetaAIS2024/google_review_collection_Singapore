There are a couple of reputable ones here from reviews - you can search them up through google but have not personally engaged with any of them directly.\n\nA few small eateries are present as well, most possibly to accommodate to the tenants. Looks delicious nonetheless with reasonable pricing. Very traditional delicacies as well which brings back fond memories.\n\nOther tuition centres, tailors, and massage parlors are also located here - mostly catered to the regulars living around the area.\n\nOverall a good mall with good layout but of course not as commercialized. It serves its purpose at the end of the day.",
