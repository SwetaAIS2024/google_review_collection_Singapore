The tamago is quite nice n acceptable for the price. Giving 3 stars for the food since one is so so n the other is quite nice, hence the food rating is being averaged out.",

Unacceptable.\n\nOrdered the curry katsu don: curry is slightly sour\n\nSprite: can’t go wrong with that\n\nNo wonder this outlet is empty during dinner time.",
