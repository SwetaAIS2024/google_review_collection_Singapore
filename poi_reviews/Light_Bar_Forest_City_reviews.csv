Alex Tan,3,"Recently media have covered about Forest city, so perhaps it‚Äôs also time to post this review. It‚Äôs been a while since I was at Forest city. This review finally got its way to contribution.

Driving to Forest city is already quite a feat, being far from anyway except 2nd link, and if you recalled about the collapsed road, you will get a short glimpse of it when entering Forest city.

After looking for a parking, walking to light bar was a little distance, recommended on another media review, we thought the place is worth visiting and it did not disappoint us to see the place and its environment. What‚Äôs is probably lacking is the food and the drinks are a little sweet, pretty similar to desserts.

Staff service is a little lacking maybe because the staff didn‚Äôt really give any enthusiasm to having customers visiting the cafe, hopefully that they will improve as they work longer here. It would be good if they can show more interest in service.

Owner of the cafe is there and was interested in knowing how we found them, I think this place deserves a chance and with a friendly boss what can go wrong?

Oh, watch out for crocodiles, please share if you really saw any. By the way, I feel the water level is so near to you, I wonder why the coastline has the feel that the sea is about to eat you up. ;)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103223305278053605683/reviews
Elaine Chong,5,"I like the seafront and it‚Äôs so windy . Come early you will get to sit so near to the sea . It‚Äôs beautiful. The atmosphere is amazing too. I came on the day after the afternoon rain. The evening is cooling. The beach is beautiful too. Not too crowded. Overall it‚Äôs nice and relaxing . Thanks will come again.

Jae Gum,2,"2/5 ‚≠êÔ∏èthe drink wasn't good, I was surprised they took so long to make my drink but when it came it didn't taste good.
1/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è the employees were not ethical, there were two of them who hugged and kissed in front of customers, I didn't mind at first but when my food and drink took a long time to arrive I started to get disappointed, even though there were not many customers at that time.
5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏èThe view is very good
3/5 ‚≠êÔ∏èthe price is not too expensive",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106663286214498081508/reviews

Diego Mendes,5,It is a pretty decent place to spend time with friends and family. The ice late was price but it was worth it. The send is good for kids to play and there‚Äôs a playground nearby.
