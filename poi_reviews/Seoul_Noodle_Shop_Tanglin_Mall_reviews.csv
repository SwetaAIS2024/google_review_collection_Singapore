Kelly W,5,"Excellent spicy beef hand pulled noodle soup! The broth was rich and the noodles were plentiful and cooked to perfection. My friend had one of the chilled soups which was also fantastic with deep flavours. Will definitely be back. Both the chive and kimchi giant mandu were delicious too and chock full of pork and veggie filling.

You order through QR code at the table and pay at the till so not much service but the food is served promptly and politely.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117790449479557280250/reviews
Susan Ko,2,"Underwhelmed by the food and service. I was there on a Saturday night. Waited 30 min for a table despite being only the 3rd in line. Water and hot tea were free flow but empty. I saw many people walking away after trying to fill their cup. We ordered the short rib sotbap and pork bone spicy noodle. Short rib was ok but noodle soup was bland. Apart from the spiciness, I couldn’t taste any flavour. Pork ribs was the same too. Not sure why the hype and the high reviews",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100124781923567741445/reviews
Matt Ho,5,"Great food here. Had a half chicken noodle soup which had a clear, light, and tasty broth. Kimchi pancake was good too but of course eat it when it's hot; had nice crispy ends.

Another friend had the bone soup which was tasty, and a large amount of meat.

Made a reservation for dinner at 630pm; and there was a short queue when I came.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107157220020608933710/reviews
Cath Lau,1,"After three consecutive weekends of dining here, today’s experience was deeply disappointing. Regrettably, the quality and service have declined significantly:
- The cheesy spicy chicken Sotbap arrived with undercooked, hard rice.
- Unhygienic food handling was observed: a waiter used bare hands to pick up food which dropped out of the container while packing takeaway orders.
- Service felt unfriendly, a stark contrast to previous visits.
While we’ve enjoyed meals here in the past, today’s issues—poor food quality, lack of hygiene, and unwelcoming service—make it difficult to return.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102431865161545324704/reviews
Becca Foods,5,"Atmosphere is reminiscent of Korea - a warm, cosy bustling outlet tucked away in the basement. Tried the half chicken noodles and spicy pork and they were excellent. Portions were sufficiently hearty for one pax and everything was clean tasting and healthy. The noodles were cooked perfectly and still retained a bit of bite. Could be a little more generous with the side dishes but the free mandus more than made up for it.

A great joint to revisit again and again when the craving strikes or when the weather turns.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108609711843571349657/reviews
