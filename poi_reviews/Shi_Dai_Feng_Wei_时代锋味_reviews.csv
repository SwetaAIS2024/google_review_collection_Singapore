GoAheadGroupFan,5,"On Monday 5 February 2024, I had fried Hokkien prawn noodle for my lunch at The Marketplace @ 58 outlet in Bedok after walking from Tanah Merah MRT station on the East-West MRT line by using exit A and the hokkien prawn noodle tasted very delicious. Overall, the service provided to me was very good and it cost me $4.00. I would love to try these delightful carrot cake and fried Hokkien prawn noodle dishes from this branch in the future.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105877449322822053371/reviews
