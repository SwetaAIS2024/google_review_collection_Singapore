Jiayou,5,"Good place to use your cdc vouchers! The other stalls nearby accept it too.
The coleslaw and mashed potato are pretty good honestly, much better than you would get from some restaurants. My mother says she doesn't like the mash since it contains butter, but that's exactly what I like. The coleslaw is large and doesn't taste weird like it does in many places, it also doesn't contain a bunch of hard to chew thick stems. Very nicely cut vegetable threads, it's really easy to eat. The non sides? I think they are fine, I only tried the black pepper, or was it mushroom? chicken chop and the full moon burger. The minced beef in that had hard chunks, but honestly that's not too avoidable. I advise eating non minced stuff outside, especially if you aren't somewhere specially known for minced meat. Want to try the fish next time.
I forgot where my black pepper chicken chop photos are.
Anyway the staff are nice.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100999144101112923213/reviews
Boon Leng Teo,5,"9oct `24.
Ordered Grilled Shimiji Chicken ($9), and added Lamb ($7). It was worth it. Chicken was succulent, and lamb tho 30% fat, was still worth it in portion. The lamb was marvelously smoked, even making the fat so tempting - I had to summon all my will against consuming it. And the sides were generously added. The corn was especially juicy, sweet and fresh. All in all, a most satisfying meal!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101216731478850605752/reviews

Phylicia Lim,4,"Quite a big portion for the price. Delicious grilled chicken, for sides won’t recommend the coleslaw, got a weird taste like it’s refrigerated for too long.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117839451090594765533/reviews
