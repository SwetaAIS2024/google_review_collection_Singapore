A few non halal food stalls. A very short ride (5mins) to ECP via Bedok underpass which u will end up near OBS campus.",

The satay gravy was thick & yummy with crunchy peanuts. üëçüèº However, satay was not well grilled as there parts burnt & others uncooked. üëéüèº Hokkien Mee was good! üëçüèº We dabao-ed Roti John & found it to be miserably thin. üëéüèº",
