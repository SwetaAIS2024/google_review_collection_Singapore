He takes the time to explain the readings of blood tests, medications and how to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Even though this means a slightly longer waiting time, I think itâ€™s worth coming here for a visit. Keep up the good work!",

      "text": "I am extremely disappointed with the service at Shenton Medical Clinic at Changi Business Park. My teenage daughter took a Grab ride to this clinic as it was the nearest to our home. The clinic's stated closing time is 5:30 PM, and she arrived at 3:15 PM, well before the cut-off time. However, she was denied registration by the counter staff, who claimed they had stopped taking in patients due to being \"overwhelmed.\"\n\nWhen I called to clarify the situation, the counter staff informed me that the decision to close registration early came directly from the doctor, citing a queue of 15 patients. I requested that she check with the doctor to reconsider, but she refused and instead told me to visit other branches.\n\nI find this unacceptable. The clinic still had 2 hours and 15 minutes until closing time. It is absurd for a healthcare facility to turn away patients when there is still ample time to manage the queue. This lack of empathy and professionalism is disappointing, especially for a clinic that should prioritize patient care.\n\nI hope the management addresses this issue and implements measures to provide more considerate service in the future.",

Her attitude was dismissive and unfriendly, which is unfortunate because patients visiting a clinic are often already unwell and need kindness and understanding.\n\nI hope the management can address this to ensure all staff represent the same level of care and professionalism as the doctors.",
