Their kway teow is delicious especially if you add their chili sauce and fried pork fat.\n\nPlus tasted their white/black carrot cake (not a cake but an omelette) it was also YUM.\n\nSister is nice and accomodating too even if she isnt keen on smiling. Very very yum.",

      "text": "Excellent. One of, if not the BEST Oyster omelet ('Or luak') in Singapore.\nThe egg omelet is actually Crispy and not soggy as per the usual.\nThe oysters are suprisingly fresh and not foul tasting at all. Delectable, creamy, succulent oysters.\nThese two components paired with the tangy chilly make this dish extremely savoury and appetising.\n\nThe Black fried carrot cake (Chai tao kuay) here is also fantastic. I recommend adding an additional egg for +$1.\nStrong and smokey 'Wok hey' flavour, quintessential to a proper Chai tao kuay.\nSmokey, sweet, savoury, and satisfying. This captures the essence of local hawker fried food. Superbly well done.\n\nWill definitely return.",

It's not spicy and on the sour and gives some mild spices to it.\n\nTheir fried Kway Tiao is also very yummy and sweet.\n\nThe chef frying the fried carrot cake is cheerful and so happy to capture his smiling face!\n\n#ILoveTongXin",

About 6-7 pieces of medium size prawns were provided.\n\n2) Char Kway Teow - At $8 I thought the quantity was a bit less but taste wise this is a good Kway Teow. Comes with cockles, beansprouts and Chinese sausage.\n\n3) Mixed Carrot Cake - Really like the white carrot cake - so soft. Even the black carrot cake is flavourful.",

First few mouths tasted good but as it cooled I realised it was actually pretty mid - both my mum and husband felt the same too. Overall so so but I haven't tried the other dishes so might give it another try when I'm back.",
