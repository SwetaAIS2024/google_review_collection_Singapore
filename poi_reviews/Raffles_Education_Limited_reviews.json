They do not care about the welfare of students and have committed themselves in various corrupt activities that will consequently affect the students. I wouldn't give a single star if I could write a review without having to give one. This is a very unreliable college and has no university standards. More reviews on glass door about Raffles will suffice. The most corrupt college I have ever come across. The college has no ranking on any websites of Singapore either.",
