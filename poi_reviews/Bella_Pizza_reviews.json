We found this Bella Pasta.. the service was good, and the food was nice, too, especially the pizza thin crust. Well, although some mistakes were on the food but the staff was nice to wavie off & offer to change. Staff seeing us with dogs also offer to provide some cold water for them. Will come again.",

The one with honey looks good too which we would probably try it next round. The folded pizza was a little disappointing and I was expecting more out of it. Gnocchi is flooded with sauces and cheeses. It’s super chewy and definitely recommend!",
