D Lo,5,"Love the pandan gula melaka roll with jellies. The colour is a bit too intense and artificial but the flavour was really well balanced and not too sweet.

The rolls are made fresh on the day according to the staff and must be consumed within 3 days of purchase (but it‚Äôs really +2 days from date of purchase).",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109633349485863470090/reviews

j c,5,"This is hands down my favourite cake shop in Singapore. Love that the bakery has Japanese inspired fare, and used to host baking lessons by Japanese instructors in the past, which were really well conducted. The Pandan Swiss roll is to die for - it‚Äôs so soft and moist with a strong pandan flavour (better than a certain other famous brand). The coconut cream, desiccated coconut flakes and gula malaka jelly added a nice touch. Loved the matcha series - matcha cream puff and strawberry shortcake; latter is the best in Sg. Has a very distinct and robust matcha flavour. I also like the tea/coffee jellies and scoop cake.

As a long time customer for the past ten years, I feel it is a shame that the outlet in Clarke quay closed down and the prices have increased with inflation over the years. Some cakes have also reduced in size. Nonetheless, I‚Äôll continue to repurchase as I feel the desserts have maintained its quality taste wise.

Have to add that the service at the Taka location is very good too, aunty is ichiban at promoting the items and offered me free ice packs to keep the desserts cold for my journey home. Will continue to support.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113959851477906507881/reviews
Jolyn Fang,5,":) i have always loved their pandan gula melaka swiss roll and pandan chiffon cake.

Omg they sell the swiss rolls in slices now.. woohoo!
Dined it since i had some spare time...

Flavour: still awesome.
Maybeeeee because its already cut and on display in the fridge, the rolls-portion is not as moist.
I would order it again but would prefer to buy the rolls itself next time. :)",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111016364634817490717/reviews
Florence Leow,5,"üü© Dulcet Studio = is the small bakery kiosk next to Tampopo restaurant ( B2 level, Ngee Ann City)

üíöPandan Cake small = SGD9.50 ( ‚úÖÔ∏èAt times, I would get the small-sized pandan cake here and let my hubby bring it to his office to share with his colleagues).

üü® I love this Dulcet & Studio pandan cake because of its delightful attributes. It has a pleasant fragrant aroma. ü©µ  The pandan chiffon cake is incredibly light, soft, moist and fluffy in texture.  ü•∞ It is easily the best pandan cake in Singapore, I feel.

üíô Photos shows you I buy this pandan cake quite often ( I go to Takashimaya at Ngee Ann City).",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102656561598060120185/reviews
