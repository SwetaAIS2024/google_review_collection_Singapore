Sin Ee Toh,5,"One of my favourite go-to bars in town. Love the cozy vibes and well-curated drinks here. Cocktails are consistently excellent. Used to be more of a hidden gem, but word’s gotten out so it’s a bit more crowded now. Still a great spot for a chill night out.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111012911627974119892/reviews
