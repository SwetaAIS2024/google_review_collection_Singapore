      "text": "Stumbled upon this bar during a weekday night after a long day. I ordered the Taiwanese bento and scallion intestines, while husband ordered the chicken chop and special fries. We were blown away by the food! Really didnâ€™t expect this quality from a dark bar in the middle of nowhere. The fries were so crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, Iâ€™m not usually a fan of fries but this is ðŸ’¯. The intestines are well cleaned, well seasoned and is light and crispy. The Taiwanese set is also surprisingly tasty, and the chicken chop is tender and well seasoned. Really glad we came across this place, will definitely bring our friends over one day.",

      "text": "I had the pleasure of savoring one of the best cheeseburgers I've ever tasted, paired with a perfectly poured pint of Guinness. The burger was simply phenomenal â€“ juicy, flavorful, with the cheese melting just right, layered with fresh toppings and nestled in a perfectly toasted bun. Each bite was heaven, balancing rich flavors and textures.\n\nAnd that Guinnessâ€¦ it was the ideal pairing! Smooth, creamy, with that unmistakable roasted malt flavor, it complemented the burger beautifully. Together, it was a match made in culinary heaven. Highly recommend this place to any burger lover or anyone seeking a perfect pub experience. Canâ€™t wait to come back!\n\nFyi i had 5 pints of Guineness and still counting",

When we asked the service staff, she was so defensive and gave so much excuses about it. Just thought that it wasnâ€™t value for money and service staff didnâ€™t handle the situation well.\nAfter a while, the manager did came over and tried to salvage the situation. We truly appreciate it but we hope the service staff could be more professional.",
