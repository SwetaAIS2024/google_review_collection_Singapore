Very caring teachers and support staff. Spoke very little English when she started, and within a few months was fluent. Highly recommended!",

For me I really could not tolerate this as my son was sick every week after attending school. One week attend school. One week sick. This went on for 4 cycle. Then finally he was admitted in the hospital for Rotavirus. That‚Äôs when we took him out. It was not worth my child‚Äôs life.",
