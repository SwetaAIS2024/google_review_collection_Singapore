MD Adam,4,"One of the better mee rebus I've had in a pretty obscure coffee shop ðŸ˜‚ Coffee shop on the first floor of the Zervex building facing the road, with outdoor visitor parking lots beside it.

Gravy was thick, sweet and nutty, noodles were just nice for me (not too overcooked), and begedil/potato patty was good!

Auntie manning the stall was very friendly and welcoming, and menu seems pretty diverse too :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113804061984228026454/reviews
