I let him roam freely around the house and I just started introducing to him fresh vegetables too. The vet advised me to get him to go for a check up before I can get him neutered.

Buying the VIP Card was worth it, and whenever birthday month arrive the discount given was alot as compared to other pet shops, some doesn't even give discount for bday month. Last but not least, staff were very very friendly, one of the staff even remembered me when I first got my hamster there. He would always ask how my hamster is doingü§≠",
