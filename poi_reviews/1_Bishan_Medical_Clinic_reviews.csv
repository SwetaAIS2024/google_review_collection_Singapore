Ong Laysee,5,Dr Poh is very friendly and helpful. He helped my father in law when he was too weak to stand up. The clinic was nice to lend us wheelchair and staff offer us support during the visit.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104764914909213360394/reviews
Sara Xue,5,"Took out my stitches really well. I had gotten a surgery a month prior overseas and regretfully waited too long to take them out.

Cynthia Yeo,5,"Whenever I'm not well, this clinic will always be my first choice (although I've move house). The female receptionist is always very welcoming and friendly. When the queue is long she even suggest that I can have my meal and come back. Personally I prefer Dr Poh at the clinic. His always very attentive to the details I've provided and he gives very good advice. The clinic is also very clean, neat and have a pleasant smell. The female will always wish you speedy recovery before you leave the clinic.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102852526086275016495/reviews
