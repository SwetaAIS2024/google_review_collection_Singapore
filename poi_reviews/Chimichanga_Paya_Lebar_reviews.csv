Andrew XZ Lee,5,"The Chimichanga is definitely nice (makes it feel like from a Dead pool Marvel film). The roasted duck rice is also not bad.

The fried popcorn chicken is a bit too strong in favor for my liking",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103214396992886699987/reviews
Eleanor H,2,"Came by on New Yearâ€™s Day for lunch with our dog after making a reservation. Upon arrival, we waited outside while the staffâ€”busy wiping cutlery for a restaurant that was, at best, 30% filledâ€”did his best to ignore us.

After signalling to him twice, he finally responded and got another colleague to show us to our seat.

As the place is pet-friendly (with a reservation option to indicate if youâ€™re bringing a dog), I was surprised to be shown to a high table, even though the al fresco area was, at best- less than 30% filled. After requesting couch seating, they accommodated my request but reminded me that pets arenâ€™t allowed on the couchâ€”fair enough.

The food's flavors were on pointâ€”very good overall, except for the steak, which was cooked medium well instead of the medium rare we ordered. When requesting payment, I asked for the rest of my burrito to be packed. However, it wasnâ€™t delivered back to our table. My companion thought the restaurant might be busy, but after noticing the chef out chatting and snacking, I decided to check in with the staff on our way out. I approached the very same staff member who is still dedicated to wiping the cutleries and discovered my food sitting forgotten on the bar counter.

Throughout the meal, no one checked in on our dining experience or asked about the food. While this particular outlet was disappointing in terms of service, I appreciate the flavors and the good reviews of other locations. Iâ€™ll likely give another outlet a try next time instead.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117724548078617631272/reviews
WenD Tan,4,"Good outdoor but sheltered place to chill.
Had Beer battered fish and rice (not so good on batter, very oily and peel off 2nd piece) generally tasty.  Churros are good but oily as itâ€™s fried as well.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109536932994130185088/reviews
David Oon,4,"Delish Mex food, just somewhat pricey

Decided to give the place a try, attracted by the weekday lunch promo of $14 with a drink. All of us ordered the tacos, beef and chicken.

I must say that this is one of the better tacos I have had. Beef were well marinaded, flavourful and tender. The avocado is generous, and topped with diced tomatoes and onions, yums! The wrap is chewy and not overly dry. The way I like.

Service is fast, and atmosphere is quiet and chill for a workday lunch.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111461636018977333111/reviews
