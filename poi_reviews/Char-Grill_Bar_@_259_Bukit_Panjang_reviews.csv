T T,1,Havent been here since 2022. Standards have seriously dropped. Ordered fried rice and chicken. Rice is wet and clumpy...even ordering face to face is challenging. Apparently ordering machine was down and staff at counter didnt seem happy about the extra workload. Took the wrong order and kept asking if eating in or take away even though it was the first question that was answered. Wont be coming back for the food and service.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117599631738092063424/reviews

Eileen Neo (Sgsohotleh),3,"Heard from a friend who stays near the neighbourhood that this coffee shop Kim San Leng coffee shop has very good western; CharGrill Bar.

Affordable western food. Most main comes with 2 sides. But didnâ€™t enjoy the fish selection.. grilled fish with lemon butter sauce. Fish was a little dry. Ended up asking more butter from the person. Should have ordered the grilled chickens maybe. But overall, it filled our stomachs.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114986102670574642770/reviews
axel suryajaya,2,"Ordered Mexican grilled chicken without onion and the staff had to explain to say ""no onion"" after I ordered the chicken specifically before the sides. So how the hell would I know how your pos system works. In the end silly me, went off without checking still has onions. So much for saying that your system ""will indicate"".",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109287827148803651271/reviews
Ice Kyla,2,"Portion size for takeaway sides were small for mashed potato and mac&cheese. Ordered teriyaki sauce but received soy sauce. As it was a takeaway, didnt realise until it was brought home.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105245469921872913811/reviews
