I get that there's inflation...but there's also shrinkflation. The portions have also shrunk and the chicken are no longer as well cooked. Most of the time, they taste bloody. Standard and quality has fallen big time. Really sad about this because they used to be pretty good. The nice uncle and auntie who used to tend to the counter don't seem to be there anymore and they were friendly and attentive. The staff there now sometimes just ignores you...",
