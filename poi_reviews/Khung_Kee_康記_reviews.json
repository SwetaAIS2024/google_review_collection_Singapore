      "text": "This is a hidden gem in the area!\n\nAt first it looks like just another unassuming nasi lemak econ bee hoon stall, but the food is actually very good!\n\nThe nasi lemak basic chicken rice set is priced at $3. It comes with egg, chicken rice, slices of cucumber, sambal and roasted peanuts. It's way cheaper then most stalls, especially the Changi Village ones.\n\nMost ingredients are also 50 cents and a bit more for other bigger ones.\n\nRice Taste ok, the sambal is kinda dry type and pretty spicy. Might want to ask for more as the auntie gave not too much. The chicken wing is the winner. Very crispy and well seasoned, and not too salty too.\n\nIf only the rice is a bit more fragrant this stall will be the top stall in the area. For now the chicken wing is top for me. Even power nasi lemak chicken wings lose to this stall!\n\nCheap price and good food. Best!",
