sada meru,5,"My aunt highly recommended us to Listening Lab at Marine Parade where she got her hearing aids. Got dad a pair of hearing aids with the kind help from Vina who patiently let him test and explained details of different models to us. Spent 2.5hrs with her on Thursday afternoon. When we collected the set today, Vina spent another couple of hours to let dad get used to the set and help him adjust. Now dad and aunt can communicate normally and no longer have to shout at each other and guess each otherâ€™s conversation. Such a liberation and worth every cent. Thumbs up to Vina for her excellent service. Thank you! Strongly recommended.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106160815739031234881/reviews
nino_house,5,"I got a pair of hearing aid  from Vina today. She is very patience when explaining my test result and even give examples on the result interpretation to address my concern. When we tested out my hearing device, she is very helpful  to guide how I can put them on. She gave me time and space to familarise with the device. For devices, from hearing aids, battery, charger and maintenance of hearing aid, she keep repeating the steps. I appreciate her kindness in doing so. Her action enable me to be comfortable with the devices and be make sure I know how to use when I get home. She is a very kind person understand my need and help to address them. I hope friends who need advice on hearing loss can come to seek consultation with her.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105632961591985503131/reviews

thyelee mong,5,"An amazing experience I had with Listening Lab at Marine Parade.

I was served by Vina Ang, the hearing consultant who did an hearing evaluation on my hearing and gave me a very detailed explanationã€‚

She touched on the dangers of not wearing an hearing aid & the benefit of having it,

it not only improve the quality of life and you will see friends, colleagues are more willing talking to you in a softer tone, you will not be neglected in the conversation, while driving and walking on the road, you will be able to hear the horn sound from different directionâ€¦

I felt I have learned a lots in stepping into the wonderful shop. Vena leads me from unknown to known of the usefulness of wearing hearing aid and I am now feel that I can hear much better and more and more friends start talking and start communicate with me. While in the meeting, I am able to answer questions posed from different angles.

I have confidence with Vina as my Hearing Consultant ðŸ˜€ã€‚â€™Great Job.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105660096932833004753/reviews
