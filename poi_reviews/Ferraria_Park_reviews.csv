Ben Ben,5,Quiet freehold condo with regular competition length swimming pool which is good for lap swimming unlike most condos with odd-shaped pools that are not conducive for exercise. Condo is well-maintained and cleaners work on weekdays. Blocks have been repainted and pool decking has been replaced in 2024.  Majority locals in the community which generally discourages uncivil behaviour and practices.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108338425265290337020/reviews
