Jeremy Ho,3,"Long q because the service is slow very slow.
The only thing that stand out is the fried chicken wing .
Unable to add on other ingredients unless you opt for the $10 set which consist of wings , fish , otah.
Overall can eat but won’t q again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110275270500014613437/reviews
Ismail AB,5,"If you’re craving for a good plate of nasi lemak with fried chicken, this is the place to go. Rice is fragrant, sambal is sweet, spicy & flavourful and the chicken is fresh, hot & juicy. The plate of nasi lemak also comes with the usual condiments- 2 slices of cucumber, ikan bilis, peanuts and an egg omelette.

I get why the place only has 3 stars- probably due to the long queue, slow-service or grumpy makcik but thats what you can expect during the busy lunch hour. I was lucky as I was 2nd in line and I managed to find a parking lot. Just order your nasi lemak with a smile and enjoy the food.

Overall, there’s no denying that it is one of the best places to eat nasi lemak in Singapore.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108301888930313151887/reviews
JC C,3,Avoid like a plague. The chicken set had hardly any ikan bilis and the egg was just a small slab. The server was also very slow.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113718753133606547030/reviews
Daniel Bok,4,"The queue was short but the line goes a lot slower than the shop beside. Food wise, I thought it was just average. We couldn’t add extra chicken wings cause they were running out (I think the operations isn’t that good here)",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114835379352368094009/reviews
Yung Jun Liew,1,"Super
Long
Overrated
Wait

No nasi lemak is worth a 1 hour wait. Especially not this one. The rice flavour was too subtle, was too soft (I prefer it a bit firmer). Egg was normal, sambal wasn't special. The chicken was also very normal with uneven batter covering.

Too long wait for mediocre nasi lemak. Eat anything else.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100194203990442595410/reviews
