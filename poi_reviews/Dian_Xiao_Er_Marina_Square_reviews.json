Fried vegetable is a bit pricy but that's how they make money. Side dish should not be charged. Dessert is interesting but a bit too creative to me.",

We tried the yam pork ribs for first time and it was so good. The yam was well cooked, soft and ribs were easily deboned. The deshelled cereal prawns were a hit with the kids. The stir fried vegetables with lime hits a spot with all young and old. The spinach tofu gets everyone excited once it is served. We will always go back again to Dian Xiao Er.",

Must try.\nTheir menu offer set meal, you can choose which package you want then order how many head(pax), to avoid waste food.\nThe tofu is in green, it’s delicious but it’s in green I cannot accept, make me think of this is a pandan toufu? Haha\nThe yam pork in clay pot is delicious too, looks pale and tastless but it taste good!\nThis restaurant suitable for lunch and dinner session, suitable for friends and family meet up.\nThe crew are all very friendly.\nSpend more than a certain amount, can get a free gift rubber ducky.",

Love all their dishes, especially the duck with Dan Gui sauce.\n\nAlso like it that they have flower tea added to the menu. We ordered the Grape and Peach. Grape is super fragrant. The blossoming tea is pleasing to the eyes. The hot water is refillable.\n\nEven though they were packed, the service crew tried to ensure that we are attended to and helped clear the table of empty plates or glasses as it can be very cramped for rectangular seating of 6 people.\n\nDian Xiao Er is still super value for money for family meals and celebrations.",
