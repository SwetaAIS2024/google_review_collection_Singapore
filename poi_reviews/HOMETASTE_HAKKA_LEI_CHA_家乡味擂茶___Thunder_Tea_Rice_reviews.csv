Shan Leong,5,"Consider one of the best Lei Cha I. Singapore. Taste was great, not too tasteless. Service was fast and organised. Price is pretty standard comparing with others. Only thing is difficult to find parking lot.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113138367268114769094/reviews
Hui Lim,5,"One of the best Lei Cha 擂茶 (Thunder Tea Rice) that is around.  I have tried many of this cuisine in various settings before, including home cooked and this is it.  It is comfort meal for a lot of people as well as people looking for healthier foods.  The stuff bean curd (醸豆腐）are really good.  I could not get enough of this food.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102073353905956017844/reviews
June Lee,5,"I thoroughly enjoy indulging in the thunder tea rice at this stall. Despite being a loyal customer for years, I realized I hadn't left a review until now. It's my top choice for Lei Cha rice! The fried niang tofu with minced pork is exceptional. Although, on my visit yesterday, they only had vegetable pancakes left. Surprisingly, it turned out to be delicious and crispy. Pairing it with the diverse assortment of vegetables on the rice made for a delightful combination. The thunder tea itself was amazing—slurped it up and loved every drop!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104604648932097247317/reviews
Super Fragrance,5,"Update price went up again. Now it is $5. But size seems to be more as well. Tea js gery savory as always

Update
Price went up to $4.50. but still very value for money. Definitely not thirsty yet cha is super flavorful.

Peanut is optional so good food those allergy to peanut. But I wonder if it is peanut or seasame in the cha.

~~~~~

It cost $4.

As a whole it is greater than sum of its parts. For uncultured swine it means individually part of the meal is pretty ordinary but together they just work in a very comfort meal kind of manner.

However how to eat this? Pour the tea over or dip it? I choose the later. But disclaimer the tea/soup actually feel quite msg but they claim not to be using. Nevertheless salty though acceptable for me if I go with either of the above method of consumption.

Individually nothing special, if u don't like onion perhaps u need to ask them not to add? I am fine with it though. Peanuts add the crunch and it wasn't tiring for the jaw. Overall fantastic... Why is there no queue for this? All drawn to the $2.20 fried bee hoon?

The only disappointment is where is the ah mo... Was expecting an 80 years old grandma to be there... None in sight... Gutted.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105892392413528737906/reviews
Stacey T,5,"Have been only eating thunder tea white rice (S$4.50) from Home Taste Hakka Lui Cha ever since my colleague from Malaysia recommended this stall.

Takeaway this on Saturday morning brought a small dessert size container for the green sauce gravy. Ate this about 3 hours after purchase; the box of thunder tea rice weighs at 357g nett.

Finished this in 11 minutes 😋😋😋😋😋. So far this is THE BEST lei cha in Singapore 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻.

Update: been here another few more times where once I ta bao their fried sides (2 meatballs for S$1, fried eggplant S$1, sliced Bittergourd S$1, fried vegetable pancake S$1 and fried tofu S$1.30). These were really good and delicious.

There’s also the bee hoon version which I tried on 23 September 2023 but prefer the rice cos I’m a 饭桶.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102986174268569506114/reviews
