They were also very helpful. I asked the chef to make fried egg whites for me, and he gladly did‚Äîhe even offered to add chicken and onions!\n\nThe staff manager (a guy) also seemed very friendly and supportive toward his team. I loved seeing the harmony among the staff working together. Keep up the great work!\n\nBonus points: the toilet was clean too!",

You had to make a special request for alcohol. Some of the seats lacked comfort. Would have been better for us to have used the food courts on the same level as it would have been cheaper, tastier and quieter at 11pm.\n\nOn the positive side, the cakes were very nice and the man at the front desk was really friendly and helpful.",
