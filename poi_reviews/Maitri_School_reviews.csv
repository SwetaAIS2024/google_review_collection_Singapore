John Lim,5,"Having seen the teachers' dedication to Maitri School, such as how committed they are to helping the students discover the best of themselves, through activities like angklung, I think this is a great school for students who may be differently abled.

Their school is also well-resourced and well-equipped for students, with places like the occupational therapy room which has fun games to engage students.

This is definitely a place to be for students!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109715216837654981623/reviews
