Lawrence Ong,5,"- Happen to come this area to run some errand, so pop by Tao Payoh Market & Hawker Centre to have lunch
- been hearing about this Yoshi Kitchen on TikTok, so decided to try
- I tabao the Chicken Karaage + Luncheon Meat x2 set + Chicken Middle Wings x1 set
- Chicken Karaage & Middle Wings very flavourful, can taste that the chicken is marinated overnight type - the meat itself has flavours
- luncheon meat also very chunky, unlike some places, the luncheon meat is very thin
- the omelette is the key highlight! Very soft & flavourful!
- the chilli very flavourful, not very spicy but flavourful!
- overall, this is a very value for money fusion style Nasi Lemak. Should try when in Toa Payoh area!
- parking is also tricky, the carpark lots (non sheltered type) are usually full, will have to park at multi-storey carpark (but more troublesome)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101187900965109424721/reviews
Eli K,5,"A bit tricky to find, but once you realise you need to go upstairs (level 2 of the hawker centre), you get to enjoy nasi lemak fusion bowls for only $6. The omelette and rice combo was delicious. We tried the chicken wing version and the black pepper chicken karaage. Both very tasty. Great customer service too.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112204115023766914949/reviews
Yvonne Chua,5,"$6 nasi lemak! Full of dedication and flavour... that tender jap style cooking egg, special well seasoned boneless chicken and the torching add charred flavour to the chicken!! Amazing!! The flavoursome rice... a lot of passion into this plate of delight!!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101689535044323427605/reviews
Peter Williams,5,"I love finding places like this!
Firstly though, if you‚Äôre coming here, IT‚ÄôS UPSTAIRS. Can look like nothing is open in the evening but go upstairs üòâ

My wife saw the orange nasi lemak on Instagram and suggested I check it out.
It‚Äôs REALLY GOOD üòã
Your classic nasi lemak with just enough orange to make it special. And made carefully to order for $6 - you can‚Äôt lose.

Hubert, the friendly stall holder, tells me he‚Äôs really busy during lunchtimes - and probably a good idea to call ahead if coming in the evening because he sometimes sells out of the orange nasi lemak ‚Ä¶.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116478471747678805228/reviews
Leon Kwang,2,"Ok, it looks pretty ... and that's almost it.

To me, a competent nasi lemak must get the rice right. Firstly, it was a tad wet, and the coconut flavour was not there, and the rice  was just bland.

The fried mid wings, though well fried, were not properly seasoned, where the taste is only on the outside (‰∏çÂÖ•Âë≥).

Net net, it was a disappointment since I came with high expectations from the high Google Map rating.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116326892362989736040/reviews
