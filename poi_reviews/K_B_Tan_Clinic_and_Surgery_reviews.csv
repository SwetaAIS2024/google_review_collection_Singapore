H L,4,"Don't know it is due to past bad reviews, the counter staff seemed to be okay, in fact polite during my visit. Dr Chen is as friendly and warm as his dad. I even learnt two things from him today. Patient and willing to take time to share. One star down cos I think overall fee is a bit ex, not sure is it bcos I long time never visit private doctor and this is the current price tag?",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103420781983828833660/reviews
Min Jin,5,"I have been seeing senior Dr Tan for 20 years, and he has witnessed my children growing up. Dr Tan is very kind and honest, caring for his patients. He never asked us to take unnecessary tests, even once advised me no need to spend money as he saw that all was fine. The consultation fee is also very reasonable. He also refer us to specialist who carries the same value. He is just as what the words in this photo describes, a good and kind doctor. Thank you Dr Tan, we are blessed to have you as my family doctor.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104356323554857361588/reviews
