Jas,1,I was told that the AGM battery they sold me was not authentic. The AGM battery which I paid a premium to replace died shortly after 1 year They did not want to honour their 1 year warranty even though it only lapsed 5 days. Be forewarned and suggest not to use their service just cos their price looks cheap.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106207268801269953559/reviews
