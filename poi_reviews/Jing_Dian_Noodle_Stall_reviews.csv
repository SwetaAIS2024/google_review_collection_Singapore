Benjamin T P Tan (btptan),4,"Definitely one of the better noodle stalls in the area. Texture is just right. Vinegar+black sauce combo is the classic ""Mee Pok"" flavour of the old days.

Item 1 on the menu is an interesting pork soup kway teow with intestines. Good (unless you're averse to that kind of stuff).",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102383274760996797437/reviews

J T,5,"The order was delicious!!! I was injured and sick so I ordered the spinach soup but I cannot eat meat. I wrote in the remarks and the seller did follow exactly the instructions and the beehoon was so delicious, not plain tasting.
