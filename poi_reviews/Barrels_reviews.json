      "text": "tl;dr decent taste, small quality and on the expensive side.\n\nPretty easy place to find beside paddy hills. This place have a bar and it is also an Indian restaurant, haven't seen this combo before. Taste is decent.\n\nLamb korma is very good, but has about 90g of meat for $19 (see pics)\nButter chicken is a bit too sweet for my liking and has about 100g of meat for $19\nChicken Biryani @$13.\n\nThe price to value for here not great, I think it is quite expensive for the amount of food you get.\n\nOverall I would rate this place with the following:\n\nLocation: 6/10\nAmbient: 8/10\nTaste: 7/10\nService: 7/10\nPrice: 3/10",
