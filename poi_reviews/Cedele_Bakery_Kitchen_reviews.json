However, when we arrived this morning after 10 in the morning, the staff told us that they did not have the Christmas boxes. So we had no choice but accept them in commercial packing as we don‚Äôt know when those boxes will arrive though we must have paid for them in the price. The employees were apologetic and polite but we were totally disappointed and embarrassed by the packaging. I am sure the management must have a response to such a poor customer service!",

Food was normal but the food presentation is really good üòπ\n\nPerhaps just that day, the prawn feels pretty old, got issues to remove the shell. Their soup is pretty good though, would have went really well with bread.\n\nFavourite was the very cold air conditioning! Though I find it pretty wierd that food is served to us but not the cutlery. Not much of a problem with that just personal opinion.\n\nWill be back to try baked stuff next time!",
