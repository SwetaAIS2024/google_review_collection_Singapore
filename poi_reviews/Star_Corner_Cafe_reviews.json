      "text": "We decided to have our Sunday morning kopi at Star Corner Cafe at Buangkok.\n\nStar Corner Cafe is a small coffee shop that‚Äôs located near the NTUC Fairprice. Due to its location, we think most people could miss it easily as there‚Äôs a Kopitiam nearby, and another hawker centre in Sengkang Grand Mall that is directly across the road.\n\nWe ordered quite a few things here:\n\n* Kaya butter toast set with Milo Gao Kosong\n* 2x Teh Gao Siu Dai\n* Fried beehoon with sunny side-up and Taukwa\n* 1x Chicken bun and 1x Char Siew bun\n* 1x Siew Mai and 1x Har Gao\n\nWe think what‚Äôs really outstanding here is the kaya butter toast set - it‚Äôs thick, well toasted with the right crisp and the kaya spread was adequate (not too much, not too little) and not too sweet. The hot teh Gao siu dai was solid as well; in fact one of the better tasting hot beverages in the area. Interestingly, the milo gao kosong was thick but a little sweet (?) despite it being ‚Äúkosong‚Äù.\n\nFried beehoon was surprisingly good! It tasted exactly like how we like it - savoury without the taste of the veggies overpowering it. But we found that it was a bit cold - would be much better if it was served hot!\n\nSteamed buns were quite average. The dim sum was slightly above average compared to those that you see at Koufu or Kopitiam, but definitely cannot beat the homemade dim sum that you can find in those dim sum specialty restaurants.\n\nWill we drop by again? Definitely!",

      "text": "Hidden Breakfast Gem Opposite NTUC. Tucked away in a cozy outdoor corner, this unassuming breakfast spot offers a great variety of local delights at wallet-friendly prices. The white bee hoon was packed with flavor and came with a generous slice of luncheon meat, all for just $3‚Äîa steal for such a satisfying meal. Pairing it with a smooth and aromatic Kopi O at $1.20 made for a perfect start to the day.\n\nWhat stood out beyond the food was the friendly stallholder, who warmly shared that customers can conveniently order both food and drinks in a single queue‚Äîsaving time and hassle. With its relaxed atmosphere and welcoming service, this spot is definitely worth a visit for a fuss-free, delicious breakfast.",

The lady staff prepared the tea in a cup for dine in and I said  I want to take away. The lady replied that I never mentioned with very bad tone. Then I check with her whether are they selling char siu pau or not she never answer me then collected 3 dollars from me and get me one pcs of pau. Bad experience will never come back to this stall again.",
