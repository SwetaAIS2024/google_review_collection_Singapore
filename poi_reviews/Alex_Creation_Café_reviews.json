And my favourite Thai Cream pasta still has the right amount of spiciness and tom yam taste.\n\nHad the 3-course meal, which comes with garlic üçû,  cream of mushroom soup and drink. The garlic bread taste exactly the same as the one I had more than 10 years ago!\n\nHighly recommended for those who enjoy good pasta!\n\nAttaching some photos which they took at Shaw Tower. For those who went there before ,  you will remember them!",

      "text": "This place is a hidden gem! It‚Äôs already quite popular, but its location makes it a bit tricky to find.\n\nThe food here is fantastic‚Äîfull of flavor! I highly recommend trying the laksa cream and Thai cream bases. Both are rich and creamy, yet not overly oily or heavy.\n\nThe seafood is fresh, with the salmon pre-grilled for a smoky, grilled flavor.\n\nThe grilled chicken also adds a nice \"wok hei\" taste, making the dish even more enjoyable.\n\nWith the quality of the food here, it‚Äôs easily worth a higher price. If they upgraded the presentation and moved to a more visible location at Bugis, it could easily command double the current price. It's truly great value for what you get!",
