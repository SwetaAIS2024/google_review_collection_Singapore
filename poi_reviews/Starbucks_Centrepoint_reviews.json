The lady taking order frowned and impatiently responded when I tried to redeem a voucher. Requested for another fork as it came wet and stained was another bad experience! Strawberry Mochi Blossom Pure Matcha Latte? Can’t taste the matcha at all and in fact it’s a diluted funny taste; green colored milk drink! I usually can’t be bothered to leave a bad review unless absolutely necessary! Good luck to everyone who expects friendly barista and good customers service from this outlet.",

The location was about 10% filled with people; a good place to work.\nCrowd came in at 3pm and it was fully packed.",
