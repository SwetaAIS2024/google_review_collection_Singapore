Wong Yi Kye (HCI),5,"This place is the best. It has up to date facilities, a very big campus, and is located on top of a hill, which makes it bery cooling, especially if you are sleeping in boarding school. Canteen food also good. All in all, better than raffles. Confirm plus chop",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101266496228251347463/reviews
Khor Tzer Kai,5,Too goated... first yr at Hwa Chong (my dream sch since p5) and never regretting my decision at all! Better culture than RI and perfect choice for anyone who wants a good and friendly environment. A little competitive but this is what u shld expect at a school like this. Thanks!

Jun Yan Yap,4,"Alright so this probably isn't the place for such a review but if any of you Sec 1-3s are reading this, don't be like me. I basically completely wasted 2 years (whilst getting into trouble (= DP)). The school does place quite a bit of emphasis on academic results (like duh?) so you better do well if you don't want to be ""seconded"". You definitely do have more opportunities if you're in a Special Programme. Can't blame the school though, I simply failed to seize the opportunities offered to me. Oh and elitism DOES exist.

microwave enjoyer,5,W school who said this was worse than ri . Literally every senior I know is literally an example of success in every aspect . It‚Äôs not true that if ur Chinese sucks u are not suitable for hci.my Chinese is trash yet I did not compared to by my classmates or teachers at all.We learning coding and stuff alr in sec 1 and we have a lesson called thinking program which teaches you the elements of thinking and stuff.we have very chill ppl here.all the stalls here have affordable and delicious food.during the open house all the ppl I talked you were patient. The school culture for hci is also very good and everyone is supportive.if you need help and u ask ur classmates and teachers they will definitely help you. My friends and I always exchange notes with each other. Facilities are amazing and the scenery is beautiful.I literally got 4M and willingly went to hci cuz I was so impressed.just saying this is a W SCHOOL.üòçüòçüòç6/5 experience I chose correct,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110617644201423014550/reviews
