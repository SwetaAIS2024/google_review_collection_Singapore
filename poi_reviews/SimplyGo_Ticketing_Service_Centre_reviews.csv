Wilson Chang,2,"Review is for the SimplyGo mobile app. Unlike the previous EZ-LINK app, SimplyGo is taking too long to show the updated balance.

I top-up on the 14/4 and till date 17/4, it still does not show the actual and top-up value on my SimplyGo app. Does it take longer than 48 hours for the card value to be updated ?",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102589058598808274925/reviews
