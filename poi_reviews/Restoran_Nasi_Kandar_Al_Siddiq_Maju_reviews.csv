Cayden Ching,5,"A lovely place to eat breakfast! Whole restaurant is generally clean & airy, staff are very courteous and food is pretty good. Ordered prata, crispy on the outside, fluffy and soft on the inside. Fish curry is flavoursome too. Had some ayam goreng too, cold but still tasty.

See their effort in keeping flies away by lighting tealights at food display area.

Well done and keep up the hygiene!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102199388690341784342/reviews
