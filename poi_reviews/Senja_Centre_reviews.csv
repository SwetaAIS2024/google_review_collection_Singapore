L S,5,"Blk 628 Senja Kopitiam Corner is among the top most popular, cleanest and tastefully renovated coffeeshops in Bukit Panjang where you can find R.E.A.L. Malaysian traditional zichar smooth & eggy horfun 正宗滑蛋河粉，Loke Mee and steamed octopus, coupled with their Malaysian imported coffee. The kopitiam stalls are known for not using MSG but just light soya sauce to bring out the original taste of the meat and vegetables. Fajar and Segar patrons like to drive over to patronize this coffeeshop for breakfast too given its indisputable Malaysian Kampong home-away-from-home culture. Every vendor is very cheerful, polite, friendly and warm chit chatting with patrons that my friends reside in Bukit Panjang and Chua Chu Kang love coming back, over and over again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104943415089697121781/reviews
