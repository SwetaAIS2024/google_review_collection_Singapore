Ross O,5,"Not all legal firms advertise their services so we rely on websites and reviews. I went through the same process and found Jayne Wong and tried my luck. I have to say that I am lucky to have found her!
I did my legal matters with her and not only was she able to advise in her professional capacity, she went the extra mile by ensuring that my matters were right and documentations were in order.
She's candid, jovial, homely and honest to a fault. And that is saying something about a lawyer.
She might decline to dwell into matters not within her expertise, as any decent lawyer is not supposed to, but when she is in her house, she brings in her years of experience into play and gives her professional  best with a generous touch of humility to solve your legal matters. Like mine.
So thank you Jayne for your help. God bless you.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100432828244407055660/reviews
