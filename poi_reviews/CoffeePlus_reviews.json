      "text": "After lunch, we went for coffee and ordered white coffee. While the barista was making our coffee, we noticed the vanilla ice cream, which looked amazing—full of vanilla beans (too bad there’s no photo!). Excited, we asked for a taste, but it turned out to be quite disappointing. It was just sweet without any vanilla bean flavor.\n\nAnyway, the white coffee was good—strong and not too milky. I liked it. Since I'm here for the coffee, I'm still giving it 5 stars.",

It was not like the staff in the cafe was busy at all.\n\nAt a price point of $7.50, the scoop should have been bigger.\n\nWill I patronise this place again? Probably not!",
