Flo Yeow,3,"It's quite a small DFS Duty Free shop, located right by the departure gates of Harborfront Cruise Centre. You can get alcohol, beauty products, and chocolates, at duty free prices, before you embark your ferry. But that said, there's not much choice given the size of this shop. Don't bank on it.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews

umesh pherwani,5,I took a cruise of Dream cruise Genting Dream from here. The cruise terminal is huge and user friendly. The baggage drop is right near the coach parking. From there we have to proceed to security and check in. It is usually very crowded during the boarding hours.,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115292457444279117579/reviews

VERIFY YOUR BILL AS THEY WILL CHARGE YOU EXTRA ... IE NOT THE PRICE INDICATED ON LABEL
THEN WHEN YOU CORRECT THEM ON PAYMENT TERMINAL, IT IS STILL HIGHER .. SO YOU ALSO NEED TO VERIFY YOUR RECEIPT !
