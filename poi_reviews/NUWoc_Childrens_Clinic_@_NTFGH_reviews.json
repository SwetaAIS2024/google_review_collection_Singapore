      "text": "Needed to see doctor cause our kid suddenly had very bad coughing on Friday afternoon\n\nTried to make appointment on the app but takes 2 or 3 days to process. Had to walk in cause number was taking forever to reach them.\n\nWalked in at the clinic and they didn’t give us a number straightaway as they needed to check with the doctor. Eventually was chased away to another clinic with the reason “I checked with my doctor, one has a meeting and the other one is quite packed, the waiting time is 2hours. Would you like to go to UCC at Bukit Panjang?”\n\nI asked if they knew if the queue was shorter there and they told me they didn’t know. I called and check and the waiting time there was also 2 hours.\n\nSo basically they chased us away to another clinic that is equally long.\n\nDidn’t expect such service by a public hospital.",
