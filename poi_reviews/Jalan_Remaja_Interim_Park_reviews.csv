Hai Song,5,"Two elderly ladies, with the help of a few dedicated volunteers, toiled for years to transform an abandoned PUB lot into a lush, peaceful haven for the surrounding residents. Towering trees and blooming shrubs cast cooling shade and infuse the garden with vibrant splashes of colour, while the thick greenery gives the garden a serene, tropical feel.

Along the way, you might even stumble upon many plants reminiscent of a bygone kampong era, almost forgotten in the modern time.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115043676239600879433/reviews
