      "text": "What a joke this clinic is. I visited two years ago for a hair fall problem that I only experience in Singapore (when I went back home, my hair stopped falling and started growing again). I asked my Singaporean husband to call the clinic to check if I could buy their scalp protector again without having to pay for a doctor’s consultation ($250+), and they said yes.\n\nHowever, when I went there today, they refused to sell it to me unless I saw the doctor ($250+). Funny how it was okay over the phone when they assumed I was Singaporean, but once they saw I was Caucasian, suddenly I had to pay extra. Sadly, this isn’t the first time I’ve experienced this kind of treatment in Singapore.\n\nIt was a scalp protector sold for 75$+.",
