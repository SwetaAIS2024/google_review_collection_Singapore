Ordered pani purri also and mango lassi. Everything tasted as it should though somehow I feel like there‚Äôs an additional herb/spice they put in the biryani that I‚Äôm not a huge fan of.\n\nAtmosphere was very quiet though, besides one other table, it was just us. Place is bit stuffy too air con wise but nonetheless, wouldn‚Äôt mind coming back with Eatigo.",
