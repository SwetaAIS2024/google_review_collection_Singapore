Fantastic value at $4 /bowl including an egg !\nTheir minced meat ramen Shanghainese style is great too no.7 at $4.50/bowl ! One of my daughter's favorite! Lastly remember to order their dumplings (deep fried or boiled) too .\nIt is worth the trip ! Support our hawkers !\nThey sell frozen dumplings too ! Look at the queue  !",
