Corrine Lin,5,It’s interesting to explore Lornie road and to link from Ang Mo Kio/Bishan area to Farrer road on bicycle. You’ll have to cross the overhead bridge at the end of Lornie road but there’s a bicycle ramp so it’s not too difficult. You’ll end up behind Adam road market so it’ll be nice to have some fruit juice before setting off again.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111335070274614170572/reviews
