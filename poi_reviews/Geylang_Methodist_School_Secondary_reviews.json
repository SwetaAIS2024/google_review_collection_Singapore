      "text": "The school claims that it isn’t a must to donate and help out the school, but in some classes, the teachers are really forcing the students to donate money to the school. This year, I’ve heard that students from class 1-3 were forced to donate money, which made them donate an insane amount of 1800+ which is just wild if you ask me. I understand that the school really needs support but this should not be how y’all are getting the funds man.\n\nOther than that, the school’s quite decent as long as you do your homework, always reaches the school on time and do not get into fights or anything related to physical combat.",

Quite a lot of propaganda wasting school time that could've been usen for lessons. The teachers are mostly biased towards the first ting they hear and the students throw vulgarities like it's nothing in the MRT.",

      "text": "This school is an absolute joke. They'd rather waste all their funding on a useless little garden and a pointless air-conditioned display area, where students aren't even allowed, than fix anything practical like the water cooler or the toilet doors. The door locks are completely broken, so people just walk in on you while you're doing your business—I've lost count of how many times it's happened to me. To make it worse, when I'm dying of thirst and bring my big water bottle to school, the water cooler is always broken, so we can't refill. The teachers and discipline masters are hopelessly biased, targeting certain students for no reason. They even make a huge fuss over hair; I got called out in the middle of class for a single strand of hair touching my eyebrows, even after cutting my hair super short. And forget about staying in class during break to use our Chromebooks for homework—they don't allow it. This school is a nightmare. Enroll your kids here at your own risk. Absolutely unbelievable.",
