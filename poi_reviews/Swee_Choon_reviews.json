Fried chicken wing was cold and batter was not tasty. Rest of the food was just on the average side.\n\nI rather put my buck in other dim sum places",

Their dumplings, siew mai and wantons are generous in fillings of prawns and meat deliciously flavoured.\nService is excellent especially Alan at the front desk who despite the humidity was cheery, welcoming and efficient in managing the queue. Grace who attended to our table was very helpful and courteous and made our dining a  very pleasant experience.",

Not only the place was revamped, they have also added many new food items on the menu, not only the usual dim sums. Had the stir fried cheong fun and la zi ji which were pretty good. Surprisingly good service and reasonable price.",
