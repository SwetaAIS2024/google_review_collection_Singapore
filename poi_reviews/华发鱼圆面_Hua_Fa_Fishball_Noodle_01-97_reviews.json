      "text": "This stall is ran by a middle aged couple which surprisingly accepts only cash. Queue is long and even after the order I could go get my drink, sit down and wait for another 15 minutes or so for my order. Guy really take his time to cook the noodles and mixed it well. Which explains the queue as most of them are residents and know that after their orders they just sit nearby for the food. I ordered the large bowl ($4.50) and added ingredients ($1). It came in big bowls of noodles and soup with ingredients. Noodles are done well but just lack the taste I liked for in dry noodles. Ingredients are definitely factory made so to me it’s ok. Hence the 4 stars rating.",

The queue moves slowly as each bowl is prepared one by one.\n\nI ordered the large fishball noodle($4.50) with extra ingredients (+$1.00).\n\nThe noodles had a good mix of vinegar, broth, bean sprouts and lard which had an overall salty and balance of acid from vinegar and alkaline noodles.\n\nThe fishballs, fish cakes and fish dumpling tasted fresh and not too salty.",

      "text": "Mediocre tasting fishball noodles using factory made fishball and fishcake. Noodles lack fragrance and punch even thou there was pork lard. Nonetheless there was a long snaking queue on a Sunday morning, probably due to the fact that they serve a $3.50 portion, enough for a small eater.\n\nTotally regretted queueing close to 30mins for this.\n\nI did see two other fishball noodle stall with long queue using handmade fishballs, so maybe those will be worth checking out.",
