The food and drinks were excellent. The Hibiki and yuzu sake were big hits with our team. The staff in particular took really good care of us and ensured that we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and partied the whole night away. Kudos to Raymond and his crew for doing a great job hosting us.",

All my friends enjoyed the night very much and the space and sound system together with a darts and pool machine in the room really made the night fun! The screen was also big and nice and we could adjust the atmosphere and lights to our liking. The room had a total of 5 mics which allowed everyone to have their share of mic time. They did some simple deco for us for the birthday party too! Appreciate it!",
