Elise Phang,4,Sandwich was good although a the bread is  over toasted. Got quite a bit of char. Coffee was good with different beans used. The staff knows their product well. Ambience is very good. Not crowded. I went on Sun morning and it was quiet. I prefer the less crowded ambience to really enjoy the food and place.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101418289094349124427/reviews
김윤희,5,"The coffee here is absolutely delicious. The classic black has no acidity at all — just clean, smooth, and rich in flavor. The outdoor terrace has a lovely atmosphere, and the interior is just as cozy and inviting. The lemon zesty pound cake was truly impressive — a perfect balance of citrus and sweetness. Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102382741725510501509/reviews
WM,4,"Cosy environment and ample seats even on a Saturday. Service was attentive and the staff brought the menu and water to the table right away.

Iced mocha RM19 was lacklustre, looked and tasted like an iced latte. Baked basque cheese cake RM20 was tasty.

Reception is poor inside, if you're looking to work or use the internet, make sure to sit closer to the door.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109123060858334739092/reviews

Cheewee Kok,4,"06 Oct 2024

Finally we visited this cafe after they were in business about 2 years ago.

Amazed with the attentive acts from the serving crews.

We sat outside the cafe that had some small tables and low chairs.

The beef ramen was tasty and came with the crunchy archa. Then we ordered a bagel with chicken, it came with the fried sweet potatoes.

MSG level is acceptable.

Place to revisit.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104234572596322175340/reviews
