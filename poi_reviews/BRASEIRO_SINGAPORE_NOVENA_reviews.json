Prob cheap beef from NZ.\nServer lady was friendly helpful and attentive.\n\n2nd visit.  Too chewy.  Too much gristle vein see photo.  Beef lacked flavour not juicy.  Probably sous vide and seared.  Wasted jaw effort chewing. 1/5.  Staff was great, replaced with better piece.  No issues.",

The steak is also good and cooked as per request. Maybe only the tiramisu did not have that muh impact. Service was super nice. Thank you for the hospitality.",
