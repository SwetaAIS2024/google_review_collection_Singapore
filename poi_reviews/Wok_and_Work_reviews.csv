nad MN,4,"I visited this place for the first time around dinner time on the weekend. The environment was okay‚Äînothing special, but it was spacious and clean. I ordered the Jjamppong + Chicken Tangsuyuk set, Stir-Fried Jajangmyeon on a stone grill, and the Chicken Wings combo set.

The Jjamppong had a good wok hei flavor and was quite refreshing, with a generous portion. The Tangsuyuk was also decent. The Stir-Fried Jajangmyeon had a large portion, but the taste was on the sweeter side for me. The Chicken Wings combo set was okay.

Overall, it was a good experience. I‚Äôll definitely come back to try other dishes and have the Jjamppong again. If you're looking for Korean food or want to try something new, this place is worth a visit!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106504944827649057178/reviews
Hao Tan,5,"Visited on weekday lunch. Restaurant was quiet with 3 tables of diners. The menu was clear and indicates their signature dishes. Having saw the other table serving size, we beware and order with caution.  The serving were hugh. Lucky for us, we could finish our food  the homemake noodle was good. The soups were savory yet not salty.  Prices were also reasonable.  The restaurant atmosphere was good. We enjoyed our lunch.

A A,5,"Nice. Great food‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è. Jajangmyun was very tasty, so as the beef fried rice.. so yummy. Chicken cutlet was also nice. Strawberry matcha was not up to my liking but i bet its great for those who love both strawberry and green tea combined togetherü§£. They gave you free kimchi and plain water, i guess. All the mentioned dishes cost me around rm123.00. Big portion, can be eaten by two people. I have to tapau some more.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110491813313384256476/reviews
Larktiss,4,"Lunch at Wok & Work was fantastic. The Set JaJang with JamBbong and fried chicken fillet (RM83) was super delicious, offering rich, satisfying flavors. The beef fried rice (RM27) was also impressive, full of savory depth.  The fact that it‚Äôs a no pork, no lard restaurant doesn‚Äôt compromise the taste‚Äîeverything was top-notch.
