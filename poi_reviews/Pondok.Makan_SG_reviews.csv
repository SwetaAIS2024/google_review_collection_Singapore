Hartono Harjono,5,"Located along Arab Street, opposite Golden Landmark. Delightful Laksa Ikan Kembong with a rich and solid soup at this spot. Pair it with the flavorful Otah Otah and a satisfying Teh Tarikâ€”all at an attractive price. Don't miss their delectable curry puffs and fried bananas! Highly recommended, but limited seating, so consider a takeaway for a treat on the go.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102944719141464210600/reviews
BHART LALVANI,5,Curry puffs and their other snacks are made fresh and eating them while its hot makes a huge difference. Price is very reasonable and they justify by the size of their snacks. Staffs are prompt and courteous with their service. I have bumped into Mediacorp celebrity who was patronizing this store. He did mention the laksa is a delicious dish.
