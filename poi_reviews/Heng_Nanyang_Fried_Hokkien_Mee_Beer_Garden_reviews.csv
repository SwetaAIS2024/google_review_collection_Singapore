Alvin Quah,5,"Situated right next to the Alexandra Village Food Center, separated by only a small carpark, Heng Nanyang is an unassuming coffeeshop that is easily overlooked.

Only after chatting with the staff did I find out that they've been here for about a year(since 2023).

What makes matters worse is that there used to be a really famous Fried Hokkien Mee, my favourite in central west, at the other coffeeshop near the main car park entrance (they have unfortunately permanently closed).

Today I've come to try out their Fried Hokkien Mee to see if they can be crowned the new King of the central west.

First impression of the dish is that the broth looks really  thick, but the prawns look small.

The chilli is spicy and slightly sour, it goes very well with the noodles.

The noodles had a little bit of gravy, I'd say it is between wet and dry type. Personally, I prefer the dry type but this amount of gravy is acceptable to me.

The broth tastes really flavorful, filled with the richness from prawn and pork, with a tinge of wok hei, which is what I was looking for.

They use yellow noodles and thin bee hoon, which again, is to my liking (some people prefer the thick ones).

As mentioned the prawns are a little smaller than what I like but there were four inside the small portion.

The pork lard was soaked with the broth, some people might prefer theirs crunchy. Personally I avoid them ðŸ˜‚

They were also 4 slices of squid in the dish, which is not bad.

What's missing is sliced pork belly. Which, sadly,  more and more hawkers are leaving out now.

Overall I love the taste profile of their dish and to be able to find it early in the morning makes it even more valuable.

Technically, this a 4/5 Fred Hokkien Mee and with the dish becoming a rarity, especially in the morning, considering it costs only $5, I think it's fitting to be the new King in the central west (for now).

They are open from 6am-8pm for food, Breakfast starts 530pm and coffeeshop closes at about 10pm.

I will be back to try their prawn noodles and laksa!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117766417318468985509/reviews
