Mabbel Elroy,4,"This is a halal Korean restaurant, we appreciate that there is kids menu, making it easier for parents to consider this as a dining in option.

Some dishes were alright, some not so good. Service was good, restaurant and tablewares were clean as well. The soy garlic chicken (not captured) impressed us though, how well done it is.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102879096020874056848/reviews

Claudia xuan,5,"Came on Christmas day and was served by welcoming and friendly staff. Restaurant was not super crowded which makes it a great place to dine and catch up with friends (suitable for big groups, and baby chair available)!

Most of the foods we ordered were good except the portion of Rice cake , portion a bit too small to our liking . Hope they can improve on that . A plus point,  No GST and Service charge . Highly recommended !",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106562069610360478877/reviews
