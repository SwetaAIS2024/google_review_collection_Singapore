Outdoor activities with blasting speakers of karaoke / getai, auctions, chanting and gongs banging (sometimes, at the same time) from evening till after 10.30pm!! Loud shouts of \"Yum Seng\" & \"Huat Ah\" make us wonder if it is also a night-club ... serving alcohol?\n\nHope the temple leaders will be more\nconsiderate and let the residents live in a peaceful, respectful environment. We have been tolerant but find it very difficult to keep suffering in silence.",

It has a comprehensive temporary set-up (behind) the original temple built-up. I suppose its meant for praying Tai Sui and Hu Yeah season only. Anyway there is quite a following of people there praying Hu Yeh (White Tiger) against misfortunes etc.",
