      "text": "Excellent eating place for duck. The dishes are surprisingly affordable, simple and tasty however the process that goes behind it is incredible, tedious and hard work. I like how crispy the duck's skin is with its meat still very tender. Nice texture especially it's a duck dish. Highly recommend! I definitely will bring my family, friends and relatives here. Only draw back is the restaurant's space is quite small. They need to plan to expand soon :)",

The roast duck is out of this world!!\nI’m a roast duck fan and I can guarantee you this is one of the best u can put inside your mouth. The skin is crispy, the duck meat is not gamey, and the fat/meat ratio is just right.\nI highly recommend this place!",

The sour plum condiment goes well with the duck so was the chilli. Noodle was slightly salty. The ventilation needs some improvement as the place was smoky and warm.",
