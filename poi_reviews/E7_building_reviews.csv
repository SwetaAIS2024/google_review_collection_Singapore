Alex Tan (sup dot sg),5,"NUS E7 is quite the standout on campus! üåü Its modern design is seriously eye-catching, and once you step inside, you're greeted with a tech-savvy learning environment. The classrooms are decked out with the latest gear, making studying here a breeze. Those big windows are a nice touch, letting in lots of natural light and giving the place a welcoming vibe.

But here's what's really cool: E7 is all about sustainability. It's eco-friendly and energy-efficient, which is awesome for our planet. And don't get me started on that rooftop garden ‚Äì it's like a hidden gem in the middle of the campus!

Being right in the heart of NUS means you're close to everything, making it easy to meet up with friends and collaborate on projects. All in all, NUS E7 is a top-notch hub for learning and innovation. üè´üåø",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114029170025753307595/reviews
