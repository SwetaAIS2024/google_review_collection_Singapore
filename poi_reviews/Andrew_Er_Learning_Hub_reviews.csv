Zhi Wen Ho,5,"The receptionist is very friendly and kind and helps you with anything. They even let the kids play with toys or read books when waiting for classes to start.

I went from 75/100 to 95/100. The classes are very helpful and brought me from AL4 to AL1.

One teacher i would like to thank is Mrs Mok. Her style is teaching is the reason why I am getting AL1.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113104640492773006832/reviews
