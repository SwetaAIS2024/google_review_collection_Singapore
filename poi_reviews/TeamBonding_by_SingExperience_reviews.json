We booked the gardens by the bay activity and participated in the evening. Post videos and photos are hilarious.  Definitely will recommend it to a bigger group!",

It brought colleagues from all over the world together, helping us quickly bond and develop strategies to work better as a team. Bertrand was incredibly flexible — we had originally planned an outdoor activity, but due to unexpected weather, he adapted quickly and seamlessly. I highly recommend the team for any team-building activities you’re considering!",

Thank you Bertrand and Vince for guiding us ☺️\n\nWe had to change our event dates multiple times but SingExperience was still very kind and accommodating to us. Many thanks to Lovely, who was prompt in her replies and coordination with us ☺️\n\nHighly recommended!",
