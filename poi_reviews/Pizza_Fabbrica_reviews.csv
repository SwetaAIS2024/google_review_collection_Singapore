Matthias Thul,4,Came here for the pizza. It was decent but just a little bit undercooked. The bottom and crust were just a tad too doughy still and I personally would prefer even a little charring on the crust. The guacamole ordered from their sister restaurant across the road was good and made at the table. It lacked a bit of seasoning though.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106748204209708745982/reviews
Jojo,4,"We had family dinner at this cozy setting restaurant during weekend. We were delighted by the food served with passion. Had two wood fired pizza,  one was Sausage & Kale,  another was Chorizo with cheese. One was tomato sauce based ,while the other was white sauce based with mustard chutney. To each their own, both were equally good. Another highlight was the Ravioli with mushroom filling though we thought pizza were their speciality. Creamy sauce packed with umami flavour ,thanks to the added Burrata cheese. As for the Seafood risotto,  the stewed rice was flavourful enough but not too overwhelmed. We really enjoyed its generous seafood varieties with rice cooked al dente. Overall it was pleasant dining experience for our first visit at the restaurant. Anyone who prefer quiet atmosphere may sit further inside the restaurant as other restaurants nearby play loud music during night time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107649346650979258474/reviews
Jerome Tan,4,"Great location in haji lane and Pizza looks fantastic and taste good and with lotsa ingredients. The only problem is that the middle part of the pizza become soggy very fast due to the thick sauce.

Gnocchi is chewy and the sauce is superb.

Staff are attentive and drinks are reasonably priced.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117996872878240417241/reviews

Located along Haji Lane, the cozy little restaurant serves a plethora of pizzas and pastas. Thereâ€™s the usual Haji Lane drinks fare and cocktails too.

Weâ€™re very broke college students so we opted for the cheaper options: Pizza Margherita ($25), Carbonara ($22) and two cocktails, Mojito ($16) and a Strawberry Daiquiri ($16(?)).

The food was relatively good. Pizza had a generous offering of cheesy mozzarella, but the basil serving was kinda. Tragic. Pizza could also be a little crisper, the sauce had it a bit soggy by the second slice. Carbonara was hella interesting, the sheer generosity with the parmesan cheese was surprising, but also a little overpowering. With the price tag though, I ainâ€™t complaining.

The drinks are quite a highlight. Mojito was lovely, though the alcohol content between drinks seem to vary quite a bit. Mine tasted very much like juice, but my friend had a LOT of alcohol. Strawberry daiquiri was sweet and strong and a nice treat.

Overall, great service and friendly staff, food was nice.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111418563977977305187/reviews
