Already staffs were turning customers away or advising them to do it online.\n\nA hapless young man was trying very hard to assist a bewildered couple and an elderly lady with the DBS app.\n\nAmazing. He was most patient while giving valuable advice and taking new customers through the process.  P\n\nWe got our new account set up in no time despite our initial apprehensions.\n\nJust one man? Guess the good old days are gone when tellers are the face of retail banking.",
