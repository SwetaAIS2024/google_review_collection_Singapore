Lee Leng Lau,1,"Security shouted at me to ""get the hell out of the condo"" and ""get lost"" when I waited in the car along the double yellow line to pick my daughter up from her enrichment. There were no available visitor lots and I was not blocking the way. He could have suggested an alternative politely but kept shouting at me to get out of the condo immediately even though my young daughter was already on the way to the car. Very very unprofessional and rude.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111037977155712929903/reviews
