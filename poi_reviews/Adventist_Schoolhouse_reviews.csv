Peh Soon Lee,3,My girl joined Adventist Schoolhouse only for her K2. The teachers are great and made her adapt fast and smooth. The activities are also fun as she is always full of sharing with us after her school everyday. She often want to know more and request us to find more related information which was gone through in school and watch from YouTube. A great school with many activities which I will recommend to parents. Tks Adventist Schoolhouse.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112420880009567717730/reviews
