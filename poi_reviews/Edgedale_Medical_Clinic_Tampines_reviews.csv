Shikin Salehan,5,"Convenient location, great doctor and support staff. My go-to clinic. About 13 weeks ago, I had a stroke scare. I went to the clinic on a Monday morning and was concerned that I might have Bell's Palsy. The lady hijabi clinic doctor activated the paramedics, just in case I had a stroke. Everything went like a blur and I am truly sorry that I couldn't get all your names. She didn't want to take chances as I had facial droop and weakness on my left side. Was also starting to run a high fever from flu and only after the MRI results came out, could they eliminate stroke and confirm that I had Bell's Palsy. From the bottom of my heart, thank you to the dedicated healthcare team from Edgedale Medical Clinic (Tampines), SCDF and CGH. Your love, kindness and medical expertise have given me an easier recovery.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114441094602634842340/reviews
Lee Yamashita,5,"Extremely friendly clinic assistants, especially Irin(sorry if spelt wrongly) who attended to me today. The doctors here are also genuinely concerned for their patients' wellbeing.

Jocelyn Cheng,1,"background story: i made an *appointment* on 21/02 at 6:45pm for my influenza vaccine. i finish registering at 6:35pm & i only went in to see the doctor at 7:50pm (after i voiced out my unhappiness to the nurses).

dear edgedale medical clinic (tampines), if i have made an appointment at 6:45pm, i don’t understand why do i need to wait for more than 1 hour like other normal patients? does this make any sense? it clearly defeats the purpose of making an appointment right? if today i’m a walk in patient seeking to take my vaccine, i can fully understand i need to wait.

please seriously improve on the SOP & understand the differentiate of appointment and walk in.

further, i’m being charged $54.50 for the vaccine. honestly, idk why but my friends who have gotten the vaccine at other clinics are paying $30+.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110794366746305711814/reviews
