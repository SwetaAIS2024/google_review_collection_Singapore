Anitha Kamath,5,"The Community Garden at the Waterside  brings together the varied  loves and interests of its residents.  A biodiverse oasis in a little corner on the estate where we reminisce our growing up years among family tending to plants, building trellises with care, mulching and fertilising, pruning and harvesting,  sharing our love for nature and growing. I love the composting corner which quietly works on its task, while overlooking the garden. This is a beautiful work in progress!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111296631267251944088/reviews
