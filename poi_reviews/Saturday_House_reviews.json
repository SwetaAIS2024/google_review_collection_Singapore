All dishes that I tried were delicious, steak I ordered was done the way it was requested. It has a warm and casual welcoming atmosphere.",

I have posted a picture of the bacon mushroom bombs here.",

But the salt and pepper calamari that it claims, I didn't taste much of it, but more of spice powder rather than salt and pepper and the overly battered.\n\nService wise - as expected, they are attentive and quick to react.\n\nAtmosphere wise - would be perfect if I knew that the live band only perform on wed and fri.\n\nOverall, would visit again for the ambience and warmlyness. But would be on a live band performance day.",
