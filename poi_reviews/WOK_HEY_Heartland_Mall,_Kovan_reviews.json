I preferred to order from Hougang Mall, but unfortunately, it closed down.\n\nToday, again, I ordered from this store. And again, staff was busy but not cooking.\n\nTook some time for my food to be prepared. Should have ordered from Stuff'd.\n\nAfter I posted this feedback, I read other reviews. They are quite similar, very slow service. There were responses, even. Seems like \"value your feedback\" is just a template term. No improvement has been done.",
