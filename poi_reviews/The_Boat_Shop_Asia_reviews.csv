Melissa Mak,5,"Would highly recommend Cpt Noah Hardy! He was my practical lesson instructor and PPCDL refresher instructor both of which were great. His teaches clearly, patiently and is also very friendly.

Went for a one hour refresher course before my PPCDL practical exam, (I would recommend the two hour refresher but I could only make time for one hour) and passed my practical test right after!

Although administration by Jamie could be improved. I was given confirmation for a slot previously but it turns out she had given my slot to someone else who also received a confirmation. I was forced to give up my slot. While I was given a refund for the refresher, I did waste time and money travelling down. I would advice all to email to ask for a second confirmation closer to the date to confirm your slot again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108023296346491178892/reviews
harry boot,5,Great session with Jeremy and Patrick last Sunday. Ive got my own boat and grew up in singapore as a kid on Pulau Bukom so fair to say I know the waters fairly well but learnt a lot of new things from them. Their sessions are the practical side of boating that everybody should do before heading out. Great day and I highly recommend it.

George,4,"Good place to get more practical hands on after getting ppcdl through their competency course.

Gives you more confidence in boat handling and tips on how to actually sail a powerboat in Singapore waters.

Recommend to anyone who have gone for ppcdl and wish to advance their skill.

The only con was trying to teach too many things in a short time.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106117383369677558635/reviews
John Nelson,5,Very well put together course and presentation delivered by the instructor in a concise and very helpful manner. Even long term boaters will pick up valuable tips on navigating in Singapore waters and a great refresher for those out of touch with the boating scene. Highly recommended.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115620938792983589555/reviews
Michael Phua (RainGhost),5,"Had taken a Southern Islands Tour with Patrick and Jeremy. It was an enjoyable and informative trip. Both Jeremy and Patrick were friendly and always willing to share knowledge about islands, markers, danger areas, fishing spots, diving spots, etc.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108999544456436116164/reviews
