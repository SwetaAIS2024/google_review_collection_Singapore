      "text": "Had this yesterday . Waffle taste good . Feeling the scoop of ice creams are to huge. Nothing special on the ingredients used for the ice cream . Taste more like commercial ingredients used instead of natural ingredients. Sweetness may be from gums or addictive sugar.  Overall , the work flow of the three staffs are not smooth and efficient. They can do better here as each table has to wait around 20 min to be served their orders.",
