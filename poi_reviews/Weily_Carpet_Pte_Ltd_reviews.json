      "text": "I engaged Mr Lim and his team to fit my masterbedroom with vinyl boards in early 2021. I was happy with the quality of work. It was easy for me to communicate with them and they were on task - there was no delay. In 2023, I had a water leakage issue. Water leaked from the bathroom and seeped beneath the vinyl boards. I asked Mr Lim to help and his team helped to mitigate the problem while I try solve the leakage issue. Once solved, they refitted the boards for me. The leakage recurred in late 2024 and again, they helped even though it was just a small project. They provided a temporary solution until the HIP works solved the leakage issue permanently. The entire room was finally refitted yesterday. As usual, a job well done. How is that for customer-centered service? I would give them 5 stars and more if I could! The photos attached show the mitigation work they did for me in 2021 and 2024.",

Their carpet rate is affordable and most important they are honest with their price with no hidden cost.\n\nUnlike other we spoken too with extra cost at very last minute and we decide to cancel another contractor and engaged Mr Tan for their carpet service.\n\nWill recommend other for their honest service and affordable price",
