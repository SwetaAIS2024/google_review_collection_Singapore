PL,5,"Ordered the Mookata delivery set from Bangkok Street Mookata and was really impressed! The meat was fresh, well-marinated, and packed with flavor. The chilli sauce was absolutely amazing â€” spicy, tangy, and addictive. Delivery was prompt and everything arrived neatly packed. Great experience overall, will definitely order again!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109592877847683314617/reviews

John Leow,5,"4.6 for Al fresco Mookata. Came with 3 other guys on a Tuesday 7.30pm, very packed. But managed to find a table after 3 minutes of standing.

Ordered a good tonne of ala carte meat and vegetables. They have two types of chilli, one sweet and the other spicy. The spicy one goes really well with the BBQ meat and a spoonful of rice. Recommend the marinated pork, pork belly, marinated chicken and garlic chicken. Golden mushroom is a must have, fry till golden brown and it'll be juicy having soaked up the pork lard.

Spent about $50 for 4 pax. All full and satisfied. This is my 5th or 6th time here. The taste never disappoints. Just take note to avoid the peak periods. Parking behind the coffee shop is always full but you can always park at nearby HDB just opposite the coffeeshop across the road. Short walk 3min.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116641880786684356476/reviews
