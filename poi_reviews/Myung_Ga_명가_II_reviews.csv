seafood pancake [ pic 2 ; 10/10üî•] ‚Äî the best seafood pancake i‚Äôve ever tasted in my life. so well fried and delicious! my whole fam agreed that it was the best dish

soy garlic chicken [ pic 3 ; 10/10üî•] ‚Äî SO crunchy, juicy and so generous with the delicious sauce!! another big big thumbs up from my whole fam and i üëçüèª

pork gimbap ‚Äî this is probably just personal preference but this wasn‚Äôt a dish that stood out to me. it is still a really good gimbap! it wasn‚Äôt dry, which is usually how i feel when i eat gimbap.

cheese ramyeon ‚Äî would pass on this next time, it was outshined by the other dishes",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104198052626816980862/reviews
Angelin,5,"BEST KOREAN RESTAURANT IN SINGAPORE!

I come here frequently, and everything, from the taste to the service, is consistently amazing. If you‚Äôre looking for authentic, high-quality Korean food, this is the place to go. Here are the top dishes you must try:
‚Ä¢	Yukgaejang: Hands down the best stew you‚Äôll ever have. The broth is rich and flavorful, and they‚Äôre so generous with the beef.
‚Ä¢	Soy Garlic Fried Chicken: No other Korean fried chicken in Singapore can beat this
‚Ä¢	Samgyetang : Seasoned perfectly, so comforting and flavorful. Easily the best ginseng chicken soup I‚Äôve had in my life.
‚Ä¢	Tuna Mayo Kimbap / Spam Kimbap ‚Äì Simple but incredibly satisfying.
‚Ä¢	Tteokbokki ‚Äì Rice cakes were perfectly chewy
‚Ä¢	Donkatsu
‚Ä¢	Bossam
‚Ä¢	Seafood Pancake
‚Ä¢	Nakji Deopbap
‚Ä¢	Dwaeji Bulgogi

Note that they have a Tanjong Pagar branch as well!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105417076759937799330/reviews
Esther Tong,5,"Love the food very very much. The food here is damn good! Super authentic and so flavorful ‚Äî every bite was a treat. We ordered bibimbap, kimchi pancake and a few other dishes, and they even gave us extra compliments like more bibimbap and drinks! The service was amazing ‚Äî the waitress and the boss are both so pretty and sweet, really made us feel at home. Definitely coming back again. Highly recommend this place if you‚Äôre craving legit Korean food with warm vibes!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112386934451168857544/reviews
Sheila Ye,2,"Seafood pancake, the best dish of the night. It was crispy and packed full of seafood. However, it was seated on top of a pool of oil. The pork cutlet was overcooked, horribly dry, tough and the sauce tasted unusual. The gimbap was small and ordinary. Kind of disappointed cos they were featured in food competitor ZN's videos. Banchan was also meh - kimchi was not served cold. It needed an extra kick of spice and acid, kind of lacking in flavour in general.

The restaurant has tables inside and outside of the restaurant (the common area of the shopping mall, near the escalator). As the restaurant is poorly ventilated, the dining area would be smoky and warm, as hot air from the kitchen would be trapped inside. You can request to sit outside but be prepared to wait as most customers would choose to sit outside.

Overall, a disappointing experience.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113810719626443095814/reviews
