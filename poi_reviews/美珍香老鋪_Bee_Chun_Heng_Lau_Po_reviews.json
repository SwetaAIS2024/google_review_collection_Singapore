Both were sealed in auspicious golden foils & packed into lovely red flora with peacock boxes in old school printed paper bags.\n\nLove the handcrafted yummy goodness that‚Äôs lean, flavorful & nicely grilled without over-charring. Appreciate the impeccable, prompt & affable service by the 3rd generation boss, Sunny via WhatsApp order & on-site pickup.\n\nBrought back olden days memories of buying from neighborhood stores with their rollers metal gates where store owners & neighbors know one another by names. This is one of them. Sunny takes effort to ask & address customers by name & even sends thank you & well-wish message thereafter despite being occupied in backroom production.\n\nA shop that takes pride in its traditions, craftsmanship & treats their customers like family & friends just like olden days. Thank you, Sunny.",

And I was wrong.\n\nBee Chun Heng has remained true to its roots, a beacon of tradition and quality. It's a taste that evokes a sense of nostalgia, a connection to our past, and a reminder of the simple pleasures in life.\n\nSo, the next time you're craving a taste of home, or simply want to indulge in a truly delicious treat, reach for a piece of Bee Chun Heng.\n\nIt's a taste of nostalgia that will leave you wanting more.",

      "text": "If you patronise the row of shops along Frankel Avenue in evening for dinner, chances is that you may miss out this shop selling Bak Kwa. I thought it was just a sign of the famous Bak Kwa Bee Cheng Hiang. But no it‚Äôs not. It is Bee Chun Heng. According to the owner, they are relative of Bee Cheng Hiang. It is pre-CNY period and usually I avoid getting Bak Kwa during this period for obvious reasons. I happen to be at the area at about 2pm on Saturday and surprised to see the shop open. I am even more surprised that I could get Bak Kwa without queuing. I bought 500g each of sliced and minced Bak Kwa for $23 each. The sliced Bak Kwa is so tender and well grilled (see the pic). I have yet to try the minced one but according to them, it is even more tender. Totally unexpected and blown away by the Bak Kwa.",
