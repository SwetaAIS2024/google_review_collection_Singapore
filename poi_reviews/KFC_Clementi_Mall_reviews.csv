Johann Shane Tian,4,"The staff change regularly and can slightly differ in service. Typically, they are alright. Food wise, I feel that KFC tend to be ""stingy"" with their topping. For example the loaded fries do not seem to be generously layered with hot sauce. This outlet can be flooded with students in the afternoon.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102305159058266346114/reviews

Patota blue,4,"Food portion is smaller than expected, but they still taste great! KFC's original flavour is a taste of childhood.

However, temperature is regulated by a central system, so can be hot early in the morning. Besides that, all's good! Not crowded and fast service :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114140159586626273954/reviews
