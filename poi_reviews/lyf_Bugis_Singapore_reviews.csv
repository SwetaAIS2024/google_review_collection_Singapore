Kenneth Yeo,4,"Had a staycation here quite a long time ago and enjoyed my stay. Rooms were of course compact and small but had everything that one can ask for. I definitely prefer bigger rooms but was open to try this hotel just for fun and I still enjoyed the stay as the small area didn’t hinder nor annoy me in any way. Price was also affordable and for just a quick getaway, I have no complaints. Would I return in the near future… perhaps, if the price is good enough then why not",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111153740218915905371/reviews

Shashank Vasudevan,3,"This hotel felt more of a hostel than a 4-star hotel.  Our room was quite small without any storage space for clothes. The bathroom/toilet door was not designed to be locked; it was a just sliding glass that did not close fully either!! Perhaps, the room is better for solo travellers.
The breakfast was good, the staff/service was really good.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113107931952096883681/reviews

Chriz Lee,5,"The distance to Bencoolen MRT station is around 180m, quite close. The hotel provides drinking water with a water dispenser which is filled from tap water. The toilet does not have a bidet. The hotel room is quite comfortable because the atmosphere is not noisy. The room space is not too narrow but not big.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106003861360718256323/reviews
