Lots of choices mind you. Sales lady also showed me the features of the helmet and taught me how to wear the full face helmet the right way. Will be back to shop for more.",

Don’t hesitate to tell him how you feel about his behaviour! I did. He no longer fronts the shop nowadays; he’s at the back or in the office changing visors and/or getting the helmet inventory. The current guy who engages with customers is a nicer guy.\n\nHaving said that the prices are ok and the range is pretty decent. But an individual order will take “2-3 months”.",

More over from an official distributor.\n\nDude just hand me a set of internal padding, “they come like that”\n\nI think Arai takes pride in its product and pretty sure they don’t come without packaging.\nWell, it’s either from a separate helmet or something else I’m guessing.",

Was very happy with my purchase of VZ Ram and ended up buying 2 helmets. He is passionate about arai products & explained clearly about the ventilation system. Highly recommended I would rate\nChiap Lee 10/10. The best authorised dealers for Arai helmets in town.\n\nThank you sir.",
