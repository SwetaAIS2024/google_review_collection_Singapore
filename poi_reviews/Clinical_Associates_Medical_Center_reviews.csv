Random Stuff,1,"Bad service with all the receptionist service here.
I in a bad shape desperately need to see doctor due to high fever and cough. The timing not even during closed timing. I been early they even not open yet. They already given to one of the last patient to mantion they closed for registration.
We leave nearby ofcos we unwell we need to go nearest clinic is convenience for us during unwell conditions. Thn once I enter this clinic with this kind of bad service redemption I feel disappointed the way they talk unpolite with their patients.
They have to do something abt their service.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105772048804170433870/reviews
Patricia Lye,5,Dr Kan is my childhood doctor when he’s located in another part of CCK. Extremely caring who went beyond his call of duty. There was once I was cut by glass and was bleeding. I went down to his clinic and he was leaving but he went back in and treated my wound. He’s very popular and the queue is always long. Good to call beforehand.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105972675789309467939/reviews
James Chan,5,"Dr. Kan is meticulous, still has a good heart to heal his patients, compare to those some doctor which simply diagnosed you and send you away in 5min, however many disappointed by their number of patients per day.

everytime my visit is in the morning, reach there at 8am, you will get the queue i promise. However, you might only get to see the doctor somewhere around 11am-12pm, if you staying far I suggest not to come here.

i am saying sorry on behalf of those here had a bad experience.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116579199502096527694/reviews
Celine Nhy,1,"Their opening hours stated they are opened FROM 8.30am. Reached clinic at 8.25am, joined the queue and the receptionist passed the 'Closed for registration' card to the patient in front of me and walked off. It was my first time visiting this clinic and was confused by them and the process. Went into the clinic to clarify and was told off by them to read the sign card passed to the patient in front of me- which says 'Closed for registration'. She further commented that if I want to see the doctor, I should come and queue at 7am.

Utterly disappointed by their service. They could have said it nicely and be kind to patients.

To the management of the clinic, pls revise the operating hours mentioned in your clinic and in your website to prevent confusion which resulted to wasted trip from patients. Pls also do a perf review your staff service standards and attitude. Patients are there to see the doctor, not to be lectured. Do train and educate your receptionists to be kind to patients. While patients are always reminded to respect clinic staff, the staff should respect patients too- mutual respect pls!!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116640599328972164574/reviews
Yongle Zheng,1,"this clinic closed their registration at 1020am where there was barely any soul inside the clinic. Imagine you are feeling so sick and want a doc to assess your condition and when u reached there, the clinic told you to come back at 2pm. 1020 till lunch time is 2hours man. very bad experience with this clinic.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108170384418440630807/reviews
