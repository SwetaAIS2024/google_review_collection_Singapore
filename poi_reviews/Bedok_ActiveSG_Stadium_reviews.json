      "text": "One of the oldest stadium that had been around since i was in Primary School.\n\nThis was the place to go when we had sports meet, soccer matches or soccer gathering. Our memories of this place will remain till the end of our time ðŸ¥³ðŸ¤­\n\nLets dive in.\n\nLocation:\nNestled among hdb blocks, this stadium was actually part of a sports hub back then.  They actually had a swimming pool jz beside the stadium.. in the past, we actually had to travel from tampines/pasir ris up to bedok, just to learn how to swim ðŸ˜‚.\n\nCarpark:\nThe design of the place catered for lots of cars back then.. but with the generations growing and salaries increasing, more can afford cars now so, we would now say it has just adequate number.\n\nAmenities:\nThere are lots of eateries nearby. And we really mean it. Getting out of the carpark side, you have few coffeshops that had been there for years. Convenience stores are plenty as well. Similarly for the main road, once you cross over to Bedok South side, food is of abundance.\n\nSo ya, this is one of the most memorable places in our childhoodðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­. And the reason why this is at 4 stars, is bkoz of the maintenance and upkeep. We do feel it could have been improved abit more.\n\nSo ya, all in all, a great place to unwind and gather especially with a packet of coffee, watching sunset/sunrise here.. or join in the fun to walk/ jog.\n\nCheers!!",

Growing up Iâ€™ve always used the one in Tampines but ever since they removed it after building OTH, I was looking for an alternative. Wanted to try TPâ€™s track as Iâ€™m an alumni but figured bedok stadium is easier to access. Good track, I got here around 8am on a weekday before work started. A handful of young folks and some elderly doing their runs/walks. Overall a decent track. Will come back here for my sessions.",
