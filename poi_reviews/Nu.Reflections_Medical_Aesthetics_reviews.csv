Avy T,5,"I have been coming to Nu Reflection for a while now. Started seeing Dr Ivan Tan when I was in my early 20s because of my acne problem. He’s very professional and only recommend treatment or products that’s needed. My acne problem is under control now so I just come in for a facial once a month with April. She’s friendly, easy to talk to and doesn’t hard sell packages . Overall the place is clean and the staffs are friendly.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102299373230048247866/reviews

Xiao Qian,5,"I did eye fillers with Dr Ivan and couldn’t be happier with my decision. As someone new to fillers, Botox, and other invasive treatments, I really appreciated how much I learned from him. He will also recommend things I need to do and advise against what’s redundant to make sure I look as natural as possible. Dr. Ivan is incredibly experienced and uses the cannula method and minimal bruising (his hands are v steady and he’s also gentle). I think this is very important for people who have low pain tolerance or simply new to aesthetic treatments. I feel confident going out bare faced now, as my sunken eyes are no longer an issue.

I also did long-pulsed laser treatment for the blood vessels on my face, and the results were immediate. Highly recommend him for his expertise, professionalism, and integrity!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105851332215041679326/reviews
