Fed them at 7pm on the same night, my youngest boy started vomiting for more than 7 times and my elder boy started vomiting at 2am for more than 3 times. Both boys had diarrhea. Sent a complain to Pet Lovers Centre via whatsapp and facebook, the only response they gave was sorry. After what my boys went through its just one sorry? I'm seriously disappointed!!",
