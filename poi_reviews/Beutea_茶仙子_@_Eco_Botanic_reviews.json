Despite being short-staffed, they kept accepting more online orders and told us it would take 30 minutes just for fruits tea options ‚Äî we had to change our order. Other customers walked out immediately, and they made the right choice. Even basic drinks took forever (more than 30 minutes). If you can‚Äôt handle it, stop taking GrabFood and Foodpanda orders. Serve the customers who are physically there first. Ridiculous.",
