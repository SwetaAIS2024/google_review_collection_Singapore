HP Chng,1,"The information on this Google page is not correct. There is no table to sit. It’s completely closed and stuff by a disinterested employee who was not keen to receive any feedback about the misleading information here. This is a pre-order cake shop, which has lots of very delicious looking cakes. But the photographs in this Google Paige show table and seats and they aren’t any for the public..",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110104310981166368019/reviews
Benjamin Lim,5,"Its now a cloud kitchen, no more cafe.
We ordered a birthday cake with customization.  the service was good, they were responsive on WhatsApp and made the order and collection process easy. We will go back again for our next cake.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118386724725221632880/reviews
Audrey Lim,1,"It breaks my heart to leave this one star review as I really want to support the few vegan bakeries in Singapore, but the cake was really not it. The cake had a high buttercream to cake ratio, making each mouth full and overly creamy experience. The buttercream was immensely oily (liken to non-vegan ones you can find in neighbourhood bakeries) and extremely disappointing. For a lack of better word, the cake looked and tasted cheap.

At $80 for a just over hand-sized cake, I expected a luxury experience, but my entire family disliked it. I felt really bad as the only vegan in the family and giving them such an experience. So unless you want a vegan remake of those oily/cheap cakes from neighbourhood bakeries, would not recommend to most. Hope to support this vegan bakery again if the recipe changes!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104294451091642614343/reviews
Riles M.,5,"Love the cakes from 25grams. I have been ordering from this place for many years and have always had a good experience. I have tried both the vegan and non-vegan cakes and love them all! Highly recommend the vegan chocolate cake - the cake is moist and the ganache is rich. It is tasty and chocolate-y. Besides cakes, I also love their chinese new year cookies - the almond cookies have no almond essence (which I truly dislike), made of almond meal, with a textured melt-y-ness. Their vegan chocolate chip cookies and dark chocolate and sea salt cookies are also very good. I get them every year. They have a giant fortune cookie with baby fortune cookies in it as well! Love this bakery ❤️",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117522092354949378848/reviews
Jessica Lim,5,"Alex has been the point of contact since the start of our conversations, he has been very delightful and accommodative throughout the process of our arrangements. We had the wonderful baking team at 25Grams assisting us with food testing to cater to special dietaries, and we sincerely appreciate the efforts made. The baskets of fortune cookies were aesthetically pleasing and they taste the best I have ever had! Thanks Team!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105533501772494910325/reviews
