      "text": "The Chinatown MRT station itself is insanely crowded, messy, and incoherent in my personal opinion. It feels exactly like how Chinatown feels like.\n\nThe unfortunate fact is that I'd personally have preferred if they put more thoughts in how they'd do up the Blue Downtown line, vs the Purple North East line, and how everything connects a little better, like other train stations in Singapore would.\n\nThis feels a lot more like Hong Kong unfortunately.",
