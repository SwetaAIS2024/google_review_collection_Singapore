Darren Lim,5,"Would give 6stars if I could. Very impressed with everything!

Dr Poon is a very nice, down to earth, professional and brilliant lady doctor.

Thanks for giving my wife a sense of reassurance and the best advise.

Young Malay lady assistant is also super nice and helpful, thank you very much! (Sorry that I did not ask for your name)

Reasonably priced too, very happy with everything!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109171158288914632101/reviews
Suhana Shahril,5,"Have been seeing Dr Poon for almost a year and my young family and I are so glad to have found her! We have recommended Greenhealth to all our family members and they feel the same way. Dr Poon is patient and meticulous, we always leave the clinic feeling well-equipped and reassured. The clinic staff are also very efficient, we usually don‚Äôt have any long waiting times!

Overall good and clean clinic with great staff and service! So glad to have a reliable GP for my family.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102599205227241556698/reviews
Sharon Hu,5,The clinic is truly living up to all the good reviews. I‚Äôm really happy to have finally found a legit clinic that doesn‚Äôt overcharge. Dr. Poon was very patient in explaining my flu condition to me. This will be my go-to clinic from now on. I‚Äôve always been reluctant to visit a clinic these days because it‚Äôs rare to find a doctor who genuinely wants to help and cure you.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111587751283770531187/reviews

Ihsan,5,"Very new, clean and spacious clinic compared to the rest around the area and most probably in Tampines. Dr Poon is very gentle and polite. And so is the receptionist! Finally, I have a favourite stress-free clinic! I hope this clinic flourishes and sustains long.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113995617222955931198/reviews
