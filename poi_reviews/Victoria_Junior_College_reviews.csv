Ravindra Rampuria,4,A top rated junior college. Great location spacious and lush green campus. It is among top 6 JCs in Singapore. Very old institution. Heard some good feedback from ex/current students. Some mix/not so great feedbacks as well. I guess a lot depends on how the student and teacher rapport in the end. Like any place I am sure this also has its pluses and minuses. My best wishes to the college and its staff and students.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112472435130395088335/reviews

Tan,5,"Known as one of the top Junior college , Victoria JC have never failed to provide a conducive environment to study in . Attending VJC has been an incredible experience for me. Tutors here are truly exceptional. They are capable of providing top-notch education and support to all students regardless of their type of admission. The campus is equipped with modern facilities and resources , creating an optimal learning environment. I love that every single classroom is equipped with air-conditioners, it really helps us to study in a hot and humid Singapore. Plus, the wide range of extracurricular activities allows students to explore their interests and passions beyond the classroom. I highly recommend VJC to anyone looking for a nurturing and enriching junior college experience. Nil Sine Labore ðŸ’ª",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107153656428357298654/reviews
