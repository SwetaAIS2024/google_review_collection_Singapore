      "text": "I've tried this coffee before at their other locations, and it's really disappointing. However, this branch is pretty good. The taste is clean, with no off-flavors or bad aftertastes, leaving a pleasant remaining flavour.\n\nTheir fries is also good along with the dipping sauce.\n\nThe customer service is very remarkable. The guy with a moustache, sorry idk his name üôèüèª is very good. He patiently explains their specialty and recommendations which shows he has the passion about coffee.\n\nWe are now consider a regular here. Good job",

Tried their peanut butter latte and dirty latte.\n\nPeanut butter latte: buttercream on top. Sweetness just nice to my palate. However the peanut butter taste is so little. But the base latte is good.\n\nDirty latte : now this is ace.\n\nLaid back cafe atmosphere for coffee enthusiast to chill",
