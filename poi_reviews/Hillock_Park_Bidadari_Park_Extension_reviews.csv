Forest BK,5,"🐦Hillock Park is a little park linked by a beautifully landscaped land bridge over a road below to the Bidadari Park.
🦜The Hillock Park provided a green sanctuary for migratory birds, as well as for residents of Woodleigh Glen.
🐦‍⬛The Hillock Park green sanctuary was deliberately left without any footpath or lighting to preserve its natural habitat.
🐧It's a serene little Park for a relaxing stroll or walk the dog.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
