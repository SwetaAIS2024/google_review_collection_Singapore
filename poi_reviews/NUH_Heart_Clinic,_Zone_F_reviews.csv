Lian Seng,5,Had AF and PVC fixed by Dr Kevin Leong. Great doctor and great experience all round even though I was slightly apprehensive at first. Had 2 friends who spent like 30k going private and I spent like a tiny fraction of that after subsidies etc. But I had to wait 3 months since it wasnâ€™t life threatening or anything,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116157040908596904737/reviews
