C Gan,5,"My passport photo taken looked really good, and the final copies were done quickly! I got the online version almost immediately, and the printed one 20 minutes later. Mark was the one servicing me, and he was friendly, and made me feel comfortable while taking the photo. He took a few shots and we sat down to choose the best one together. I have tried ID booths (photo was so blurry!), and even went to a photo / print service that you see in most malls (the company name of which I won't mention) and none of them captured my face nicely for the passport photo. This place was the best, and cost less than the photo/ print service company. Totally recommend!!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103699630654870532747/reviews
ƒ∞layda Cy,5,"Highly recommended! My friend and I have both used this shop on separate occasions for passport-sized photos. Both times, the service was efficient, professional, and quick. Great experience overall!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102571430551913594447/reviews
Shelley Goh,5,"My husband recently went in to get his Australian passport photo taken. Due to the stringent requirements of the Australian passport office, his photo was rejected. We went back to the shop and they were very helpful in getting his photo edited and reprinted. I am very impressed and appreciative of their excellent customer service üëçüëè",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113096705309878841071/reviews
K Y,1,"Very expensive and worst of all VERY BAD customer service. NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN. If possible, NO STAR at all, Don't even deserve 1 star. The one at Bedok Central near NTUC Fairprice entrance is way BETTER.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106463856498245497647/reviews
Twinkles,2,"Absolutely won't come here unless it's emergency printing. Really expensive rates for printing + mid service (never felt so uncomfortable paying for a service lol, y'all need to mentally prepare yourself to face a grumpy uncle). It's $0.50 for 1 side and $0.30 for subsequent sides and these are only for black/white for those wondering.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100255066433684877511/reviews
