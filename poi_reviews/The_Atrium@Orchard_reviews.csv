viking T,4,"Looking for a reasonable dinner place? Try the CO Chun Vietnamese Restaurant. Located at B2, accessible to Plaza Singapura. Cozy small restaurant serving pretty authentic tastes Vietnamese food. Price on slight steep but definitely worth the try. 3 person plus tax $100. Can forget about the chicken salad. I must say the rest are pretty good.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117279516290197236406/reviews
