Sylvia Yit,5,"I had the most amazing experience at the Yoga SUP session at Lazarus Sea Sports Centre! The whole experience was so zen, and Trainer Lou’s calming voice made the session feel incredibly peaceful. She guided us through each movement with such ease that we completely forgot we were doing yoga on a SUP board! It was a truly unique and relaxing way to connect with nature. Honestly, I can't wait to go back again! Highly recommend this experience to anyone looking for a fun and mindful activity.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112905414125473250077/reviews
