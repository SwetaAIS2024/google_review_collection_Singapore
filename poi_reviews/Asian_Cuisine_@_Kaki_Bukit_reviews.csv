Eric Wong,5,"Visited on 29 Apr 2025 and ordered some prata and fish curry for dinner

Visited on 23 Dec 2022 to order mutton briyani for takeaways. The rice is fluffy and well cooked.. almost like fried rice with individual grains.. and the mutton curry is succulent and soft to the bite, with very deep indian smell and taste to the curry sauce. Worth all the $5.50 paid for it",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117691308830861443080/reviews
Flying Wong,4,"Cheap and nice crab promotion. $38.80 for 3 crab with any flavour really worth the price. But Asam fish taste not that fresh and some vege got bitter and sour taste like not that fresh. However, it is still worth going if promotion still valid.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102851978110870617404/reviews

eel,1,"Online but no response for whole day, after saying can order we placed order and pickup time. We already on the way to pickup since there was no response, after spam call for few times 6pm+ pickup call say crabs smelly not selling say order cancelled.

Order since 11am confirmed already, no responses no reply. Best part, WhatsApp was ONLINE ALL THE TIME. Absolutely disgusting service, no apologies aftermath and not remorseful through phone convo. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104614615903861753471/reviews
BK,4,"I usually go in to have indian food. Thosai and vadai...or some pratas..gravy nice..commonly produced tamil food with decent taste..yet to try their lunch spread.
The coffee is nice to have in the morning with this spread..coffeeshop's breakfast set is also good...clean sitting area but price is cheaper than many locations. They also sell Malay, Bangladeshi and Chinese cuisines too...I liked...recommend you to try.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102240985089016758836/reviews
