We ordered the steak for the main course. Ordered medium rare but one came more medium well than medium rare and as a result was quite tough and dry. The chocolate lava cake was nice, but did not look and taste handmade. Service was quite slow. For three courses, we took 1.5 hours. Staff was friendly. Overall it was an OK experience.",

Mushroom soup is tasty, rich in flavour and is thick and creamy, drizzle of truffle oil into soup as well. Truffle fries, Cali tandorri chicken pizza soso only, 5/10.\nThe crab meat pasta is bad, nothing special, taste like dry Chinese friedb noodles:(",
