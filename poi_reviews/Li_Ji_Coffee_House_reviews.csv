Artem Moshnin,4,"Very affordable good food here along with drinks. I got the chicken cheese baked rice which is served with only multigrain brown rice, no white rice. To my surprise it was not dry, it was quite tasty with the whole top covered in baked cheese and underneath, a creamy sauce on the large chunks of chicken. Very worth the price for $6-7! However, did not get the drinks because they were way more expensive than normal drink stores (ice milo here is $2.60 compared to $1.50 elsewhere). The place is nice to sit at, it’s indoors and has aircon. The staff was not very nice, she seemed very occupied, didn’t really care about the customer and was rude to me when I asked if the bake rice could be in white rice instead of multigrain. After payment she simply tossed the receipt at me.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114186673531048387843/reviews
Spencer Paw,3,"Their toast is superior to the nonsense at Toastbox and Caffe and Toast. My favourite would be the peanut butter and butter! The eggs are usually slightly underdone for my liking, though. The fried rice is pretty good too, with nice wok hey, I just wish brown rice was an option rather than the default.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106133221641148569526/reviews
JW Y,4,"Duck fried rice has the wok hei taste and is loaded with ingredients; slightly pricey but worth every penny.  For spicy food lovers, do ask them to give you sambal chill.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108511850293315854587/reviews
C. En,2,Toast sets start at $4.30 with additional $1.10 for iced drinks! Highest premium that I’ve come across in Singapore. Service staff are also extremely rude and unfriendly for a university campus.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110601930033542355777/reviews
Roger Tan,5,"The Chee Cheong Fun is freshly hand made (no pork, no lard). The fresh lettuce and prawn was rolled into thin steamed rice sheet and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds. The rice sheet was smooth, tender with natural rice sweetness. Additionally, it is eaten with a sweet sauce made with sweetened fermented bean sauce and a tangy spicy sauce made with chili laced with rice vinegar.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114718856388068742054/reviews
