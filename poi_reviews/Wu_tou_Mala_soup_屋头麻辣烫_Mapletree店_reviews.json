Staff mentioned there’s no customers so they usually close by 2pm+.\n\nOriginal:\nLegitimately the best dry mala I’ve ever had. They put peanut sauce, lots of garlic and some chilli padi and that combo with your ingredients brings out all the dimensions of flavour. Can’t stop thinking about it",

They just keep serving those in the queue, after 40mins then the lady went to see the foodpanda receipt orders, however she still did not prep our food but those in queue kept getting their food first. Waited for 1 hour and we have to cancel the order ourselves. Do not buy from this stall via self pickup. Horrible experience and this is the second time.",
