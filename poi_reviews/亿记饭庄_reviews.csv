JJ Jen,5,"Happened to find this good Cai Fan stall in West Coast. Serving was generous, price not the cheapest but reasonable. Dishes were well cooked and delicious.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108529671565113161419/reviews
Wilson Foo,5,"Been meaning to try this Mixed Vegetable Rice stall located in Chang Cheng Mee Wah Kopitiam along Clementi West St 2.

As with all Cai Png stalls I review, I look for good taste, affordable price and variety. Prefer to have rice and porridge. This one hits all the criteria. Not one with taste for very salty food, their Sichuan veg with mince pork was just right. The fried pork with ginger was also nice due to their choice of meat cut which resulted in a little more chew.

Recommended for a cheap and good meal!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114263857328212431619/reviews
