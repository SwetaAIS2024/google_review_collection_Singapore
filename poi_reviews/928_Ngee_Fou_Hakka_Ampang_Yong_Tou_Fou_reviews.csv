Bryan lim,5,"One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore! 🇸🇬❤️
Dropped by 928 Ngee Fou (Hakka) Ampang Yong Tou Fou for lunch on a Sunday with a good friend (a proud Hakka!) to enjoy some authentic Yong Tou Fu.

We ordered the signature Yong Tou Fu set and the special dumpling soup. Everything was freshly prepared, and I especially loved the combination of kangkong and tofu. The real hero? The rich, flavorful gravy – it ties everything together perfectly, soaking into the veggies and tofu to create a truly satisfying bite. 🥬🧄🥢

Atmosphere:
The restaurant gets hot and lively during lunch hours, packed with customers — a true sign of how popular and delicious the food is! 🔥🍽️

Parking:
Roadside (paid) parking available nearby. It can get busy during peak times, so do plan ahead if you’re coming during lunch.

Overall:
Still one of my go-to places whenever I crave good, authentic Hakka Yong Tou Fu. Definitely staying on my must-visit list whenever I'm back! 🫶",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101339629740467913751/reviews
Paul Viray Prado,5,"Had the 928 Yong Tou Food - Ampang

Per pax with rice is around $8.

Highly recommended, quite an healthy option but lots of birds around. Either way, it was quite a good meal, would recommend.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114480577794587238806/reviews
Esther Loh,5,"I think the duck meat is very nice.
And the 酿豆腐 Kang kong especially nice!

Bee Choo Cheng,3,"One pax ytf set cost $6 and rice is $0.60. They have no noodle only rice only. Their fried and non fried tofu etc was not salty and taste not bad. You can inform the ingredients you don't like to eat and they will replace with other pieces. This store ytf is the dry style and the sauce goes well with rice. Overall, a fulfilling meal.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107028407430947755113/reviews
Super Fragrance,3,"Ordered ytf for 3. 2 rice. Cost $19.20. i would assume is $6 x 3 + 60¢ x 2.

It was okay average in some way on the cheaper side. What you need to note is the items are fixed and they have no noodle only rice.

Chili is nothing special and oh yeah there is no soup. Ingredient wise the only unique piece was the mildly fried quail eggs which doesn't taste particularly special.

Their fried and non fried tofu etc was just average. The fried dumpling might slightly be on the saltier side but it was still okay.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105892392413528737906/reviews
