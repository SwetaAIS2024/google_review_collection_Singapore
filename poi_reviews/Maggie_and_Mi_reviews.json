The Mash Potatoes and Kani Salad definitely can compare with upscale restaurants.\n\nFriendly staff with good food! Will definitely come back again!!",

      "text": "We ordered the signature chicken chop, wagyu beef and fish cutlet. The maggie + meat combo work better than I thought. The noodle is not too salty and goes well with the soft boiled egg. The meat are of good quality esp. wagyu is juicy. Overall, it's a nice experience, nostalgic maggie mee and eye opening one for young senior like me, ha!\n\nThe price is reasonable w/o gst and svc charge. Its value for money.",

Mushroom soup can be improved though, a little grainy. Chicken üêî was well cooked and their coleslaw was yummy! Unique and finely chopped. Will support again üòã",
