Lionel Tan,4,"Quite empty on a Saturday afternoon. The sausage plate was good and came with sauerkraut. There is one for one beer order. Service was good, except the waiter was smoking just before he poured our glasses of water and the glasses had the smoke smell. Suggest that hands be washed before serving.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105174264645946437106/reviews
JATHL,5,"Best pork schnitzel I‚Äôve had in Singapore! Sausages were cooked perfectly and the gravy and mashed potatoes were delicious. The white asparagus was an absolute delight!
Enjoyed their seasonal beer (can‚Äôt remember the name) and their berry bliss gin cocktail.
Service was great! The lady who took our order was a consummate professional!
Great setting, with 3 floors. The first one being a bustling pub and the upper two a little more formal-dining style.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110357299060106350854/reviews

Jin L,5,"It was delicious. I went there because a friend of mine recommended it to me. What impressed me the most was how friendly and nice the staff were. Everyone smiled and made me feel comfortable and relaxed while eating. DavidüëçüèªüëçüèªIt was a really nice place.  The portion is generous. The seasoning is just right. It's not too salty, which is nice. I didn't know that the salad came with dressing. If you don't want it, ask for it when you order. The vegetables were really fresh. My child said that the vegetables were crunchy and fresh and that they went well with sausages and meat. I was so sad that I couldn‚Äòt try a variety of dishes because I was pressed for time. Next time, I want to go and try beer too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111989888697449964494/reviews
Lee Cargill,5,"The asparagus 25 was simply incredible! Proper German vibes and excellent cooked.

The maibock was very good and very fresh being the start of the season for it. The service was incredible and Sarah is a legend. Constantly brilliant poured beer with a smile. One of the best servers in the city

Highly recommend",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102185669501575921925/reviews
