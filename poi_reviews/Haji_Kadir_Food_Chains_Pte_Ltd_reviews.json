Totally unacceptable, maybe there was miscommunication among the cooks but please pay more attention to customer's extra details/requests on their food. The food are Maggi Goreng Thai & Maggi Goreng Seafood. Hope this will improve on my next visit.",

      "text": "I ordered Maggi Goreng Merah Beef from Haji Kadir at Tampines Polyview through Grab, but ended up receiving what looked and tasted like Maggi Goreng Tom Yum Seafood instead. Luckily, I’m not allergic to seafood, but this mistake could have been serious if I were. It’s really important for a restaurant to get orders right, especially when it comes to food allergies. A little more attention could prevent dangerous situations. I’m really disappointed with this experience and hope they take more care in the future.",
