Doreen Jill Mistica,5,"My sister and I had a lovely stay at Nostalgia Hotel! The staffs are very accommodating. The room was clean and fully equipped with everything needed for a short vacation. One of the best features is probably its prime location, just a stone's throw away from Tiong Bahru Market which quickly became our favorite spot for this trip :) Transportation is similarly a breeze with its nearby bus stops and train station. We'd love to be back should we find ourselves visiting Singapore again :)",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111393582467977836475/reviews
Thang Le,5,"I had an amazing stay at Nostalgia Hotel in Tiong Bahru! The location is perfect—just a short walk to fantastic cafes, hawker centers, and public transport, making it easy to explore Singapore. The staff was incredibly warm and welcoming, always going the extra mile to ensure a comfortable stay.

The hotel's classic and elegant vibe added a unique charm, blending heritage with modern comforts. The rooms were cozy, clean, and well-equipped. A wonderful bonus was the free coffee machine, which made excellent espresso, lattes, and hot chocolate—perfect for a quick pick-me-up any time of the day.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for a boutique hotel with excellent hospitality, convenience, and thoughtful amenities!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103065643153615957031/reviews
Geof Givens,5,"The best thing about the Nostalgia hotel is its location in a beautiful central district across the street from a popular hawker center (restaurant/food court), and nearby other great restaurants and stores. The hotel itself is clean and nice, perhaps a little pricey although I am not too familiar with Singapore standards. The room was quite small, but tidy and wholly adequate. Service was helpful and polite. Solid recommendation, altogether.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108988560290172726585/reviews

Mandy Glass,5,"Lovely hotel in an excellent location, away from the central city but close enough for easy transport links. Staff were very helpful and everything was spotlessly clean. Tiong Bahru bakery nearby is a must try!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108112103458172194447/reviews
