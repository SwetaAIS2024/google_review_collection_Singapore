Shiela Kim,3,"Pros: service was not bad, really authentic Indian food.

Cons: the food was salty especially their mee goreng. My husband couldn't eat it. The mutton should be cooked well, though the biryani was good, would be great if it was a bit more soft.

The atmosphere was okay but I hope they will do renovation and make it cleaner. The vibe was a bit dirty, we were only realised it when we already made an order.

I think the price was reasonable.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103187116620220847179/reviews

Adrian,5,"A prata shop located in jalan kayu. Abit far from the carpark. They serve good crispy and hot prata.  I found many shops in Singapore prepare a lot of prata to wait for customers to buy, but mostly it is cold. Their tea also good. Do try if you at jalan kayu. Not the shop beside the carpark. The prate beside carpark is bad in service and very hard prata. So please go to the correct shop to avoid disappointment.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106871878422533362800/reviews
Henry Cheng,4,"The pratas here are definitely better than the ones on the opposite side in Jalan Kayu. The pratas were crispy and had the right fluffiness to it. The curry sauce that came with it is very fragrant, you will be savoring every last drop of it. The same can‚Äôt be said about the mee goreng and maggie goreng pattaya. I felt it was missing some seasoning and the overall dish wasn‚Äôt well executed. It has more of a sweet than savoury flavour with all the ketchup on the egg.

In conclusion, I will be back for the pratas, not necessary the other dishes.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108151994390288524704/reviews
Winston Ng,5,"Ordered their Set A which comes with Fresh crispy plain and egg pratas, and wonderful curry chicken which helps work out a sweat. Food quality has definitely improved from my last visit years ago. Service staff is polite and generous with the curry. üëçüëç",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101891448705410336999/reviews
