BK C,5,"Hands down best fish soup you can get in Singapore imho.
Forget Hankee or whatever, you order the biggest bowl of slice fish soup + rice = $8.5 + $0.6, totalling $9.10

Gives you THICK and FRESH fish slices, superb soup base (soup so good, it needs no extra bs like fried onion, ginger, bittergourd to enhance the flavor).

Legit, i’m seriously thinking of asking the uncle to accept me as apprentice, if not.
Once he retire, i eat what sia?

Note: must dine in la, takeaway will overcook the fish and become gross.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108911259687304207428/reviews

Teck Chong Law,4,"One of the best fish soups that I have eaten.

Generous thick slices of fish.  Soup has that fresh fish sweet taste.

Previously there was always a very long queue, but now the queue is short.  No complaints as I am happy that I need not queue for 30+ minutes.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103886416957126587915/reviews
Genesis NΞO,4,"Delicious and very fresh sliced fish soup with a generous portion of fish slices and rich umami flavoured clear soup. Each bowl starts at an affordable price from $5.50 to the largest bowl at $8.50.

They also have red grouper options which are slightly pricier.

Overall a great bowl of sliced fish soup.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102854124263961361309/reviews
