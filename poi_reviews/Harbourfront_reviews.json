This place is alive and kicking.\n\nJust a tip: check yourselves in only when the start of boarding time is closing. There is basically nothing beyond the immigration counters but a single drink stall and one small duty-free shop.",

      "text": "Lovely ferry terminal in Singapore.  Located just off Harbourfront MRT. The ferry terminal is well connected by public transport including mrt, public buses,  taxis and phv. The price of taxi or phv may vary based on surge and peak periods.\n\nThe ferry terminal has a duty free centre that allows you to buy spirits as you leave Singapore. The waiting area where you wait to board your ferry is very basic and not fantastic.\n\nStill the ferry terminal is complete with atms, money changers,  restrooms,  souvenir stores, coffee shops and few other stores that cater to travellers.\n\nThe ferry terminal largely connects you to locations in Indonesia including Batam and Bintan. The ferry  services are regular.",

We took the Horizon Fast Ferry to Batam, and the entire process was a very straightforward and streamlined one. Although there isn't anything exciting to do while waiting, but at least it's clean and safe, and the ferries are punctual.",

      "text": "My 70 yr old friend & I (60 yrs old) were checking in our luggage at Harbour Front ferry terminal on 6 Apr Sun around 11.45 am. We were so frustrated with a young lady staff who handled our luggage check in. She told us that our luggage check in weight could not be combined (even when we booked our ferry tickets together online). And before we could sort out our luggage weight, the young lady staff sent our 1st luggage in (via conveyor belt). She did not bother to give us time to add more weight to combine with the 1st luggage (it was 15 Kg, we could still in another 5 Kg).  And eventually, we had to hand carry unnecessary weight load.. She is not suitable to work in customer service because she was so impatient & did not consider the challenges of senio4 passengers lugging heavy stuff.",
