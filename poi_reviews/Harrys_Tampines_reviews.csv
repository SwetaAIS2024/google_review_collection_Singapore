Denise Lee,4,"Bar bites such as the satay, tomyum popcorn chicken were addictively delish, definitely recommended. Mains we tried included the seafood aglio olio, burger, chicken and fish & chips. Fish & chips were the most satisfying in terms of taste and portion for its price. The rest of the dishes were alright. Attentive staff and nice, quieter atmosphere away from the crowds.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100613858224644758681/reviews
