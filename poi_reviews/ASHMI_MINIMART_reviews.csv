Ladoo Dhaigharay,1,"Disorganized and rude service

The old balding man with moustache and his heavy, overweight son are both very rude.

Many items are left on the floor making it inconvenient to walk. Also this place is a Fire Hazard.

Please AVOID this store altogether.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112816912212041361220/reviews

Yang Hwee Tay,1,"If I can, I would have given zero star for this store!!! Like other reviewers, I should have checked on this store before selecting it as the pick up for the shopee parcel! It is terribly disorganised and what is so disgusting is that the store person (Owner?) rudely said there is only person manning the shop and he has a business to run and not to help shopee customers to find their parcel!! Then why is this shop offering the pick up service if they cannot handle it?",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102710756101916662771/reviews
leo joseph,3,"My review ONLY on the Shopee collection services.

Nothing organised, items kept on the ground, and I was asked to find my package from a pile of items.

I came out empty handed and called Shopee to cancel the item and to verify how this shop has been listed as a pickup location.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115949258947917247704/reviews
John Tan,1,I should have read the review first before using this place for shopee collection point. U have to search for your item among the heaps of parcels in the baskets. DO  NOT use this shop for your collection address.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107912775434129376573/reviews
