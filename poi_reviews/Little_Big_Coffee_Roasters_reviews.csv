CK C,3,"Coffee were great although they could be hotter. Reasonably priced too. Disappointed that bagels are no longer available. Only cakes, brownies and cookies are available now. Both lemon loaf and banana walnut were quite dry.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
Kenny Yap,5,"Finally got to check out this coffee spot. It’s only opened on weekdays which makes it hard to visit if you don’t work in the area.

Chose this over bras basah boys as it’s along the main road with natural light coming in. Ordered a regular white and was pleasantly surprised to see that places still sell it for not just below $5, but below $4 at $3.80.

They didn’t cut in terms of quality either. The interior is quite simply decorated. Nonetheless, a really good cup and a nice spot to pause before moving on with the day.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105256927610815725781/reviews
Seah Jia Hui,5,Ordered ice latte and I could taste the coffee and not just milk. Their coffee has the roasted espresso taste and fortunately not masked by the milk. Will recommend if you are constantly sleeping during work.,11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109933240025657790273/reviews
Alvin Lim,5,"Situated at one of the street corners of Biopolis.  Enjoy the relatively slow pace of life here away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of Singapore.

One of the few small coffee roasters in Singapore where you can buy their beans which are roasted on site, and also sample their delicious coffee.  They also serve delicious home baked cakes.

They bring in a good variety of coffee beans to bring home for your own home brew too.

This is an often overlooked place. Highly recommended to drop by!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103117270394505823550/reviews
Yin Yin Leong,5,"Quiet little nook for your on-the-go coffee or just to hang out. Very reasonable prices ($4.50 tea, $8 salmon/spinach/cream cheese wich, $10 eggs ben). Will be returning to try other food, and for me-time.

Back in their renovated space. Some seating upgrades, food still smashing, extremely affordable prices (bagel w spread $3.50, bagel w other goodies $6). All bakes done in-house!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106975810826375337528/reviews
