Sari Van Tendeloo,4,"Everyone raves about the Marina Bay Sands rooftop, but when youâ€™re up there, you miss out on seeing one of the most iconic parts of the skyline itself. This spot is perfect for watching the sun set over Marina Bay Sands and the rest of the cityscape. The vibe is enhanced by a nostalgic â€™90s hip-hop playlist, making it an ideal spot to bring friends for a relaxed yet lively evening.

Initially, the staff seemed a bit standoffishâ€”likely because we were touristsâ€”but once they realized we were there for more than just a quick photo and a drink, their attitude completely changed. They were attentive and fantastic for the rest of the evening.

Despite a bit of bad weather, the view was still breathtaking. The drinks were standout, especially their house martini with plum and the spicy margarita. And the food? Absolutely finger-licking good. Iâ€™ll definitely be back!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102615774636329622100/reviews

Fion Tay,1,"Nothing fantastic about the food or service. Small roof top area without much decorations or renovations. Super poor karaoke system with the songs always in downloading mode. Act as a  Karaoke pub but can't turn the volume up. It's so ironic that our raw voice sounds even louder than the microphone. Overall, don't recommend this place for the price we paid.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117040371127564384896/reviews
