      "text": "The instructor Ms Yang is very experienced. She can spot my daughter's weakness in techniques and add various and suitable practices to improve her skills. Only one year, my daughter has improved a lot not only in her playing techniques but also her stage performance. Ms Yang's teaching style is not didactic. For any piece of music my daughter is playing, Ms Yang  patiently discusses with the kid about the feel of the music and how to use various techniques to express the feeling.  In this way, my daughter understands the music better and deeper. Her violin studio is highly recommended.",
