JM V,5,"We recently visited Chanko Oden in Bugis Street and tried their soft serve milk vanilla matcha ice cream it was amazing!

The matcha flavor was rich and refreshing, making every bite so enjoyable.

The cone was also fantastic crispy and well-made, adding the perfect touch to the creamy ice cream.

Highly recommend this treat for anyone craving a delicious matcha experience!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113607140413131397124/reviews
W Y,5,Japanese-style Matcha & chocolate flavoured ice cream at $1 (cup) & $1.20 (cone). Reasonably-priced oden 🍢 which is not easy to find in Singapore. Friendly shop owner as well 💯,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101522161375913093051/reviews
Kimberly Chew,5,"The soup very flavourful and yet very light, very healthy as they only use natural ingredients to make the soup. They have wide range of choices for their 關東煮！all at affordable pricing as well!

I also check out their ice cream, very milky at only $1! Yum yum! Definitely recommend this place!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101479522983369779631/reviews

David Lee,5,"Got to recommend this! Get it especially during rainy days. Soup was superb however once warm not as nice as hot, so best to drink as much soup as possible first. 😋

Try as many as possible but I would say quite full after 6 items. So go and try it!! 👍",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102378190822715896810/reviews
