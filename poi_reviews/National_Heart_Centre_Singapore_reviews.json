This is especially true for appointments made earlier several month ago. These will also reduce paper wastage and be environmental friendlier in this age of climate change. Will expedite the process too.",

Each time she told her to wait as she claimed she had called another patient.\n\nAfter her second raised voices, I am  upset and told her point blank that my mother do not understand English, she looked stunt, she kept quiet and instructed my mother to sit on a chair behind her and thereafter instructed the called malay couple for measurement.\n\nShe made a mistake , did not perform service recovery, and not even apologising for the lack of empathy when taking my mother measurement.\nThis is very poor service and lack of tact, empathy and above all very entitled.\nThis is a very bad experience for us\n\nThomas",
