It‚Äôs an open, spacious area, but since it‚Äôs fully outdoors, you‚Äôll want to be ready for the heat or rain. On a nice day, it‚Äôs an awesome place to relax and take in the scenery!",

The Meadow (and the Serene Garden) is worth a visit for its equally well-paved paths plus the benefit of lesser crowd. A great way to enjoy nature and art; a therapeutic escape for busy city life.",
