í•œê²½ë§Œ,5,"A recent visit to this gallery yielded a delightful encounter, particularly with the works of Coplu. His distinctive cartoon style, reminiscent of the whimsical world of 'The Little Prince,' captivated my imagination. The artist's warm, vibrant color palette perfectly complements his unique imagery, evoking a sense of nostalgic wonder. This gallery offers a chance to reconnect with the imaginative spirit of our past.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104169783564216363528/reviews

Aimiende Negbenebor Sela,5,"Wish I could have seen more.
This quaint and compact gallery features works from artists like Choy Moo Kheung, Rujiman, Soe Soe, Yayoi Kusama, Coplu and many more. There were several flats with artwork in the gallery that I believe weren't technically on display...? (I may have assumed wrongly.) I imagine that if I were there to purchase art, I would've summoned the courage to ask if I could see themðŸ˜…
In any regard, I really enjoyed the pieces I got to see, and the space to view them. I hope to visit again next time I'm on this side of town!
If you've got a moment to take in some beautiful and imaginative pieces of art, pop in here on your way in/out of the RafflesCity mall. City Hall station.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113892506736604667331/reviews
