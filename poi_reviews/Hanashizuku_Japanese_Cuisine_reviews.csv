Roger Yuen,5,"Finding the right spot to celebrate a birthday can be a bit of a challenge. Hanashizuku at Cuppage Plaza turned out to be just the place—cozy, intimate, and all about good food without the fuss.

We kicked things off with salmon sashimi, thick-cut and silky, each bite melting in the mouth with just the right balance of sweetness and umami. Then came the asari clams, swimming in a delicate mushroom sake broth, their briny juices perfect for sipping straight from the shell. But the real showstopper was the grilled Iberico pork—charred beautifully on the outside, juicy and full of rich, nutty depth within. It was one of those dishes that made everyone at the table pause for a moment, nodding in quiet appreciation.

Of course, no celebration is complete without a good bottle, so we poured ourselves some Dassai 45 — a crisp, smooth DaiGinjo and just fruity enough—the perfect match for our meal, elevating every bite without overpowering. By the end of the night, we were stuffed, savouring the warmth of good food and family bonding.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106980819513205586625/reviews

We also had lasting impression with the staff, especially Chounan. She was attentive and hospitable, making this a highly-recommended place to visit to satisfy any cravings for authentic Japanese food.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108401026342261109184/reviews
