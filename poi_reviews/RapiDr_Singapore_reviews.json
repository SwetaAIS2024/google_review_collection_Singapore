Cannot see him from the video call, don't think it is technical issue, i think he purposely don't show face, can only see grey screen . Arrogant way of talking too. U will feel worse by meeting this kind of doctor especially when u are already not feeling well. Do not wish to post this on Google but there is no way for me to share my review or feedback in app.",

Sacrificing almost half of my resting time to queue for both a consultation and medication seems very inefficient.\n\nWith this ‚Äòteleconsultation‚Äô practice, I‚Äôm now able to prioritize more rest during my days of illness as it is very convenient, extremely efficient, and fast, to say the least. I probably save a few hours each time. Thank you so much!",
