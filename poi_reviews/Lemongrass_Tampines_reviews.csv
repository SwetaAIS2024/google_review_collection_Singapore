Falsefast,4,"Was here for dinner twice on a weekday and a weekend. For a restaurant in the heartland, the price is affordable with no GST and service charge at the moment. Mango Sticky Rice was a let-down, the mango was sour, unlike the ones in Thailand, sweet mangoes served with sticky rice. Would recommend the Basil Chicken, Seafood Tomyum Pasta, Pad Thai, and Seafood Tom Yum soup. Overall, the food was tasty. However, the service was rather slow because they're understaffed. Pitied the workers, but they really need to speed up, too, if they want to keep their customers. We ordered more drinks later but had to cancel them because after waiting for 20 minutes, our drinks were still not prepared nor served. Despite all that, staff were nice and approachable. Advance reservation is recommended to avoid long waiting time during peak periods.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107614224395170529226/reviews
BeholdHim,2,"No wonder 2 previous reviews rated 1 star. I decided to try nonetheless.

Total wait time : 40mins
Served my food to the wrong table who arrived after us.
20mins wait for 1st dish to arrive.
Had to remind server to serve us rice.
20mins later, had to remind server about my other outstanding dishes.
Finally, 40mins later, 3 out of 4 dishes was served.

The food was mediocre. It doesnâ€™t serve pork. Portion was alright for 2-3 pax

The 2 corner tables have much echo. Uncomfortable if the volume was loud.
I helped myself to the 3 sauces. They tasted artificial.

The only thing I like about this place is the space and some greens in sight. Hope they can improve to retain customers.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107790882829972143902/reviews
I liEk PoTaToEs Ã™vÃš,4,Decent Thai restaurant with a variety of dishes and a chill garden view. Lines can get long during peak hours - come early or be prepared to wait. A great addition for residents to enjoy Thai food in their neighbourhood.,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117174534983466318951/reviews
Kean Foo,5,"Very good Thai Food just near my estate. Shared about $70 for very satisfactory meal for 4 of us family. Highly recommend the sweet sour fish (centre dish). Pad Thai is great too, brilliant presentation (other picture). Pad Thai has very good tender chicken leg and tender texture of Pad Thai. My family also enjoyed the pineapple fried rice and tom yum soup. The KangKong is great for itsâ€™ price too, with non-Sambal version available and tasty.

If you decide to get the Crispy Omelette, know that itâ€™s rather oily in nature. I didnt knowðŸ¤£. Otherwise, the variety in drinks were great too!

Would also recommend coming earlier for Lunch as the sun can heat up the glass panels, causing the window seats to be a little unbearable at the start of the meal.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105370047078138741335/reviews
SZ,5,Ordered basil chicken with egg for $9. Food is decent and portion is large. There is no gst and service charge which is rare nowadays. Itâ€™s a good value restaurant and would definitely come again.,in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106389252403483357700/reviews
