Muslim Amad As-Senjawi,5,"Booked GrabCar outside the temple. Got to know the temples are dedicated to Ma Zhu, Goddess of the Sea and Kuan Shi Yin/ Kuan Zi Zai/Kuan Yin, Goddess of Mercy. Met the old venerable who is burning some joss paper. Unfortunately I couldn’t understand Mandarin. People walking pass the temple will bow and pray towards the statue of Kuan Yin with kids by the side on the right side of the temple.
