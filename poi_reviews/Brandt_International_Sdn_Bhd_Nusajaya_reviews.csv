Tan Wu Huei,3,"The office had a small reception which usually is vacant. The project they are handling is Astro. The call floor is quite long and open.

The location of the building is at a condominium, so it would really be a plus point if you are staying there and working in Brandt International as you could save on travelling time and cost.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116144532735487071341/reviews
