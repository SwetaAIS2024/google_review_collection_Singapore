YiXin,5,"Writing a review to give praises to Aniq!!! He was super kind to customers at the cashier, patient and calm despite the crowd. He was also bilingual which is super helpful to the chinese aunty behind me. ;)",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101311628345447332620/reviews

Jonathan Lim,3,"Right next to the hawker centre so you can have your fill with BCM etc before doing your grocery shopping. Bear in mind that it gets crowded here, because of the high population density of the area. To make things worse the aisles are quite narrow as with many HDB estate fairprices. I would recommend visiting during off-peak, which is easy because this is a 24 hour fairprice.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114473725027611542564/reviews
Dum Spiro Spero,1,The heavy set cashier with the tied hair or ponytail is very passive aggresive. Although he pretends to answer politely he stares at you as if he wants to fight. I have given feedback and was told he will be terminated but obviously NTUC has ignored the feedback. Please do not be afraid and call police if you are intimidated by his mannerism. This guy should not be doing this and obviously need lots of training. He is constantly on his phone when unoccupied.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104784430035416203113/reviews
Vivien Chee,1,Some cashier staff here are rude and the items placed in the shelf was a mess. Only know that I had bought a wrong item only after purchasing. Not allowed to exchange even though its was the same priced. No customer service.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116685953005883693113/reviews
