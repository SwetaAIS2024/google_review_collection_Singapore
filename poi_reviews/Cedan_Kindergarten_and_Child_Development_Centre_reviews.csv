Ken Poon,5,"My daughter graduated from Kindergarten 2 at Cedan Preschool this year, and we are deeply appreciative of her progress and overall experience.

She joined Cedan two years ago after transferring from an international school, where we found it challenging to adapt to the teaching style and lacked focus on structured learning. From the very beginning at Cedan, the difference was clear. The principal and teachers were incredibly supportive and systematic in helping my daughter acclimate to the teaching structure.

The curriculum is well-designed and appropriately paced, gradually increasing in difficulty to match the children's abilities. Initially, my daughter needed more time to adjust to this model, but the patience shown by the teachers and principal was invaluable. This approach ensured that she not only kept up with her peers but also genuinely understood the concepts being taught.

We have been amazed by her growth and development since joining Cedan. She has graduated with a strong foundation in essential concepts, and we are proud of the progress she has made under the guidance of the wonderful team at Cedan.

Thank you, Cedan Preschool, to the principal and teachers, for your dedication to guiding children through the teaching structure and for nurturing young minds!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109299402445190024377/reviews
Jason Siang,5,"My son have been attending Cedan Kindergarten since 2023. He have really enjoyed his time there where he built a good relationship with both Cedan Teachers and Classmates. He will come home and tell us about the good and fun things that he experienced in school.

We have seen how our boy have grown over the years and how Cedan have contributed in moulding our boy. It has been good and we are still continuing our journey with Cedan where our boy is in K1 now.

We have been working closely with Cedan Teachers/Management, who are very professional and knowledgeable, and learn many things from them. They are also very firm in teaching our boy and we appreciate that.

I am grateful and assured that my son is in a school with knowledgeable Teachers/caring Management and a robust curriculum that prepares him well for Primary School in future.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100822515035863117372/reviews
Lavanya Chappa,5,"We conducted extensive research to find the right school to help our child develop in the best possible way. After meeting with Principal Mrs. Poh at Cedan, we were impressed by her clear explanations and the school's holistic approach. Her demonstration of the school's strategy reassured us, and we made the decision to enroll our son. Since joining Cedan, we've seen remarkable improvements in his English communication and socialization skills.

Additionally, we are pleased with his growing sense of discipline, particularly in how he now takes ownership of his homework and enjoys completing it. The teachers have provided an excellent learning experience, and we are particularly grateful for the Robotics and Speech and Drama sessions, which have further enriched his skills and sparked his interest in learning.

As parents, we are truly happy with our decision to choose Cedan for our son, as it has produced outstanding outcomes. We highly recommend Cedan to other parents who are looking for a school that offers a well-rounded education and fosters a love of learning.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108721839627391051595/reviews
Stella,5,"My son has been attending Cedan for two years, and he thoroughly enjoys his time there. He often comes home excited to share what he has learned from his teachers and friends.

At just 4 yr old, thanks to the school’s strong phonics program, he is able to read and sound out 4-5 letter words. His writing and pencil grip have also improved significantly.

We truly appreciate how Cedan has nurtured him into a happy, confident, and vocal child. Beyond academics, the school offers enriching programs such as robotics and speech and drama, which I believe are essential skills in today’s world.

I’ve also spoken to neighbors whose children have graduated from Cedan, and they shared that their kids are thriving in Primary 1, thanks to the strong foundation in math, reading, and character-building instilled during their preschool years. These formative years are so critical in shaping a solid foundation for their primary school journey.

I am grateful and feel assured that my son is in a school with dedicated teachers and a robust curriculum that prepares him well for Primary School.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113234120898097436001/reviews
siva shankar reddy,5,"I want to thank you for the amazing impact you've had on my child this year. Your hard work has made a big difference in ways I didn't expect.
In just one year, my child has improved so much. Their pronunciation is better. They're reading more, solving problems, and even their handwriting has gotten neater. It's clear how much you care about helping each child grow.
The graduation concert was wonderful. Seeing all the children, including mine, giving speeches, act, and dance so confidently was truly special. You've given them not just knowledge but also confidence and excitement about learning.
CEDAN, you've done more than we hoped for. Your teachers deserve high praise for their dedication. Thank you for giving our children such a great start. Please keep up the fantastic work.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116205829587873552204/reviews
