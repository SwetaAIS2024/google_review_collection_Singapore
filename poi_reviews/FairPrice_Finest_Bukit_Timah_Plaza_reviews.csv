Moon,5,"My favorite place to do my groceries 🛒 after a morning walk 🚶 at Bukit Timah Hill in Singapore! 🇸🇬

It’s huge and a wide variety of selection for you to choose from! 👍

And I found some of my favorite childhood snacks! 🥰",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105450329461994261284/reviews
Esther Teo,3,"Not sure if I am right, the prices at this store for non offer items seems higher than neighborhood FairPrice.  This is especially so for fresh fruits. You will also need to check the fruits that are pre-packed carefully to ensure that they are not moldy or damaged.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102592420502174075945/reviews
littlebitofnoms,5,"A decently sized supermarket in Bukit Timah Plaza! Really neat and systematic structure, and I doubt you will struggle with finding anything— everything is well labelled and classified into clear sections! They are pretty well stocked and even have a whole breakfast section. It’s huge, but still not as big as the NTUC in Vivo City.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105189557995353438074/reviews
Count Monte Fisto,1,"What is this 'counter closed' sign on the trolley? If you want to close the counter, just close it after the sale, don't let users have the responsibility to tell those queueing behind them that it will be closed. It is easily missed and not the user's job. Complete waste of time queuing for nothing.

Absolutely ridiculous. The person that came up with this should have the karma of being stuck in a immigration queue which closes just before the their turn",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110661366816879966622/reviews
Susan Knudsen-Pickles,2,"Frustrating that they took away the scanner gun and you have to now use the Fair Price App to scan and go. The App is not very user friendly and it is too sensitive, scans random bar code where ever you point it. Its frustrating! 😩",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116920397508005143571/reviews
