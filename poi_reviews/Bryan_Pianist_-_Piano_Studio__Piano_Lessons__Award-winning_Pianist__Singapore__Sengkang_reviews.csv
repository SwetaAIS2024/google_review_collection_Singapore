Audrey Ong,5,"We are grateful to Tr Bryan for the remarkable impact he had made on our son’s musical journey. His patience, enthusiasm, and deep knowledge of music have inspired a genuine love for playing piano.

When our son started lessons, he was lacking some accuracy in playing certain notes. Under Tr Bryan’s guidance, he has managed to play much better now and has also grown more confident and expressive. We’ve seen him develop a strong foundation in technique and a deep appreciation for music.

Tr Bryan has an exceptional ability to make lessons engaging and fun while ensuring steady progress. We wholeheartedly thank Tr Bryan for your patience and commitment!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107568589650825342818/reviews
E Xu,5,"Bryan is a dynamic piano teacher who strikes a great balance between setting high standards and being encouraging. He emphasizes the importance of good sound production and keeping the ‘big picture’ of a music piece. Lessons with him are interactive and exploratory, encouraging students to find their own interpretation and to be independent learners. His own journey in music is truly inspiring and motivates his students to never give up one’s dream to play the piano. I highly recommend Bryan to anyone looking for a dedicated and supportive piano teacher",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109686826044341052528/reviews

Qiao Ying Tan,5,"Tr Bryan works extremely well
with young kids. He is patient and is able to engage the kids well. My son looks forward to Tr Bryan’s session every week.

He is also open to discuss with parents and shares his perspectives, and most importantly to pinpoint areas that needed more attention and effort. He is not just a great pianist himself, but also a good teacher.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115685888924439107925/reviews
