I chose to not confront him solely for the reason that he's elderly.  Last time I'm gonna use this store. Shop looks creepy old and dark and badly ventilated.",

Unnecessarily making it an unpleasant transaction. Also, no response to my greetings lol which is fine ig. Rudeness is not.\n\nSimilar experience with previous review on here. Definitely shipping my parcels elsewhere now ✌️",

Staff is always nice when I come. Had bad experiences with other shops where they don’t even entertain you so this is the best so far",
