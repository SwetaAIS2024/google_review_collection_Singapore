Antonio Lim,5,"Play! Tennis has a very nice outdoor court on the eighth floor. Coaches are very warm hearted and very encouraging with students. Helping each player to improve their groundstrokes on the spot when there are mistakes. It has a small retail shop at the side of the tennis court as well where it sells Balls, Shoes, Rackets and even Restringing services. Highly recommended for everyone who is keen to learn tennis and to have fun while playing tennis. 👍",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111130458690863295904/reviews
Carmina Ashley Manabat,5,"Came from the Philippines wanting to experience playing Tennis in a foreign country and Play!Tennis was the only organization we came across that was very accomodating in helping us find a convenient location as well as a coach to play with. As an intermediate tennis player my session was focused more on cleaning up my technique and footwork, as well as some groundstrokes and we even touched on my net game which I appreciated 😊. Overall I enjoyed and was very happy with how accomodating they were to us 😊. Thank you to Coach Steven for hitting with me and helping me clean up my game 🎾 and Alycia for helping us organize everything! Many thanks from the Philippines 🇵🇭!!!!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117234628083640838486/reviews

Leonard Lum,5,"It’s my first ever tennis lesson I attended, but I know Coach Steven (Sat morning session) is one of the best tennis coach. He gives clear instructions, has a systematic way of teaching, able to manage the lesson well and he can spot my mistake from across the court. I can feel his passion for tennis when he talks about it. Very good experience learning tennis here.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115716303475465989703/reviews
