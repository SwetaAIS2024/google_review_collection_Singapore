jianhao lee,5,"Coming back 2nd time for this stall. Forget to take pictures during the first time. Too hungry. Normal setup as per many market hawkers, at least is quite windy here and the cleaners clear dirty tables quite fast. The first time i tried the porridge, taste good and is quite “thick”. Unfortunately sold out this time so i ordered bee hoon. Overall the food quite tasty. Try the chicken wing, i like. Aunty quite generous on the portion, price also quite reasonable. Will be back if i am nearby and if i want bee hoon or peanut porridge.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107431589322877158256/reviews
