Woan Leng Yap,5,"Cannot park your car in the premise, so find a car park near the vicinity. Google map directs my car to the entrance along Sin Ming Drive. This entrance is locked and is a staff exit only. Use the entrance along the road off Sin Ming Drive.
Service is good, area very quiet, especially because it‚Äôs by appointment only.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110313958775674754260/reviews
Jia Yin,1,Inefficient and slow services. Had an appointment to pay penalty but still need to wait for 1 hour when it's not crowded there. Ask for assistance what I got is just instructed to wait. Not sure why can't put the payment system combine with one motoring and instead asking people come down for the sake of wasting time,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103631831436841440686/reviews
Harry Leong,5,"I was asked to arrive before the appointed time. I reached half an hour in advance. I waited for 40 minutes, my  number appeared on the screen. When I walked to the counter, it was not my number. A similar incident happened to the next counter. What happens?

This review is after counter 7 staff helped me. She went through my appeal efficiently. Thank you and because of her, I changed the review from 1 star to 4 stars.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106061166884071054048/reviews
