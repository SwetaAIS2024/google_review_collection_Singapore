      "text": "Smol space, big vibes. This literal hole in a wall of a cocktail bar is hidden in plain sight within the Raffles Place pedestrian mall under Ocean Financial Centre. Fusion food. Many makis on the menu. Didn’t know fried broccoli and tater tots (Napoleon Dynamite) could taste so bomb! It gets a little squeezy but that’s part of the vibe. Asiatique cocktails. The seasonal nori cocktail was briny and fresh. Like a gulp of seawater. If you like martinis you can try the Silk & Honey with a pecking of wild honeycomb. $50-$60/pax for 2 drinks + bites. Reservations necessary.",

      "text": "A small secret bar hidden behind an inconspicuous black \"container\" setup. I like sitting at the bar and making small convo with the bartender. I had a cocktail called Special Tea that was light with a tangy bittersweet to it with \"creaminess\" from the egg white. I had the Apple Highball as well, which was pretty normal to me.\n\nThe staff forewarned us that the truffle mushroom fries serving was huge like XXL and they were not kidding. We were served a basket of fries that was probably 3-4 x large pack of MacDonalds Fries. The fries were really nice and crisp, and we finished 3/4 of it for two ladies. The Mermaid Maki was a nice change-up - flavourful and nicely made as well. The Fried Broccoli (not in photo) was battered in tempura batter and fried to a light cirsp. Felt that the pieces were too big and chunky and would be better if they were cut into smaller size like chicken pops.",

      "text": "Atmosphere and service were great. We enjoyed our dinks as well. Unfortunately, the only dish we tried - the raw oysters - was a big disappointment. Previous reviews had mentioned $2 oysters during happy hour, which we thought was from 5-7pm. Turns out that *drinks* happy hour is from 5-7pm, and *oyster* happy hour only starts after 7pm, and you have to order a full-priced drink to get the oyster happy hour deal ($3 raw oysters instead of $5). Regardless of the pricing scheme, we did not enjoy the oysters. Perhaps it's because they're warm water oysters, but they were unappetizingly large and weren't served particularly cold. We ordered six at $5 SGD a piece and only ate two.",

Great layout and interesting covert corner. The food was good, the cocktails could be better. However, we enjoyed the nightcap. Unfortunately, towards the end of the night, when the small groups started talking louder, the sound bounced back uncomfortably now and then. Overall, 4/5.",
