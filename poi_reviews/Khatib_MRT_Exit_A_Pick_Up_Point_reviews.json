      "text": "Let's start with the station not having tickets for the Mandai Exoress bus. The ticketing office tells that the zoo told them that people can ride the bus and pay at the zoo, which is confirmed by this sign. I get in and I tell the bus driver that I don't have an acceptable form of payment and I would like to pay at the zoo as instructed, but he didn't allow me in. I called the zoo and they were helpless, they even took my number to call me back but never did. I got a card that cost $5 with a value of $7 just to use $2 value round trip, so I'm paying $12 for $2. I wait for the next bus at 2:20 but it turns out it left 3 min early. I wait for another 20min, ride and pay, only for the same exact driver to allow someone else in. He didn't even say a word to me. So, if you're a tourist, without an acceptable payment method and would like to pay at the zoo, just point at that A4 atop the driver's head if he doesn't allow you in.",
