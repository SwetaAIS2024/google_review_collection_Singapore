Usually the 2 bros are very friendly too.\n\nToday, they served both with full sweetness. Which is fine, we all make mistakes when we are busy right.\n\nWhat was unacceptable was how when I gave feedback civilly, the stall operator gave me a smirk and walked away. The other lady moderated the situation and modified the drinks unwillingly before they disregarded me again.\n\nThe drinks also remained very sweet with inadequate tea potency.\n\nHope bros will regain their standard in the future.",
