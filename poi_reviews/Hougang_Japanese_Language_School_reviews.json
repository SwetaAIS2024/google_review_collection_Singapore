      "text": "Good experience taking classes from Jack Sensei. He is both firm in pushing us to work hard, as well as encouraging us to be confident. Good to learn Japanese as Jack Sensei focuses on correct use of grammar and vocabulary. Be prepared to commit to studying and completing weekly assignments. Would love to study with them again.\n\n(-1 Star as my class was very small, so management put us in an accelerated program, which caused me quite a bit of anxiety. Grateful to Jack Sensei who encouraged me a lot when I had reached my limits. Hopefully Management can take into account and accommodate slower learners more, especially if the class is small.)",

He will go through topics taught in the previous class at the start of every class which is very helpful for us to recall what we have learnt. The course administrator Irene is also a nice lady who is warm and affable.",

I am surprised by how he can simplify complex Japanese language concepts that I learned over the internet into simple ideas. This made my learning easier and gave me a strong foundation in Japanese language.\n\nI am taking a break for the time being but will definitely go back to HJLS in the future if i were to take lessons again :)",
