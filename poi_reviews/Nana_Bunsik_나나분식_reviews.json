The wide variety of gimbaps also gave us a hard time choosing where in the end we had tonkatsu and kimchi + spam. Gimbaps are freshly made and definitely sufficiently full for an adult. Good place to order a variety to share!",

The toppoki did not really standout from the sauce, the fried stuffs were nice to be used to dip with the toppoki sauce to eat. Gimbap and the rest were normal fare. Shop is a little cramp though as they tried to have more tables and chairs to serve more customers.",
