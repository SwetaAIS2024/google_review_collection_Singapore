amber qi,5,"My cat was infected by feline parvo virus, and was sent to United clinic for hospitalisation. The doctors and nurses here are very helpful , professional and knowledgeable in taking care of my cat and keeping a close watch on him day and night. He has fully recovered after 2 weeks of treatment. Thanks for all the love and care you have given us. ❤️❤️",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116903259256836486687/reviews
Hafiszah,5,"Multiple visits from consultations to surgery, overall staff and vets are warm and honest in their opinions and assessment. Every steps that is needed to take are explained in detailed patiently by their team. Price wise I would say they are comparable and competitive to other vets. Thank you Dr Lee See Yang and team.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115981875996715853659/reviews
Mimi G,5,"We are so grateful for everyone at United Vet team!
This is my second review using another Google account because they are THAT good!

Dr Lee is really one of the BEST doctors around. He is knowledgeable, kind and compassionate. We have 2 cats and 2 dogs. He is always understanding towards each of our pet’s condition and even our SS who is extremely skittish and fearful. Dr Mark is the same too! ♥️

I’ve since moved to the other end of SG but still only goes back to United vet because I only trust them!  They really work with a heart and that’s all that matters!

Also shoutout to the vet nurses, reception & WhatsApp team and Gillian (sorry I don’t know all the names) ! They are always friendly, replies promptly and professional!

Thank you for everything United Vet! ♥️

Fiona Sum,5,"My husband and I picked up a lost cat under our block this afternoon and was advised by the community cat aunties to bring the cat to a vet. At noon, most clinic are closed for lunch yet Dr Lee from United Vet AMK is willing to sacrifice his lunch to help us see the lost cat. He has also given us a lot of options taking into consideration our existing circumstances. He is really going beyond what a normal vet will usually do for a patient/client and we deeply are very thankful for him. Coming from a dog owner, I understand that vets are an extremely taxing and tiring job and emotional tiring as well but he is really really doing his best to his best abilities to help us and help our lost cat.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107651853078946613253/reviews
