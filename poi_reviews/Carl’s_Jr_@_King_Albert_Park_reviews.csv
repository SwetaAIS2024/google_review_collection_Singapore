Isaiah Osmond,5,"Definitely one of the best burger I have ever eat in Singapore.. Stunning view from upstairs.. Definitely worth the money for the combo, especially if you're a student.. 10 bucks for a meal.. Ate the yakiniku pork burger, the patty was so smooth and tender..",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101218001147536796121/reviews
Aronica Lee Xavier,3,Burgers were delicious. The combos we ordered came with a side of fries and free flow of soft drink. We were able to upgrade 1 side to a chilli cheese fries and another to onion rings for a minimal top up fee. At the condiment station we were surprised to see that we were able to help ourselves to unlimited salsa and chopped onions. The service staffs were pleasant and friendly too.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100703506838042504743/reviews
Gopi Bala,5,"I ordered two Guacamole combo meals at the counter and was promptly and cheerfully attended to at about 11.20am today.  I inadvertently left my handphone at the counter and went upstairs to wait for the meal.

When I realised that my phone was missing, I went back to the counter and the lady at the counter had kept my phone and returned it to me. I would like to thank her for her act of kindness.

The burgers were prepared well and the fries were fresh and crispy.

The ambience of the restaurant was great!

Definitely worth repeat visits here.",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114775727475904526433/reviews
Paul Young,5,"Excellent burgers! Always loved Carl's Jr with their freshly made burgers. Excellent fries and onion rings - crunchy and freshly made. Milkshake was slightly sweet, but that is what we expected when we chose it. My only complaint is the environment. Inside is super cold!! I had to move from indoors to outdoors as it was just too cold to stay inside. Manage the environmental controls, and this becomes a prefect location for a good burger at affordable pricing.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109729405213634414664/reviews
J,5,"Nice and quiet outlet (Good for customers but not good for the business). But students started rolling in around 12:30pm.

They actually have condiments at the condiments station unlike the other outlets.

I didn’t know they served sweet potato balls and it’s actually pretty good. And their promo is also a really good deal. I hope they still have it regularly.

The only gripe I have is that the chili cheese fries being too salty.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113966954151240288230/reviews
