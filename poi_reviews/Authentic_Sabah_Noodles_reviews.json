Finally, looking for so long an authentic Sabah noodle has opened coffeeshop stall at Vertex, Ubi.\nI have ordered Sabah Meat Noodle Dry, the taste is good and authentic. Just because Singapore yellow mee is not that tasty as Sabah local mee. The black sauce is so fragrance with fried shallot oil. I like the noodle portion is big. The soup is nice, it comes with slice pork meat, pork ball and veggies. For sure I will return again.",

Prawn noodles is good too.\n\nA pity that I only got to eat this twice before it closes.",

The soup was flavourful, with tender pork slices and meatballs.\n\nThe yellow noodles are not the same as what you get in Sabah because they taste different here. Still, it was a great meal and as close to the real deal as you can get!",
