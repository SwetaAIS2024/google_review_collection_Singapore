Asked nicely if there is any other QR code to scan, they are so defensive and said that's the only one and other people can scan. Others paid $300+ and blamed on my phone. Asked me to change hp.\n\nWon't revisit!",

Braised egg was hard as well. Their soup had a mild herbal taste and was a bit too peppery. I felt that they could definitely do better than this. Just my personal opinion.",
