      "text": "Portions are not as generous as Supergreen's, but still decent enough to make a full meal (I went for \"Gain\" which comprises 1 base, 3 supplements and 2 proteins, costs $12.90). There was a huge crowd at lunchtime and many ended up getting takeaway.\n\nSome components that I loved -\n1. Capsicum was grilled, which brought out its sweetness.\n2. Brown rice (base) was flavoured and tasty, with some good crunchy texture.\n3. Sweet potato was the purple sweet and creamy kind.\n\nWhat could have been improved -\n1. Broccoli was ice cold and soggy.\n2. Teriyaki chicken could be more char-grilled, it looked really pale ðŸ˜…\n3. Membership - i could only sign up at the point of sale, which meant I could only get my 5% discount from my next purchase. ðŸ˜³",

When she was to fill up my bowl, she was distracted and paused, and held the empty bowl that was to fill up my lunch, with the inside of the bowl opening pressed against her apron for at least half a minute. That is so unhygienic!\n2. She let me waiting further while getting busy with something else while still holding my bowl in that manner.\n3. She was loud, and while I was still considering the options for the supplements, she rushed me while gesturing at me in a rude manner.\n4. The soup was lukewarm, bordering on cold.\n\nBusiness owner: you ought to take note and train your staff accordingly and adequately.\n\nThis is my first and the last time I order from you.",
