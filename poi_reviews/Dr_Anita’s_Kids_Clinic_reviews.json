      "text": "Dr. Anita is a wonderful pediatrician.\n\nWe first met her when my daughter was just a newborn 8 years ago and struggling with a skin condition. As a new mom, I felt completely lost and helpless, but Dr. Anita immediately identified the problem and knew exactly what to do. My daughter recovered very quickly after seeing her and I’ll never forget the relief I felt.\n\nSince then, she’s been the doctor I turn to whenever I have doubts or worries. Even after moving far from her clinic, I still go back to her for a second opinion. She gives me a sense of reassurance and trust that I haven’t been able to find with other doctors. I truly feel my daughter is in the best hands with her. Thank you Doctor!",

She has a very practical, methodical and comforting approach for managing any illness, vaccination or other conditions. Her clinic is always busy and her pricing is on the higher side. However, the reception staff has always accommodated me if I had any urgent requests and wanted to see the doctor urgently. Overall, I am thankful we have a doctor of her calibre in the East Coast.",

Even though her clinic is really the nearest for me, but I hardly can make any appointment to see her in 7 years after 3 kids … I only managed to see her 7 years ago for my first born and only once.\n\nSo I wouldn’t recommend waiting around this clinic unless your child can really wait!
