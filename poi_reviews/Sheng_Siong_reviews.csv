Liyana Pang,1,"Has been visiting this shengsiong outlet just downstair of my house even since I moved here since 5 years ago. The old staffs used to be super friendly, nice and helpful. Recently weeks, we notice most of the staffs now are new faces and when we approach them to ask or check on some items, their reply to us was â€˜I not sureâ€™ or I donâ€™t knowâ€™ and giving such a rude attitude or black face. And today, I went to buy some groceries and checked with one of the old staff is the item is available since the rack is empty and she say yes and get me to check with the staff that in charge of the department. So i approached the staff that in charge and she told me, this is out of stocks. So I told her, the old staff said item is Available but you say out of stocks???? End up, she give me a very black face and said, â€˜ you want than you wait loâ€™ so I was with my newborn and I asked need to wait for how long and she ask me to wait for 15 mins!! Strolling around in shengsiong for 15 mins and I donâ€™t see the item on the shelf or that staff who asked me to wait!!! ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ so I went back to the old staff and ask again, she immediately went into the store to get me what I want. I think you all really needs to train your staffs what is good customers service. Is such a pity that all the oldest staffs that we see for 5 years no longer there. And with such an attitude and service, I guess we will have to visit FairPrice just a street away.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102797367957932423139/reviews
