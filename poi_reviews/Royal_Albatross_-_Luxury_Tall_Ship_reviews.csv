Win Tai,5,Nice short getaway on a sail ship. The staff are friendly and top notch service quality. The ship is very very well maintained with Willie the cat as the star attraction. Western dining experience. The vegetarian options a bit lacking and 4 course not enough for adults. Food quality is good but varieties lacking.....non vegetarian options look good portions just right......more can be done to improve vegetarian options. Otherwise the cruirse was perfect.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114240320617932935405/reviews

Kelvin Ho,5,"Their service is exceptional and considerate towards customers as my wife was having motion sickness, they went beyond their service to allow my wife to eat at the lower deck so that she can feel better. The food was really good and they are very attentive to your needs. A58373",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116381580848123915649/reviews
