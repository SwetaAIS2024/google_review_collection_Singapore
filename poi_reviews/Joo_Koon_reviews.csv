Del Hamid,5,I buy my groceries here occasionally though I donâ€™t live near here. The food court is within a throw stone. There are more eateries at the lower floor. Easy to find parking lot. Public transport is easily accessible too.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104900919431491242159/reviews
jimmy lee,4,"It seems that most of the time the train will end in this Joo Koon station instead of the Tuas Link station. This is a very remote area in the extreme west part of Singapore. It is nice to know that they have a FairPrice Hub mall that is linked to the train station that offers quite a lot of F&B outlets. Overall, it's a nice mrt station except that there are very few train services that goes to Tuas Link.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110518855728692358654/reviews

Jason IIP,1,"Malay cleaner aunty forbid me from entering the handicapped cubicle even when there is no nearby physically handicapped person around.

And she assumed that I was not handicapped by the outfit I wore.

Ridiculous. So if a person is trans they are not able to use handicapped toilet as well?",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107241636817078096774/reviews
