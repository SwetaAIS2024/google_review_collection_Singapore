      "text": "Bought chicken from frozen pre-packaging that felt slightly thawed to the touch the chiller section (Seara Chicken). I thought it was still frozen through, however it ended up being stale.I only found out after getting very ill from cooking the chicken.\n\nBe wary buying frozen goods from this outlet as they are not storing or managing frozen produce properly. Not sure how long the chicken may have been par-thawed, as the pack was still cold/frozen from the outside, so its dangerous and hard to tell for a consumer how the chicken was managed (whether it had been thawed and refrozen in the chiller)\n\nWould advise anyone from buying any frozen meat or meat products from this outlet.\n\nAlso Shallots I purchased on the same day had some rotten pieces.",
