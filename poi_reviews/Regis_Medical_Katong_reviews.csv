TQ Koh,5,"The clinic near home was crowded and tight,
So I searched for a place that would feel just right.
A spot with care, both swift and true,
Where healing hands knew just what to do.

I stepped inside, my chest so sore,
A cough that lingered, I could take no more.
Yet here, the air was calm and bright,
A soothing space bathed in gentle light.

The staff was kind, their voices low,
Guiding me where I had to go.
With every word, they eased my fear,
Their service warm, their help sincere.

The doctor listened, nodding wise,
A thoughtful look in caring eyes.
Prescribed relief, not just in pills,
But in comfort, patience, and gentle skills.

The price was fair, no heavy toll,
Yet I left feeling fresh and whole.
Not just my lungs, but heart felt light,
A clinic that truly treats you right.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110086377302432579116/reviews
Sarah Staton,5,"My husband and I got sick with a cold while on holiday here and we wanted to make sure we were okay before we had to fly home. We did a walk-in on a Monday morning and we were seen pretty much immediately. Everyone was so nice, and we were even offered water right when we came in. Their prices are clearly listed at the front desk too. Dr Amit was great and took the time to talk through all of the medication that he was prescribing to us.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103220372828123509768/reviews

Jeffrey Cheng,5,"I fell off from the bike a few weeks ago at the East Coast Park and was desperately searching for a clinic that was open in the Sunday afternoon. Luckily, Regis Medical was open, and I was greeted by the beautiful minimalist interior and the kind and lovely doctor and nurse. The doctor was very patient with cleaning my wounds and painstakingly took out all the debris. The nurse was extremely kind and helpful and offered me snacks because I looked pale.

The services provided by this clinic are impeccable, and I dare say it’s the best care from a GP I’ve ever received. Any patient seeking care can rest assured that they are treated by professionals with the upmost empathy and compassion. I’m truly thankful to them.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101972259319680347437/reviews
I E,5,"A very professional and caring doctor's surgery, with enthusiastic, dedicated and empathetic staff. I felt involved in the diagnostic process, and my symptoms and explanations were listened to carefully and acted upon. The surgery is easy to reach by WhatsApp or telephone, and they even kept in touch after referring me to hospital, to check how I was. Wonderful people, and the best experience one could hope for in fairly challenging personal circumstances!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101364707827141837004/reviews
