Wilson Wong,5,"📍 Cathay Pacific Singapore Business Lounge ✈️🥂

Back in Asia, back to true premium airline hospitality! 🇸🇬✨ As soon as I stepped into Cathay Pacific’s Business Lounge in Singapore, I could immediately feel the refined and elegant ambiance, with perfect lighting and a peaceful atmosphere. The highlight of the lounge is definitely the famous Noodle Bar 🍜, where you can enjoy freshly made Wonton Noodles, authentic Laksa, and even Hainanese Chicken Rice 🍗—every dish is top-notch! The buffet offers a wide variety of desserts, beverages, and premium champagne, including MOËT & CHANDON 🥂, making the whole experience even more luxurious.

This marks the end of my Singapore trip and the beginning of my next adventure in Bangkok! My goal for the next four years has never been clearer! 🚀🔥",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101511593943248214220/reviews
Chan Arthur,5,"Though cannot compare with those flagship in their homebase lounge in Hong Kong, still a very nice place to relax before flight",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105294114021305160465/reviews
JA A,5,"A quiet and relaxing lounge, though I’m still not quite sure why Cathay Pacific wants to base in T4.

Nonetheless, the food and beverage offerings are pretty good here. The live station with their signature wanton noodles plus local favourite- laksa was good. The laksa even tasted better than the ones at SIA lounges in my ‘taste’. Champagne wise was Moet brut which was also good.

Service was good too, one senior uncle very polite and always smiling, greeting guests.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111504148684021296494/reviews
