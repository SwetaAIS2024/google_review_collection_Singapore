dann,5,"I’ve been receiving chiropractic treatment from Dr. Jason for the past few months, and the improvements have been amazing. Before starting treatment, I often had headaches and even felt breathless at times, along with pain in my neck and back. He adjusted my posture, which made a big difference. Since then, all of these issues have gotten much better. He’s very friendly, professional, and always careful during treatment. I appreciate how he takes the time to explain everything and ensures I’m comfortable throughout the process. I feel much better now ！",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114349983492436050997/reviews
Jan Adrianne,5,"Been visiting this clinic for about 4 months for my chronic shoulder, lower back and knee pains! Significant progress has been made and allows me to return to a more active lifestyle without pain. As someone who is new to chiro, it has been a great experience and value for money. Highly recommend if you are looking for a clinic in the east as the location is near the MRT.

Both Dr Yen Ee and Dr Jason are very friendly and good at providing care, along with the lovely clinic staff Chie and Clai as well. It is very easy to schedule appointments using their online system or WhatsApp.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110130438929660593407/reviews

Goh Dino,5,"I have been seeing Dr. Jason for a few months now, and I cannot say enough good things about him. From my very first appointment, he took the time to listen to my concerns, explained everything clearly, and created a personalized treatment plan that is actually working. My lower back pain has significantly improved, and I feel more mobile and energetic than I have in months.

The office is clean and welcoming, and the staff, Clai and Chie, are always friendly and professional. Appointments start on time, and the entire experience is stress-free.

If you are looking for a knowledgeable, compassionate, and skilled chiropractor, I absolutely recommend Dr. Jason.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114569396508741163110/reviews
