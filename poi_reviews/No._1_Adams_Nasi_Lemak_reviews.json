      "text": "If you’re craving for a good plate of nasi lemak with fried chicken, this is the place to go. Rice is fragrant, sambal is sweet, spicy & flavourful and the chicken is fresh, hot & juicy. The plate of nasi lemak also comes with the usual condiments- 2 slices of cucumber, ikan bilis, peanuts and an egg omelette.\n\nI get why the place only has 3 stars- probably due to the long queue, slow-service or grumpy makcik but thats what you can expect during the busy lunch hour. I was lucky as I was 2nd in line and I managed to find a parking lot. Just order your nasi lemak with a smile and enjoy the food.\n\nOverall, there’s no denying that it is one of the best places to eat nasi lemak in Singapore.",
