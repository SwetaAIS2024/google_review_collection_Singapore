Christian Madonna,4,"Was very pleasantly surprised by how warm and personable Wallace , the staff who serviced us. He went out of the way to explain the available menu, the options and even recommendations.
After taking our orders, he even informed us that he would bring us our meals.
To top it all off, he even moved to open the door for us to enter the dining area.
He showed sincerity and care that was unexpected in a fast food establishment.
High praise for Wallace.
I will certainly be going back for more.
The spicy chicken was lovely, with Indian spices and flavours prevalent, and the accompanying curry on the rice, so yummy. The chicken was moist and the skin crunchy. The fish for the fish and chips was tasty , but on the “skinny” side.  Nevertheless, a nice meal.
Sadly the aircon was not cold and some of the seats damaged/torn.

Porter KHOR,2,"$10.50 for tower burger meal.  Topped up $1.00 to swap fries for onion rings.  Served only 7 rings.

Burger was small.  Bun was smaller than size of my palm.

2 patties.  One chicken thigh fillet which was alright.  The other was a processed chicken patty like a giant nugget. Tastes like a knock off MC Spicy.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115681434361834317527/reviews
Gaurav Gupta,4,"Ordered the Veggie burger combo for 8.5$, the fries were crispy and tasty. Burger was decently good, the patty was crispy from outside and it felt like hash brown from the inside.

** the Staff informed that mayonnaise contains egg.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107343109932781353214/reviews
Alex,4,One of the few places in sentosa where you can get a meal at a reasonable price. Long queue at dinner time and the self ordering kiosks were not working. Got to wait quite a while due to the long queue.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106097709609821008050/reviews
Stan,4,It's the offspring of Col. Sanders after marrying an Asian woman. It's a great fusion of West and Asia with their juicy fried chicken paired with sambal or curry sauce. If we have this in the Philippines it'll be a good alternative for the ever boring western fast food chains.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102536880321073305234/reviews
