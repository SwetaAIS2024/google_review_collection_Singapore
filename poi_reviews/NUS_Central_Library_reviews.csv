t j,5,"It's my university and that is my central library where I stayed for almost three years. Thanks to NUS, thanks to the Singapore government who provided me Phd scholarship. During the PhD study period, I and my wife booked the carrel almost every day. There left us beautiful memories. Blessing you, my university",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102590096810898177632/reviews
A. O.,4,"Very nice library but I wonder who decided to put the noisiest elevator in a library. Every up and down and door opening, the elevator makes these incredibly long and loud signals. You can even hear from 50 meters distance. Having so much noise kind of defeats the purpose of a library. Clearly the designer never used a library in his/her life.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110942762609785391479/reviews
