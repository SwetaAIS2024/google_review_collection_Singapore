Aman Kozha,5,"Catching the open stall early in the morning with freshly made veggies and meat sets is worth the charge for the whole day ahead! Getting the seating place at any part of the day may be tricky.

Another small but significant factor for me is the nicely made hot milk tea. I have personally learned to appreciate those simple things over the years! Plus, the service usually goes at a higher pace.

Kudos to the people behind the traditional setup from the lakeside massive rapid transport train station! It's a substantial boost for any person's work day ahead, and fast service levels are at play!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114220481994962867432/reviews
Lyzz O,1,"I've been buying the same food, and the price seems to be changing every time, and I'm not sure why it is so. $12.20 became $12 then today $12.60. I told them to add noodles for $1 more. They also never listened properly. So less portion do you think it will be full hence I said many2 times also never add. Sian ah. Not buying there anymore.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105815514690017931270/reviews
lontongstroong,2,"Rather mediocre food with small selection of menu, but you can't beat the price. Usually no more than $3.5 for a full meal. Definitely better cost performance despite somewhat lesser quality and range than the cai png stall next door.

If the owner sees this post, I hope he/she could also decrease the music volume in the store. It's hard to get the message across due to the excessively noise.

Edit: Downgraded to two stars due to hygiene issues - they seem to be not bothered by flies hanging around the food shelf.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112708452931686187176/reviews
