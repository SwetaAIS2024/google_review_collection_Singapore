Dora XY,2,"It look decent like a Japanese small eatery. However when the food came it was quite disappointing after eating some. As I eat more the food - there were some black dots inside the soup. It was certain that it was burned somehow that the pot that they used to heat the soup and noodle up were charred. The meat was okie, however the soup based were pretty not up to standard. the staff claimed that it was due to the grill ingredients. Kindly check your food properly before serving.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102612060797932101152/reviews
Cuddle Malice,4,"Ordered the chicken thigh don with upsized meat for $13.
For this price in a mall and this portion, it‚Äôs quite worth it.
Normally i order the gyu don but it was sold out at time and day of visit.
The meat here is always cooked nicely, and rice portion is just right.
The ramen is also cooked very nicely. Broth is seasoned well

Have been coming here before or after blood donation and will continue to do so as it‚Äôs just at the basement.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102427232260718700001/reviews
Sunny Side Up Eats,3,"not the cheapest pricing for the quality, i didn't enjoy the beef don as the meat was too tough, perhaps better to ask for doneness of meatü´† grilled squid was way too chewy which was tough to chew on, regretted ordering that. i enjoyed the bacon enoki roll which was grilled nicely & has a nice umami sauce over it. they provide free tea which was nice.
