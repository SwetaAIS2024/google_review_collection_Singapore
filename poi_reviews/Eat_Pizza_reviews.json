Ordered the seafood pizza set and triple cheese pizza.\n\nFor the price, it was actually pretty good, and I like that the pizzas are somewhat freshly made upon order. It would be better though if the order screen at the shop could list the ingredients in each pizza.",

How can a pizza \"stick\" be filling?\n\nI was totally wrong when it arrived.\n\n1. Pizza.\n\n- 25cm long.\n- it was thick.\n- it was flavorful and riched.\n- nicely done up.\n- I find it little bit sweet but still OK.\n\nSirloin Steak Pizza\n- the beef is not those thin\"piece\" type but the \"cube\" type. Size was just right.\n- quantity of the beef cube was just right.\n\nPepperoni Pizza\n-  size of the pepperoni was just right.\n- quantity of the pepperoni was just right.\n\n2. Original Mac and Cheese\n\n- very riched\n- very flavourful.\n- nicely burnt.\n\nOverall\n\n- extremely satisfied with the pizza n the mac&cheese.\n- definitely will eat again.\n\nRecommendation\n\nOrder different flavours to try and share instead of having one person for each flavour.",

For the small size, the price may not be the cheapest pizza. But the take out container made it easy to have a pizza on the go. Will be back again to try their best seller; Hot Spicy Chicken and Sweet Bulgogi.",

      "text": "Stopped by for their 1 for 1 promo. The pizzas are okay, nothing particularly special imo. Just another pizza chain. Prices arent that great for the serving size either. But the real pickle they have is the ordering and production process. Seems like they're always behind and it's supposed to be \"fast\". I waited a good 45mins after ordering to collect my food. Even went to get ice cream first!\nI figured that after having 100 outlets in Korea, they would have had a solid production process by now.\nWould I come back again? Probably only when there's a promo. Don't think the price is really worth while.",

      "text": "A search for a good makan spot in Paya Lebar area got me noticing this new Pizza spot.\n\nANNNNDDDD, both my pal and I weren’t disappointed with the Bestie Set that we had. The Pizza bar came in a nicely thought-out paper box that made eating it easy and convenient - i.e. without dirtying your hands. (Except that if you are a very careless eater, or bought a pizza with toppings as creamy as mine, you would need to prepare some wet wipes and tissues on the side)\n\nThe side came in a nice plastic container and fork so, it’s really easy to order this and eat out, at anywhere.\n\nWe’ve got a Double Cheese Bacon & Aloha and both pizzas were delicious and easy to take down.\n\nThe only downside was its open-air seats that weren’t the most comfy spots during the hot and humid season.",
