Claire Soh,5,"Went to buy Pei Pa Koa at Unity Clementi Mall on 19 Aug 2023 around 11am, the elderly lady cashier (Jocelyn?) was very helpful and patient. She showed me where the item was displayed and told me they are new stocks. Excellent service. Thank you.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110405063445591910541/reviews

Cheng Zheng Yang,1,"Started with me trying to get small change to use the NTUC trolleys. It has been indicated in NTUC that I could either exchange for them at their customer service counter or Unity pharmacy. There wasn’t anyone at the customer service counter at 1.35pm when I visited. I went back twice but there wasn’t anyone.

Also around 1.35pm today (24 July 2021) I went to Unity pharmacy to check if I could get some coins with a 10 dollar note which is the smallest note I had. There were 2 ladies at the counter. The lady with short hair mentioned that they can’t open the cash counter and could only make do with the existing coins available in their loose change container (understandable). The other lady in longer hair, however, retorted in a very negative tone making me sound as if I am here to make their lives difficult and taking away all their coins. She could have told me that we can’t do that and that’s it, but she had to make me sound like the devil in the process. Very bad experience.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111811256611777965429/reviews
