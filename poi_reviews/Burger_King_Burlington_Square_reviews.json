The food waiting time is impressively fast, and the LCD screens clearly indicate when your food is ready for collection. Don't forget to check for online coupons that can be redeemed at the kiosk – a nice money-saving feature. As for the burgers, they were absolutely awesome; Burger King never disappoints. Recommended!",
