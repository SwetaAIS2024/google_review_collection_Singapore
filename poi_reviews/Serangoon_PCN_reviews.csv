Irene Tan M X,5,"A long stretch of straight walking trail with lots to see once you reach the resting spot in-between punggol park or further down the park connector.

Famous resting spot where you see many kids just play within the area sometimes even people fishing. Look down the bridge and you‚Äôll notice lots of fishes, turtles, frogs in the water.

The waters here are like mirror reflecting against the trees! Super pretty sight!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107234303898599875744/reviews
