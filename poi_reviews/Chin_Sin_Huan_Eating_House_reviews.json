Takeaway with beautiful box for giveaways. Very reasonable pricing. The prawn noodle is also good. Note Prawn noodle is not available Wednesday/ Thursday. Pau usually sell out by afternoon especially on weekends.",

Ordered the prawn and pork rib noodle but the stallholder said they were out of ribs. He still very nicely gave me the last remaining piece of pork they had left. The Mee/beehoon was nicely cooked and broth tasted great. I asked for chili but was not prepared for how spicy it was, left about half the paste untouched. I was lucky to get one of the last bowls of noodles for the day, they turned away customers before 11am, a record time according to the stallholder.",
