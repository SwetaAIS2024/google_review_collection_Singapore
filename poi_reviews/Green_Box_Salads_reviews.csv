Adam Sobieski,5,"I am a foreigner who works near by in the science park. This is a simple salad bar. But it is fresh and tastes really good! They are serious about delivering a high quality meal.  In some ways this is my favorite place in all of a Singapore to eat. I might cry like a baby if they ever close. Hope more food centers in Singapore can open this type of natural, healthy food and sell it at a good value!!!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112527260527142119517/reviews
Bryan Hu,5,"Not sure why this place doesnt have reviews, its quite good! For $5.80 you get chicken thigh, brown rice, corn, broccoli, lettuce and some thai chili sauce.
