      "text": "Ordered via Grab Food. Now I first came across the new double down burger with a helping of Korean spicy instant noodles in an ad and truth be told it looked fantastic. But reality is never quite the same, now you can't go wrong with 2 zinger patties sandwiching anything, unless there isn't really anything in between. I could count the number of noodle strands on both hands, plus the noodles were cold and pretty hard and most of it wasn't in between the chicken patties, there were on top, dropped out onto the package and melded into the gooey mess of cheese and mayo. Stay clear of this or ask them to separate the noodles or better yet save the money and cook some to go with your zinger burger.",
