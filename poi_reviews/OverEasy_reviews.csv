WEI HONG CHAN,5,"We had a great experience with signature food beer can chicken at OverEasy.

The restaurant has a lovely ,romantic atmosphere with soft lighting and comfortable seating.

The prices were reasonable for high quality of food and service more than made up for it.Definitely will be returning.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117176059872692213783/reviews
Stefan Ladwig,5,"Great place right across the Marina Sands Bay hotel. We stopped there for snacks (burgers, fries and beer) and had a blast. The food was great, the view is beyond spectacular. It was not too crowded but I can imagine that this is a popular place to stop by in the evening. We sat inside as it had just rained but the place offers great outside seating.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110603128227701098575/reviews
Gibrand Cruz,4,"Food, service and atmosphere were all great! Loved a peaceful and delicious brunch with an amazing view — the burger was cooked to my chosen medium rare perfection, the buttermilk chicken was so crispy and juicy, and the sides complimented everything perfectly with taste and portions. Grabbed seats indoors by the open entrance which make for a great in-between for the indoor comfort but outdoor ambience and view. Prices are a bit too high though I feel, but I suppose that's expected given the location.

Overall a great place that I recommend, I'll definitely be back again!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114241521605512628733/reviews
Cindy Nee,3,View was great. Tried their “To Die For” burger which was decent but the patty could have used abit more seasoning. The brussel sprouts were quite nice but the buffalo wings were so-so. Food was served fast and service was acceptable.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113665402041556650651/reviews
