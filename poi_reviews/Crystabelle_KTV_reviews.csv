CK CK,5,"One of the few places for a good chill at karaoke pub. The owner is superbly friendly. The ambience is well decorated. They have private karaoke rooms and open space karaoke with good system. They have one pool table and per game is $2 only. You can change $1 coins there to play.  For foods, they have titbits only as they donâ€™t have kitchen. Overall surrounding is clean, chill and lively.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112703430868755541581/reviews
Littletiny sun (littletinysun),5,Soft Drinks are sold at $10 nett. They have a wide range of songs for karaoke and lots of alcohol.

Shawn Low,1,"I inquired about the status of my song dedication, but was told to wait and not bother the staff. While I understand the need to manage workload, I had hoped for a more helpful and communicative response. Hopefully, the team will work on improving their customer service in the future",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107571699110383841750/reviews
