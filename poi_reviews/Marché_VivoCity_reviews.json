      "text": "Brought my partner and her mom here for dinner and I must say for the price 4 pax, we each had a main and one sharing dish plus 2 drinks that worked out to about $130 - its super overpriced for the quality of food. First off we ordered 2 Rostis with chicken cheese sausage for one and garlic pork for the other, while the sausages were serviceable, the Rosti was mid, and for the price of over 20 bucks per plate so not worth it. We also ordered grilled sea bass and half a chicken, again just mid, actually it came across feeling like Ikea grub. Lastly we had fried calamari, now this was a favourite of mine many years ago, unfortunately due to various dishes being ready at different times , by the time I got around to eating it the dish was already cold and the batter soggy that was rather underwhelming. It's been over 5 years since I last had Marche and the bill after the meal just made it a bitter pill to swallow seing which the food was sub-par at best.\n\n(Edit: forgot to mention we ordered two mushroom soups as well for 8.90 each iirc, bland, watery and pretty dismal)",

      "text": "A lively, European market-style experience with enticing cooking aromas and vibrant fruit/veggie displays at the entrance. Rosti shines—crispy, golden shredded potatos, paired with cool sour cream. Some decent but not excellent dishes, the pork knuckle was unevenly dry and chicken mushroom crepe (had a rough cabbage filler) unlike the creamy savoury crepe I recalled from previous visits. Prices are steep (mains ~$20+), but the immersive vibe—open kitchens, swiss chalet-inspired decor—justifies a visit. Best for families or groups craving atmosphere over flawless food. Stick to Swiss classics.",

Their separate food stations and ordering system based on tags are efficient and still refreshing.\n\nDon't think all their food are Swiss cuisine, but I enjoyed it anyway. This family-friendly restaurant offers a variety of food from steak to seafood, with something for everyone.\n\nWill be back from time to time.\n\nCheck out my food reviews on my Instagram page for more!
