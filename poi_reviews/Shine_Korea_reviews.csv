Wayne Leong,5,"This outlet is particularly spacious, allowing for a more enjoyable shopping experience. Just like most Shine Korea outlets, this outlet is very well stocked and offers a very wide variety of products.

Generally, I would recommend this outlet as it is slightly quieter and lesser known as the outlet at Bugis Street is seemingly more popular.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116303283851842617447/reviews
Catherine Yeo,1,"I get food poisoning from these penust
After calling the shop to check the expiry date, they told me it is 28June2024 expiry date still consumable. I think the front desk boy doesn't have any knowledge about food poisoning especially if any items contain peanut.That's a ridiculous reply.

These are free gifts from the shop owner when I made payments upon purchasing 2 bags of eggs noodles from this shop on 11June2024 5pm+

I only looked 1 bag n within 30min I filled whole body muscle pain, no energy to move, difficult to breath....these are food poison symptoms
Now my lymph nodes are still in pain

Shop owner, please stop giving free expiry foods if is the expiry closed to due date, and especially contain peanut ingredients. Imagine chronic illness person took it and lead to critical situation.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101630493462771375489/reviews
