Maximilian Jackson,4,"Ji De Chi Dessert isn't just a dessert shop; it's a nostalgic portal to sweet, comforting bliss. From the moment you step in, the aroma of simmering ginger and coconut milk wraps you in a warm embrace. Forget fleeting dessert trends, this place is a testament to timeless Hong Kong classics, executed with unwavering precision.
Their signature black sesame paste? A velvety, nutty revelation, rich and intensely satisfying. The ginger sweet soup, with its perfectly chewy tang yuan, delivers a soothing heat that lingers beautifully. And the mango sago? Forget those watery imitations; Ji De Chi's version is a symphony of ripe, succulent mango chunks and creamy sago, a tropical dream in a bowl.
What elevates this place beyond the ordinary is the palpable dedication to quality. Every ingredient tastes meticulously sourced, every bowl crafted with care. The service is genuinely warm, adding to the homely atmosphere. It's a rare gem that manages to be both authentic and consistently exceptional. If you crave desserts that nourish the soul as much as the palate, Ji De Chi is an absolute must-visit. You‚Äôll leave with a sweet smile and a longing to return.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111591021169192976239/reviews

Julian Seow,5,"Cozy little shop for Chinese dessert. We had the durian shaved ice which was pretty good, really liked the chewy yellow and green ball things. It was a good size for two people to share.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102992432674241965160/reviews
Amy,4,"The store is split into 2 parts (one side is selling desert, the other is selling pizza). This resulted in a small shared sitting area. Easily filled.

There was only 1 - 2 staff left who were attending multiple orders.

Had the durian snow flake from other outlet, so I have decided to order the same too. it was decent. For some reason, the flakes were ""patted"". This has changed the texture of the flake-ness, it's slightly on the dense side.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112819721208074690339/reviews
Marilyn quek,2,"I recently ordered a takeaway of 2 bowls of almond paste from here and I must say, I was thoroughly disappointed with my experience. The almond paste had been scooped directly from the fridge and then hastily reheated in the microwave, still in its original container with the cover on.
The reheating method was not only hasty but also subpar in terms of preserving the taste and texture of the almond paste. The microwave reheating method used seemed lazy and had a negative impact on the overall quality of the dessert.
Regrettably, based on this experience, I will not be ordering the almond paste from this establishment again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113627492503501328025/reviews
