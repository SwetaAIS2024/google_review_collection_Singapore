Leon Chung,1,"Had a very awful experience studied here:

1. Official website listed it’s a in class course. On the first day of class, I’m the only one attend in class, then I was notified that it was an online course through Zoom.

2. Classes were 6pm-8pm, mostly starts late, including exam day, the paper were given out late too. Have an half hour break about 7pm, starts late again, sometimes ends early, how do we really learn things through these short periods, not even 1.5 hour per class.

3. Mostly a reading class than a teaching class. Lecturers read through books and reference, some of them not even listed out examples and make expansions.

4. All courses I took  end around Dec 2024, results were delayed, and have to keep asking in the group whether they had update the result system. After results are updated, they never even contact me for certificate collection. I have to ask then again and again about the certificate, and they were always on “checking and update you back”.

Until March 2025 and coming soon April, never get my certificate yet, still wait for their “checking and update you back”

In conclusion, if you were finding monthly installments course, pay to get the certificate with not much useful knowledge course, this might suit you. But I felt throw $4k into the sea.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110226942400017997436/reviews
