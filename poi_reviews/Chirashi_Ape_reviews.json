      "text": "We went after reading the 8 very positive reviews as well as intrigued by yet another brave F&B attempt at Ayer Rajah C.C.\n\nBut was disappointed. Perhaps the place have seen better days but nothing like what we saw on their website.\n\nFor one thing, the menu have shrunk to 12 items at prices closer to $10 a piece. (See photo of menu) The dispenser is not working. Just canned drinks and hot tea. Just a bored, but pleasant, guy at work. No nets. No paylah. Just cash payments.\n\nAnd ya, we didn't even get the miso soups that previous customers shown in their reviews.\n\nTo be fair, prices aside, the food is good enough for our family. Portions could be more generous. Service was okay okay.\n\nPlus points for us: freezing aircon, no other customers during lunchtime, and no intrusive piped in music.\n\nNevertheless, $33.70 for three abbreviated meals really tested our sense of being charitable.",
