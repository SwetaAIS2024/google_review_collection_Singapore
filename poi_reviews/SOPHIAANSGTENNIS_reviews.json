      "text": "I am an adult learner and picking up tennis for the first time. I am on to my 9th lesson with Coach Sophiaan and progressing really well. He is extremely approachable and caters really well to whatever goals you may have for tennis. I am aiming to win something in a tennis competition within 1-2 years of training. Might sound a bit unrealistic or crazy but I think Sophiaan can help guide me in achieving that!\n\nHe adjusts the pace according to the learner, and is pretty straightforward with his feedback (which is what serious learners need). As of now, with his guidance, I now have a relatively dependable forehand and can maintain rallies well with it. I am still working on my backhand and just had my second lesson on overhand serve. It's a really technical sport but through his lessons, I really find myself liking the sport a bit more each week!",

This clearly demonstrates how adept he can be in his coaching approach. What I really like about his coaching was the fact that Sophiaan makes pin-pointed observation and provide incremental feedback for improvement. I'd strongly recommend his services if you have been playing for a while and wanted someone to mirror you for improvement.",
