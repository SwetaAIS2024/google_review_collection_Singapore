Despite the restaurant being packed, staff were all friendly, polite and in good spirits. Dishes were served promptly, presentation and flavours on point. My guests and I were especially taken care of by Jit â€“ wonderful lady who took time to recommend me the specials. Her sincerity could be felt at every point of our dinner. Thank you, Jit!\n\nCan't wait to head back to again soon. Delicious food, fair prices and feels like family :)",

      "text": "As a frequent patron, the food and service at iO has always been excellent and well worth the price.\n\nReservations are recommended, otherwise you will probably end up waiting for a bit. The restaurant is often quite crowded, especially during dinner time, and the tables are relatively close to one another.\n\nWould definitely recommend their braised beer beef, stuffed Roman Bruschetta and Porchetta. Their Tiramisu is also quite nice.\n\nThe staff are all really friendly, but none more so that auntie Jit, who is an absolute delight. We will definitely be back soon.",

The service was top notch and the food is really high quality for the price.\n\nWe got the meatballs, medium pizza, tangliolini and pistachio tiramisu.\n\nThe meatballs were really fat and round and the cheese and tomatoes sauce really elevated this dish.\n\nThe pizza serving was extremely large and generous and the crust is really crunchy the mushrooms topped ones were the most delicious.\n\nThe pasta flavour was really unique and aromatic and creamy and tangy.\n\nThe tiramisu is not too sweet but still creamy and nutty. Really great way to end the meal.\n\nIt was a full house when I came in on a weekend so recommend to reserve in advance.",

The panna cotta n tiramisu were perfect with just the right amount of sweetness.\n\nThe drinks were a bit of a let down, the coffee with bubble was good though, ask for sugar syrup as it is with no sugar.\n\nAmbience and service was good, we had a fun time .",
