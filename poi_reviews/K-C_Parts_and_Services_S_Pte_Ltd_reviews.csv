SAILING WILSON,5,"You maybe interested in this.

I purchased a genuine YANMAR brand raw water pump from the local YANMAR  distributor here in Langkawi.

It cost an incredible AU$900.  What a Hugh difference between the JMP raw water pump at $350 AUD.

I am so happy. much cheaper and still good quality.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115031208356251790669/reviews
