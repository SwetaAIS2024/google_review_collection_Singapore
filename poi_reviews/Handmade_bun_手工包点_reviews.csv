qing li,3,"Big bag $2.2, sticky rice chicken $2.5
The meat in the big bag is fresh, firm and quite tasty.
But the big bag is very small, just slightly larger than the small bag in ordinary coffee shops. The glutinous rice chicken also comes in portions of 2 or 3 bites. I don't think it's worth a return visit.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105248477618506360754/reviews
