They really did a fantastic job on helping me locate my birth father in Singapore while trying to communicate with them from overseas.\n\nI explained my situation and within the same day (within hours) they were able to locate my birth father and provide me his address, photos, and video. Wow! I am so impressed! :)\n\nHighly recommend this company, SK Investigation Services; and their rates are pretty reasonable compared to other PI. Please check them out first before consulting other places because their work is very professional and trustworthy. You will get good results!\n\nThank you so much Lawrence and team! You have made my dream come true and now that Iâ€™ve reunited with my birth father I am finally at peace with myself!\n\nYours truly,\nHappy and satisfied customer",

They get me information that other investigators were unable to get. Raffi is very approachable and patient. He often goes the extra mile to get that extra piece of information.\nThey have helped me find long lost family members that I have been needing to reconnect with. I can honestly say that the service they provide is very valuable and worth every dime. I would definitely recommend this company to anyone in need.",

I sent a message to SK INVESTIGATION SERVICES and he quoted me a price and we started working. At first he couldn't find what I needed but I knew it was more out there. The more information I provided the more they searched. Things started happening and the information started flowing. I love the extra mile they went to help me get the information I knew was there. These people are great and will get you what you need. But...be careful what you look for because you just might find it.",

The report was very detailed, informative  and definitely more than I expected. The price was very reasonable and actually lower than 2 other quotes obtained.\n\nVery highly recommended if you need something investigated fast. No nonsense, Quick and to the point, you can't go wrong with this agency.",
