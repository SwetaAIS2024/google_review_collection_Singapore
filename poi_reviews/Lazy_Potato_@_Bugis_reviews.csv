Zijing Tan,5,"Dining at Lazy Potato was a truly unique experience. The private tatami rooms were thoughtfully designed, creating a cozy, home-like atmosphere. Every detail, from the warm lighting to the seamless layout, reflected the owner’s dedication to comfort and cohesiveness. The space felt intimate yet modern, perfect for unwinding with friends or family. It was clear that a lot of care went into making the experience both inviting and memorable. I appreciated how effortlessly everything came together, making it a perfect blend of tradition and contemporary charm. It’s a happy place I’d return to for both comfort and ambiance.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115193890748271445932/reviews

Athena Minty,5,"Dropped by Unsalted today for a snack and was pleasantly surprised to find a nice cosy cafe with yummy food and alcohol!
Katsu Sando features a crispy thick juicy chicken thigh meat sandwiched between 2 chonky waffles.
Vernice also introduced me their popular sour plum vodka shot which was light and refreshing! After which, she also showed me the unique tatami private dining rooms and more private rooms on level 3 ! Each room comes with custom built couch (so everyone can stretch their legs and chill),  TV (Netflix, etc) and gaming console.
What a cool spot to chill and hang out in private with friends!!!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113225084518926636096/reviews
