Brandon Lee,4,"This is a mid tier restaurant, very comfortable with a good ambiance.

Waitress recommended a reasonably priced set RM328 set meal for our group of 5.

Set had chicken and pork stomach soup, Soy steamed groupa, prawn balls, double yam rings ( veggie and sweet sour pork), garlic fried vegetables Added a plate of fry beef hor fun.

The set was definitely worth the price for the sizable portion , taste, and quality.

Beef hor fun was on the high side at RM70 for large portion. Tea for 5 pax was RM25

Overall, it was an enjoyable dining experience. Will be back to try other dishes.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111058138352724401189/reviews

Vincent Khoo,3,First time tried this restaurant at Eko Botanic area. Serving Chinese dish mainly. Taste is mediocre and no wow effect to me. Price is definitely on the high side. The shrimp paste chicken wing is so small. Yam ring portion is rather small too. Not worth for the price we pay.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109845981260181580873/reviews
