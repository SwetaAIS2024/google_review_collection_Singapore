      "text": "Went to Pretty Face for facial and had a great experience! I enquired quite last minute but Jenna shifted her plans around to accommodate me, very thankful!\n\nI‚Äôm struggling with acne and Jenna tailored the facial according to my needs and I could tell that my face was a lot clearer after the session. She also explained in great detail what she was doing at each step.\n\nAt the end, she even massaged my neck and back to complete the whole facial experience, explaining that it would help with the detoxing experience (because of how the lymphatic system is connected).\n\nOverall I‚Äôm very pleased with this facial and would recommend! No hard selling either which is always a plus.",
