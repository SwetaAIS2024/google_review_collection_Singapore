      "text": "Gong Yuan Ma La Tang offers a straightforward take on the popular Sichuan-style mala soup, but unfortunately, it doesn‚Äôt quite hit the mark.\n\nSoup & Ingredients\n\nThe broth was decent, carrying the expected numbing and spicy kick, but nothing particularly stood out. The ingredients were fresh, though the overall experience felt quite generic‚Äîcomparable to any other mala tang chain.\n\nCondiments\n\nThe peanut sauce was a letdown. Instead of the rich, creamy nuttiness that enhances mala flavors, it was overly diluted and lacked depth. If you‚Äôre looking for that signature thick and fragrant peanut dip, this won‚Äôt satisfy.\n\nEgg Bomb\n\nThis was a disappointment. It was excessively oily, which took away from the enjoyment. A good egg bomb should have a crisp yet slightly fluffy texture, but this one leaned too much on the greasy side.\n\nOverall Verdict\n\nNothing fantastic. It‚Äôs an okay choice if you‚Äôre craving mala tang in the area, but there‚Äôs nothing particularly memorable about it. With better mala spots around Singapore, this wouldn‚Äôt be my top pick.\n\n‚≠ê Rating: 2.5/5",

      "text": "New mala spot in the stretch, and it left a great impression‚Äîwe‚Äôll definitely be back! The interiors are bright and clean, and the food was overall good. However, the operational flow could use some improvement, as many customers (ourselves included) were new and needed guidance from the staff - especially with 1 ordering kiosk down out of 2. The process is simple: order at the kiosk, clip your receipt to your bowl, and wait for your number to be called when your food is ready. With a large variety of ingredients to choose from, it‚Äôs a fantastic addition to Rail Mall!",

      "text": "It's yummy! The mala pork bone soup is nice can choose level of spiciness and pork bone soup is nice too. Can choose to fry or not for selected items. Staff is friendly to assist. One thing that shop can do is to add better blue UV light or mist at fridge so that can deter the flies to keep food fresher. Music speaker is not good as it gets very loud, can improve. Thank you. üòä",

The fried items were somewhat better since they were refried, but overall, the experience was poor. Won‚Äôt be coming back.",
