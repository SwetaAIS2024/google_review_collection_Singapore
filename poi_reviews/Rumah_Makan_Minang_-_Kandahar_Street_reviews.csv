Gladys Sun,5,"Food: best in this area. Not too salty. Not too oily

Staff: service staff was polite, friendly and although there was no table service, they assisted us with carrying out drinks to level 2. But we just have to be a little patient. All is good. And this is all during lunch!!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117699041456143842667/reviews
Sheue Lin Ng,4,Came here slightly before noon. Managed to find seats. The queue to order was about 12 mins. The dishes were tasty and spicy. My favourite is the chicken rendang. The tahu telor was slightly spicy too with the sweetness of the dark soya sauce as based.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100782595262033627690/reviews

Jennifer Lee,5,"Sitting at the road side with great tasting nasi campur. The belacan added a spicy kick to the dishes, curry chicken was tender and fragrant with plenty of gravy coating my rice.

Pecan Pie,1,"Went today for lunch, was lining up then a staff asked for my order, told him having here, I told him chicken rendang and he puts beef rendang then as the display is long I told him I wanted the green veg and pointed to it he then commented you come here why you stand there? I’m standing here because there’s a person in front of me and I don’t want cut her que and this is exactly what happened when I went pass, the person didn’t like it. While paying I noticed the beef rendang instead and told the cashier, he asked the guy who scooped the dishes and  he wasn’t happy and started complaining and accusing me, insisting that I was the one that said beef but I very clearly said I wanted chicken rendang not beef, he then said next time say more clearly in an angry tone. Your staff are rude and really unpleasant. Worst of all, the chicken rendang was not cooked properly and was raw, a real health hazard.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102778119224471464181/reviews
