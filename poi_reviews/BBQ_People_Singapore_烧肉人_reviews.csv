Emily White,4,"A restaurant with good quality and low price, less than $25 per person for four people and six dishes, which is more cost-effective. The taste of the dishes is ok, the sweet and sour pork ribs are not very tasty but the others are ok. The cold noodles are delicious, the environment in the store is noisy, and the smell of oily smoke is heavy, don't go if you mind",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110065644797576297846/reviews
Wai Sing Ong,5,"Food wise, okay lah‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt expect hotel level for the price. No service charge üòù

Drinks is self service (but need to pay later lah huh‚Ä¶)

The interesting part (or at least to me and my kids) is the egg around the pan‚Ä¶ kids love egg so the egg thingy is a welcome to both of them.

Service, in my humble opinion, is good. The lady is helpful in answering my wife‚Äôs question about the stir fried vegetables. (Cos not much of a crowd on Sunday night I guess)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102349796681873131701/reviews
C L Lim,4,Cheap and Good but restricted to their special fatty beef and fatty mutton. Others not too great. That dessert with red bean is great too. I took the garlic and green cut chili but not the lettuce cost worried about raw wet vegetables....,8 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107622652572837479988/reviews
Matthew Lee,4,"Interesting extensive mix of Chinese Dongbei style and Korean BBQ on menu. Reasonable prices makes this place hugely popular with the Chinese migrant community and fills easily as the evening progresses. Does get a little boisterous, so will not be the right spot for that romantic dinner date.

Food here is greatly satisfying. Who doesn't enjoy the ultimate combination of heaps of meat + plenty of booze? I especially enjoyed their in house made kimchi, still crunchy without being overly fermented.

Speedy service by the 2 friendly ladies in the dining room.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102172941439658597090/reviews
