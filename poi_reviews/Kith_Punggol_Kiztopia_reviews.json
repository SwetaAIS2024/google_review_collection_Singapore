      "text": "This branch is located next to Kidztopia, so it is very convenient if you wanted to have coffee or a meal while your kid is having fun.\n\nThe team and service is sincere and genuine, checking in if we were okay and always quick to respond to us.\n\nI thought the food was good value for money given the portion sizes! The staff was really helpful - they told us about the coffee card and special $88 deal for 6 mains so we saved a fair amount on our final bill!! All in all, I think this Kith branch is a great all-rounder - fairly priced, great coffees, tasty pastas, big portions and you can dump your kids at kidztopia ðŸ˜‚\n\nI can safely say they are a really decent choice given the other food options around! Will make it my weekend go-to for sure!",

Restaurant Manager, Mabel, was a gem as she went out of the way to ensure things go as smoothly as planned, from seats layout to food distribution and the service of the staff, who remained patient & helpful throughout. We received many compliments on taste of the food , including our 3yo who loved the kid meal pasta!\nKudos to the team who accommodated our many requests and ideas, and executing them to perfection.",
