      "text": "On the 26th of January 2025,\n, a concerning incident occurred during my family's scheduled photo session\nat Lilipop Studio (picture me), located at Suntec City level 3, #03-356. Upon arrival at the studio with my family of five, including my wife and three daughters aged 10, 14, and 18, we encountered a distressing breach of privacy that I feel compelled to bring to your attention.\nUpon entering the studio at approximately 1:55pm, we were directed by a male staff member to a large white curtained area for our photo session. Shortly after, my wife discovered a hidden camera in the changing area, which was both unexpected and distressing. This situation not only caused discomfort and embarrassment but also raised significant concerns regarding our privacy rights.\nIt is evident that the actions of Lilipop Studio (picture me) in directing clients to an area under surveillance without prior consent constitute a serious violation of personal privacy. Such practices are unacceptable and must be addressed promptly to prevent similar incidents in the future.\nAs a entian in intestigation in his pith breten. I am prechie do to regent adiren\ninformation or assistance required to address this issue effectively.\nFurthermore, I intend to pursue all available avenues to ensure accountability, including seeking support from relevant authorities and publicizing this matter through various media platforms if necessary.\nI kindly urge you to take swift and appropriate action to address this grievance and prevent the recurrence of such violations in the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is highly appreciated.",
