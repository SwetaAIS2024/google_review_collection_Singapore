      "text": "For the information of those who are not from Singapore, our coffee shops usually have multiple food stalls, each managed by different individuals. My review is based on my overall experience, although I will still highlight some stalls that I particularly enjoy.\n\nThe coffee shop has recently undergone renovations. I am unsure if there has been a change in ownership, but the service has definitely improved. For instance, even though it is a self-service establishment, the staff at the coffee stall still make the effort to go around and take orders for the convenience of customers. The prices of their drinks are also very reasonable. My son especially loves their \"Frappuccino-style\" Ice Milo.\n\nIn terms of food, my personal favorites are the mixed rice stall (or what Singaporeans call it \"cai fan stall\") and the curry noodle stall.\n\nThe zhir char (cooked-to-order) and prawn noodle stalls are also worth trying. As for the other stalls, I believe it depends on individual preferences. After all, one person's favorite may not be another person's cup of tea.\n\nOverall, this coffee shop is a great option for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.",

The portion I shown is $4 and it is not too small, just nice. It is better than other franchise wanton mee stalls whose portion is pathetic and wanton as just a smear of meat filling. Do try out this stall and support the lovely ladies.\n\nThere is also an Indian food stall that serves really good prata, dosa and briyani. Prata is crispy and soft, not chewy. Do try out the stall if you are nearby.",

The stall is manned by two petite ladies who work hard to churn out delicious bowls of wanton mee. Add on some fermented fried pork or a side of fried dumplings and wanton to zhng your meal.",
