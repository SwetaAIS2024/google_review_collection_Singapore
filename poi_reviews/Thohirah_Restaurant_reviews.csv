Ivan Teh,4,"Mee Goreng (SGD $9) @ Thohirah Restaurant.
.
Established in November 2005, this well-known fast-casual restaurant is a late night supper place.
.
Their rendition veers towards the 'dry' style, non-greasy, with yellow noodles tossed with bean sprouts, chye sim / Chinese flowering cabbage, chicken egg, potato cubes, beef slices, and red chili. Topped with a fried egg and cucumbers.
.
Has nice chewy soft tender crisp textures, with smoky grainy sweet salty meaty savoury vegetal spice eggy flavour.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114332345573544911646/reviews
KKT,3,"Average prata. Portion quite big.
Chicken mutaabak filled with dry chicken breast meat and quite bland. Bryiyani fried chicken thigh also quite dry, but rice is fragrant.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399770588752359508/reviews
Swee Teng Low,2,"The place is ok to dine in, there's even an aircon place.

We ordered 3 plain prata ($1.70 each), 2 egg prata ($2.70 each), mee goreng with no meat ($5.70, add $3 for beef or chicken), 10 satay plus ketupat ($1.20 per satay for beef, mutton or chicken, $1.30 per ketupat), 1 teh halia ($2). Sounded like quite a lot cause I broke down the prices one by one, but you can see for yourself in the photo. We wanted a light dinner, and the proportion was alright, but the price was not. It's too pricey to be $31.50 for only these.

Scores (purely based on taste and not taking price into consideration, which all scores would go down to 1 or 2 over 5)
Plain prata: 3/5 - I'm ok that the flour is a little tough and chewy, but may not be elderly friendly. Definitely not the kind to go for if you like crispy prata.
Egg prata: 3.5/5 - slightly better than plain prata in terms of flavour and texture with the help of egg.
Mee goreng: 4/5 - it's quite flavourful for a plain mee goreng with no meat, but some may find it spicy
Satay: 2/5 - dad says mutton meat too tough. Chicken meat was lean, but ok for me.
Ketupat: 2/5 - hard, not steamed thoroughly?

All in all, likely will go back again if the standard is like this.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104006423189756098729/reviews
J. Tay,4,"Typically prefer dum briyani but got the regular mutton briyani instead to save some money. Not a fan of their achar, it's kinda blend. Briyani rice, curry and mutton was good. There's a ""big"" piece of mutton but it's mostly bone with not much meat. Will be better if give more curry.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108850317457824409105/reviews
Kok Hwa Lim,4,"A great spot for plain and egg prata (flatbread) served with fish curry. The vegetable murtabak was the standout dishâ€”fluffy and generously filled with potatoes, onions, cauliflower, and button mushrooms. The mee goreng, though, was just average and didn't deliver the spiciness I was hoping for.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112550475450564989535/reviews
