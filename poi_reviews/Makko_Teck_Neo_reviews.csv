I W,3,"Whenever I come across Nonya food, I yearn for the taste of my late grandmother's (she is 100% Nonya) cooking once again. She was a great cook.

So I was hoping that Makko Teck Neo could be the one to blow my taste buds away.

Ordered their Ayam Buah Keluak, Babi Pongteh and Nyona Chap Chye.

Their dishes were on the salty side, especially the Ayam Buah Keluak ($18.90).  Strangely, I found a pork rib in my Ayam Buah Keluak.  The saltiness would have cancelled out the subtler flavours that I was expecting from Nyona dishes.

Their Babi Pongteh ($14.90) contained only 3 small pork ribs, so I can't shake the feeling that the dish is overpriced.  Their Nyona Chap Chye ($14.90) didn't contain dried shrimps, so was missing the umami that could have been there.

No, none of their dishes reminded me of my late grandmother's cooking.

Service was clinical.  No one was rude to me, but none of them were welcoming either.

The portion of rice ($2!!) served is less than in other places.

Overall, it is hard for me to be excited about this place.  I probably won't be returning anytime soon.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107686746966044708528/reviews
Gerry Sng,4,"Had a delightful chat with Makko during my visit today. Such a lovely and pleasant lady. Food taste quite authentic. Had nasi lemak, gado gado, kuih pie tee, ngoh hiang and dry mee Siam, with delicious desserts. We joked about making together nasi ulam for a special event in 4 years. Lol

Makko, kamsiah for the laughter.

GH,4,"We arrived just before lunch. While indoor tables were fully booked, the staff readily accomodated us with outdoor seatings.

Our Ayam Buah Keluak featured the Keluak flesh conveniently scooped out, making it easy to blend with the rich and subtly tangy gravy. The flavourful dish paired beautifully with the light and fluffy basmati rice.

A special Nonya Chap Chye braised in savoury coconut milk replaced the usual offering. The cabbage however was not as tender as we would have preferred.

The meal was overall enjoyable.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101252855469598813164/reviews
Leonard Chong,5,"Lunch dated 5 April 2025.
Not bad for everything.
Serving of dishes were quite prompt.
Maybe just the rice portion was small.
I especially liked the pork rib kiam chye tng.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101585984216350252104/reviews
L Chan,5,"Discovered this restaurant from the Old Taste Detective TV series & decided to try delivery. The food arrived on time & warm.
1. Bak Kueh (available only on weekends) – The filling is similar to Nyonya Bak Chang, it has a nice balance of sweet & savory.
2. Laksa Lemak (only available on Saturdays) – The coconut broth was rich & creamy, full of flavor.
3. Nasi Lemak – Made with basmati rice, it was fragrant & fluffy, a nice twist on the traditional.
4. Chendol – The palm sugar had a rich, deep caramel flavor, which complemented the coconut milk.
5. Ngoh Hiang – Well-seasoned with aromatic spices, it was full of flavor.
6. Mee Siam – The texture was good, with a balanced combination of spicy & savoury flavors.
7. Ondeh Ondeh – The skin was a bit too thick & there wasn’t enough syrup to ooze out when bitten.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116520472038541999281/reviews
