      "text": "A humble looking salad bar and cafe at TTSH Integrated Care Hub with excellent service and fresh salads.\n\nNice presentation too. The get-away spot for a comforting meal especially when we get too hungry. Located very close to the shuttle bus waiting area..We won't miss it. Worth checking out when in the area. It is well-known for the Baiye Tofu!\n\nI ordered a salad bowl mix-and-match to the ingredients I fancy and I was delighted.",

Tuna chuck (meat option) is a must order. Sides and meat are freshly made and the fruits options are sweet.\nGreat place to chill and the staffs are super friendly.\nI wish they will be opening a franchise at SGH ðŸ˜¬",

      "text": "Rena and her staff are friendly, helpful and meticulous when dishing up orders. The toasties (mushroom or chicken with melted cheese) on toast (white or wholemeal) comes hot, scrunchy & so yummy. The spiced tea (ginger, masala or cardamon) is slightly sweet, smooth and comforting. Together with a chocolate croissant or cinnamon swirl for dessert, what a delicious meal. Discount for Merdeka generation too. If you are feeling a bit down, the chicken soup for the soul beautiful images & wisdom scrolls on a loop on the large LCD TV on the far wall. Nice touch!",

      "text": "Friendly owner who explained how their salad bowl works. They have usual toppings (corn capsicum, various fruits) but echoing other reviews, the potato/spicy potato salad + black fungus are delicious! Meat toppings are shredded and I went for chicken which has an old school salt/pepper taste.\n\nOverall enjoyable. I also recommend the sparkling rose tea which is like bandung without milk. Space is quite quiet and comfy to, so may eat in next time",
