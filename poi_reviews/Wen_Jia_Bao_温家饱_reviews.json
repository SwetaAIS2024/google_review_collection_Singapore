      "text": "Huge pao, take away only.\nLocated in front side of People Park Complex, a very crowded and messy area with many stall food.\n\nThe paos are mostly covered under the fabric, which is good, although I thought it's not opened. Service is okay, just straight to the point, no pleasantry, broken language.\n\nThe pao though, very soulless.  Bland, tastes like nothing, bun tastes like a bleak future in dystopian novel. There is no enjoyment at all in eating this pao.\n\nIt's filling tho. I give you that. I believe it costs $2-2.5/3? I tried the pork one.",
