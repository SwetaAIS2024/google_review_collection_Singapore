Kimberley Howarth,5,"One of my favourite hypermarkets. They are enormous. So many products! You won't find much imported or European goods here, but in terms of local products it is amazing. I love the bath and body section, there is so much variety. Fresh food section is also excellent. Prices are reasonable... budget friendly. There is an ATM machine just outside the entrance which is convenient.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114957590885643931784/reviews
