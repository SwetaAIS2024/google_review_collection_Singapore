Better Better,5,"I finally found a vegetarian kway chup stall with a refreshing, herbal soup thatâ€™s truly satisfying. The braised egg is deliciousâ€”not overly strong in flavor but clearly made with care, unlike others Iâ€™ve tried. The fried bean curd is also excellent; itâ€™s perfect when eaten hot, but still tastes great even after cooling down. The pricing is very affordable and feels kind-hearted. Iâ€™ll definitely be coming back again!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114724505070513467673/reviews
Victor Ng,5,New vegetarian stall that open. They close about 7pm more or less. Some of the menu items can be ordered that are not displayed like Kway Chap and curry noodles (forgot the exact name). Best of all it is really affordable and need to be supported.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102828971930324493638/reviews
