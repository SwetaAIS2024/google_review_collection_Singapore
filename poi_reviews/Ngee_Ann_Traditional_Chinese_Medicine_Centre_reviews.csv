Marcus Ravon,3,Counter staffs were friendly and helpful compared to the many TCMs I had visited in the past. Old uncle physician was kind and patience but probably overwhelmed with patients. Not much remedy to my ailment after treatment...but caused the pain to worsen over the next few days. May not return again.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100775640361950229633/reviews

ES Tan,5,"I have been receiving Physician Tay's medical treatment for years. Mr Tay is very attentive and patient, besides his professionalism. He always gives relevant advices (on exercises, foods...) with clear explanations other than the necessary treatment. Remember that during one of my visits, I was the last patient on that day, he did not rush and took his time to perform full treatment even though it was past their office hours. One of the staff also waited patiently to see me leaving the clinic. So thankful, really appreciated 🙏🙏",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106398303340823792460/reviews
CK Chai,3,"Don’t ever go for the afternoon session if you cannot reach the clinic by 5pm  despite the registration cut off is 5.30pm as they have zero flexibility. And best part is, their clock runs faster than others. Reached the clinic at 5.32pm they told me is too late as they have already closed accounts. This I can understand but the clinic assistant told me it is already 5:45pm, I’m simply too late!?!! Totally speechless… 😂😂😂",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114402117111382848881/reviews
Dorothy Peck,5,"I agree with most that Dr.Tay is indeed very dedicated and professional in treating his patients.  He treated my son's sport injuries and even taught him some exercise to strengthen the affected areas. At times, he will be attending a few patients, some were there for cuppings while he perform tuina on another patient. He told me he sees a lot of stroke patients whom need more frequent treatments. It's no wonder his schedule is always packed till end of the day.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104862224773821933552/reviews
