noel aye,4,"My table tennis training hall; spacious, high ceiling, near to water point and power points if you plan to use robot. Table 4 and 7 are closest to the power points. The tables are average only, though. Table 7 is slightly better and it's net is also usable as of Apr-2025. It would be better to bring own nets for certain tables since the provided nets are not good. It could be quite hot in the afternoon and evening, also and some tables will reflect evening sun; slightly cooler in night time 7 to 10pm as of Apr-2025.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100571587233890832342/reviews
William,4,"The badminton court here is kind of old but relatively well maintained.

Location wise it's not that accessible as you would need to walk quite a fair bit from bus stop and even further from the nearest MRT station.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114916696399917166666/reviews
Jesse Woon,4,"Clean pool with a gradual depth from 1.4m to 4m and a good pressure to it. Clear water as well!

Various sports for children and my gal enjoyed the beginner volleyball sessions. Value for money at $130 for 12 lessons.

Do note that usual days/times are restricted to the public.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108879090914748300582/reviews
