Audrey Tan,5,Came at lunch time but sadly charsiew was sold out! Thankful for having tried it before. Roast meat is still as shiok as before which I highly enjoyed with the chilli and noodles. Yummy! Boss Edward also does delivery and glad to see him doing well. Chicken soup provided is made in house and is simple yet satisfying. Will be back when I'm in the area again!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100537510928931715089/reviews
Alexander Reinaldo,4,"Tender and Juicy Roasted pork, with just enough amount of fat. However, the Roasted duck bit harder and slightly smelly. Tried their Roasted Pork Noodle with small sides of Roasted duck for $8 (1st Picture). Will come again to try the famous char siew pork next time!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108446373348289716691/reviews
D L,4,"The roast pork is the best. Crunchy and tasty.
Char siew comes in second place. Gourmet quality.
White chicken is tender, but not so much my preference.
Chicken rice is a tad dry and hard, although fragrant.
Chicken soup is not bad.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104966613744701231932/reviews
Natasha Tjahjadi,5,"Tried this stall which is currently run by third generation hawker - the chilli packed a punch! 1 plate of charsiew shao rou fan is $5.

The highlight for me was the siew yoke, the skin was crunchy and lightly salted. The charsiew sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking, but still great anyway. The portion was pretty generous.

Expect to wait quite a bit as it's a 1 man stall. Kudos to the current owner for continuing such hawker heritage!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101744417641852989607/reviews
Johnny,5,"Succulent roasted meats at an amazing price, with great vibes to boot. Edward is the current owner (his grandfather started Happy World Roast). And the quality of his food is outstanding. He even has specials—his pico de gallo + wonton crisps are even better than some of the chips and salsa in California.

Recommendations:
Get the char siew. Folks love the crispy roast pork. My girlfriend loves the #8 chicken cutlet noodles.

Whatever you get, you won’t go wrong. But if they have roast duck, definitely go for the duck + char siew combo, before they sell out.

My only wish is for salad bowls or tacos! Alas, only as specials.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102509615995289423615/reviews
