Ivan Wu,5,"Good range of book. You can find many different type of subject. From engineering, to maritime related to books on info communication. Lots of study table. Very conducive place for study.
Need some space within the library for discussion? There are discussions room provided too.
Best of all, plenty of F&B option within walking distance. It recently has their first floor renovated with a new look. Check it out.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106945963575136807264/reviews
Jonathan is a good boy,1,Not sure why the hell you'll need a gantry to enter like a University's Library. Even NP's library does not have it. Library is also smaller here than NP with little studying spaces. NP has a plethora of studying spaces scattered across 4 huge floors.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109688425756406734376/reviews
