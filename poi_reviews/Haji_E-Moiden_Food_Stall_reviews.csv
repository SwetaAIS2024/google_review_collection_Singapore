Faizal Rahman,5,"Excellent customer service. Friendly and smiling at all times despite the pressure of the long queue of customers due to their popularity. 👍

Be prepared to be disappointed if you come late as they’re usually sold out by 10 am.

Objectively, the prata is really good as the dough is freshly made daily (unlike other prata stalls where their dough is bought commercially). It’s Crispy on the outside and at the same time moist & fluffy. Homemade taste indeed 👍👍👍

The Dalcha gravy that comes along with the prata is also one of the best that I’ve tasted. Not forgetting the dollop of Sambal Tumis that goes so well with this iconic dish.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103784146025651006794/reviews
Sirajuddin Jamat,5,"The best prata in town is right here!! Be prepared to queue for a bit but trust me it’ll be worth it! Affordable prata with the perfect texture and taste; right amount of crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Add a delicious scoop of sambal on the side, it’s like an icing on the cake. Staff are very friendly. Highly recommended if you’re a prata fan!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113481727480900530402/reviews
Ghafur Khan,5,"This is a must try limited edition prata. Served fresh from order, the prata is crispy outside and doughy inside. Not oily and it can be eaten on its own. The savory curry and sambal complete the meal. Will definitely come back for more!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104610599783291758847/reviews
