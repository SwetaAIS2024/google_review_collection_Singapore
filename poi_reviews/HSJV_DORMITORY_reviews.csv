Thomas Fong,3,"This place that I patronised is just a small canteen that sell mostly indian food, namely, L2 canteen. I was there together with a few of my colleagues in the afternoon, to have our lunch. It mainly caters to indian/bangladesh contract workers and others too. The prices there are quite reasonable.
