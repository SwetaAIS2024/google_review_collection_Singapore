Lard croutons were freshly prepared and gave it an added dimension in flavor department.\n\nA mixture of lean and minced pork, pig's intestine and liver. They were mainly slivers but cooked to perfection. Pork ball was flavorful with hint of preserved veg.\n\nLettuce leaves were crunchy and gave it a refreshing bite to it.\n\nSoup is tasty and flavorsome.\n\nI foresee myself being back very soon.",

Taste just like what i use to have back home in Melaka!\n\nTraditional black sauce noodles, and soup comes with minced pork, sliced pork, pork meatballs, pig’s liver and intestine. Not everybody will like the pig innards but to those that do, it’s cleaned well and really delicious.",
