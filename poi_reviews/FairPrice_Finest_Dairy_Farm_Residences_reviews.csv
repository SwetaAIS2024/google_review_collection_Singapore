CHIN ANG,4,"Latest 2023 mart as big as BPP
not a mega mart like Balestier
Lots of canned / processed varieties
not enough fresh greens / seafood

Roasts, cuts, cheeses & sushi here
ceiling type full glass freezer & latest gear
convenient waist high type push  trolleys
and newest checkouts (less frustrating)

Cozy aisles, friendly staffs
Missing German / Dairy Farm footprint
given its location in front of GESS / DF
needs crowd pull as not near MRT too
Lives long & prosper to serve community

TC K,1,"The quality of the Farm Fresh milk is anything but fresh, and is getting from bad to worse, and my experience is that the milk in 2 out of 10 bottles of Farm Fresh milk would be bad (few times became like bad yogurt) even opened 1 or 2 weeks from the expiry dates and kept at the top shelf of my new fridge.

Even for the other cartons which are not overly bad, they would not taste as good as before. Taste funny frequently like about to go bad.

I have switched completely to the more expensive but much more consistently good Magnolia milk which has been improved and is perfect for the espresso coffee I make at home. If you feel the thickness of the carton boxes of Magnolia milk versus that of Farm Fresh, you would understand why the Farm Fresh milk is often bad or borderline",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109681066620086116852/reviews
