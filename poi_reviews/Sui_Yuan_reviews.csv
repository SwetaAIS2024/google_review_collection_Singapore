Terry,1,"I will never go there again even if it's close from my home. The service is terrible and like everyone's review, the serving is horribly slow. I just ordered the small dish but it takes approximately 40min. and they started to cook when I ask what time should I wait more.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100082438286272204054/reviews
Min,5,"Want to lift the negative reviews from the naysayers. Quality is restaurant quality, but at a fraction of the price. A great local spot for Chinese classics. Yes they can get busy, but it's only one uncle that is cooking, but still haven't had a bad experience. Best food at dairy farm for sure",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113208206407487058746/reviews
Meng Lei,1,"Food is quite ok, but same as other low rate review, super super slow. Yeah, there is only 1 cook, but you should make by sequence, I wait 40 mins for my dishes and the other people come later than me already got there dishes. Also the price is not cheap, serving size also quite small.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108078084798071025858/reviews
