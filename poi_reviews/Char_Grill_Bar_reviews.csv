Stall : Char Grill Bar.
@ Coffeeshop : “Meet Up @ 203”, Blk 203 Hougang Street 21.

Alighted pax across the street at Kovan Residence and decided to come here for my favourite Steak 🥩: Prime Striploin steak of 200gm w/ Black Pepper sauce of Medium Rare w/ 2 side dishes : Onion Rings + Baked Potatoes 🥔 @ $12.80.

What’s so good 😊?
It’s sizzling sound as it’s served on Hotplate and upsized sauces as per requested and bottom w/ raw onions 🧅!

Onions as base to reduce the heat from the Hotplate to prevent over done ✅! But still it’s already near done … 😅😜

Always ❤️ this Char Grill Bar of this outlet that serves the better steak 🥩 w/ black pepper sauce ! 😮 🤩 ⭐️ 👍

It’s TGIF Cheers 🥂",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104330535068986683571/reviews
Eugene,5,"Good good quality with cheap price. Ordered their signature Char-Grilled Chicken chop for $6.90, there are 2 side dishes you can choose out of 11 options which I like the most,plus the vegetables are all fresh.
Also,they provide cutlery in a basket with a tissue paper on it.
Definitely my first choice of western food in Singapore.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103555157472622656687/reviews
