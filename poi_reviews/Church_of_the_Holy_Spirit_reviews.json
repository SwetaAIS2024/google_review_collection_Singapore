      "text": "My childhood church. I live about an hour away now, but I come back for Good Friday and Christmas Mass. I really love this place even though many things have changed. I moved away in 2009, and the community then was tight and thriving. I'm not sure about how it is now, but I brought non Catholic friends here (baptist/pentacostal) for those large masses, and they've also loved it! Love the way they do the hymns here, and the Glory to God entrance song is mad epic. It gave my friends goosebumps, haha.\n\nI think the only thing that I dislike would be how they changed the rustic stations of the cross wall statues/mounts to now cheap looking stained glass variations. It really looks bad. The anatomy is weird and there aren't enough fractals to make the stainglass look work well. Q_Q Same for the huge words Knowledge/Understanding etc on the lvl 2 glass panels. It kinda killed the regality and class of the whole place. But that's just my personal opinion.",
