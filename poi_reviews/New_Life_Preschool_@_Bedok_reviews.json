I have learnt a lot under the guidance of my mentor teacher Ms Frincess and also saw the passion the teachers have for their students.\n\nPersonally I feel their support for students is absolutely amazing and as a parent myself I didn’t know such supports were available in preschools until I joined them during my practicum. ❤️",

      "text": "I will be eternally grateful to Ms Wan, the principal, teachers and aunties at YWCA Bedok. They gave my son a second chance and have been extremely encouraging in all aspect of his growth. Their love and care shines through daily which helps him assimilate well into school life. It has been almost a month and we have seen so much improvement in him.\n\nFurthermore, it feels more akin to a family unit here. My son is currently in PG and the teachers from other classes welcome him with open arms as well. Notwithstanding that, the PG class and N1 class often mix together which is such a great idea. It allows the PG group to have older kids to learn from while the N1 class has younger kids to play with and giving them a sense of responsibility.\n\nI will definitely recommend YWCA Bedok to everyone I know.",
