Shraddha Rosie L,5,"Love to give 6ðŸŒŸ owner very friendly offer us samples when we couldnt decide which, end up buying most of what we love. Laksa Lemak has fresh lemak fragrant, rice noodle slips thru the fragrant gravy such a delight to the sense! Chicken curry has lovely creamy texture,  can really taste fresh ingredients, comes with noodle or rice and yummy homemade achar which we bought a bottle home, very home made flavour, not the commercial flavour, gotta eat it to know. We had coconut cake and coffee, tea for dessert, moist cake with lots of coconut flakes on a crunchie base.  Great service, nice friendly environment, air con, comfortable & clean.Highly recommended ! Yummy and Happy.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112229283896107460291/reviews
Kirby Ong,2,"Tbh - food was decent, laksa was alright, and rice was not bad, but attitude of the staff was bad and could be better.

They were largely unfriendly, mother-son duo and we did not felt even the slightest welcome to the store. They even stared as the group of 4 of us while we were sitting down and having the meal.

Eagerly clearing the dishes from the table and eyeing us again like hawks while we were finishing up our last drink.

Never again. Better food elsewhere with better service attitude",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106478715836090688001/reviews
K,5,"Yummy food. Very friendly uncle.

Recommended :
1) Laksa (thick soup)
2) Curry chicken noodle (yummy curry)
3) Prawn noodles (rich broth)
4) Nasi Kunyit (chilli is good)

Hard to rank the above, because all are so nice. Well cooked and rich taste. much nicer than the adjacent store where standards have dropped due to mass cooking.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109386738253826668143/reviews
Eng-Joo Gay,5,One of the best butter cake and borbor chacha I have tried ! Shop owner was extremely friendly and accommodating. He also offered us to try his banana cake which is also equally good! The butter cake is just nice and moist enough unlike most butter cakes which are too dry.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114363464857928905694/reviews
Amy Leong,5,"Came here with a friend to try their Mee Siam & Lemak Laksa, then uncle recommended today's special - curry chicken noodles. We weren't sure if we wanted that until he let us try a spoon of the curry sauce and we were sold. Both dishes were delicious and had great depth in the flavour which many Spore stalls sometimes lack in these highly spiced dishes. Uncle's customer service exceeds expectations and he made all customers feel so welcomed in his shop and happy to eat his food. Highly recommended!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103142785652194189755/reviews
