      "text": "I was looking for a sturdy rack to stack a dryer on top of my top loader washing machine. I needed a custom size since my service yard is small and I barely could fit the washer. I asked everywhere, and no one was able to do the custom rack. Racking.sg was the only one who was able to provide solution.\n\nI communicated with the staff solely by WhatsApp, which is very convenient. S/he was proactive and very patient to hear out the specs which needed to be precise as we had no room for error. It took awhile (2 months) but they delivered a rack that fit the spec 100%! Thank you racking.sg!\n\nBUT, if you are looking for a laundry stacking solution like me, it turns out some dryers can be wall-mounted and installed upside down. This ended up being the best solution and now I use the rack as added storage in my service yard. Still love the sturdyness of this rack!",

Racking and I make phone call enquiring - Mr Sakib is very helpful and explain in clear details for a suitable type of rack  that can fit my house and he is responsive and patient toward my enquiry. He even makes effort to WhatsApp me photos of their rack and introduce me a suitable one with a lot of patience and Iâ€™m super impressed with the fast delivery arrangement too, thanks again Mr Sakib",

They also provide submission services so I don't have to worry about all these issues while concentrating on my business. After the installation of the racking system, I have managed to store more goods (2.5 times) then ever before. Thank you Racking.SG!",

They not only have professional sales team who know their product well, their installation team also did a good job putting up the system for me.
