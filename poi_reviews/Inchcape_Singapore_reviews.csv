Wei Jie,5,"Had another great experience at Inchcape Toyota! My car servicing was completed within 3 hours. I was attended to by Mr Jayson Aguilar, who was very polite and took the time to clearly explain the servicing process and what needed to be done. On my way back to the reception, I noticed Mr Jayson personally wiping down my vehicle after the routine car wash — such impressive attention to detail. Truly an awesome and attentive service!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101347623182702930133/reviews

Gek Mui Ho,5,"I'm a Toyota car owner and recently it was very unfortunate that I have to make a third party insurance claim. As it was my first time, I was overwhelmed with making accident and police reports, Thomas Pang (Motor claims Assessor) came to my aid each time when I visited Inchcape Singapore. He was really helpful and patient, he guided step by step on what needs to be done and the information required. Although the outcome of the third party claim is unknown yet. I'm very grateful and appreciative of the help he has rendered. Thank you Thomas!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115581669143889916242/reviews
Marlene Lee,3,Have been sending my car here for service 8 years now. Car Service is good. Price could be better. Coffee machine for black coffee too bitter… although I’m a Americano drinker.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111488905286087650300/reviews
Jeff Thiam,1,"Send my car here for servicing. Service agent tried to push for unnecessary services such as aircon servicing, engine flushing, etc. Servicing price wise is already at premium compared to outside workshops. Not prepared to fork out extra premium for such routine job. If not for the warranty, would have gone to outside workshops. There are plenty out there. Also got to wait up to an entire day for the servicing to complete. Recommend car owners as far as possible, look for outside reliable workshops. There will be substantial cost savings and reduced waiting time.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105232939930866585514/reviews
