      "text": "I am writing to express my concern regarding the ongoing delay in the development of the project I purchased in January 2021. Unfortunately, the project TOP has been delayed since February 2024, with no clear timeline for completion, and there have been no updates provided by the developer.\n\nI visited the site recently to speak with the builder, who informed me that key collection may be possible by the end of this year. However, with just one week remaining until the end of 2024, I am becoming increasingly anxious, as I urgently need the keys to plan for my confinement. I have also attempted to reach out to OKP Holding multiple times via phone, but each call has been unanswered.\n\nGiven the significant delay and lack of communication, I am deeply concerned about the overall progress of this development. It has been nearly four years since my purchase, and as we approach 2025, I am still awaiting the keys. I am also doubtful that any compensation will be offered for the inconvenience caused.\n\nBased on my experience, I would strongly advise caution to anyone considering purchasing from this development.\n\nI sincerely hope to receive a prompt resolution, as the situation is becoming critical.",
