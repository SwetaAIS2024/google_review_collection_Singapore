Benjamin Tay,5,"I am writing to express my utmost gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional education and loving care provided by Learning Vision@NUH. The dedication and commitment of the team, led by Ms Marie & Ms Joyce have made a profound impact on our son's crucial early years. It is with fondness that we transition him to Learning Vision@NTFGH - solely due to logistical reasons.

The nurturing environment and thoughtful curriculum are outstanding; while the creativity infused into daily activities, coupled with a strong emphasis on social-emotional growth has contributed immensely to our sons confidence and eagerness to learn. We have witnessed remarkable progress in his cognitive and social skills, thanks to the efforts and expertise of your educators - namely teachers Adrienne, Riz, Syahirah, Monica, Cai Jing-Han ËÄÅÂ∏à and Wang Yi-ShanËÄÅÂ∏à. It has been a joy watching him grow under you team's guidance.

Thank you for fostering a safe, stimulating, and inclusive space. The love and care he receives is written in the big smiles he always wears at the end of each day. We wholeheartedly commend LV@NUH for its unparalleled commitment to early childhood education.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106792408774970443025/reviews
