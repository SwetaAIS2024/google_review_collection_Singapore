      "text": "Post Review Update:\nI am heartened to know that Safra Tampines Management takes proactive actions against reviews and feedback. They have responded to me and will step up on their cleanliness. Glad to give them a try again in the near future.\n\n________\n\nRented their bbq pit. Disappointed the pit wasn't clean properly with greases on the floor. Managed to get cleaner to clean up before using. They have grill and bbq but their grills is super dirty. I don't even consider using.\nThe door to the pit is faulty. Hard to open. Signage that one side is faulty only paste indoor but outdoor side not pasted. People thought it was locked.",

      "text": "Had an enjoyable experience at SAFRA Tampines this morning, for a combined location run alongside various SAFRA Running Club members that brought us to Bedok Reservoir Park and back. The facilities are great here, especially the Theatrette perfect for talks and engagements. All staff are helpful and professional. The showers and toilets are clean too. Ample carpark space when we arrived in the morning too. Thank you! üôèüèª",
