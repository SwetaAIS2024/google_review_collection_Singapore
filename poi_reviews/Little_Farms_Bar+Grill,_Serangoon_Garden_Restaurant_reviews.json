      "text": "We were a party of 5 and had a lovely time dining at Little Farms. We especially enjoyed the outdoor seating ‚Äî it was a great setting to relax and enjoy our meal. The food was delicious! The salmon was beautifully done and a definite favourite at our table. The avocado quinoa was another standout ‚Äî all the ingredients were super fresh and full of flavour.\n\nThe pork rack came in a generous portion, so it‚Äôs great for sharing. However, we personally prefer a bolder seasoning, so we might skip this next time. The beef, on the other hand, was excellent ‚Äî tender and flavourful, and the fries were perfectly crispy without being dry.\n\nSpecial mention to the service staff ‚Äî they were very friendly and cheerful throughout. Even though it was clear they were a bit short-handed, they still maintained a positive attitude and made us feel well taken care of.\n\nAll in all, a great dining experience with fresh ingredients, lovely ambience, and warm service. We‚Äôll definitely be back!",

Even though price slightly higher than other local cafes but with such service & food qua won‚Äôt mind to come back again.

The lightning and atmosphere also nice for being sweet sweet with the loved one.\n\nThe only thing wanted to comment is the speed of food serving.... We waited for around one hour for the appetizer, another half an hour for our main. And finally another 20 to 25mins for our desserts... The serving speed way too slow üòî.\n\nAnyway, might give it one more try during non peak season.",

      "text": "Located in the corner of MyVillage, the place offers outdoor seating with fans. Might not be the best to hang out on hot or rainy days.\nOrdered the smashed burger, tomato soup, cauliflower chicken rice and a chocolate lava cake.\n\nTomato soup had a strong herb infusion.. I think it's basil. But the tangy flavor made it rather appetizing . It was served with a few slices of bread. (Server also gave the option of sour dough as well)\n\nCauliflower chicken rice was great. It's a twist on our local steamed chicken rice. Very big portion in my opinion. The chicken was tender and moist. One of the best I've had. The ginger sauce on the side was an awesome compliment to the chicken. Cauliflower rice was tasty and not too mushy.\n\nSmashed burger came with salad on the side and a heap of fries! (Wasn't able to finish them!) the beef patty was slightly on the thick side but overall was not bad. But would probably try the other items on the menu if we do visit again.",
