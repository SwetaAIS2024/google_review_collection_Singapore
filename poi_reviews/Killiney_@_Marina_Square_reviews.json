      "text": "Kinda mixed with this cafe. Maybe because it’s new. The curry tasted great with enough savouriness to it. My curry had many balls of flour clumps in it however so I wasn’t able to finish it all. Coffee is good as always and service was decent. It’s situated in the long corridor heading towards Marina Square so having a lively cafe helps the corridor space to gain some traffic. Decent decor",

Also, the promo cannot be used together, so take note ya...\n\nMee siam $6.80 normal taste. Lime was not cut abit so had to bite into it to squeeze the lime juice out.\n\nPenang char kuay teow has big pieces of prawns but are frozen ones. Have wok hey.\n\nTo avoid lunch crowd, go before 12pm.",

The cashier did not bother to clarify as well. Should consider to update the wording to avoid misunderstanding.\n\n+ 1 of my order was missed.",
