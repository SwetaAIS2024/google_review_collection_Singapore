Jonavan Lee,4,"Food was great! Interesting local twist to the dishes too. The Tom yum prawn pasta had a great creamy broth that wasn't too spicy & the prawns were fresh & succulent. Pork chop fried rice was great as well. Crispy fried pork cutlet & the fried rice was really fragrant. Also love their ha chiong gai (prawn paste fried chicken) with mala sauce. Gives the traditional dish a unique spicy kicküëçüèº They don't charge GST or service charge so prices are really reasonable. The only glaring thing lacking is service. I think they're kinda jaded of humans & try to have 0 interaction. When forced to interact, they talk like a robot with no warmth or welcome. I guess they've been worn out by entitled & demanding customers in the past so they put no effort now. But a lil' effort & a lil' smile could go a long way & I hope they find the light within themselves to do just that somedayüôèüèº",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102582766424036554780/reviews
Cristina Ng,5,"One of the best fried rice in Singapore.
The Japanese garlic fried rice is light on the palette, not really oily and pleasing to eat till the end.

Portion is huge as well, suggest to share 1 fried rice for 2 pax.

They are generous with the garlic. Definitely recommend üëçüèª",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113797532339619563755/reviews
Christopher Choo,5,"Delicious pasta at affordable prices.

Ordered the Tom Yum pasta and it was really good. Not overly spicy with a nice tom yum flavour, and plump juicy prawns. Pasta was done well, not too soggy with a nice bite.

Have indoor and outdoor options with paynow, paylah and cash payment modes. Accessible area as well.

Overall, recommended place and will go back again to try other food.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106303798238081979222/reviews
LP Pua,3,"A small dark restaurant under a HDB block. Service was kind of cold, but not rude nor friendly. Ordered a beef steak, that came with a large portion of fries. Steak was bland and the saving grace was the steak sauce, which is the best I have came across. Fries were above average. Overall, some hits and some misses.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
