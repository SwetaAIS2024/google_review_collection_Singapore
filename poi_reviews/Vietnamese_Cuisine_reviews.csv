SuperShy Gel,5,"A truly authentic Vietnamese food stall in the heartlands, at Ang Mo Kio Blk 531 coffeeshop. At its price point, the value of food and quality of ingredients are extremely hard to beat.

The Pork Noodles ($7) are amazing.

Pork Sandwich/Bahn Mi ($6) is a simple affair but generous in meat portion. Definitely still moist and flavourful.

Iâ€™ll be back for more.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104772022056749613637/reviews
Lijun Yang,4,"Ordered Beef Pho, portion is alot, but priced slightly expensive for food court food at $7. I don't personally fancy beef as it is an acquired taste for me. But I find the beef acceptable. No beefy taste and I can chew down and swallow a huge chunk without feeling nauseous.

Soup base on the sweeter side for me, otherwise will highly recommend if you like minty and light tasting soup.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118102187834430930720/reviews
Jeremy Khoo,5,Delicious and authentic Vietnamese dishes in a coffeeshop. All 3 were yummy especially the rice paper rolls which were deliciously paired with the generous dipping sauce. The pho and bahn mi were also packed with meat and justified the slightly higher police point for coffeeshop fare. Lots of other Vietnamese dishes on the menu to try next!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101975552015179312270/reviews
Terence Chan,1,"Beware: no price list. Owner charges whatever amount she deems fit.

Bought pork noodles once or twice. Always faced with very bad attitude from both the younger and older female vietnamese ladies. Only the Chinese guy working there is polite. No choice as this is the only vietnamese place in the area to satisfy cravings.

Today was the last straw. Faced with the usual bad attitude and was charged $10 for the above meal which was prepared in 30secs.

Most vietnamese people I've met have been so friendly and warm. Quite sad that these people come to Singapore for a better life and instead start to cheat and abuse Singaporeans.

Will stop patronizing this stall from now on.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100111982760388613342/reviews
