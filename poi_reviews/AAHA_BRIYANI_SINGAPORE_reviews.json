But the owner (father) is really friendly and hospitable.\nWas happy to try their special  thosai, which is a pancake with shredded chicken, the combi of curry and yogurt enhances the already flavourful Dish.\nMy buddy had the mutton Bryani, the rice is not the normal Basmati, but it's very well cooked woth various spices, and a good amount of mutton.\nReccomended!\nDo check out of the timing, prata and normal thosai is available in the morning and evening.",

Dosa is nicely crisped and holds its shape, and the sambar and chutney taste fresh and homely - I polished them up (which is not usually the case)! Weather was cool this morning but still sunny so I had my meal outside and it was lovely. Staff was friendly and efficient! I am glad to have found this place as the other dosa option in this area hasn't been great - hope they upkeep the quality of the food. I am gonna check out their prata and biryani next.",
