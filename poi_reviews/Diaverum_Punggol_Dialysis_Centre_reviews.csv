Crystal Ang,5,Nurses are very kind here! My father is a challenging patient who visits this dialysis centre for his regular dialysis and the Nurses are very patient and kind to him. Dialysis is properly done here and my father has no complaints about their services here! Thank you 🙏 to the Nurses who have put in their heart to make dialysis a lot more pleasant for the patients and the family of the patients!! Really appreciate the good work!,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102706177551417725845/reviews
