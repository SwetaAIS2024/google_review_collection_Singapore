Fish paste noodle was best dish, did not seems to be found easily else where. Meat selection was great. I feel everything was generally sweet, not sure if itâ€™s just sugar or some seasoning. Drinks are reasonably price. Expect to wait during peak hours.",

Service was prompt but maybe due to busy timing, at multiple times the service staff literally threw the empty gas can into the waste bin which lead to loud noise. This was quite unpleasant. I hope the Operator can look into this. Other than that, it's a great place to dine.",
