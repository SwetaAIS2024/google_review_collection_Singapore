CT Seow,1,"Always a fan of Zus but I had a very disappointing experience at this Zus Cafe. The staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. The coffee was bland and tasteless. When I ordered food and requested for it to be heated, I was told they couldn’t. I had ordered donuts and waffle in the morning—how can they expect kids to eat cold food early in the morning? Cold and dry straight from the fridge. It's worst then i just buy from a petrol station. When I asked for a plate, the staff handed it over reluctantly, as if it was a hassle. Overall, the service and quality were poor. I won’t be coming back.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116928956025907040981/reviews
Francesca Tang,1,"The female barista on duty is attentive . But I believe the manager needs to lead by example . I saw one seem like a manager ( female ) openly turn on her phone speaker watching some stuff for a while. If she is not the staff , then perhaps employee shall be empowered to do something about this .

I come here often but today is really bad . They played HOUSE / Techno music in the morning , imagine you come here for coffee fix you end up having headache having to listen to the pounding music in a supposed to be relaxing coffee shop .. is this part of the branding ?",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116829274612950766108/reviews
Hayley Hayley,1,"We’re big fans of Zus Drinks, but we had a disappointing experience at this branch. They only accept cash, which is really inconvenient. On top of that, the staff were unfriendly and acted arrogantly when we asked if we could add more banana syrup to our Banana Spanish Latte. This isn’t the level of service we expect from Zus.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118170901132888234393/reviews
Sresah Letchumi,5,"Recently I went to Zus outlet inJB  . I tried one of the drinks Diarshana’s service was outstanding—polite, knowledgeable, and  on time. I tried one drink and was so nice. I went back that night  to get two more drinks. Now, I’ve tried all the brownie collections—everything was amazing. Thank you Diarshana, for the wonderful drinks .",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100689919546533470468/reviews
eric tey,3,"Having at least one cup of coffee a day has become essential in my routine, and ZUS coffee, a local brand, has been my favorite in recent years. Each morning, after dropping off my kids, I stop here for a cup of coffee to start planning my day.

However, I’ve noticed the barista’s attitude is consistently cold—just a nod, without conversation, and it’s been this way every time.

Suggest that management consider additional customer service training, especially on creating friendly, welcoming interactions.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108261336395711991609/reviews
