The other time was the burger I received, it was so cold until the slice of cheese inside was not even melted. Anyway back to now, the fries were cold. Why were the fries cold? Isn't it freshly scooped out? This is dine in by the way, not take out or delivery service.",

      "text": "Today I witnessed this manager being rude to a rider. The rider just asked how long have to wait. At first it was the lady at the counter that replied rudely to the rider but then this manager stepped in. He said they prioritise take away, does that mean the people who order online is not of priority? So not all customer are equal?\nNot only that he said LOUDLY at the rider that the rider is causing a commotion but in actually fact both of their tone of voice is the same.\nI normally order online too and today I understand why Burger King is always slow when ordered online.\nManager is sneaky and tried to pin the blame on rider. Such terrible attitude I will not eat here ever again.",

      "text": "After self-ordering at the kiosk, the manager informed the order would take 45 minutes to 1 hour which is ridiculous for fast food. Asked the manager for a refund and suggested that he should have let customers know before ordering. He claimed he did inform others who ordered before me. While the manager expedited my order eventually, during the 10 minutes I waited for my order, I did not see other customers being warned about the long wait. Also checked Grab and noticed the branch continued to accept delivery orders despite being understaffed. I do not think it is fair to make customers (whether walk-in or delivery) wait so unreasonably long just because the branch has poor manpower management. Also no excuses for such an establishment to have manpower issues when itâ€™s been in business for years.",

      "text": "Easily one of the better Burger King outlets in SG. This outlet just recently opened and there was an opening special deal which was really value for money. The seats are quite limited but I did not have an issue finding a vacant seat during off-peak hours. The food quality is pretty good and delicious. The service was quick with no problems. However, the wastebin was not really user friendly as I felt the bin was designed quite poorly, which took a longer time to clear the rubbish. Overall, the cleanliness of the outlet was alright and would come back again if I am nearby.",

      "text": "Quite a comfortable burger king outlet. The limited time cheesy spinach burger was great. It was actually a spinach and cheese filled patty on top of either chicken or beef patty. The whole burger was crunchy and paired well with the lettuce and raw onion. The fries were cold but then still crispy. Love the new chilli packet which was super easy to pour. Other than the pricier burger, everything else was pretty good.",
