She was recommended by our gynae Dr Claudine, just around the corner.\n\nShe‚Äôs able to put parents at ease and so far has been great in treating our kid.\n\nMy recommendation is that a proper queue management system should be invested in, something that can least give a number or phone call to prevent parents waiting around. This should be a key consideration given the amount of intermingling happening at the waiting area.\n\nDr Grace is a good PD but the admin management should definitely be improved on üëç",

For that, we paid close to $300. There was NO medication given.\nSo normal and usual, why is the bill so high?\n\nNot sure why the doctor was highly reviewed or if the reviews were paid.\nThe doctor gave off a laid back vibe that she is just there to earn your money and couldn‚Äôt give more thought to anything else.",
