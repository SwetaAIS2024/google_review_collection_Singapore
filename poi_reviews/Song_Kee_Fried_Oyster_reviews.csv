Jeff,1,"Used to be a big fan of this place but how the standards have dropped. There was a time the starch was fried till partially crispy whilst the rest was sticky and almost chewy. But now‚Ä¶ to save time‚Ä¶ the chef essentially dumps the egg with the starch into the egg mixture making there little to no starchy parts.

Also, the cook uses his hands to scoop the oysters and the sauces which is kinda I believe or should be a health violation‚Ä¶",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101763540896756605183/reviews
Trotting Horse,5,"Love this stall as their oyster omelette is fried till crispy, even with the starch. So the texture is a mix of egg crisp and starch. üëçüèº their oysters are also fat and juicy, definitely slightly larger than most hawker stalls standard.

Be prepared to queue for it during peak hours, even weekday evenings.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114960726223703734828/reviews
Ivan Teh,5,"Fried Oyster Omelette (SGD $5) @ Song Kee Fried Oyster.
.
Queues to order at this popular stall can stretch up to 30 minutes, more so now that they've gained a Michelin Bib Gourmand award.
.
Their rendition has a nice helping of small but juicy fresh oysters, bursting with briny sweet salty flavour.
.
The mix of gooey crisp potato starch and fluffy egg, topped with crisp parsley, carries smoky eggy sweet savoury herbal salty flavour. They cook it slightly wet, with a bit of gravy.
.
The lime infused chili has a good zesty tangy sour spicy kick, lingering on the palate.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114332345573544911646/reviews
WS Lim,3,"06/10/24
Overrated. Can hardly find any oysters within the egg. Even if there is one, it is pathetically small in size. Taste wise is just average.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104258555113765533217/reviews
Victoria Martin,5,"The oysters are super juicy and they are quite generous with them - don‚Äôt have that dirty taste or grainy texture. Love their very tangy chilli (could literally drink it). A little on the pricey side but I guess no one is immune to inflation. But it‚Äôs so good, highly recommend!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103026680623602309072/reviews
