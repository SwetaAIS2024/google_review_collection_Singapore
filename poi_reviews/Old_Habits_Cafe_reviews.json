Delicious. I had the pasta and it was full of flavour. The staff? Friendly, attentive, and made us feel right at home.\n\nA hidden spot with both soul and taste. Will definitely be back!",

For the price and vibes, it deserves 5 stars.\n\nThe only inconvenience is a little far from the nearest subway. Suggest bus or cab.\n\nNicely located next to a walking trail up Mount Faber. After a heavy meal, you can burn it off üòâ.\n\nKudos for the nostalgia stomach-filling experience.",
