Daniel Martínez Guerrero,4,"A solid spot for casual drinks with friends or colleagues after work. I’ve been here a couple of times and always had a pleasant time. The bar is spacious, so it never feels too crowded, and there’s a relaxed vibe that’s perfect for unwinding.

Happy hours are a nice bonus, and they have live music on Fridays and Saturdays which adds to the atmosphere. Drinks are reasonably priced, and there’s a good selection to choose from.

Food-wise, it’s not the main attraction – best to stick to the basics if you're feeling peckish. One odd thing to note: there’s no in-house toilet, so you’ll need to use the mall’s restroom on the second floor, which can be a bit inconvenient, especially for the ladies.

All in all, it’s a great place to chill with friends, enjoy some music, and grab a drink or two without breaking the bank.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117518282101099921100/reviews
Joyce Lee,5,"The lunch set came with appetizer and dessert. With the add on for beverage makes a filling lunch for all of us. The homemade lemon tea is really good. This was the only restaurant open in Orto Mall for lunch (opposite Haw Paw Villa). The service provided by the staff is excellent, super efficient and attentive. The food service was very fast as well.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111319478928757387578/reviews
Joe C,2,"atmosphere at coastal acoustic was good and the staffs were attentive.

not too crowded on a weekday evening. calamari starter was delicious. however, the main was a  dissapointment. we ordered the steak medium done, but it was too cooked. pork chop was below average, only the mash potatoes were good.

2 main + calamari for $96, prices a bit steep.

maybe will return for happy hours and other dishes next time.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108094531333234585895/reviews
Paul Toh,5,"Really like this place. Good food, great vibes. The singing was great but the music can do with maybe a better percussive instrument.
Highly recommend the truffle and maple chicken.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110110584107240453374/reviews
