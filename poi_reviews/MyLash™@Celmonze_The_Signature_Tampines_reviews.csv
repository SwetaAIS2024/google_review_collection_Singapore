S.T. Tan,5,"I worked with Elaine from Tampines outlet for a set of misty brows. She was friendly, meticulous and forthcoming when I asked her questions on the products used for the session. I am really pleased with my brows and appreciated how she did not do any promotions during the session, but focused on the brows. I returned to do the classic lashes three times after and also mostly enjoyed my time there. Thank you Elaine and team for the kindness and spectacular service!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102011505265918700880/reviews
