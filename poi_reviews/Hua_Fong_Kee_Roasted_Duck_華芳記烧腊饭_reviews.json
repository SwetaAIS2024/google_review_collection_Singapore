For $7 for a whole meal without an MSG reaction, it is definitely a treat for me!! I just have to abstain the soup just in case ☺️. Oh i should end that i come early but i see lots of folks taking away too! I am glad that the servers speak English too though they start with Mandarin always!",

Great service from each and everyone except 1 old uncle.\n\nReview 2018, 3 stars\nService is not as good as in 2017. Sometimes they will ignore you even you waited at their stall. Always failed to provide what I asked for, extra chilli despite telling and reminded twice each time I ordered. They simply ignored my requests. I have stopped patronize since. The only thing they are good at are asking you for payment first.",
