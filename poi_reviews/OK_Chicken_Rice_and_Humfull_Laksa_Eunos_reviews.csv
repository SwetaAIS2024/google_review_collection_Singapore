Albert Foodie,5,"The chicken texture is smooth and tasty
The laksa soup has rich coconut flavors. Not too impressed with their fried items. Overall very good chicken rice and laksa",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103770328622099236282/reviews
Keng Fai,2,"Nothing fantastic. Humful Laksa only a name doesn't reflect on the amount of hum in the dish. Noodles also not cooked well. Clumped together and stick together. Wondering what was I eating.

For $6.50 can get much better laksa with more Hum at many other places.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109358264531479235776/reviews
josh li,1,"Roast chicken both meat n rice were dry, soup heavily laced with msg n still tasted terrible.
Chicken cutlet laska soup not hot enough with noodles undercooked.
Only cash or paynow accepted although multiple modes of payment stated.

Yiting Goh,5,Excited to try this stall. Menu looks interesting with different varieties of laksa. Food looks appetising with generous amount of ingredients. Stall owner was friendly and provided recommendations. Seems like they won a few awards too. Yums!,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106000364874298085074/reviews
YX,2,"All the 5 star reviews are because they give a free meal for 5 star review. I got chicken porridge + egg - $6. It was so salty, they added way too much soya sauce it tasted nothing of chicken. Had to take off top layer of porridge, probably should have rinsed my chicken too.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106250851825179038253/reviews
