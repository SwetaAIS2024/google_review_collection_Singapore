The portions for the popcorn chicken was a little small but fried well, cheese fries is your classic side, more cheese would’ve been great. A satisfying lunch!",

      "text": "Recently ordered their fish and chip and grilled fish to try. Well I am quite impressed and it was quite good especially the grill fish that it was cooked well and has flavor with the brown sauce. Fish and chip is typical but both portion size may be small doe most people.\n\nOrdered chicken spaghetti with cream sauce and spring chicken whole to try. The spaghetti noodle was well cook not too soft, chicken is bland like poach in water and throw into the spaghetti to cook. The cream sauce lacks flavor and not rich, a bit running. However the chicken was good, loved their crispy skin that is packed with flavours and not oily. Worth trying their fried spring chicken!",

End up lady got the order before me.\n\nWent to ask the cashier a male, how come take so long. Give me theory lesson that fried chicken wings takes longer to cook than fried fish.\n\nWow. Lor wonder my 3 pieces chicken wings was overcooked n had random black patches\n\nThanks not coming back. Service sucks like the food.\n\nThose ordering from grab, its the same male chef cooking your sometimes under or overcooked fish/chicken. If a chef cant be consistent what he puts out, wonder how he survive so long.",
