Cheryl Leong,5,"My father and I chanced upon Amazing Hearing at Chinatown Point and decided to walk in for a consultation. Ms Ivy was incredibly patient and thorough, taking the time to explain the hearing aid models best suited for my dad’s profound hearing loss. She was not only knowledgeable, but also caring and empathetic — giving us the space and time we needed to consider our options and budget without any pressure.

When we returned, Ms Ivy was just as warm and professional. She reassured us that we could reach out anytime for assistance and arranged regular follow-up sessions to ensure everything was going smoothly.

Finding a hearing care provider we feel truly comfortable with hasn’t been easy — it’s a long journey that requires trust and ongoing support. I’m very happy and relieved that my dad is now in capable and compassionate hands. :) Thank you so much!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100036258799943123213/reviews
Elyse Ma,5,"I visited Amazing Hearing for a hearing aid checkup. Ivy provided a thorough explanation regarding a minor malfunction, confirming that the issue was unrelated to the Resound device and that my current hearing aid was functioning optimally.  I also had a trial run with the latest Resound model, during which Ivy expertly highlighted the key differences between the new and old models.  The experience was excellent, and I will certainly return to Ivy for my next purchase.  She is a highly skilled and professional audiologist.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108003092296581955186/reviews

Charlotte Ching,5,"Appreciate Ms Ivy provides caring and personalise service today. She patiently explained to my mother what can the Hearing Aid do for her. Ms Ivy did her best to adjust the hearing aid according to my mother’s feedback.
Her explanation made my mum better understanding what can the remote control do, besides increasing sound volume.
Thanks",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103161573490882336816/reviews
