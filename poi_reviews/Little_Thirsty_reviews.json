      "text": "I recently visited Little Thirsty at Changi Road, and it was a great experience overall! The ambiance was cozy and inviting, perfect for a casual hangout. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the service was quick. I tried their fried pork and was impressed by the unique flavors and quality making it the best pairing complement the drinks.\n\nDuring the happy hour the Guinness is going for 2 for $24 as well.\n\nOverall, a solid spot for anyone looking to unwind with great drinks and a chill vibe. Will definitely return!",

Your hospitality and friendliness will never be forgotten. A breath of fresh air to receive the service we experienced tonight. In addition to Kenny’s top notch service service, the food was incredible! Highly recommend the bangers n mash and the fish and chips along with the platters! My husband also loved his smash burger! There wasn’t a single thing that we didn’t enjoy. I cannot wait to be back for another phenomenal experience! 10/10 for sure!!",
