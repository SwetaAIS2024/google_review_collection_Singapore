Only downside is the place isn't well ventilated especially with the evening sun shining in.\n\nBut overall, the food is almost comparable to those from golden mile. A good Thai place to recommend to those who stay in the East!\n\nThey abit old school and can't speak good English and won't issue you a proper receipt or order chit. But they won't cheat you don't worry!",

      "text": "Friendly service. Food is good and authentically Thai. Love the tomyum soup, flavorfully rich and not too sour. Thirsty after that but I'll still come back from it ha. I enjoyed the kailan with salted fish too but might be too overpowering for those who do not like salty food. Not very cheap considering it's neighborhood coffee shop, most dishes are priced at average $10. Cash or PayNow payments only. Will be back to try other dishes.",

      "text": "The food is authentic Thai. They used to operate in Golden Mile. It's in the Kim San Leng coffeeshop in the back of the carpark shared by NTUC at blk 138 and the Tampines Council building.\nCome try it out! I usually buy it home.\nRemember to ask for less spicy if you're not up to Thai levels of spicy!\nMy go-to's are the crab fried rice, creamy tomyum soup, larbmoo and the basil fried rice with pork.\nParking is super easy and it's a quiet corner so if u don't like crowds, this place is perfect. Although I only go on weekdays. I read the weekends they're very busy. Why not enjoy with ease on week nights üòä\nAtmosphere is 3‚òÜ bec it's a coffeeshop - bonus ‚òÜ bec the drink stall makes excellent sng boi chui üòä",

      "text": "(Updated). Round for second try. Most stalls at Tampines Round Market are closed in the evenings. Mum Beer is open from 8:30 am till 8:30 pm. Staff are busy but polite, Takeaway basil rice - well, I'm not sure how authentic it is. The pork was quite spicy (I guess that means authentic), but too spicy for me and there wasn't that richness of flavour that I get from other stalls. Fried egg topped on rice mixture, as per picture. Second round was Thai style satay and mango salad. Salad was a little spicy but not, I think, as spicy as Thai's would like it! Satay pork was different to our local Malaysian/Singapore satay - minced pork patties on a broad spatula. But overall very pleasant, and the salad was a cut above that from Nakhon Kitchen (but prices were the same).",
