Dr. Joel impressed me with his deep expertise and calm professionalism. He took the time to explain each step thoroughly and made me feel completely at ease throughout the consultation.\n\nThe clinic staff are equally outstanding. Xiaoxin, Divya and Catherine were incredibly efficient and helpful, making the whole process smooth and seamless. A special mention goes to Xiaoxin, whose warm and nurturing demeanor makes it all the more pleasant. She has a gentle way of making clients feel cared for, a rare trait to come across in any industry!",
