Muhamad Rizduan,3,"Order Some food for breaking fast for family, received 2x Nasi Fish Belado instead of 2x Nasi Sambal Goreng Fish. As Nasi ambeng beef, potato cutlet already taste sour as it already spoilt. Only satay are acceptable, peanut gravy are good, satay not over burnt. Hope they would double check the order before food was out for delivered",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108518752580394775068/reviews
thomas gian,1,At first I thought this was a piece of beef skin in my beef rendang but it's a whole ass plastic bag cooked together with the beef  rendang. I've seen review of bugs and hair in the food. But this is the first time I got an entire bag of broken down plastic in my food here is the example. Take care of yourself out there.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107887457996939903809/reviews
Lydia W,4,"Have been here several times since it opened. My favourite is the Nasi ayam grepek with cabe ijo. It comes a piece fried chicken cutlet, fried tofu, deep fried leaves and chicken rice. I have never had ayam grepek before (or cabe ijo), and so I can't compare if this is authentic or not, but I enjoyed this dish very much and have ordered it many times. I have also tried the red sambal version, but it was too spicy. The cabe ijo is milder and sweeter.

I have also ordered their Ayam Penyet several times. It is delicious - but I won't consider it as authentic ayam penyet. More like a very good fried chicken thigh with rice.

The Nasi Lemak sets are decent. Tasty and well seasoned.

The also serve other asian food like sweet and spicy fish with rice, fried laksa and basil chicken rice. But I don't order them because they can take a really long time to be served. I have seen my colleagues waiting 30+ mins to be served after all the other food has arrived. Which brings me to the cons - the serving time is very erratic depending on what food you order. The air con is weak and the seating is squashed and awkward. This place started out as mainly delivery with the dine-in portion tacked on like an afterthought. But the food is good and the prices are decent.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114298584666245829355/reviews
Choon T,5,"I was recommended to this satay place recently. I've passed by this restaurant several times but didn't really caught my eyes.

I ordered their chicken satay ($0.80 per stick) and nasi lemak. The satay didn't disappoint and a nice smokey taste to it. Their peanut sauce was full of peanuts and you can see the chunk peanut bits in there. It's not too spicy and not too sweet.

The nasi lemak was pretty good as well. The beef rendang was tasty, a little softer would be nice. Their sambal chilli was slightly sweet for me.

Overall, an awesome meal. I'll be back to try other dishes.

Back several times to tabao satay home over the last few months and finally managed to sit down at the restaurant for meal today.

Tried the mee soto and you tiao rojak, mee soto was pretty good and can give the you tiao rojak a miss.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114720035040328969753/reviews
Noor HezAin,3,"First time being here, was not too disappointing. They have indoors and outdoors seating. The food was nice and the price was affordable. Only menu they have is in the shop, up the wall. Very inconvenient, should consider a QR code style of menu. So we have to take a picture to view it n place our order since we are seated outdoor. Next door cafe blast their music loud, Lina's satay club sound system cannot compete.
Food was serve quite promptly... may come again...",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105492715591728697755/reviews
