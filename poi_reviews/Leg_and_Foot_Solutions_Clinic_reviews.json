He gave practical advice and spoke candidly like a friend, which made every visit an enjoyable one. He also shared professional insights, which helped me make sense of what I experience when I walk and do certain activities using my legs. It is indeed a go-to place with solutions for leg and foot issues, as the clinic name suggests. I'd recommend Henry and his clinic if anyone is looking to get help for leg or foot concerns.",
