Javier Tan,5,"Overall dabaoed through Grab, most of the dishes were super delicious despite the food coming through delivery! It was fresh!

The prawn paste chicken was a little soggy, but i assume its because it was delivered!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106617631020704357051/reviews
