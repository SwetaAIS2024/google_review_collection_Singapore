Madeline Xiong,5,"The principal, teachers and staff are really warm and friendly. They are incredibly caring and patient with the children. Lots of effort in their day to day lessons, as well as special celebrations. There’s open communication and accountability in the school and I’m so glad to have both my kids in MFS Clementi.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117762268354381882561/reviews
