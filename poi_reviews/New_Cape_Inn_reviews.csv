Roselly,1,"Cleanliness is disappointing. The carpet is old and musky, you can even see the wooden tiles underneath, can't walk on it with barefoot. The facilities are obviously used and old, the hair dryer produces loud noise hence I didn't use it at all.  The service is quite ok, they have a 24 hrs front desk.
Nearby have a food court which is quite convenient. If you don't mind their carpet and room, you can try to stay for a night.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112449177187040416323/reviews
Fetrin Adha Rizka,5,"Stayed at New Cape Inn recently and had a really good experience. The hotel is in a great location, just a short walk to Havelock MRT and also close to Tiong Bahru. There are plenty of nearby stores and eateries for breakfast and local food. The room was clean, comfortable, and affordable. The staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a convenient and budget-friendly place to stay in Singapore!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116432657317605471523/reviews
ramoncito pabion,1,"I would like to raise some concerns regarding the service I experienced during my recent visit. Firstly, the customer service was disappointing. The staff were not accommodating, appeared impatient, and seemed unwilling to answer my questions properly. This left me feeling undervalued as a customer.

Secondly, the carpets were extremely dirty and poorly maintained. This is a separate issue from the room cleaning services. Regarding room tidiness, it is disappointing to note that cleaning and tidying up only happens once every two days. This is inadequate for maintaining cleanliness and comfort in the space.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103030533820167301285/reviews
Timothy Tok,3,"Classic, old and wore place, it could really benefit from a refresh. The rooms, though not dirty, show signs of wear and tear. The hot water was surprisingly hot, which was a nice touch, and the air conditioning worked well. However, the carpet could use a deep cleaning, and the bed, while comfortable enough, wasn't particularly plush. Overall, it's a decent option for budget-conscious travelers seeking a basic, functional accommodation.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114858975406702442135/reviews
Algert Islamaj,5,Don't go to this place and expect luxury. The report between quality and price is really good compared to other hotels in SG.  So if you're on a budget and don't want to share your room with strangers this is the place to go.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109102082367431544299/reviews
