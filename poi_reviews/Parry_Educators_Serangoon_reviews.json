His classes were always insightful and interesting - discussing various topics outside of usual curricula, as we evaluated and built on each other's answers. Certain points highlighted by him still stick with me today when writing an academic essay. As an experienced and down-to-earth tutor for all levels, I'm sure anyone would enjoy his amusing lessons as well!",

He always sacrifices his time, effort and energy out of his love and passion for teaching and his students. He always seeks out the potential in every student who is at the lowest point of their life. Also he is an amusing teacher and the life of the party who brightens up your day.",
