jp tuazon,5,"I have been experiencing pain in my left shoulder and was unable to raise my arm, but thanks to Dr. Bernard Lee and Michelle, it's like a miracle - just 30 minutes after the procedure, I was able to raise my arm again. 10cc of fluids were removed from my shoulder. I've known Dr. Lee for almost 12 years and have seen firsthand how he works, ensuring that his patients won't require another procedure. He guarantees that it will be done correctly. Once again, thank you so much Dr. Bernard Lee and Michelle. More power to Singapore Pain Care, and I'm sure more patients will be pain-free once they see Dr. Lee. 5 ⭐️ service, very highly recommended.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106567082929991684160/reviews

J L,5,"Visited SG Paincare on 20 Feb to see Dr Bernard Lee for a Coreflex injection for my knee pain. Was attended warmly by Michelle and Sherlynn who were both competent and reassuring especially during the injection process. Dr Lee was also professional in his diagnosis. It’s been almost 2 weeks now and I feel like my knee has been given a new lease of life - finally pain free after living with the pain for 2 years. Thanks Doc, Michelle & Sherlynn!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115877680770521700487/reviews
