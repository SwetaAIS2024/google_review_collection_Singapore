      "text": "If you’re looking for an elevated movie experience, Gold Class Cinema at VivoCity is the place to be. From the moment you step into the lounge, you’re greeted with luxury. The seats are plush recliners, allowing you to lie back and enjoy the movie in comfort, with ample space and even a built-in footrest. The service is impeccable.\nThe screen quality and sound are top-notch, providing a premium viewing experience that makes watching even the most anticipated blockbusters feel special. The ambiance of the cinema is quiet and intimate, with a smaller, more exclusive setting, ensuring a private atmosphere compared to typical theaters.\nWhile the experience is certainly on the pricier side, it’s worth it for the luxury and convenience. The comfort, service, and premium amenities make it perfect for a special occasion or just a treat-yourself movie night. Gold Class at VivoCity offers a cinematic experience that's hard to beat. I highly recommend this place.",

      "text": "Signage was unclear.\nThose who had redemption voucher for corporate food and beverage was shouted at by the manager (confirmed with the other on duty staff that it was indeed him) assumed people knew which line to go. If you have a receipt to redeem for a pre-purchase paid online, you would assume you go to the “online f&b collection point”. But instead they expected you to queue up at the “food and beverage purchase” line instead. Doesn’t make sense as we’re not purchasing anything, just collection a pre-paid purchase. If GV can’t handle corporate event with a better signage, maybe don’t try to do it. It doesn’t cost much to take a piece of A4 paper and write down clearer instructions and paste over existing queue poles signage.",

It was a long Tamil movie, CAPTAIN MILLER.\n\nI wondered how they expect people to sit through-out or go to bio break during gripping movie. Didn't drink drop of water entire 3 hours.. mmmmm",
