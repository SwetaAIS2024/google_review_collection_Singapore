It's the integrity of the store.",

There were a lot of seats available when I visited, it seems to not be too crowded as its not located near any malls or shopping areas which makes it a pretty peaceful and chill place to have a meal.\n\nThe coffee shop has a tall ceiling which allows huge fans to be installed, making the place very cooling with good ventilations.\nThere was also a TV üì∫ installed on the pillar, allowing people to watch shows while they have their meal üôÇ\n\nFrom most stalls that I've seen, the food prices were shockingly low considering the inflation lately. This place feels like a hidden gem üíé  and I'm sure most people who live around here are happy that stallowners are not increasing the prices too much and providing great food. üëç\n\nI managed to try out both the Western food stall and Korean Japanese food stall, both of which were delicious and affordable. üëç\n\nI had an enjoyable meal here and will definitely come back again in the future if I am nearby. üôÇüëç",
