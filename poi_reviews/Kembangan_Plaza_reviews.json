      "text": "This security is rude to the max. He pointed finger into my face and shouted at me.\n\nIt was my first time visiting Kembangan Plaza this morning 4th May 2024. I was taking a bite while waiting for my child to end his grading test.\nI didn’t see any ‘no food n drinks’ signs around me, next moment this security came pointing right into my face with his finger tip about 30-50cm apart from my nose, shouting rudely at me:” YOU! No eating HERE!”. He had totally pissed me off! I kept my food into my bag and told him there’s no need to be so rude to me. He then gestured me to shoo off and after that he does threatening stared at me every-time he walk passed me.\n\nIf he had spoke to me nicely or just gave me a reminder, i would have apologized for not noticing the house rules but he choose to shout at the very first place.\n\nI would like to know from the management if they trained their security this way, because he mentioned he is not scare of being complained.",

And he was mad shouting at me saying I can’t eat. Crazy fella. Unds that that was his job, I can’t even see any signboard of no eating, and even if he wants to stop people from eating a small bites he could have talked nicely. How to lodge a complain to the higher management? Can just please fire him away? I believe there are more people who met the same situation as me according to the reviews. Please kindly seek this matter seriously.",
