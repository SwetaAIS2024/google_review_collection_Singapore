      "text": "Dr Tay was my surgeon as well for performing a surgery on my leg for accute DVT. I have greatly appreciated his vast experience and willingness to share his knowledge and time to make us more aware of the operation, follow-up treatments and processes around it, making me confident and re-assured in the (ultimately successful) outcomes. Thanks to his care and advice, I was able to recover quickly post the surgery. Also, shout-out to the clinic staff and Jessica who were very supportive and accommodating before and after the operation, to support us in the administrative process as well as insurance matters. Thanks to all!",

      "text": "Dr Tay was my surgeon when I had to undergo surgery due to Deep Vein Thrombosis affecting my right leg. Dr Tay is an excellent doctor. He is most understanding and patiently explained my condition and everything about the surgery itself. This was most reassuring  and helped reduce any anxiety I had. I went into the operating theatre confident that I was in the hands of a most competent surgeon.\n\nWhen he learned that I, an average working mother, could not claim from insurance he very kindly reduced his fees and even offered to treat my other leg, with a similar problem, without charge.\n\nThank you Dr Tay.",

      "text": "Dr. Tay and his team (especially Jessica) are truly exceptional, and we are beyond grateful for their expertise, care, and kindness during a suddenly very difficult time.\n\nOn February 7th, my fianc√© was diagnosed with acute deep vein thrombosis and a pulmonary embolism. It was quite a stressful situation. When the hospital called for Dr. Tay to be the attending specialist, I felt we were so blessed with such reassuring and competent doctor.\n\nHis clear explanations helped us understand the condition and treatment plan, giving us much-needed reassurance. He prioritised necessary procedures, avoiding unnecessary interventions that would add to the cost while ensuring the best possible outcome for the emergency operation.\n\nBeyond his medical expertise, Dr. Tay, Jessica and the team went the extra mile in promptly assisting us with certain documentations that were required for insurance matters, showing incredible kindness beyond just patient care.\n\nThanks to Dr. Tay‚Äôs skill, professionalism, and genuine care, my fianc√© is now on the road to recovery. If you're looking for a highly competent and compassionate vascular specialist, I cannot recommend Dr. Tay and his team enough. They are truly lifesavers!\n\nThank you for everything! üôè",
