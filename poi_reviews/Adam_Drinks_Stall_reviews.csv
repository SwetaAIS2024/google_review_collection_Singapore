Daniel Bok,5,"This is gonna be a super funny ordering experience. The charm is in the shopkeeper who doesn’t really speak English but who has a great smile and follows it up with his thumbs up sign.

We got teh tarik siu dai. Our “less sweet” orders were still pretty sweet. I think the only way to get “siu Dai” is to tell him kosong. But all in all, 5 stars cause of the shopkeeper",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114835379352368094009/reviews

Samuel Lipoff,5,"Their lime juice, less sweet, I think is the best in Singapore.  No shortcuts, just freshly squeezed juicy limes, a touch of sugar dissolved in hot water, poured over ice.  Just perfect, even if the price varies a bit.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110394865249528273768/reviews
