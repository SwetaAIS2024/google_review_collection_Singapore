      "text": "Wine Connection outlets never seem to disappoint. The best thing about them has got to be the great selection of wines by the glass.\nThe food menu is usually quite extensive too.\nOn this occasion, I had the fried baby crabs which were served with a tzatziki-like sauce. A simple dish but quite a treat. The rose pasta was a bit claggy but decent enough to be enjoyed. Finally, their apple crumble had a good balance of tartness and sweetness which made it a light and easy finish to the meal.\nWill be back! Mostly for the wine üòÇ",

Nothing beats to this cozy bowl of comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the BBQ Pork Ribs is disappointing for a main.\nIt's warm, not hot, I guess microwave does the work.\nIt wasn't tender as expected and dry.\nI didn't finish & left.",

We had Lamb shank,  which was moist and tender, and served with mash potatoes. Prawn Gambas unfortunately was too oily, not quite what we expected this time. Big shout out to their service team who extended excellent service throughout our meal. Will be back again for sure.",
