Food & Home Dairy (East West),3,"Large selection of household products.
You can find wide variety of tools, diy, home items, locks and many more here.

Unlike other hardware store, the walking path is wide, bright and neat.

The reason for deducting 2 stars are the staff. The ladies do not know the tools, not helpful, lack of empathy and not knowledgeable.

Hopefully they can have staff that know about hardware.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110687054466909678905/reviews
