Terry Ding,4,"Ordered the Thai milk tea and Roasted pork basil rice. Tastes quite good. Both are quite balanced and at the right point. Price wise, slightly above average: 10SGD for a set meal and 3.5SGD for a Thai milk tea. Will surely visit again.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106265589250471004962/reviews
KS Chuah,4,"food is authentic thai that‚Äôs for sure. But the place is quite stuffy sharing air from the cooking in the kitchen, after food the whole body and hair smells like their kitchen‚Ä¶ if you plan to go, make sure you prepare to take a bath after returning home. Price is a bit on the high side, portion needs to be more generous.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110011635618018852103/reviews
Prism Ho,4,"Forget the sad, gloppy versions you find in some mall food courts.

I recently had the pleasure of trying authentic Thai Fried Rice from a local Thai eatery, and it was a revelation.

This wasn't just fried rice; it was a symphony of flavors and textures that danced on my palate.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116990755326782972907/reviews
Crypto ExDee,5,"Pretty decent Thai food in this industrial park.

Definitely try out the crispy pork and red ruby!! The Thai Mama is not to be missed too!

Tom Yam soup hits the spot but slightly on the spicier side.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110697649280498996686/reviews
Steven Soo,4,"Hidden gem in industrial area but limited parking space for public.

All staff are thai and many varieties of Thai dishes. We want to try the grill pork or pork jowl but both unavailable except fried stuff.

Potion are huge compare to Nakhon and taste good. It's a self service and need to return plates after finish your meal hence no service charge or GST. Recommend to try Tom yum seafood red as its cone with lots of ingredients although prawns seem to be slightly overcooked. It's a basic small eating place and its not suitable for family with kids.

can drive down or order take away if nearby üëç",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102309295159637658350/reviews
