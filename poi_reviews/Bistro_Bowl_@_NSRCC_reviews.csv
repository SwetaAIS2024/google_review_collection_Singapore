Monica Ung,1,"Worst curry fish head ever! No meat at all. Only some bones and a few strand of cabbages and lady's fingers. $42!! And when I complained, the service staff told me it's expected that there is no meat on fish head! She thought I first time ate fish head! I told her it's a feedback and she ought to acknowledge and bring it up to the  management and the chef. Instead she chided me that if I wanted more meat I should order a large. I will never go back there. Horrible service. And horrible food.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106559335581364584990/reviews
