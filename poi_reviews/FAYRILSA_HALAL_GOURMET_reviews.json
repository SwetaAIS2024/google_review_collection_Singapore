HIGHLY RECOMMEND !!!  Wow\n\nAsk for nasi lemak rice and add ingredients. Their rice and ingredients especially the chicken and the sambal goreng + the sambal itself is insanely good.",

On the other hand, The drink stall is a huge disappointment, most drinks are pretty much pre-made in pitchers so they taste yucky and flat. Ugh.\n\nNo aircon here as well but the place’s airy and open so it’s still bearable.",

Very very good! The soup is tasty and clean in taste. We had seaweed porkribs, old cucumber pork ribs and lotus root pork ribs. For sides we tried spicy chicken (so so), spicy seaweed and vermicelli (yummy!),  cucumber (yummy!).\nAfter lunch, relax n have a nice cup of teh or kopi n enjoy the breeze.",
