Conan Edogawa,1,"Worst customer service of all times be it the temp or full-time staff!  Make no apologies for price tagging error.  One item, but item code written wrongly on so many pieces.  Not the customer's fault.  Not even a show of good faith.  Just void your purchase without even telling you and asked that you pay for the new item entry. Well done, Watsons!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102584334689565900899/reviews
