      "text": "Saw this newly opening whereby they expanding from their original outlet at Changi Road. Not the one that I tot of when came across an online intro for this.\n\nWill becoming lucky after eating & drinking? No mention in details online for there is no parking at this private property. No drive-thru either. And no toilet within.\n\nThe dine-in area is the benches as this cafe does not cater for any dining. No such words being mentioned online.\n\nThks to the taxi uncle who drove me there for my 2nd time visiting at there. As this cafe opening hours also quite strange. Shout out to the kind soul who opened the gantry gate for us. Else the taxi meter keeps on running. Sorry that the taxi uncle couldn't exit out till this cafe staff remotely pressed the button for the gantry to be opened. Talking about the hassle.\n\nLuckily the taxi uncle also taught me on how to exit out by walking the other side to the Bedok South. True enough much more shorter than the original route that coming from the main road of East Coast Road. If coming from Bayshore mrt, worst still. Better come from Bedok busstop & walk-in for less than 5 mins only ✌",

      "text": "Located in a quaint private walk-up apartment. You have to park by the roadside as it’s a private property.\n\nLet’s break down the pastry.\n\nThe croissant is on the thicker side where you don’t get the layers of dough and the crunch. It feels more doughy and chewy.\n\nIt’s tasty with any choice of fillings but it can get rather costly for a small croissant.\n\nCoffee pulled by the la mazocco was as good as it can get. It’s barista coffee but lacks character. The milk was overpowering the coffee.\n\nI think they need to secure the pastry display with a sliding door cos insects can get inside.",

      "text": "A Hidden Gem in a Charming Neighbourhood\n\nDefinitely one of the best coffee takeaway spots in Singapore. The quality here is top-notch – everything is fresh, delicious, and clearly made with care.\nThe savoury croissant, croque monsieur, and brie sandwich are all must-tries, and the La Marzocco coffee is simply amazing – smooth, rich, and perfectly brewed.\n\nLocated in a lovely residential area, the shop has a super charming vibe that makes every visit feel like a little escape from the city buzz.\nThe staff are kind, professional, and always welcoming.\n\nHighly recommend!",
