Catherine Ting,5,"Restaurant is spacious and bright. Service staff are friendly. Love that food are served warm. Chawamushi is good! Portions are big so I am glad I went easy with my main: a sushi plate.

jason Tan,1,"Because of the 4.7 high reviews given for this restaurant, I decided to give it a try as I was in the vicinity.

But, it was so disappointing.

Their salmon avocado taco had so few toppings on top, while the rest are all rice. And it cost 28.90

Secondly, the Tonkatsu Ramen was worse. Bland soup taste, over soggy noodles. Although the pork char siew was great, the star was the soup, isn't it??

Sames goes for the Char Siew Don. Rice was plain dry rice, no sauce, nothing. And can't digest properly.

Seriously, how did this place have such a high rating of 4.7 over 535 reviews??? I don't understand.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104527905962091193519/reviews
Serene Neo,4,Decent standard for a quick and fuss free Japanese dinner at Eco Botanic! Generally good portions of food with fast service & the kids wiped out most of their food! RM200 (SGD60) for 2 adults & 2 kids ðŸ˜€ (Disclaimer: Missing a pic of a Salmon and Mango Maki that we ordered),2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103168344790570640637/reviews
Ling Chen,5,"Quality sushi, better than those franchise restaurants. Sashimi big and thick slice. My girls like the salmon maki, handmade goyza and surprisingly the yellowtail fish head! Chirashi taco was super yummy, adults liked it. Fried garlic rice has the wok hei!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110867631264441136421/reviews
dolce bibobi,3,"Between a 3 and 4 stars flavour-wise if you want to be strict but honestly itâ€™s difficult to find legitimate japanese restaurants in the area and this place serves alright food.

Price is good and portion is big too. Will be visiting again to try the other items on the menu!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113755863430044252682/reviews
