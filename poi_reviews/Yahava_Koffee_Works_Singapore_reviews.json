      "text": "I recently visited this charming coffee café, and I couldn't be more impressed! The cozy ambiance makes it the perfect spot to unwind and enjoy a delicious treat. I ordered their breakfast set under promo price that came with a cup of reg coffee. The bread was fresh, with a crunchy crust and soft, airy interior. Paired with their coffee, it made for a delightful combination.\n\nI also had the pleasure of trying their waffles and pancakes, and both were exceptional.\n\nWhether you're a waffle lover, pancake fan, or just in the mood for a great cup of coffee, this place delivers on all fronts. Highly recommend!\n\nPricing wise is also very reasonable for a cafe.",

      "text": "It was a pleasant surprise to find such a cafe in the middle of an industrial park. They’re obviously pros in the coffee business, what with the heavy machineries in the background. However, I ordered the pancakes and they were nothing to shout about.   With the Japanese version of fluffy pancakes around Singapore, theirs were a tad dry and not fluffy. Butter and syrup were a little sparse (but I did order the plain version). Long black was the slightly sourish type, not the strong and bold type. Hope they’ll improve on the pancakes. Perhaps I’ll try their sandwiches or waffles next time. Loved the ambience with plenty of seats available.",

The staff is helpful to help us find a seat and no one seem to be leaving.\nWe order a XL iced latte, a lime tart and butter croissant. The coffee is definitely worth making a visit there. I would also recommend the butter croissant.",

Additional syrup was charged at 50 cents. Suggest for the restaurant to provide more FOC otherwise the pancakes feel really jelat after the second piece.",

      "text": "Exceptional coffee at a reasonable price. Tried the caffe latte, matcha latte, pancakes and tuna melt. The tuna melt was very good - crisp, hot, perfectly toasted, tuna was delicious.\n\nMatcha latte was velvety smooth too, though a bit too milky for my liking (husband loved it). The pancakes were decent, fragrant and tasty, but were a bit too dry and tough. Not overly pricey, we had each at $3 opting for the Elite pancake choice of 3 pieces.\n\nOverall it was a nice breakfast that we really enjoyed. Location can be a bit troublesome in the industrial area but definitely worth a revisit!",
