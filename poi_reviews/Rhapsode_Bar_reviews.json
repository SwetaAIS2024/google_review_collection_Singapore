      "text": "Nice cosy karaoke bar. Only 4 tables. More suitable for those who like to drink and sing. The shop is along the corridor inside the building, not along the street, so may be a bit hard to find. The building is near Tai Seng MRT station Exit A. The boss is nice and friendly.  Right now they have a promotion where you could get a bucket of 4 bottles of Heineken beer for $20.  Payment is by cash or paynow only.",
