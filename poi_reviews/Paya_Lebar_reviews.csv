Champ,4,"I love paya lebar station.

I’ve lived in paya lebar station for over a year. I never regret this decision, luckily I’ve chosen here as my second home.

It’s very near to cbd, also to east coast. Along with the river side is a great place to take a walk or jog.

Here is a interchange station as well, which means you can find yellow line and green line in the same time.

There are more than 4 shopping malls around paya lebar, it rocks! Right? You can find everything you need here, grass to chill, supermarket to shop, food court to eat, music to hear...

Although some of pictures I didn’t take, one good thing here is you can find a clinic or drug store easily.

Something you need to aware: green line recently has some trouble... so you might not able to take the mrt. The good thing  is they provide shuttle bus for this.

Enjoy your paya lebar experience!",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116667078710255296103/reviews
胡佳恩Jia En,5,"Love this MRT as it is close to Shopping Malls and offices. With 2 lines (Circle Line and East West Line), travelling to most part of Singapore is very convenient.

It is also lively with the various stores, water fountain in between the PLQ Mall and office, like the fact that there are many exits and covered shelter area to make it easier to get around the area.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112778829475776252617/reviews
