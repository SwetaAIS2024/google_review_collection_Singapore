      "text": "My go to lunch spot. Standard order: Chicken rice for $2.50, and the portion is decent so it's really value for money! Their rice is fragrant and delicious, and I love that they provide self serve soup which you can try to dig out cabbages, corns, and even bak kut.\n\nRight now they're having a promo, one chicken rice for $1. My photo is for two portions of it but less rice. Go go go!",

      "text": "I use to enjoy having 烧腊 here. But recently, the standard for this outlet seems to have dropped.  My wife was with my son and she bought him a packet of char siew rice with soy sauce chicken add-on. She has specifically mentioned that it's for my son and prefer lean meat. When she went home, she realized that the char siew is almost 80% fats then lean meat and the chicken is close to meatless mostly rib bones. This is the 3rd encounter for us, as the previous purchase, we have given the benefits of a doubt that some days they may not be getting good supply. But then again, it shouldn't always be every time when we patronize their shop..",

Please have some self conscious,  do you even check the food before packing , this is morally\nNot right to sell such garbage.",

Because I love this magical duck.\n\nIt always comes with extra sauce, so that you can reheat and eat the duck the next day. The meat is herby, salty and addictive.  Packaging has greatly improved with spill-proof containers.\n\nOn the rare occasion that I travel down to this stall, I found the staff soft-spoken, thoughtful and considerate.",
