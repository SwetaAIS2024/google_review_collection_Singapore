Abraham Lee,4,"Tried out Pancake King at Bukit Timah Plaza and the pancakes were tasty, especially the traditional min jiang kueh with generous fillings. They also have a wide range of other desserts and cakes to choose from. There are some seating available if you want to dine in with coffee being served as well. A nice spot for a quick treat or a casual snack break. The store is hidden at a back corner tho the sign is strategically placed to show through.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115808583411002036520/reviews
TNJ Housing Solutions Pte Ltd,4,"Hidden at one corner within bukit timah plaza. Quite crowded when I visited them.

Teh peng is nice. Banana cake average only and earl grey cake nothing fantastic. For the price, expect to be better.

Service wise Q cleared pretty fast. Minimal renovation ambience but nice to have a cup of kopi here as its air conditioned.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103779904320049277745/reviews
Jasmine Wan,2,"Bought a chocolate chip muffin, blueberry muffin, banana crumble and a coconut pancake.

The chocolate chip muffin feels like a scam. There was no chocolate chip in the muffin except on top and below. How can this be called a chocolate chip muffin?!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111376924236401196649/reviews
Irene Lim,4,"After lunch, we just wanna try the pancake.
As usual I ordered peanut butter pancake. $2 a piece. Placed in a paper carrier - nice.
Pancake doesnâ€™t have flavour and a bit soggy. Peanut butter was ok, not too sweet but also not flavourful.
Coffee was freshly grounded. Nice. I enjoyed the coffee more than pancake. There are better pancake elsewhere.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105804445185126817371/reviews
Eve F,5,"Pancake Royalty! One peanut spread pancake and one Teh C cost me $4 and was a satisfying snack. The peanut filling was creamy and generously spread, while the Teh was a strong, flavourful brew served in the traditional rooster cup. Seating is limited but friendly patrons are generally willing to share tables. A cosy spot to satisfy your hunger or even take a quick meal break - they also sell packets of Nasi Lemak at around the $3 to $4 mark. All hail the Pancake King!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110709222032134696127/reviews
