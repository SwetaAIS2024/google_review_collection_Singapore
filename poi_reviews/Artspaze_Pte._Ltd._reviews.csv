Nivel is professional, friendly, trustworthy, customer-centric, understanding my needs, work within the budget and best of all, always response to renovation enquiries.

He gave great advices on renovation tips, ranging from design, color choices, electrical works, carpentries, defects check, furniture, electronics, curtains, plants, etc. I have learnt so much things from him! Thanks, Nivel!

With his vast experience, knowledges, and creativity, he will strive to balance our expectation. He has helped us to achieve practicability for long-term comfort & satisfaction. Not just short-term satisfaction & aesthetically pleasing.
