Stephen Lim,5,"This restaurant served one of the best foods around this vicinity. The hot pot steam fish was rather tasty. The grouper was extremely fresh. The savoury chilli crabs were marvellous. The vegetables and boneless pork loin were tender and juicy.
We love steam salted turnip egg was marvellous.
The same goes with the curry fish head.
Overall, we had a sumptuous dinner.
The service personnel was excellent. Ms Eileen and Mr Xiao Qiang are very polite and humble",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117005225316397904652/reviews

HãpPŸ,5,"Chance upon a video on tiktok that there are many variety of food served in this aircon coffeeshop. Was disappointed that only the seafood stall is opened. Since we are already here so ordered a few dishes to try. This stall didn't disappoint us. We had the claypot fish head, sweet & sour pork and the prawn paste fried chicken wings. The food is great, my favourite will be the claypot fishhead. Fish is fresh and in the pot there are tofu, random vegetables and pork cubes. Quantity of tofu and pork cubes could be more.
Bill for 3 dishes is $68.  Will be back to try out other dishes. Parking is conveniently outside the coffeeshop.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100738228560182078848/reviews

Kwan Tuck Soon,5,Interesting Zi char place in Taman Jurong. Located at the ground level of a building full of car workshops. Serve good Zi char food at ok prices. My wife and I like the 蜜汁排骨 and 招牌豆腐. There is an air-conditioned zone for bigger group dining. Use Fave eCard and enjoy some discounts. Highly recommended.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100443828037945463831/reviews
