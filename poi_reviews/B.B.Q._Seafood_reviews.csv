Mitch Peh,5,"The sambal for the stingray here is really good, suits my tastebud as it is not too spicy like in many other places.

Also, the stingray is fresh, meat is really soft. If I have a craving for sambal stingray again, I will definitely come back here even though I live in the east.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109947354795317298886/reviews
Jerry Tang,4,"This is one of my favourite BBQ places. Their sambal is nice, not overly salty yet fragrant and flavourful. Their stingray are always grilled nicely, not overcooked or undercooked. Their kangkong, while not the best I had, is also admirable. I was there at 7+pm this time, and most ingredients were already sold out. Thus, do come early and be prepared to wait. The aunties will take your orders and serve you promptly when the food is ready.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115888625563267924954/reviews
GG K,5,"The sambal stingray here is superb! I was also very impressed by the sambal sotong. It was cooked to perfection and the sauce they used just tasted so good. Do try to eat the sotong first though, as the longer it stays on the hotplate, the tougher it gets. I'd give the kang kong a miss though, as the portion was really small.

Their business is really good, so do avoid coming during peak periods. I'd recommend reaching before 6pm to avoid a long queue.

Will definitely be back for the sambal stingray and sotong again!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113182488876013163119/reviews
Daniel Wong,5,The stingray was perfectly cooked and the sambal topping is amazing. Also they are generous with the sambal. The pickled onions are nice too. Do come early as they ran out of stingrays in my previous visit.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115145949078497107987/reviews
weeleong yap,3,"Smell the aroma always when i am nearby, and always sold out before 730pm. It must be good.!
So today managed to get to order.
I ordered stingray (large), and kangkung.
It was a huge disappointment üòû üòÆ‚Äçüí®.
The fish was bland. The üå∂ chilli,? Was it there? Its also very bland. And both dishes were soaked in oil. Oh gosh... the only saving grace? Its piping hot, jus like how bbq seafood should be served!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116314773919649067930/reviews
