Room is spacious and cold enough.\nService however is not so well as we sat for more than half hour and nobody attend to us for drinks and ask for serving. Serving of food is also quite slow.\nFood some of it taste is good but some is not as for the fish is quite fishy but the boss is good enough to explain. Portion is ok as we quite full after finish it.",

      "text": "Visited Uncle Leong Signature for lunch on a weekend around 12pm, and to my surprise, the place was completely empty.\n\nWe ordered a few dishes and unfortunately, the experience was quite disappointing. The fried ee mian was particularly bad — the oil used for frying tasted old and reused, which left a really unpleasant aftertaste. On top of that, the sauce was bland, and overall the dish just didn’t work for me at all.\n\nWe also tried some of their dim sum. The fried mango prawn dim sum was another miss — once again, the bad oil taste stood out, and the mango was bland and tasteless, far from the sweet flavour you would expect. As for the chee cheong fan and fried carrot cake, they were alright, nothing exceptional but at least edible.\n\nOverall, I would say this place is just alright, but given the quality of the food, I would seriously reconsider visiting again.",

The vegetable dish was the star of the show, while the prawn paste chicken and braised tofu were also delicious.\n\nThe service we received was fantastic, and the overall dining experience was very pleasant.",
