Xinhui Chiang,5,"Booked this restaurant from Eatigo and really think it’s worth the 50% off, and we ordered two mains and two side dishes. The steak is cooked evenly and very juicy! The rest of the meal is normal, just alright. There is very little people on Thursday evening. Really love the quiet atmosphere, it is perfect.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117900154144054148298/reviews
