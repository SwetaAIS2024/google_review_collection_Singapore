Elangovan Davin,5,"A Delightful Dinner at Vanakam India

Last night, we had the pleasure of dining at Vanakam India, and it was an absolutely fantastic experience! The ambiance was warm and inviting, with beautiful Indian-inspired decor that instantly transported us to a vibrant cultural setting.

One of the highlights of the evening was trying Chicken Kola Urundai for the very first time. These flavorful chicken dumplings were crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and seasoned to perfection. Every bite was a treat to the taste buds!

The exceptional customer service made the experience even more memorable. The staff was attentive, friendly, and made us feel truly welcome. It‚Äôs not just a meal‚Äîit‚Äôs a complete experience at Vanakam India.

If you‚Äôre in the mood for authentic Indian cuisine and a charming dining experience, I highly recommend this gem. Definitely going back for more!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100611362979929886640/reviews

Fatdieme,5,"Great place for tasty northern indian cuisine. Wide selection of food made with nicely blended spices.

Blown away with the chicken kola urundai (chicken mix with herbs, onions). Crispy, well seasoned and light on the mouth.

Butter chicken masala is soo good, creamy and tomatoey, goes so well with the naan.

Masala tea ‚òï and Lassi are good üëç. Hot gulab Jamun (desert) was a pleasant surprise, the rose and cardommon goes so well. The syrup taste like a mixture of Bandung and Masala tea üëç. Do give it a try.

They serve the food hot and fresh, waiting time is to be expected.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102099818090750573208/reviews
