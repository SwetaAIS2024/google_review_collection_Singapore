Boss is very friendly too. We had a good time eating with friends. Book before coming and boss will arrange a nice place at the coffee shop for you.",

      "text": "I have been here several times already for both the Mookata and zi char.  The food has been consistently excellent and very reasonably priced. Service is excellent as well with all dishes (I‚Äôll typically order 4-5 dishes) usually being served within 10-15 minutes upon ordering. I highly recommend the fish head curry and pork ribs.  It is a nice informal gathering place and I have had two mini class reunions here within these couple of months.  Owner Sebes is really friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this place.",
