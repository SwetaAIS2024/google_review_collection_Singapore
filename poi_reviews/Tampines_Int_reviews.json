      "text": "Overall this is a great interchange with many connections to different regions in Singapore. Such as service 67 which goes to Choa Chu Kang and passes through Little India or services 4, 19, 20, 29 and 37 all offering direct access to those working in the Changi Industrial area another example being 969 for the fastest connection with the northern region. Housing a total of 24 services, it brings an ease to travelling for residents living here. The only issue is it being rather jammed along this area during peak hours.",

      "text": "Bloody bus service 28 always notoriously late. Many times commuters have to wait at least 25 mins for the next bus service 28 to arrive. This is unacceptable. So what is SBS and LTA gonna do about it? I'm sure I'm not the only one that is complaining about this bus service 28 and other bus services too. And there's also a SBS driver of African origin whom I believe to be a PR. Lack of empathy by him and he would always stopped his bus few metres ahead of the bus stop because this sadistic driver wants his passengers to walk to his bus even though there were no other buses at the bus stops. I hope LTA would do regular audits on these type of drivers and the late bus service like this service 28.",
