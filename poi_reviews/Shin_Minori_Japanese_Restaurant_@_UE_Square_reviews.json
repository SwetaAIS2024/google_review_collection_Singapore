The atmosphere was cozy and relaxing — perfect for both casual meals and special occasions.\n\nSpecial shoutout to Julia, who went above and beyond to make our visit extra memorable. She was warm, attentive, and genuinely caring — truly one of the best service staff we’ve encountered in a long time. Her thoughtful service made all the difference.\n\nHighly recommend Shin Minori for anyone looking for great food, a pleasant vibe, and amazing people in Shin Minori",

      "text": "The concept is quite unique, and the buffet offers an impressive variety of dishes. Despite being an all-you-can-eat experience, the seafood stood out for its freshness, and everything was prepared to order. There's even a mini steamboat and free-flowing Yakitori. One of my favorite surprises was the seaweed taco sushi—such a creative and textured twist on the traditional sushi roll. I also really enjoyed the truffle pasta; it was packed with flavor, though a bit too oily. The desserts and fruits were deliciously sweet as well.",

Overall it’s worth it if you enjoy feasting on raw seafood.\nService wise requires some waiting time.\nAtmosphere is very casual.",

(They provided only one  QR code per group for ordering)\n\nThe space is a bit tight, but overall, great value for money (hightea menu) & definitely spoilt for choice!\n\nAnd they provide ice cream far from the usual chocolate and vanilla!",

The buffet has many food, to which most are presented in small portions, meaning you can try the whole menu easily. Highlights are the taco items and the grilled items. The price is on the expensive range for japanese buffet but u are getting quality food and services. They clear the empty plates timely and are very professional.",
