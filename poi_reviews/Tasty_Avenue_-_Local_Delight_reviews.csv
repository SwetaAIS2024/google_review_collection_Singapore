A T,5,"Best is the Hokkien Prawn Noodles and we had the first batch at about 1015am. So Pork Lard super fresh, warm and crispy! Tasted real good.  Carrot cake average not too bad but lack a certain traditional taste we love though.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110290698573319690288/reviews
Jason Ng,4,The hokkien mee is actually good. Nice find so this would be the best hkm by far in Punggol. My plate of hkm $5 comes with 2 prawns and good portion of squid and pork belly. Chilli goes well. Consistency is good too. Will come again jus for Hkm fix.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103405563195010248727/reviews

Mark Ong,5,"I'm rating solely on the hokkien noodles. Was recommended by a friend to try this literally edge of Singapore store. Hidden in a neighborhood coffee shop . This wet version hokkien noodles could be customised with various options.. I choose to add a sunny side up $1 and $2 oyster to pump up the protein and seafood favour. It didn't disappoint. The broth of the noodles are rich in favour, slightly sweet from the seafood. Noodles however is just average, lack of the wok breath. Very satisfactory $8 deluxe HKM of exploding oysters juices mix with seafood broth noodles. With Chuck of eggs to complete the mouth feels..",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117348003086836979353/reviews
