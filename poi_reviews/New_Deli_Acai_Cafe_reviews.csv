Boon Kiat Phua,5,"Gem of a bakery / cafe in Elias Mall. Bakes here are amongst the best I’ve had locally and at a very decent price point (trust me, I’ve had a lot). Very interesting combinations of flavours too - think kaffir lime, cheddar and coconut twists, tomato, pesto and cheddar croissants sitting along sweet treats like apple foldovers, kougin-amanns.

They roast their own coffee beans and make lots of ingredients from scratch. Owner and the service team are super friendly too! It’s now my go to place in the neighbourhood for solid bakes and coffees.

Keep up the awesome work and looking forward to enjoying more new creations!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117168087124953669761/reviews
Tze Ang,5,Unexpectedly found a hole in the wall in a corner of Singapore. It has since become my regular haunt for morning coffee. I had their specialty coffee which is dark-roasted(i think) so its more on the stronger side. Delicious and perfect for the morning!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105597703544452606647/reviews
Grace Tiong,5,"I chanced upon the tiny New Deli cafe (formerly Eutopia cafe?) in Elias Mall last week. It's conveniently located on the ground floor, right next to the escalator.
They specialize in refreshing acai bowls and quality ice cream, perfect for a hot day. I tried their signature acai bowl, which was generously topped with nuts and the berry blend was incredibly smooth and tasty. I also ordered a latte, and the freshly ground coffee had a rich, dense aroma, complemented by the velvety steamed milk. The cafe also offers specialty coffee, chocolate, and matcha/hojicha drinks. The atmosphere was cozy and inviting, and the staff were friendly. I'd say the prices are in the mid-range.
They have an ongoing promotion in the afternoon where you can get special set price for their bakes and drinks. Their signature acai bowls are selling at a discounted price too during these off-peak hours.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112471093921920004434/reviews
