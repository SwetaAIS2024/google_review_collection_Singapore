Ever since, I noticed a huge shift in his interest in chinese! Every night, he would automatically take out his own books and get me to listen to his reading. He is no longer fearful of reading chinese. I am extremely thankful towards the teachers as his confidence in chinese has made him excited to start his primary school journey this year and gave him the right foundation.",
