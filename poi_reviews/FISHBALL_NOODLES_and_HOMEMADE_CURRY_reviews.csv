Jason Lee,5,"They were formally located in Kopitiam at Bukit Panjang Plaza. We love their Curry Chicken and were trying to find where has it moved to ever since Koptiam closed down in BPP.

We finally found it thru asking around whenever we meet any former stall holder/friends staying around BP.

The taste of the curry is still as good! Not too spicy. Potatoes inside the curry are just nice, not hard nor too soft. Portion of rice is generous!",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117371894884760957562/reviews

I didn't argue with her since I'm using CDC voucher to offset some cost, but wow. What a scammer ðŸ˜­",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106815152896380352505/reviews
Simon Y,4,"One of the more popular stall in the foodcourt. Curry was flavourful with the bee hoon mee well soaking in.

Kit Tan KW,5,"This curry will seriously bring you back to the good old days of your ahmaâ€™s home cooked curry!
