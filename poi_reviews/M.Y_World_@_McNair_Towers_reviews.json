And the new principal is very on the ball and we have seen a lot of activities and updates on the parent app recently. 100% recommend. Given it is a highly subsidised programme, do indicate your interest via Ecda early!",

They didn’t even let him step a foot into the facility, even though he willingly wanted to go and play.\n\n2) the “Teachers” play favouritism and will bully those children they don’t like and those are usually kids who don’t “listen to everything they say.”",
