Highly recommended!!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100754936399914467131/reviews
Rui,5,"Been searching for Singapore's best authentic Korean food for a while.

Step into this place. No frills. Just nice and flavourful old school type of dinning.

Fill your tables with lots of  Appetizers as usual.

Then came the draft Makgeolli with the kettle. Try it this way.

Meat goes by the size. If you can eat go ahead if not just order a single portion.

They will cook for you. You just eat.

The return crowd is amazing and the staff is friendliest.

Although there are 25 Korean restaurants nearby. Trust me. This one is the best.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101693177281044001072/reviews
Brian Claus,5,"This place seems underrated in it's reviews. We stumbled in when the place we were going to closed early and we were pleasantly surprised. Good variety of Banchan, we enjoyed the seafood soup and the chive pancake was great. Staff were attentive and kept refilling our ice when they realized we wanted ice with our water.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100194968913569891982/reviews
SeungJun Kim,5,"Kim's Korean Restaurant is a hidden gem in Beauty World, which has been in operation for over a decade. I tried my dad's favourite dish here called 돼지국밥 (Korean Pork Bone Soup), which is a signature dish in Busan, and my dad said that this restaurant's 돼지국밥 has the most authentic taste he has tried in Singapore. And I enjoyed it too!

The BBQ options may be expensive as for all the K-BBQs, but their soup options are affordable with plenty of side dishes (반찬). Recommended",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100958975977925692266/reviews
Charis Tan,4,The food was so so. We had to mix the soondubu hot pot paste ourselves and the soup was not as flavourful as i had at other places. The porridge was complimentary. There were complimentary cut fruits and yakult after the meal. The best was in fact the banchan and they were refillable as well.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112153510505131498978/reviews
