Savan,4,"As a native Hongkonger, I think the egg egglet here are about the same quality as those in Hong Kong. To be honest, egg egglet in Hong Kong arenâ€™t that amazing either. ðŸ˜…
We ordered the original flavor, and it tasted quite similar to the ones back home â€” the egg aroma wasnâ€™t particularly strong.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115757903290306503916/reviews
Rachel Alison,4,Managed to get the waffles during low peak period so it wasnâ€™t a long waiting time. However Iâ€™d say that the counter was confusing and also itâ€™ll be better if the girl didnâ€™t have a sulky face! :),a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112613607698536741421/reviews
Min HL,5,"Who doesnâ€™t like a hot and freshly made waffle?! ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ Love their egglet as well!

Need to wait for awhile (min 10 minutes) when there is a queue",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103965869018673563240/reviews
Di Di,5,"I managed to purchase the eggless at $0.99 on Shopee. I was initially thinking if I had to make three trips down or forgo the other two. The auntie said it was alright to redeem three at once.

Items was served fast. It was already cooked, but it was still hot. Egglets are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They do taste good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115312472597557433866/reviews
C,2,"As what the other reviews say, the egglet ($3.60) wasnâ€™t hot. That makes it tough, so it was difficult to bite and it missed the whole point of the hongkong egglet- a crispy, airy bubble waffle. Hotdog waffle ($2.80) was okay, one side of it was a little uncooked but the hotdog itself was fine. The staff was very busy, so itâ€™s understandable that her service may not be ideal. Sheâ€™s working by herself, so please be patient with her.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109477732884918793623/reviews
