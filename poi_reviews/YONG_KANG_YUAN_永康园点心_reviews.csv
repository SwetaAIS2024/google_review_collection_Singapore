Greyz Lai,1,"Worst dimsum ever. The cheecheongfun sauce taste off and sourly, so I feedback to the boss. She acted defensively, stopped me from asking about the cheecheongfun in a rude manner. Though she offered a free exchange of another dimsum, but we still got frustrated by the rude attitude. The food generally tastes super bad, except the porridge. Will need visit this store again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102302283214938516961/reviews
