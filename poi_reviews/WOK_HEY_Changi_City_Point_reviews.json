      "text": "I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding a serious food hygiene issue I encountered at your CCP branch(Changi city point). On August 18, 2024, I ordered the new Crab Laksa Max meal. While I was nearing the end of my meal, I suddenly felt something hard in my mouth. To my shock, I discovered that it was a patch of paint, presumably from the wall, which had somehow gone into my food. The paint was peeling and could be twisted off, indicating poor maintenance or cleanliness in your branch.\n\nSuch negligence is completely unacceptable and could pose serious health risks to all customers.\n\nPlease be more careful when you ordering food from this branch!\n\nI have feedback to their HQ, see how is the follow up.\n\nUpdated: compensation has been done and thanks for your prompt response!!",

      "text": "All time favourite fried rice, portion is quite big. You may think its put in a small box, however when you pour out the rice on a plate, its like 2 portions of cai fan rice or 2 portions of chicken rice.\nI like their egg fried rice variation the most! Can see they uses many eggs as the whole box has many chunks of eggs in it.\nThe outlet cooks quite fast too, around 5-8mins or so for 2 fried rice.",
