Ya Li,5,"From my 12yr daughter:
Lynn is an inspiring teacher. I had been attending her private vocal sessions for a year and a half. Before that, I enjoyed singing but i did not have knowledge about the techniques and lacked confidence. I was shy and afraid of performing in front of others. Teacher Lynn made special arrangements so that I was able to improve not only my singing skills, but also my confidence. Sometimes, I might not feel very well during the session, Teacher Lynn promptly informed my parents and took care of me. Thanks to her help, I landed a spot in my secondary school’s choir CCA. Now, I feel more comfortable with singing in front of people. Overall, I think Lynn had been a great mentor to me and I would recommend her to anyone who would like to take their singing to the next level.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113343190549124796736/reviews
Geraldine Tham,5,"Lynn is a very patient and thoughtful voice coach to someone like me who has close to zero music background. She’s masterful in identifying areas of improvement and teaching appropriate skills. She’s got deep knowledge and able to communicate in understandable ways.
