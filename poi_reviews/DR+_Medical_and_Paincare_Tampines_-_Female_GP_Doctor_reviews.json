Very gentle and listens to my worries well. She explains to me my symptoms and concerns and guides me in taking the medicine well. Prices are reasonable. She makes me feel comfy and I think the next time I‚Äôm sick I‚Äôll come back to her again.",

      "text": "The physician was amiable and cordial. The prescribed medication proved to be efficacious in facilitating my swift recovery. The ambiance of the clinic was pleasant.\n\nHowever, I am compelled to assign a three-star rating due to the following reasons:\n\n1. Inefficient queue management and unprofessional conduct exhibited by the nurse.\n\nUpon my arrival at the clinic, I was informed that I would have to wait approximately one and a half hours for my consultation. Subsequently, I received a phone call an hour later, wherein the nurse instructed me to return to the clinic as my turn would be approaching shortly. Despite this, I was obliged to wait an additional fifty minutes before I was finally seen by the physician. When I inquired about the reason for this delay, the nurse was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation.\n\n2. Exorbitant consultation fee.\n\nThe consultation fees charged by the clinic are significantly higher compared to the prevailing rates at other polyclinics.",
