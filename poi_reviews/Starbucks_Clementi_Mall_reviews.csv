Lina Lim,3,"Too many people. People who did not buy starbucks drink also sitting there. People using extension plugs too. Sacarstic.

New drink, Sea Breeze Mint Chocolate Coffee FrappuccinoÂ® (Less Sweet), taste is really less sweet. Not much mint taste too.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107917244728844048910/reviews

Astraeus Tu,5,"Had a cup of hot american brewed here while waiting for my student to arrive for tuition. I stayed here between 5:30 to 7:30pm, while there are always quite a few free seats, so this is a quite ideal place for everyone who wants to study/work in a cafe. Staff are friendly and efficient, the coffee they prepared are quite nice. The location is also fantastic, just the first store to see after walking out of mrt, or one level up from the bus interchange",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112508317414544824402/reviews
