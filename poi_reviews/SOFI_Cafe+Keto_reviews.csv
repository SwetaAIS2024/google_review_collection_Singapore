Niya Noneva,5,"A wonderful cafe with a cosy feel and delicious keto options. The staff were really welcoming and attentive, recommending must-try items on the menu. We really enjoyed the meal, all the food had a home-made feel to it and we even got a keto cookie for later. Highly recommend!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112379468836381673073/reviews
Cyndi Poh,5,"So happy they moved nearer to my place (they used to be on Craig road, right in front of my blk!). They still maintained their standards, only remembered to take photo of one dish lol.

Philip,3,"It’s not bad taste wise. Pretty good. Main issue is as a keto place I really wish you provided estimate of carbs per dish. Otherwise I don’t really feel comfortable ordering something like keto pizza or keto pasta, and potentially kicking myself out of keto.

Some people may be fine with just “low carb”, but if someone is serious about staying in high ketosis counting carbs is a necessity.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101373269902423824179/reviews

Astra 08,5,"Was here with my family for  a special occasion  , and I must say this is a gem of a place ( it is  co-located with pasta brava) !! From the ambience to the extensive food and drinks menu that can cater for all palates - non vegetarian , vegetarian , western , Asian fusion, and most importantly keto !!! It’s amazing how from their starters , to main courses , to desserts and drinks - they have keto options for all !!!had the Keto white sangria , Berries cookies and cream , the keto vegetarian burger sliders and the eggplant with parmesan cheese . It was really awesome and yummy - I didn’t feel like I was deprived of good food at all !!! :) Sofi , the owner of this place - came to speak to us to ask us how the dishes were and was so warm and happy to explain things to us which made our dining experience even more pleasurable :) and every single member of her sofi cafe team who worked here on 9 Feb 2023 evening was all smiles and so service orientated ( sorry I was unable to catch all their names ) . Eric who attended to us was very warm. Highly recommended for food , drinks , service and ambience . Recommended for birthdays , anniversaries , normal occasions , with family and kids too !!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118115272104887731691/reviews
