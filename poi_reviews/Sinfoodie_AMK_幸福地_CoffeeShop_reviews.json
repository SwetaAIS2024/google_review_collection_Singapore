      "text": "This coffeeshop offers an impressive variety of food stalls, ranging from local delights like fish soup, ban mian, and cai fan to heartier options like mookata and Western cuisine. It's a great spot for anyone craving diverse choices, and it attracts a mixed crowd of youngsters, families, and office-goers. Here’s a breakdown of my experience:\n\nPorridge (11 Dec 2024): Sadly, this was a letdown. I had it after visiting the nearby clinic, hoping for something comforting. The pork had a strange taste that made me feel worse instead of better.\n\nMookata (10 Jan 2025): Absolutely worth it! The protein buffet was generous, and the hot plate was spotless. This stall is a crowd favorite, and it’s easy to see why. I hope it stays around for the long haul!\n\nFish Soup & Ban Mian (various days): Consistently good! The food is tasty, and the portions are satisfying. Definitely my go-to for a healthy option.\n\nWestern (15 Jan 2025): The food itself was tasty, and the portions were generous. Unfortunately, the experience was marred by dirty, oily cutlery. I had to spend time cleaning it before eating, which was disappointing.\n\nThis place has potential, but a bit more attention to cleanliness could make it even better. Looking forward to trying the other stalls!",

      "text": "Driving along and saw the coffeeshop with corner of my eye, and so decided to explore if there’s any food stall that can satisfy my palate.\n\nInitially I thought this was gonna be one of those “dying” coffeeshop with not much stalls open, turn out the product mix was quite alright. In fact I think it’s pretty impressive as I consider this coffeeshop hidden.\n\nThere’s no gantry for the car park, therefore “free parking” at your own risk.\n\nHad Korean food- not bad, not bad.",

      "text": "Bought a canned drink and the stall lady gave a disposable cup with ice assuming i was dining in. After i requested a cover for the 'disposable cup', i was informed to pay additional 30cent for the cover.\n\nDoes it make sense to serve disposable cups for dine in at no charges but charge 30 cents for the lid if i wish to take the cup away?\n\nno doubt the food variety are great but some things just doesnt make sense in a coffee shop setting",

      "text": "Today I ordered mixed vegetable rice from the economical vegetable rice stall in this coffee shop, which came with fried shrimp paste chicken, fried potatoes and fried bitter gourd. The total charge was $5.80. To be honest, the price is a bit expensive. Similar portions are sold in coffee shops in the AMK area, which include two dishes and one meat, and the price is less than $5. Although the taste of the food was average, the fried chicken was a bit too dry, and the portion of rice was a bit small, considering the price, it didn't feel like value for money. If the stall can make some price adjustments, it may attract more repeat customers.",
