Yvonne L.,3,"Wanted to go Kent Ridge Wing Zone C, not much information on how to walk when exit from Kent Ridge MRT. Ended up walk one big round to the back of the eatery places. I overheard another pax was asking a staff, then realised have to take a lift to level 4, cross over the linkway and you will be at Zone C. Kindly put up a proper signboard telling people how to walk to Kent Ridge Wing Zone C.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105932945745187214695/reviews
Ms Ang,1,"Doctors are very nice but the pharmacists work very slowly. Many of them were talking to each other. :( Waited for close to an hour for one medicine. Spent more time waiting for medicine than completing my procedure.

In the end, found out the the person registering me at the pharmacy did not give me the number for collection and they use a different number at the pharmacy.ðŸ˜£",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105383698813911661663/reviews
Peace-loving Cat,5,"Have had good experiences most of the time at the pharmacy and 2 clinics I've been to as the staff attending to us are polite, efficient and approachable (eg. Can enquire with receptionist if your ticket hasn't been called after the estimated/average waiting time).",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111005175157637855597/reviews
