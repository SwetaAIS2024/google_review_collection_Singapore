PAPA STEVE,5,"Futuristic Vibes & Fantastic Coffee!

2050 COFFEE is a must-visit for coffee lovers who enjoy both innovation and great brews. The futuristic interior creates a sleek, modern atmosphere that makes the experience even more enjoyable.

They have cold brew and matcha on dispenser, which is super convenient, plus freshly brewed coffee options for those who prefer a handcrafted touch. My latte was smooth and perfectly balanced—exactly what I needed!

Always love seeing new coffee concepts, and this one is definitely ahead of its time. Can’t wait to be back!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109168306208664139357/reviews
Farrhan Nyong,4,"Product or Service Quality
I had their Iced Americano Regular House Blend (Dark), and it wasn't overly burnt or acidic. It was good.

Customer Service
Customer service was great. I was warmly welcomed at the start and bade farewell at the end. Coffee was served quickly.

Value for Money
The price is average and comparable to most outlets.

Cleanliness and Environment
The place has a very cool, futuristic vibe that's worth a visit. The air conditioning was strong, and the music was nice. There are no tables, but that's not a major issue.

Consistency and Reliability
This was my first visit, so I can't really comment on consistency.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100618397564321501047/reviews
You K,4,"Right in the middle of the shophouses along Beach Road, there’s a white-walled café with a sign that says “2050”.
Naturally, I assumed it was some kind of futuristic-themed place…
But nope—it turns out the name is a nod to the real-world “2050 problem.” And oddly enough, that made me like it even more.

The interior? Minimalist to the max. Some might say stark. No unnecessary fluff—just you, your thoughts, and caffeine. The menu? Even more minimalist. No food, just coffee. They mean business.

I ordered an iced coffee, which came from a tap—yes, a tap! It gave me vending machine vibes for a split second, but the aroma and flavor quickly reminded me this was no joke. Delicious and robust.

The staff didn’t seem like coffee scholars or anything, but hey, they didn’t need to be. The whole vibe is “keep it simple,” and they stuck to it.

Yes, the prices might be a tad on the high side—but honestly, with coffee this good, I’m not complaining. There’s no clear mention if proceeds go toward solving the actual 2050 problem, but I’d like to think that supporting good coffee is a noble cause in itself.
Here’s to hoping we can keep sipping great coffee well into the future!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114290941081043664370/reviews

Serene Costner,5,"2050 Coffee nails the vibes with its super stylish decor. The space is trendy and perfect for chilling or catching up, even if the coffee and latte art didn’t quite hit the mark. It's worth a visit for the ambience alone!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112949592572907255922/reviews
