It was surprising and new because all of the congregants were young people. I never imagined that we would be able to hold a worship service so full of grace in Singapore.\n\nThe praise team's praise, the choir's singing, the pastor's sermon, and the delicious table fellowship after the service were all so good and perfect.\n\nIf you visit Singapore, I highly recommend attending. We sincerely thank you for your warm hospitality to our traveler family.",
