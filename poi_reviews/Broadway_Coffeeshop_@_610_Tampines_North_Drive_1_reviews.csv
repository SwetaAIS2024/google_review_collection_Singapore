Cheryl Fong,1,Was charged $4.20 for a pack of rice with dishes from the list of options for budget meals. Was told I should have informed them I wanted to get the budget meal as they would have scooped smaller portions for me. It is not even clearly stated that patrons had to inform them of the preference for budget meals beforehand! ðŸ˜¡,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106600428928069719936/reviews
Isaac Ho,3,"As mention by others price for YTF is going up but taste of the food pretty good hence not much reason to complain as they will segregate between fried food and soupy stuff.

Economic rice is not economic anymore photo attached is what I just brought today for $5. (2meat)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104362227138710255618/reviews
Barbette Strauss,2,"We went down on purpose to explore the newly developed Tampines North area where the pioneer batch of BTO flats and the newly set up amenities are.  The tables and food trays were very dirty with sticky stains on them even though there are cleaners. They can do a lot better than that especially when much older coffee shops have far surpassed such standards of hygiene!  All stall holders are friendly and polite in general.  The duck meat at the roasted meat stall isnâ€™t fresh and thereâ€™s hardly any duck meat except for very thick layers of fats and bones. It was challenging trying to filter thru the pile for any meat so we wonâ€™t eat from this stall again.  The noodle stallâ€™s food is palatable but the soup that came with it had too strong a peppery taste given our hot and humid climate. The vegetarian stallâ€™s food seems to be good with quite a generous serving.  Yong Tau Foo stall is a hot popular there. The drink stall was set up with an opulent looking image of whatâ€™s available over their counter. However, thereâ€™s a lot of room for improvement where cleanliness of this coffee shop is concerned. And this is of paramount importance given the worrying situation of the widespread covid now in the country.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116995110127835257886/reviews
Shan Leong,4,"This can consider a new coffee shop, there are a wide variety of food which taste not bad. I will recommend the YTF, Mee Pok, Roast Meat and Mini Wok. The environment is bright and have sufficient seats. But although during lunch time is crowded. For drivers, there are sufficient parking lots behind. Overall will recommend this place for  a decent meal if you are nearby.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113138367268114769094/reviews
Chat Ly,1,"Has extremely rude cleaner. Sign need indicate properly not to return tray when that place looked like the place to return the tray. An auntie looks like the leader in charge of the tray return clearance, shouted rudely . I am extremely offended by her shouting and attitude. She could have say it nicely, why shout ? Pathetic, maybe her life already sucks, hence she is like this. Not going to be empathy and sympathy by her snobbish rude attitude. Wont ever return to eat again.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107692535579749997761/reviews
