Melene Loo,5,"building's exterior may look unassuming or even a lil spooky but the inside is really cozy and homely! lovely space, limited tables but plenty of seats

if you really want a table, they have a table booking system you can use to ensure you have one when you get there!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102904063770296029909/reviews
Andrew Tan,5,"This library has existed for decades since my birth. Now, my daughters have followed in my footsteps and borrowed their first book from this library. I hope the revamp don't change the look and feel too much as we need to preserve heritage and legacy as it is.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100064065631123526331/reviews
C Irene,4,"The library has a reasonable collection and a quiet room so you would expect it to be totally quiet. Unfortunately, it's used as an office when I was there, even when there is a sign to stay quiet hung on the wall. Perhaps a sign should be on the glass door in all 4 languages.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118420782488606352263/reviews
Flo G,5,"Nostalgia a plenty in this well preserved library that houses many childhood memories for some.

Located in the quiet side of Queenstown facing sky residences @ Dawson, short walk from Queenstown MRT, a cozy library to spend your time here.

2 levels served by a lift & stairs, lots of reading areas and I particularly enjoy the level 2 quiet reading room facing the greenery.

There are lots of nostalgia and nice touches to this library.

Take your time to explore, read, borrow or exchange. what a privilege!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113094459489500763998/reviews
D L,4,"Had a great kids day out at this library. All the staff are so helpful, all the books are very well organised and easily found in the right locations. The selection is decent too! Carpark opposite makes it convenient apart from when it rains, wish they would put a sheltered pedestrian crossing at some point. Will definitely be back when the weather is good.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107200992025664629160/reviews
