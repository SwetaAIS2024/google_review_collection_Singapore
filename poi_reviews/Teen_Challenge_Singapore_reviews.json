      "text": "I want to say that my experience with Teen Challenge Movers has been very positive. From a fuss-free booking for an appointment on WhatsApp, to having the movers come on time and prepared, they came with a 14 foot hydraulic truck ðŸšš and four strong men. They brought packaging and all the necessary items. Being pregnant, I appreciated the professionalism and help I got for moving into my new home for a reasonable and transparent rate. I could even add a detour for a fee to pick up bulky furniture from a different location. I didn't have expensive furniture, so I wasn't worried about damages anyway. I was just thankful for their quick response and efficient service. Thank you Teen Challenge.",
