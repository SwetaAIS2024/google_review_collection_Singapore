CF Goh,5,Highly recommend framers here! I was recommended by carousell artwork seller to come here to stretch & frame my oil based painting. The quote was reasonable and best is the staff really treated the painting very carefully like their own. I asked for their help to cover up the painting as I needed to walk in the rain. They did it without hesitation. I'll be back again if I need more framing services.,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111267171694793830237/reviews
