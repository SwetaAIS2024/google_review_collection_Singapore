Charlotte Goh,5,"Super easy and chill place! We made lipsticks and there were 10 shades to choose from, you can mix colours too. But donâ€™t expect a 1-1 instructor, youâ€™re made to self learn via a youtube video. But itâ€™s fairly easy to follow!

You can get the basic case or top up 10RM for a cuter case of your choice!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107063545219117983595/reviews
