Dr Reviews,4,"Lovely place for some Beautiful pictures.  Idyllic.

No public transport brings you here,  so you will have to walk or cycle or perhaps take a cab.

The walkway is too narrow for comfort,  since you have to watch out for cyclists. Most of the cyclists i met on this route seemed polite though.

Gecko Chua,5,"On 21st August 2020, I ride the bicycle from my place at Buangkok to Punggol Waterways then to Punggol Timor Island. It took me about 45mins.
It was early morning about 8am at Punggol Timor Island, I was simply amazed by the scenery. You can see tall casuarina trees stretching along the coastline.
