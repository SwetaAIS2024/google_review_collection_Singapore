      "text": "Tried their New Year Treat – the Chicken Luncheon, Tamago, and Cheese Brioche Bun ($6.90). As someone who’s not really into cheese, I was happy to know it could be omitted upon request. The brioche is toasted, which gives it a crispy texture; it’s slightly tough but still delicious, though I can’t quite explain why. The luncheon meat is on the salty side, while the tamago lacks much flavor, but together they create a good balance.\n\nI also spotted a tray of Starbucks takeaway cups, which turned out to be free coffee grounds. I learned you can extend their life by using them as a body scrub, in gardening, or to neutralize odors. From grounds to garden – a nice little bonus!",
