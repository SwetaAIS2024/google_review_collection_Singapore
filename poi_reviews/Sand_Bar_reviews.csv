Ravi Goel,2,"Pathetic service, arrogant staff. Empty bar is just a representation of why people in their right mind dont want to come here, at least not again.
This pic reflects why they charge extra for no ice, because they will be shamed for giving only half a glass juice.
There menu is very basic, just a couple of options.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105577538732023055519/reviews
Kanishka Randunu,4,31st night NYE Countdown party was amazing. Nice vibe. Nice surroundings. Music was great. Not happy much about the service and attitude of some working people. But I guess it is due to 31st being overcrowded. Could see the drone event and fireworks at the palawan beach from here. Great experience. Recommended if you want to chill and party.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112160003419585301353/reviews
CLAUDIA,5,"Went here on Sat July 30. Didn't planned to go here, we were just aiming for the beach. But the place is quite nice, you can climb in and out to the beach and bar :D but there's a minimum charge to dine in. So we ordered quite a package but we ended up ordering even more.

The platter was nice, it got taco's, smoked duck, chicken, beef and salmon, corns and fries. All are okay, nice and gives you appetite. The satay is also very good, I love it!!! I just hope you can put more light bites on the menu and give more flavor from around the country.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101326162616938572046/reviews
Sam Toh (Sammy),5,"Went to Palawan Beach on a weekend and decided to hop into Sand Bar to have some Bar snacks and beer. Staffs are attentive and friendly. Check out this place if you are looking for somewhere to chill at the beach. The area is barricaded with ropes so you can leave your belongings there while your kids play around there. Other than beer, check out their cocktail too.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110777175975209979259/reviews
Gh Tan,5,The service staff are very responsive and fast. They moved like ninjas and ensured that our bucket of ice was always filled. All requests and orders arrived so prompted everyone at the table actually noticed and commented about the impeccable service!  Even the huge bouncer was so friendly!
