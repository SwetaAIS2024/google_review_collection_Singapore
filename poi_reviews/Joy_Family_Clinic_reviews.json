      "text": "\"Wait la, the doctor is still writing!\" The reply given when I asked if my turn was next and one of the 3 receps looked up from her phone, and said \"Yes, after this.\"\n\"After this\" meaning...? The patient had exited a couple of minutes ago. So I mentioned that and that rude reply given by another recep - a more senior one maybe?\n\"Why was I so impatient? Can't I wait for my name to be called?\" - that was the implied message beneath it.\nWas she unhappy with her life, her job? We are patients to the clinic, ill and waited for 2hours to see the doctor. I don't think a polite reply is difficult to be uttered. Or a simple \"We will call your name when the doctor is ready to see you.\"\nLast visit to this clinic. They won't miss me since they're always busy but just to inform future/potential patients.",
