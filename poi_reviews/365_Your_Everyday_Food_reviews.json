      "text": "One of the few places where I noticed with every bite that they used freshest ingredients and still kept the prices affordable. Vegetarian Minestrone Soup is my personal favourite as of now. Soup’s not in the menu near the entrance but it’s on the screen. The assorted hummus are delicious but this branch didn’t have all the flavours. I recommend going to their flagship store Asian Twist by 365 Food. My friends found the veggie bowl (fun guy) really really good. 10/10",

Chef Kenneth also very specific about how to eat it, to ensure the taste and texture at its best! A bit expensive ah $91 but it was actually quite good! Coco and loki love it too! We finished everything on one sitting!",

They also serve good traditional coffee as well as decent selections of home made cakes and cold brewed teas.\n\nThe place itself is spacious and comfortable. Surprisingly not much office crowd even during lunch hour. Expect to spend at least $10 for food and drink.",

Will come back if I’m in the area.\nWish their utensils and cutlery for dine in was more environmentally friendly though, everything was disposable plastic.",
