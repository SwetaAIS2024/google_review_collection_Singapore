      "text": "Fusion Spoon is a casual self-service restaurant in Singapore that feels like a high-end food court, offering a wide variety of local and international dishes in a bright, relaxed setting. The space is especially pleasant, with lots of natural light from its glass façade and a comfortable, unhurried vibe — and it wasn’t crowded during my visit.\n\nI had the Nasi Lemak Chicken Burger from the Chef Mel Dean collaboration menu, which was interesting and enjoyable, though the fries were fairly average. Do note that this isn’t food court pricing — my meal came in at over $20. Still, for the setting and variety, I’d rate it a solid 4 out of 5.",

The rice is separated well, not too dry, with some tomato sauce giving it a slight sourness. The veggies and ham provides a good variety of flavours, the cheese is very well baked, some having a crust while not burnt. Overall very decent food, just that it is slightly bland, but very simple and quite affordable.",

Unfortunately, the experience was disappointing.\n\nThe Nasi Lemak rice was dry, and the fried chicken portion was small and underwhelming. The only redeeming elements were the cucumber slice and ikan bilis.\n\nAs for the Aglio Olio, it was also dry, with a small portion size that didn’t justify the price.\n\nOverall, it’s definitely not worth the trip for these dishes.",
