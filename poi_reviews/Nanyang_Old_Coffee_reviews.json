      "text": "I tried the traditional breakfast with a kopi O kosong (black coffee no sugar). I also added a traditional cassava dessert on the side.\n\nWhat I liked about this is the quick service. Moreover, they have already peeled the eggs for you. The ambience is outstanding and it feels like you get teleported back to previous years.\n\nI liked as well the nonya (traditional dessert) they sell. It was a cassava topped with something orangy sweet.\n\nThe price is a bit higher compared to other stores but you are also paying for access to their mini museum. So I think it is worth it.\n\nGo early so there will be less people. They have both indoor and outdoor tables.",

Coffee looks delicious but we wanted a light drink for this warm humid weather.\n\nI got plum lemon green tea. I thought it was good but a bit too salty. The name did not include “salt”. So I was not expecting it.  It was refreshing and had slivers of jelly fruit at bottom",
