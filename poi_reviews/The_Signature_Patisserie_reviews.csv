YEE SIN SAW,5,"I tried the Matcha Burnt Cheesecake and Matcha Latte‚Äîboth were delicious. The atmosphere was pleasant, not too crowded, and the staff were friendly. I also took away two muffins, and they tasted great as well. Definitely planning to revisit.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116951693315655180929/reviews
Ling Ling Woo,5,"rly love the food at TSP!! there multiple times and the service is always exceptional. most recently, i went there for their hojicha latte and matcha cheesecake. the hojicha latte was rly thick and tasty (they apparently use powder from Niko Neko!). the cheesecake was so creamy and soft - it was rly so goodd

Sairam Subramanian,4,"Tastewise pretty good. But very overpriced and service was okayish. That's the reason I'm giving a 4 and not 5.
Very spacious , have good seating both inside and outside. But You have to go to the counter to order everything. No one comes to check in on anything.
$28 is too high for a breakfast platter when you have that kind of service.
Oatmilk latte was good. Asked it to be heated up more and they obliged.
Platter - Salad was good, scrambled eggs were yummy.
So no issue on quality of food. I'd come here more often if it was slightly better priced. Also almost no veg options but can't really complain on that..",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115140538874299582015/reviews
E G,5,"One of my most favourite cafes !! üíØü§©
I have visited this cafe three times already and the quality/taste of the food and coffee have always been consistent. Would recommend to try the TSP white coffee as the saltiness of the cream goes really well with the coffee. The har cheong gai waffles is   also a must try!
The cafe offers tissue and water which I appreciate as not all cafes provide that now.
Overall, I highly recommend this cafe as the ambience, service and food are exceptional ü§©",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102022990084172946541/reviews
