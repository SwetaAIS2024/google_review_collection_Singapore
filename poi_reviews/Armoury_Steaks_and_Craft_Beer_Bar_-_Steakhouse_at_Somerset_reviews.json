Staff were polite and attentive.\n\nOrdered the steak with their in-house sauce. The steak was OK. It was cooked unevenly. Ordered for medium, bottom half was quite rare, and top half was fully cooked. Steak was a bit gamey. The sauce, satay, and mashed potatoes were delicious.",

      "text": "The food is served quickly, but the Wagyu burger from the steakhouse is quite oily, and the patty is on the dry side. The fries are decent—best enjoyed while hot—but not the best I’ve had.\n\nThe place was quiet on a Wednesday evening at 7 PM, with less than 30% occupancy. Water was served promptly after being seated, and the staff was friendly. They even offered 2 free drink in exchange for a Google review.\n\nI tried the Radler beer (300ml, $6), which was sweet and refreshing, and the Yakult soju (250ml), also sweet—perfect for first-time drinkers. They also have happy hour deals on alcohol from 11:30 AM to 8 PM, with prices ranging from $5 to $7.",

The place was clean, there was ample space between tables, and the music didn’t overwhelm conversations. The food quality was great for the price. Best of all was the service provided by the servers. They were all very attentive to our needs and super friendly, especially Danica! She made sure we were well taken care of and even made small conversations with us! Would definitely come by again :)",
