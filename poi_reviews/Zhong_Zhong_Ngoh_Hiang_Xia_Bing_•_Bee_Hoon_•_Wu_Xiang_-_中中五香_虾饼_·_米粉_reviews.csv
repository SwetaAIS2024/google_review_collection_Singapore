Pak Ming,5,"Superb hospitality from uncle and auntie every single time i visit the store… ngoh hiang, hey zhou, tofu and prawn cracker is consistently amazing as well… my family eat wu xiang a lot and we all agree that this stall is the best in SG… Two thumbs up!

Edit: Auntie prides her unique way of wrapping the food as it prevents the items from getting soggy 😂",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103613843139100881937/reviews
Sam Wong,5,"Very good ngoh hiang in the west! I’m spoilt for choice with the variety of food items to choose from, and everything is fried upon order.

Apart from the standard chilli, the homemade chilli is great as well! Spicy with a tinge of tang. Will come again soon 👍🏻",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117245155832826697361/reviews

Mok HonMing,5,"The ngoh hiang is very nice, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I don't usually eat ngoh hiang, but decided to give this stall a try as other stalls are closed in this kopitiam, and it is the best decision I have made.

The food are freshly fried, biting into the food can already know the oil is fresh as there's no funky taste or dark coloured/charred looking stains on them. Not like many other stalls I tried in SG where the food are re-fried many times and their oil don't know used how long never change.

The owners, Uncle and auntie are very friendly too, can see that they work very hard and is committed to serve good food 👍 price is very reasonable also for the food quality served

Overall 10/10, thumbs up will definitely come back again",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118122754499887838253/reviews
Pretty Catmint,5,"The stall is tucked away in a one of the tiniest coffee shops I've seen in a quiet neighbourhood. Their kind hospitality and good food makes up for my long commute. Visited this stall three times and the variety offered and taste were consistently good. Loved their non-spicy pink sauce which was nice and yummily sweet. The lady stall owner is always so friendly, almost like a long lost friend. I found their prices reasonable - 5 items for $7.20; 6 items for $11; 7 items for $13 and each of my takeaways included meat and shrimp choices but without bee hoon. Definitely my go to ngoh hiang stall when craving hits. 😊",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116977997313485651700/reviews
