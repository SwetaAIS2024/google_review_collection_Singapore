Poh Leong Ng,4,I called it a hidden gem near one-north. Food is above average and a good selection of menu to choose from. I had the big breakfast and the portion is enough for 2 small eaters. Coffee is aromatic and smooth. Nice muffins too.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102277716143660732726/reviews
Wanting Au,4,"Came here for lunch on a weekday. Ordered the grilled chicken pesto linguine not bad though slightly pricey at $19. Has the standard cafe offerings - brunch options (available during lunch), pasta, steak and salmon. Limited seating area so do come early. Also itâ€™s halal so great for gatherings with colleagues",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105824005447676170526/reviews
Daniel McDougall,5,"Well worth 5 Stars!
Great coffees: we had Cappuccinos - be sure to ask for large. We had the regular blend which was smooth, bitter-free and no need for sugar.
Breakfast - opted for the Avo Smash without egg - easily the best breakfast I've had this month. The textures compliment the food, and the taste - OMG so good! Delicious tang with the Avo Smash, smooth sweet white onions and ?chili oil on top ðŸ‘Œ
Thank you! Will be back for sure!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101404651130881800125/reviews
Adha Miswan,5,"Our go to place to have halal brunch. The outlet we always frequent is the one at Fusionopolis.
The coffee blend changes on a monthly basis, so u get to try different blends. And so far, their blends never fail.
Food is good though. Generous portions.
Staff are super friendly and helpful.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104399656877269093579/reviews
Carmen C.,4,"Edit: portion and service seems better on my second visit.

Salmon is a little overpriced for the size, although taste was fine. Coffee was so so, not strong enough. I've had better coffee in nearby cafes.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102600207564760890320/reviews
