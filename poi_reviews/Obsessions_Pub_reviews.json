      "text": "Worst place ever. The uncle with the long grey hair who I'm guessing is the owner removed my name on the billiards board queue on purpose without any explanation and only told me when I went up to him and asked him why he said because I didn't order a drink yet. I was going to order a drink when I play and tried to explain that him but he told me no your name will go here and he pointed. You know where it was? 4 people that added their name after me. He was doing that on purpose out of anger because I didn't buy a beer right away. Of course I'm going to buy beer just wasn't ordering yet. What an absolute joke of a place. Maybe the other staff is fine but if this is the owner, then he's god awful and I will never step foot in that place again. There's other bars with billiards I've been to that have much better staff and don't pull funny shit like erasing your name and putting it to the end of the queue just to spite you. Worst place ever.  Avoid this place at all costs.",
