Hrmgr,1,"Tried this Mala store for first time but was very disappointed. I picked a large piece of squid tentacles and fish meat along with other ingredients. After collected the cooked dish in a bowl, I already realized it was much less than what I selected. Going through I found only 2 small pieces of the squid and fish which did not make up the big pieces I selected. Some items are so hard while the instant noodle was soggy. Will not patronize again for sure.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113770174448938389729/reviews
Men in Black 2,4,"14 Aug 2022
I came back here to eat the curry rice for takeaway. One fried fish, taugeh, fried egg, mince pork fried tofu. $5.50. Plus one yuan yang from drinks stall. Not too bad because got two meat. Taste is acceptable.
My wifey ordered Tom yum carrot cake, XO fried rice with pork cutlet. Quite heaty as I ate and got scratchy throat lol
The yuan yang in a cup is quite messy though. Too soft I press it spill out. The straw also so soft can‚Äôt push in easily. Use packet will be easier.

I‚Äôm actually quite ok with the Hainanese curry rice stall. Not too bad in terms of taste and most of all the price I thought quite reasonable.

First visit in July 2022
That‚Äôs what I ate for my brunch as I missed my breakfast. The curry/Nonya mutton with tumeric rice is priced at $6.80 so I thought if I ordered a la carte it would probably be the same. Nowadays economy rice is no longer economy üòÇ

I was quite pleasantly surprised when I ordered plain rice, go lo yok, tau geh, fried egg. Only $3 something. Very fair. I added one more curry vegetable $4.40.
The drinks also ok lah. We had one yuan yang iced and kopi c. About $5.

The bak Chor Mee normal order is $4. Very reasonable.

The deco is also new and comfortable. Looks clean and not full of arid smoke. If I‚Äôm in the neighbourhood having lunch here is no issue I believe. It‚Äôs a simple and easy place to do so.

Enjoy! ‚ò∫Ô∏è",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104072991053122590633/reviews
Ginger Bier,3,"Liking the new look for this coffeeshop :)

However , my family tried a stall at this location called :
Êµ∑ÂçóÂíñÂì©‰ªî
We would only give it 1.5 ‚≠ê.
The only saving grace was the spicy curry and the keropok.
Auntie was not attentive when I was standing there waiting for her to order and there were no other customers. Gave me a  small piece of pork cutlet when I pointed out another bigger piece to her. bear in mind I was the only one standing there and she was taking her time to pick and choose the smaller pieces even though I pointed to her the bigger piece which she picked at first then threw back into the pile then proceeded to chop the smaller piece to seal the deal.üôÑ

Maybe that turned out to be a blessing coz the pork cutlet wasn't fantastic and coated with thick breading.
The mutton curry we ordered was decent actually.
Meatballs were cold and meh.
Sotong had too sweet sauce and overcooked so they were rubbery.

We won't likely come back for the Hainan curry rice since the food seems to be left out for some time  BUT we will try other stalls .",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101652262300830037879/reviews
Wee San Low,4,"This food court is a total renovated from the former coffee shop below a HDB. The place is currently new and clean. There are many varieties of food offered and the price is on a slightly higher end. Hopefully, the stalls will be able to maintain their business as the location, Holland Close, is quite deep inside the Holland neighborhood.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104193174503991545162/reviews
