There wasn’t any free staff at noon time to ask about how I had to go about redeeming it - so I queued at the checkout queue and the cashier kindly pointed out to me where I could find it. Redemption process was smooth - just click Redeem button and show the barcode to the cashier, who would scan it (and thus it’s done!).",
