      "text": "Just found a hidden gem‚ÄîCluny Court‚Äîand it seriously felt like I was overseas for a moment. It‚Äôs right next to Botanic Gardens MRT, but the vibe is so different from the usual city spots. The place has this old-school charm with colonial-style architecture and a really chill, heritage feel.\n\nThere are cute little cafes, boutique stores, and lifestyle shops that make you want to slow down and just explore. Perfect spot for a quiet brunch or coffee, especially if you're heading to or from the Botanic Gardens. Definitely one of those places that makes you feel like you‚Äôve escaped the usual routine. I‚Äôll be back for sure.",

      "text": "üü° Cluny Court at Cluny Road is just across the road from Botanic Gardens MRT Station.\n\nüü° This small retail mall is only 2 levels high, and is situated within a revamped row of colonial shophouses. It's located in a quiet upscale residential area and has a relaxing & nostalgic ambience.\n\nüîµ The stores and dining options here are limited & are premium type of shops.\n\nüü© The CS Fresh aka Cold Storage supermarket & dining outlets are usually the busier shops. ‚úÖÔ∏è There is Tiong Bahru Bakery, Da Paulo Cafe, Simply Bread, a Korean eatery, a hair salon, an ice cream store, pet shop and others.\n\n‚ùáÔ∏è I do drop by Cluny Court from time to time to buy stuff from the supermarket and have a coffee and buy pre-prepared food from Da Paulo. I like the soothing ambience of this small mall on a weekday afternoon.\n\nüü®It is kind of easy for me to access Cluny Court as I live in Toa Payoh and can visit this area via Caldecott Station to Botanic Gardens Station.",
