A pity that they did not accept drink orders for bigger purchases and said only advanced orders can get drinks also… … but… … I only wanted one box or 8 cups of hot drinks. Anyway, they did not wanna offer me an alternative. So we bought drinks from reliable Ya Kun instead.",

She bang the cover of ice container I guess, all the act that she’s doing makes her customers disappointed and unhappy. This not even deserved any star. This lady is so rude to the customer and not even felt sorry for her rudeness! Totally disrespectful. I have been to your other brach but all is kind. Please look on to her, she will push away your sales and customer. Thank you",
