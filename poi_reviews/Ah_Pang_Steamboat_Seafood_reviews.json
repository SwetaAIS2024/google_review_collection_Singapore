      "text": "No branded hotpot or premium meat and seafood but we agree unanimously that nothing beats this comforting and back to basics steamboat.\nWhat we like best is the fresh ingredients and simple, old-fashioned chicken broth and soy beans base that gets more flavourful as we add the ingredients in the soup. We skipped the set and ordered individual plates of ingredients including sliced fish, beef, fish dumplings, cockles and vegetables.\nSadly, they are no longer serving zi char dishes [yes! I miss the ‚Äòpong pong‚Äô prawn fritters] but there‚Äôs still the old school steamboat that we can enjoy and appreciate.",

The service was friendly and efficient, and the casual atmosphere made for a relaxed dining experience. My only minor gripe was that the wait times for refills could be a bit long during peak hours. Overall, a solid choice for a tasty and enjoyable steamboat meal!",

      "text": "A comforting steamboat meal with fresh ingredients and a simple yet flavourful broth. My family and I ordered the 3 pax steamboat set with 3 bowls of rice which totaled up to $52 (vegetables and 2 eggs were indicated as FOC).\n\nThey provided a homemade chilli sauce (very spicy but tasty), along with soya sauce and garlic for dipping. Additionally, a WHOLE box of tissues were provided which we appreciated.\n\nIn terms of the location, the open-air hawker setting had great ventilation with fans and high ceilings, making it comfortable to eat.\n\nWill definitely be back!",
