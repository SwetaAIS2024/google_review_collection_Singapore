Xingshun Qu,1,"Very bad place, it is a nightmare for me. I live nearby, this church was renovated at first, the noise was very loud, but it is understandable.

But after the renovation of this church, the alarm bells often rang; the sound seriously affected the nearby residents. One time, the alarm bells rang from 1am to 5am on the night of 25th Feb; the second time was on 7th Apr when the place held a sports meeting and used high-power speakers.

This time, the alarm bells rang again at 3am on 28th Apr. Its existence makes it impossible for people to live a normal life, and it is completely torturing the nearby residents.

This place that does such immoral things will probably not be saved by God, but will straightly go to hell.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108013647597265148976/reviews
