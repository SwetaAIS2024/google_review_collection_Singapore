Skye Cai,5,"Nice coffee server.
Tried the skim milk latte. it’s smooth and barista Vivian is really experienced. Her skill has made the bean’s taste fully developed. The milk is not too hot just nice to finish the whole cup when it’s served hot.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103575601236373049278/reviews
Subhajit Mandal,5,"A personal favourite

Small little place. Serves great finger food. Their gyoza and fries are great. Beer pricing is SUPERB. 12$(1 for 1)

Great service. A very good whiskey collection as well!

Always some good music playing as well",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105660226831870927775/reviews
YC Boey,4,Decent place to enjoy a cuppa especially in the morning and lunch. But evening time i guess wine and whiskey takes over. Not sure about the lunch ie eating selections but for a quick bite and no queue ok lah. But coffee is good hence 4 stars and service ok. Just next door sells wine and with same servers... enjoy,5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115074167615696150293/reviews

Dedi Nigolan,3,"The food was decent. I ordered a $17 wonton ramen, and the prawns were large and fresh. However, being given disposable chopsticks at that price point felt like disappointing",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109343894763606756833/reviews
