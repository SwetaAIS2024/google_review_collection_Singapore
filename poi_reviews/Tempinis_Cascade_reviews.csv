Forest BK,5,"ðŸ’¦Tampinis Cascade is one of the 3 man-made waterfalls located along the Imbiah Trail.
ðŸ’¦The trickling sound of the cascading waterfall could be heard as you approach it.
ðŸ’¦The waterfall is a welcome deviation from the lush greenery.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Bobojam,5,"Explored Tempinis Cascade at Sentosa on sun morning. The weather was breezy and our walk from Vivo to Sentosa was enjoyable. There are directory map along the way if you are a bad navigator like meðŸ˜…. Closer to the park, we met many peacocks, a pair of hornbill, greater racket-tailed drongo and white belly eagle. It was a peaceful and adventurous walk since there was no crowd! It was shaded in most areas and it wasnâ€™t a hectic trail. No tickets requiredðŸ˜ƒ",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112564684295061498928/reviews
Rachel Ang,5,"A water feature that acts like a simple waterfall with a very small, gentle stream of water flowing down its rocks and structure. It's not as big or powerful as a regular waterfall, but it still adds a nice touch to gardens or parks. Imagine a small hill or rocks with water trickling down them softly, creating a calming sound. The water moves slowly and gracefully, creating ripples and reflections
Surrounded by plants or flowers thats adding to the peaceful atmosphere.If you're lucky u can see birds yhaymight come to drink from the water, and butterflies might flutter around it. People can sit nearby and enjoy the tranquility, maybe even dipping their fingers in the cool water. It's a simple but lovely addition to the outdoor space, bringing a touch of nature and relaxation to those who experience it.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108373877859995350105/reviews
