Forest BK,5,"ðŸŒ³The serene trail loop around the natural vegations of the forested area of Rifle Range Nature Park.
ðŸŒ³Linking up with Banyan Trail, the trail hike along lush greenery passing through a small stream with clusters of Banyan trees.
ðŸŒ³The Trail terrain consist of gravel paths, and stairs that can get slippery on wet days.
The Trail is well shaded and is comfortable hiking around even in a hot day.
ðŸŒ¿Fun fact:
Part of Gaharu Trail was once Jalan Gaharu, a road that was expunged when Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) was built.
The Gaharu was another name for the Agarwood, a sort after fragrant wood. It is an endangered tree in Asia due to over harvesting.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
Sherab Tenzin,4,"Great hiking trail connecting MacRitchie Nature Park and Bukit Timah Park.

It's an extension of newly opened Riffle Range Hiking trail.

The trail is good for nature and durian lovers. Since concrete railings are new, it's also good for family outings.

When it rains, the trail becomes bit muddy and slippery in parts where there is no concrete railings or boardwalk, please wear proper footwears.

The highlight of the trail of viewpoint of Hindhede Quarry pond and also hiking downhill for the pond.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115240875636662687058/reviews
Jeffrey C,5,"Glad to be back at Gaharu Trail with the trail now re-opened along with the rest of Rifle Range Park.
It feels slightly wider now and more â€˜runableâ€™. But it does feel abit more curated.
This is a good option for those looking to move away from the crowd at Rifle Range Park.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106833163410885808643/reviews

Tze Wei Sim,3,"Nice trail for nature lovers as well as durian lovers, many durian trees are planted along the trail, also known as durian loop. Many come to pick durians during the durian season. Trails may be very muddy and slippery with puddles during the rainy season. Do wear appropriate footwear.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113699931018806718289/reviews
