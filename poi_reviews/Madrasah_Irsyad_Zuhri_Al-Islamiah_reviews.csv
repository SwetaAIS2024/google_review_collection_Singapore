peku ms,3,"hi i’m a graduate of this school, class of 2021. the school offers excellent academic preparation, particularly for PSLE, with numerous mock tests and extra classes for students needing help in specific subjects. however, socially, many students tend to be self-centred, two-faced etc. if your child is not easily influenced by the behaviour of others, i would recommend this school for its strong academic support",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111360204247909238717/reviews

Ya Habibi 666,3,School is halal but not at the same time. The students there act like they self entitled and should respect the teachers more. Parents should stop complaining and teach their children manners instead of scolding the teacher on how to do their job☺️,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105714839475115204240/reviews
