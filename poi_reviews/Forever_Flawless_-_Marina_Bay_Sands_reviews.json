      "text": "The device and products work; it is only fair it works somehow with their price range. There is much competition in the market; that gives consumers many options. Good services may be able to keep a number of clients, what I detest is hard sell. After the purchase, you would be given trial facials, I found they are not bad. So I bought the facials.  Even that, it is not enough for the company, they would track your visits and attacked with more sale talks. My facial visits turned out to be stressful and sometimes I don't want to go. So, I am hoping they know the limits.  The desperate sale tactics are ugly to witness.  I begin to hate visiting the spa.  Did I sign up for stress? Life itself is not easy, spare us!",
