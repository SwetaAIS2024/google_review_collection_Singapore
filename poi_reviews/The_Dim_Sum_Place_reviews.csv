Ming Shen Tham,3,"Ordered take away and considering the location of this place the price of the food is not really that cheap. The wonton noodles was around 10 dollars which is alittle shocking to me considering the food around superbowl is usually cheaper than other places (in fact one of the restaurants in city hall sells cheaper wonton noodles than this)
Despite the ""above average"" price, I found the taste to be relatively lackluster. I wouldn't comment much about the noodles texture since it was a take away hence it was slightly soggy by the time I had it at home. However the sauce and wonton were pretty underwhelming
The dim sums were also pretty forgetful. It felt like some supply chain dim sum where the skin of the bao is abit on the thicker side and not that much fillings. The onyl decent thing was the chee cheong fan with pork in it where the skin was thin.
Overall, would I visit this place again? I would give it a hard yes if I am really really craving for dim sum and trapped in superbowl otherwise I would jus head down to a maccas just nearby this store.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116082735539712168059/reviews
Ma tt,4,"The place serves delightful dim sum, and what made them stand out would be that they are a halal establishment. Located within the superbowl, there are plenty of parking space.

Taste wise, the dim sum were flavourful, but I found them to be a little salty and oily.

My personal favourite would be the Chee cheong fun, which was soft and delicate, only if you could look beyond the price point ($10.90). The prawn version came with prawn paste instead of fresh prawn, which is to me a good thing as it gave a different layer of texture to the dish. Another item that I enjoyed was the deep fried beancurd skin with prawn. They were generous with the interior filling, and the addition of chives elevated the flavours.

Overall, this is a nice place for halal dim sum, if you are looking for one within the Jurong West heartland area.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102382313505418526836/reviews
