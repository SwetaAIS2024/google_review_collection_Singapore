Euphorie Liew,4,"A stall with decent noodles, lady boss was quite approachable and friendly.

My first try was Tom Yum Ban Mian, the soup was quite addictive and the portion was just nice for me. Their ban mian noodles was quite different from others, as it seems to make the soup to become thicker in the middle of my meal.

Then I have tried their Bak Chor Mee, I love the mixture with my mee pok, and generous portion of meat was given too. Though I takeaway, the mee pok was still as good as it is.

Besides that I have ordered their Deep Fried Dumplings, they were juicy and each one was quite meaty.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102306923068386332783/reviews
Moomoo Meok,1,"happened to pass by this coffee shop at around 9pm plus, understand is late hour and the zi char stall is packing up, saw the counter staff at the counter so we try our luck and approached her to ask are they still accepting order, infact we are prepare her to say no and we will leave, no big issue. The counter staff went in to check with the kitchen and came out telling us yes, so we proceeded to place our orders.

When the food was ready, another female staff brought it to our table and placed it on our table rudely while telling us off to come early next time. Hello??? If you are not happy to serve order then just reject our order in the first place, don't accept the order and show us your attitude after that! Nobody pointed a gun at your head to force you to take our order!

Came here to check google reviews and was so amazed by so many 1 star reviews, now I know why! horrible!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106330813604367582015/reviews
