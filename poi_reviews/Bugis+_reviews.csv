Ben Panuts,5,"It is a shopping mall that gathers famous street brands from abroad, such as Adidas, Uniqlo, Owndays. In addition, there are shops that are opened for people who like games / anime or collectibles. Sometimes, there are events that come from the said stories. Another important highlight of the mall is the food sources that gather international restaurants, such as Haidilao Watami Ramen Champion. If you come at noon, some restaurants will have long lines.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114708667205849300566/reviews

Dresden Posęt,5,"I browsed the shops here as I was walking around Bugis. There was a whole array of ships, from clothing stores to restaurants. Also, there's lots of coffee stalls including Starbucks, which was why I dropped by there during my free time to grab a quick cup of coffee. The crowd is a little more than I expected, probably because it is going to be the New Year soon. Overall, a convenient place for you and your friends or family to shop and dine here.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100555790826902422091/reviews
Tim Ezra,5,"Bugis+ at Bugis Junction is a gem in Singapore’s bustling Bugis district! I visited recently and was impressed by its prime location—steps away from the Bugis MRT, making it a breeze to reach. This mall has a vibrant, youthful energy, packed with trendy shops offering everything from stylish clothes to unique accessories.

The upper floors are a treasure trove for fashion lovers, while the lower levels serve up a fantastic mix of food options.

I grabbed a quick bite at one of the affordable korean eateries and later went around window shopping.

The modern design and bright atmosphere make it a fun place to wander, and its seamless connection to Bugis Junction adds even more shopping and dining variety.

Bugis+ is a great spot to shop, eat, and soak in the urban buzz. I’d definitely return for another round of retail therapy and tasty treats.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107288961181819489105/reviews
