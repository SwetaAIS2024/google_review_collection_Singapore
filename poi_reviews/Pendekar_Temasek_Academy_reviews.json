      "text": "I am writing to wholeheartedly recommend Pendekar Temasek Academy [PTA], a renowned institution for learning the traditional martial art of Silat. As a student/santri at the academy, I have witnessed first hand the exceptional instruction, supportive community, and rigorous training that PTA provides.\n\nUnder the guidance of the master himself, Bapak Pendekar Temasek, I have seen students of all ages and skill levels grow in confidence, discipline, and physical prowess. The academy's emphasis on [specific aspects of Silat, e.g., self defence and cultural studies] has been particularly impressive.\n\nI highly recommend PTA to anyone seeking a comprehensive and authentic Silat education. The academy's commitment to excellence, safety, and community makes it an outstanding institution in the world of martial and self-defence.",

      "text": "Our group rented Paman Iskandar's studio for a Silat performance rehearsal.\n\nThe training space is adequate for small group (up to 6pax) training. Clean, spacious, well equipped, air-conditioned. The mirrors and sound systems are definite plus for those practising or rehearsing for performances.\n\nAlthough we did not utilise it, the pantry is a nice, thoughtful addition, with affordable prices for the drinks & snacks.\n\nHaving clean toilets & changing room is a big convenience as we did not need to leave the studio unnecessarily.\n\nThere is also space for parents & spouses to sit at the pantry while waiting and watching us train, without obstructing or taking up the training space.\n\nOverall, the studio is well thought out and a good option as a space for training or rehearsal for small groups, be it martial arts or any performing arts. Will definitely consider renting again should the need arise. Thank you Paman.",
