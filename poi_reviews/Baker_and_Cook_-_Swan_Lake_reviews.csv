Adrian Chan,4,"Came on a weekend morning. Cafe with a nice interior decor and also had outdoor seats. Food is generally nice but realised that the egg were not evenly cooked (in the picture, you could see one of the egg yolk was fully cooked). The queue to order was not long but there was a very long waiting time for our food (which the staff did informed us before hand). Wouldn't mind trying the other bread next time but maybe as a to-go instead.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109957919811943890317/reviews
Bryan Ho,5,"Had dinner on a Valentine‚Äôs Day. Popular location as always with parking a challenge for those driving there (no, I didn‚Äôt)
The establishment itself is very popular and I‚Äôm not surprised with the food great.
You could tell that staff were really busy but still polite (let‚Äôs try to be understanding to them üôè)
Had a long day at work myself so could be empathic with them. Nice crew given the demands of the customers.
Food was great and will come again!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104684224194591733190/reviews
Geraldine Chua,5,"As pet owner, this is my go-to place during our weekend!

Ken Lim,3,"Didn‚Äôt know this place exist.  We decided to drop by for coffee and snack while waiting for our pet to be ready.  It has a nice decor and the place has two sections.  The inner section felt a  a bit warm and there was some funny smell so we took the section nearer to the counter.  I didn‚Äôt actually look at the aircon on top but felt that the cold air should be equally distributed. I had to shift myself to another chair. Within 5 mins.

We ordered both hot and cold Cappuccino.  It looked nice as a whole with crunchy caramel Eclairs.  But it is pretty expensive for the small portion for the food.

As for the drinks, my cold Cappuccino was diluted.  Initially I thought it was due to the ice, but it was the same bitter taste for the warm cappuccino, which clearly lacking of something.  So stay away from that drink.  Quite a disappointment for my first visit.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101577617746748343265/reviews
Blackraven,5,"Comfortable and great service by cheery staff! The BBQ pork ribs were tender and tasty! Pizza was good with soft dough, and comes with chilli flakes and cheese sprinkles. Chicken Tenders with Fries were a great delight, served with chilli and ketchup. Price was reasonable, so a definite must come again another day!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114385515451710838076/reviews
