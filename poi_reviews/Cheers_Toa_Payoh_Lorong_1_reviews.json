      "text": "25/11/2024 @ 11.54pm. went to this outlet to make a purchase, encounter a male staff who was rude.\nI can understand that the staff who doesn't wish to greet any customer, it's fine with me. But does he need to show his displeasure while I'm trying to check out on my purchase. If the pos system can't process self-checkout payment, I don't think it's the customer's fault, right??? Would the cheers management think that it's right for customers to face such an attitude from your employees??? I believe your employees do wish to face unpleasant customers... Well at the end of the day, I asked your staff if I was rude toward him and why he felt that there was a need to be rude to others... and the best thing he did was keep quiet and didn't respond...\n\nDear cheers management, look into your training of your staff. If he is not the right fit, why keep him.",
