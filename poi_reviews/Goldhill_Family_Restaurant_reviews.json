      "text": "super cheap cai fan \"economic rice\" at a nondescript address but with queues forever (they move fast). Due to the large crowds (mostly takeaways) they keep cooking the dishes hence its always hot and yummy. The ONLY reason to be here is really the fried chicken wing ($1.10 per pc ONLY!!!)\n\nIT IS THE BEST in SG and I dare say JB!\nsomehow they are able to make the wings so good that they slide off the bones and the mixture used to coat it is OUT OF THIS WORLD.\n\nLiterally it's the hottest moving dish.\n\nOpens from 8am (people q since 730am)\n\nAfter takeaway it's still nice!",

      "text": "Prices here remains low despite increased cost of living. They still charge 2 veg 1 meat at $2.50. Their best seller is probably their chicken wing, priced at $1.10 each! Freshly fried with great taste, and itâ€™s super crispy!\n\nI ordered 2 chicken wings, long beans, braised tofu, luncheon meat and 2 wu xiang balls and it cost me $5.40.\n\nOther than the chicken wings, the rest of the dishes are just like a typical mixed veg rice stall, nothing shouts out.. but given the price tag, pls expect to wait about 40mins during lunch time. Can refer to the queue from the pic.",

      "text": "Chicken wings for $1.10, super worth. Crispy, salty skin paired with juicy meat.  Always see people takeaway a lot of them. Their other sides taste pretty good too, nostalgic like home-cooked food.\n\nSmall selection of sides but they are tasty :P\n\nMake sure to buy a lot of sides for it to be super filling and still affordable! Especially when buying meat you can order 2 portions lol. I order 1 portion and it's like 4 pieces of meat.\n\nQueue is kind of long but goes by fast enough. There are also a decent amount of seats and a lot of people dabao so you can sit there and eat.",
