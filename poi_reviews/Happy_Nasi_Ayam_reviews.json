      "text": "I had always been buying from this shop for a long time however today for the first time I felt cheated.\n\nI ordered half chicken, 4 rice, 1 wonton chicken mee. Price was as usual. The guys at the counter were not the usual people. Only when leaving then saw one of the usual chinese guys who mend the stall. We said our hellos n good byes as he said thanks for supporting them.\n\nWhen I reach home I was shocked to find my half chicken was not even that. It was like between 1/4-1/2 chicken. I know their serving portion n this was not right at all. The wonton chicken noodle had only 5 small slivers of chicken charsiew. Before I could take photos my wife n son started eating so no pics, sorry.\n\nI felt something was wrong when the two stall holders were whispering and trying to block my view of their packing.\n\nI wish you the best but this is my last time buying from your shop. With this type of game you guys play, I am never going to buy from you again.\n\nI rather spendd my money at the main shop at Ang Mo Kio. At least they know how to take care of customer whether regular or first timer.",
