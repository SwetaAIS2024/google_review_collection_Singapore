K Tan,1,"very poor this zhi char store very bad impression. last time eat here and today encounter when i and my friend sat here then, this zhi char place their utesnils and menu which state 8pm reserved and we didnt mind it as it was still around 6pm. when around 6.30 they confront us to leave as their customer is here.

we had a quarrel with them as they didnt ask nicely and the lady speak with a gangster expression. the cleaner got involve which i dont know when she came to ask us talk peacefully and she said since if we are still eating why not ask the customer to join us. and the stall staff got angry.

we left after i waiting for my takeaway and will never return again. This is the silly rules i heard in zhi char stall, this is coffeeshop not your restuarant.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103116308778198402167/reviews
Sandra Y.,4,"The fish soup stall food is nice, but slightly pricey for the portion. Double fish soup at 8.50sgd. i would advise everyone, especially those who take away their food, to pay extra attention to the food portion or add ons. I have bought fish soup from them and there has been a handful of times they left out the add ons and i only realised it when i reached home. Intentional? I dont know. Today i went back to the shop to feedback, they did top up the add on but there was no apology.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101973540724314501114/reviews

Keok Tong Tan,4,"The vegetarian stall sells at a very reasonable price. You can get a standard set at $3.30 and the portion is sufficient to feed 2 persons.
