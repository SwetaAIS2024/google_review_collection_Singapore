XN DX,1,"Horrible. Mash potato was watery. Female believed to be the supervisor or manager on duty was so loud in the dining area, joking around but it was so loud that it affected my dinner. So disturbing. I am so annoyed, cant even eat in peace. The management should look into staff behaviour and also how they act when representing the company in uniform. It is my first time here and I definitely would not want to patron here anymore.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104215084278665919577/reviews
khrhms,3,"One of the not-so-great outlets that I’ve come across so far. Really cramped sitting area inside the store but plenty of seats inside kopitiam where you can also order from. Chicken was only okay, abit tasteless and does not ‘hit’ like the other outlets, even though it was pretty hot when served. Ordered the new Zinger but it didn’t look like the one in the poster too, and poorly put together. However, portions at this outlet is pretty good. This outlet could definitely improve in terms of quality of food.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104014469499009095905/reviews
