Calbee Cracker,3,"Great option for groups. Indoor and outdoor seatings, bright and airy. Generous portion and reasonable Zhi Char price. Outdoor parking.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110229110724135670872/reviews
LP Pua,3,"The restaurant is located inside a private club but is open to the public. There is free parking from 12 pm to 2 pm (not sure if it's every day or weekdays only). The food was above average, the prices were reasonable, and the atmosphere was good, except that it is an open-air restaurant and not air-conditioned. The service was excellent.

[Edit 8 months later] The food was disappointing. The beef in the Beef Bee Hoon Wokhey was too tough to eat, and the Chengdol was not good.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Dr Ganesh Neelakanta Iyer,3,"Nice atmosphere, fine views, nice wind.

Food quality is ok. But service was very bad.
We have ordered food and it was served very late. Then the ordered sunny dip egg was missing. When asked, she said she forgot and after half of my meal is finished I got my egg.

When reminded about egg, I also requested for some chillies. She asked me what exactly I want, but it was never delivered. Very bad service.

Definitely think twice before going there. Very late delivery and missing items for such  a restaurant is not good.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105411179851009319476/reviews
Angela Y,4,"Relaxing dining with scenic view. The restaurant is spacious and with less than 10 tables occupied on a weekday evening. We ordered a set that came with a curry fish head, stir fried Kai Lan, Chinese egg omelette and 3 pc of papadam at $42+.
The taste of the food was decent and the service was acceptable.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104638910393993915883/reviews
