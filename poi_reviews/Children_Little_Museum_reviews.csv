Kai,5,"Occupies the ground floor of a shophouse unit. Free admission. Filled with many old items such as toys, telephones, cups.

Mr Ang (speaks Mandarin and Hokkien) was happy to have us there and explained that he is ok if we buy or don’t buy anything (quite a few items for sale there). Friendly guy who didn’t mind us sitting in the Vespa, trying to dial his old telephones, taking photos and admiring his items. Probably spent about half hour there with my kids & parents.

Was originally at another location but moved over here to 57 Aliwal Street as monthly rental is lower.

(I think Mr Ang doesn’t seem very tech savvy and might run this museum alone so there may be times that the gate might be closed during the “opening hours”. We just went around to Malay heritage centre to walk one round [free admission for citizens & PR] then came back to check again and he was back! :) )",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113885595031869775639/reviews

Kitiara,5,"The uncle who runs the place (Mr Ang) was really super friendly to us, encouraged us to take pictures and even helped us to take pictures and pose us. I think he took like a billion photos of us all over the museum but it was really a very cute and fun experience! The place was super interesting, and you can even buy the retro and vintage items curated and collected by Mr Ang himself. Super nice place (free entry!!) would definitely recommend to people who like vintage things or people who like to take instagram pictures hehe",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101305211279749919232/reviews
