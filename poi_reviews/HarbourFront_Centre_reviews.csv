The Travel Hunter,5,"I found myself at HarbourFront Centre, and what started as a casual visit turned into a delightful experience. Nestled by the waterfront, the mall’s relaxed and breezy atmosphere instantly set the tone for a perfect day.

I began exploring the array of stores, which ranged from practical outlets to specialty shops. It wasn’t overwhelming but just enough to keep me intrigued. I found a quaint little store with unique travel accessories—perfect for an upcoming trip I’m planning.

Feeling peckish, I headed to the dining area, where a variety of restaurants awaited. I chose a cozy café with a view of the harbor and enjoyed a hearty meal while watching ships dock in the distance. The calmness of the sea made the meal even more enjoyable.

What truly stood out was the mall’s seamless connection to nature. After my meal, I strolled along the boardwalk leading to VivoCity and enjoyed the cool sea breeze. The view of Sentosa in the distance was stunning, especially as the sun began to set.

HarbourFront Centre is not just a mall—it’s a gateway to relaxation, travel, and adventure. I left feeling recharged and excited for my next visit.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112702441126152817912/reviews

Koh,1,"Hi, I would like to bring your attention to the carpark. It's just past 10pm, and almost all the lights on deck 8 were turned off. While Singapore is generally safe, low crime does not mean no crime, especially when the area is so dark. Even if crime isn't a concern, it's still unsafe for car owners to collect their vehicles in such dim conditions. Given that we pay for parking, I believe this is an issue that needs to be addressed.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112754264563210149318/reviews
