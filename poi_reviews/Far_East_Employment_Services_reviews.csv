SY Chua,4,"I interviewed several maids fr various agencies and found 1 biodata of a maid I liked fr Far East Employment Services.  I hv never heard nor used them before and was very apprehensive abt the 1 star bad review I read fr a guy online 2 yrs ago. When I asked Joey, she said it the employee was no longer with the company.  The agency fee was attractive so I decided to go with them.

The process was smooth, Joey was professional and kept me in the loop abt when my maid was arriving, Quarantine duration, medical etc. I had my helper a week earlier than expected. All good!",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113108547951994385425/reviews
