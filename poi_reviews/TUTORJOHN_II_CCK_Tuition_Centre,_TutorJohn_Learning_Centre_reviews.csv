The tuition center is very good as the tutors are very patient and teach us at our own pace. The tutors explain to us how to do the questions very clearly. They also go above and beyond to ensure we succeed. I highly recommend this tuition center to anyone who wants to improve their grades.

My daughter was posted to normal technical after her PSLE last year. I went around different tuition centres looking for tutors who could help my daughter with improving her academics. But the search was so disappointing as all tuition centres don't give tuition to G1 (normal technical) / G2 ( normal academic ) subjects.
I was really desperate until my friend recommended Tutor John tuition centre.
My daughter joined their group tuition, she enjoyed the classes a lot as the centre has good teaching materials, the tutors are lively and keep the students engaged.
When my daughter couldn't have group tuition due to CCA commitment, Tutor John personally interviewed tutors to give my daughter one-to-one tuition. He was meticulous in the choice of Tutor in terms of qualifications and personality. My daughter has since gone on to achieve G2 for English, and G3 for both Math and Science. She also received an Edusave scholarship for being in the top 10% .
We would like to express our gratitude and appreciation to Tutor John tuition centre for helping my daughter when other tuition centres turned us away.
Thank you for not being biased against my daughter's poor results. This shows that with good teaching ethics and attitudes, all students could shine!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112187236377207761118/reviews
