Xoom Too,5,"To order a bun you have to get 3 at a time so I chose 1 chicken bun, 1 leek & egg bun, and 1 pork bun which were all really good and satisfied my cravings. To the right is all buns, but to the left are onion pancakes, chive pancakes, sauerkraut & pork pie, scallion pancake, and way more. The pancakes seem to be pretty large as well.

Unlike the other stalls near it, they don’t have a ton of options but the ones they do have are quite delicious and still attract a lot of customers and with good reason. Overall, great place to quickly stop by for a good snack.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105863133358477079886/reviews
Ivan Tan,5,"It seems they have many locations too and the fried beef buns i got was from the stall that is near to the Chinatown mrt station, the exit where you will be going to the hawker centre and OG mall. This stall sells delicious fried beef buns and it’s 3 for $3. It’s worth a bite.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105865784747329427413/reviews
Cynthia G,5,"Recently tried the 酱香饼 at this spot and it was a delightful find! It's soft and fluffy, topped with a thin layer of sauce that strikes the perfect balance of salty and spicy. At just $2, the generous portion is enough for a meal if you’re not a big eater.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110038244663695997045/reviews

Hsuet Funn C,5,Bought the 肉夹馍 as requested by my son. It was really good! The braised pork cubes mixed with the fat was melt in the mouth tasty. It came with lots of sliced cucumbers which gave a yummy crunchy contrast.,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117265061650610488669/reviews
