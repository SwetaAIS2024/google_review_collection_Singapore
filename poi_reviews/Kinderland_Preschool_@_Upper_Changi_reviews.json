      "text": "In the midst of the ongoing challenges at Kinderland Singapore, I feel compelled to express my gratitude to the teachers and staff at Kinderland Upper Changi. My two children have had the privilege of attending this centre, with my youngest still currently enrolled. They have both immensely benefited from the unwavering commitment and care demonstrated by the teachers.\n\nThe centre underwent renovations last year and the Principals and Teachers displayed meticulous planning to ensure that not only was the children's wellbeing prioritised, but their curriculum remained unaffected. Impressively, the renovations were strategically designed to optimise the space and enhance the learning experience for all children.\n\nWe are acutely aware that the teachers at Kinderland must be navigating an incredibly challenging period, yet I am wholeheartedly supportive of our teachers and friends at Kinderland Upper Changi. Their efforts have made a monumental difference in the lives of both my children.\n\nThe constant updates on my child's wellbeing and the outstanding support provided to parents truly sets Kinderland Upper Changi apart. The open lines of communication are incredibly reassuring and deeply appreciated.\n\nThank you, Kinderland Upper Changi, for your relentless dedication and for making such a significant impact on our children's lives. Your efforts do not go unnoticed, and we are immensely grateful. Sending everyone lots of love and sharing some beautiful art pieces the kiddos have brought home from the enrichment classes in the centre. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüé®üì∑",

      "text": "After queuing for more than a year, finally a spot. Initially my girl find it abit difficult to fit as most of the classmates have been establishing strong friendship since younger day. But the teachers are helpful and soon she is part of the big family.\nI have no regret to switch my girl to this school as you can always see the teachers paying attention to the kids and needs. None of the time I see any one of them busy with their own \"gadget\". My girl loves the outdoor playtime and often told me not to pick her up too early or even ask me to wait a little longer when pick her up so that she can continue her playtime.\nThis year, she is going to graduate and she already start missing her teachers and her friends.",

      "text": "Our daughter studied at Kinderland Upper Changi branch for four years. While we were deeply anxious at the beginning to leave our young daughter first time at the school like any other parents, the Kinderland staff proved to be the best in terms of providing care, support and perfect learning experience to our child that is the most essential at such young age. Within a short time, we developed immense confidence in the leadership, teachers and support staff based on all the school experiences our daughter used to share with us on daily basis. Under the present difficult circumstances that the whole school might be undergoing, we felt it very important to give a true and fair feedback about Kinderland Upper Changi team for the great childcare, support, culture and education that they have been imparting during these years. Even after graduating from Kinderland, our daughter always misses all her teachers, support staff, the wonderful memories and keeps wishing she could go back to Kinderland. That is a true testimonial for the School and the team. We wish Ms Gladys, Ms Jean and the entire Kinderland Upper Changi team our best wishes and have full confidence in them to continue to be a model institution to impart outstanding childcare and education in Singapore.",

      "text": "In light of the recent unfortunate events surrounding Kinderland Singapore, it has been made known to me that the teachers and staff of Kinderland Upper Changi have been subjected to distasteful and unnecessary abuse from the public. It is utterly unfair that the entire staff is being dragged through the mud for the actions of the perpetrators. As such, i would like to quickly jump on here to express my appreciation for Kinderland Upper Changi and to state that my confidence and trust in the school has not wavered.\n\nMy husband and I were both from Kinderland Marine Parade and have very fond memories of our childhood there. Naturally, we were thrilled when a spot at Kinderland Upper Changi opened up for our daughter. She started school earlier this year and adapted quickly thanks to the patient, kind and loving efforts of the teaching staff. As my husband and i navigate through first-time parenthood and toddler challenges, we have been greatly comforted by the advice provided by the school and assured of the well-being of our child by the high level of competency and standards displayed by the principal and teachers.\n\nIt has been amazing seeing how much my daughter has grown and learnt since she started school at Kinderland Upper Changi. She looks forward to school everyday and there is no doubt she loves her teachers (she even misses them when we go on holidays!).\n\nWishing all teachers and staff at Kinderland Upper Changi a Happy Teacher‚Äôs Day! Thank you for your hard work and dedication.",

Communication with school has always been easy and open, with very frequent updates on Class Dojo, even at late hours. It shows that the teachers and management are truly passionate. My child looks forward to school everyday and she loves all the teachers. She will definitely miss her preschool days when she graduates.
