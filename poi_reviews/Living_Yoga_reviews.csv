Yenxi Tay,5,"It’s rare to find a yoga studio in Singapore that treats yoga as more than just a workout, but this place does exactly that. My experience here has been truly transformative, especially with the yin and yang yoga classes.
Practicing these styles has deepened my understanding of my body, teaching me how to balance effort and ease while connecting with my own limits and potential.
Highly recommend to anyone who’s looking to experience the deeper benefits of yoga practice.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102963759820259921272/reviews
Wendy San,5,"A cosy studio for learning yoga in the neighbourhood area. The instructors Mdm Khoo, Gina and Clarice are attentive to the students especially to beginners in assisting to adjust postures according to individual body condition. I always feel refreshed and relaxed after each yoga session at Living Yoga especially after a long day working in the office. Highly recommended.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100008651553275592415/reviews

Kik,5,Tried chair yoga by teacher Clarice. I really enjoyed it. Clarice is very patient and had a really good stretch purely sitting on the chair! Would recommend for people with limited mobility or not able to do yoga on the floor. Highly recommended!,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114455390605410471277/reviews
