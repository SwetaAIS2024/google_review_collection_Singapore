Ben Slam,5,"I having been eating at this stall for over 26 years! 21 years ago when I was in the Guards unit (opposite the hawker centre), I would sneak out to have my favourite dumpling noodles. Their taste didn't change. Their dumpling is filled with an actual prawn and not just mince prawn filling, giving that mouthful taste in every bite. As I see the stallholder ageing with passing time, I wonder how long more can  keep this tasteful memories. In this photo, I ordered a $5 bowl and you can actually see the 3 dumplings taking up the entire bowl space! Worthy for money and taste. These days, it is hard to find such gemful taste in Singapore!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117765734346801078668/reviews
Victor Koo,5,"A delicious bowl of traditional wanton mee. Noodle texture is great, and the wanton and dumpling are hand made, so yummy! The broth is created with pork bone and no msg. No regrets visiting to try, and will definitely patronise again.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113833062705869697017/reviews
Dan P,3,"Average and simple bowl of wanton mee at affordable price, chilli was quite special tho. Worth a try!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113338739131835413171/reviews
Loki,4,"Traditional wanton mee. Pretty average tasting (this is a good thing). Nothing really spectacular about their sauce, wanton nor char siew, but it just works.

Noodles are cooked al dente and QQ. Generous serving of noodles for the $5 portion. I would recommend to get the dry version with green chilli, as the broth is also very ok-ok tasting.

One of the “healthier” stalls here at Bedok corner, can consider this if you’re looking for something that tastes good but isn’t fried or drenched in oil. Unfortunately it’s not halal though.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101937176024039442948/reviews
Kelvin Wee,4,Old school wanton noodles since the 60s. Current stall holder is the son of the old lady who started this version of WTM. Very decent & good flavours. Love the chilli with tomato sauce version.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108767345030655062698/reviews
