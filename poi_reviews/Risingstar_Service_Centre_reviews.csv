Christophe Le Yoanc,5,"Excellent service. Our TV broke down, we contacted Mr Kok who replied to us quickly, came to our home to pick it up and repaired it in a few days. Mr. Kok was very helpful to keep us posted on the work progress. Our TV was repaired and reinstalled at our place. We highly recommend such reliable, professional and courteous TV-repair service. Thank You!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114400678187011313480/reviews
BC Quah,5,"Got a TV problem and contacted Mr Kok, who responded and came to my place within 2 hours. Couldn't fix the problem immediately so he brought my TV back to his workshop. He is able to turn around the repairs the next day, and brought the TV back to me, and help me remount.
Highly professional, reasonable price and excellent service.
Glad I called him.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112935631629123680602/reviews
Adelene,5,Super impressed with the professional and efficient service. Cat yanked out the TV coaxial connector attached to antenna. Dropped a WhatsApp at night and response received at 0830am. Got a reasonable quote after sending some photos across.Brought the set down and the nice gentleman fixed it within the same afternoon. Even helped carry the TV to the car. Brilliant service and honest business. Thank you!!,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100192237251626064620/reviews
Robin Lo,5,"The shop owner was very friendly and he didn't require a non refundable deposit, i.e., in the event the TV cannot be fixed, the deposit is gone. He was so efficient that when I stepped in my door, he called to ask me to collect the TV and it was already fixed.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105427576181191457392/reviews
W.H. Lim,5,"I called Sony for my Old AV amp repair, when their technician came he say no parts cannot be repair. So I try Risingstar and for $40 more than what Sony's charges, I got my Sony AV, Nad Power and HSU plate amp fixed. What more do I need to say, except to Sony you can do better than this.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117545089903532816599/reviews
