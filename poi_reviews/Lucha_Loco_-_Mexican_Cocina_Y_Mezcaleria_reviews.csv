Gina Tay,5,"Absolutely loved our experience at Lucha Loco! The food was amazing and surprisingly affordable for the quality and portion sizes. The roasted cauliflower, chicken quesadilla, and baja fish tacos were the standouts—full of flavor and perfectly cooked.

The staff were incredibly friendly and patient, and offer great recommendations. The cozy ambience made it feel warm and welcoming, and they created such a fun vibe for our birthday celebration. Can’t wait to come back!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113038696095773076971/reviews
Than Thar Nway Htway,5,"Vegetarian options were really yummy, especially the lions mane al pastor. The lion’s mane mushroom was grilled to perfection. Jackfruit and hibiscus quesadillas were also yummy, considering that I’m normally not a big fan of jackfruit.
Service was great, went there to celebrate a birthday and George, our server made us feel welcomed and at home!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106316559143679764609/reviews
Melvin Lim,5,"Had my dinner with my GF last Saturday. I had previously shortlist this restaurant but I went to other due to pull pork which is my favorite.

I'm glad that we circle back to Lucha Loco. The restaurant is crowded evening though it's a rainy day. Thankfully we made reservations. We wanted to have a nice quiet dinner.. not too filling. After pondering the menu for a while, George came by to offer his assistance. His recommendations were spot on and what we had hoped to experience.

We had Fried Carnitas starter, Crab Tostada, Beef Quesadilla, Churros, and Watermelon Basil cooler. All of them are divine.. simply delicious. The standout will be the Crab Tostada, very fresh crab with no hint of fishy smell/taste. The watermelon basil cooler was refreshing, made from watermelon juice and not something out of a bottle/can/carton.

Even crowded by 7pm the noise level was manageable even though there's a party of 9 seated next to us celebrating a birthday. Lucha Loco offers a wide range of alcoholic beverages but we didn't try them. Other tables ordered margaritas and some had beers.

All in all a nice dining experience with the love of my life. We will visit again and try other dishes.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108538147964918099161/reviews

Double U,5,"We celebrated our Christmas lunch at Lucha Loco and tried almost everything on the menu! The standout dishes were the crab taco, lamb taco, beef taco, and cauliflower salad. Sadly, we didn’t get photos of everything, but every bite was amazing. The lamb taco is an absolute must-try—so juicy and flavorful! 100/100!

A huge thanks to Nick for arranging our booking and to Sasha for taking such great care of us throughout the meal. Amazing people, incredible food, and an unforgettable experience!",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105189653745546700489/reviews
