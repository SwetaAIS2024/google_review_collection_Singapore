Jason Ong,4,"Located inside a nondescript industrial building, this minced pork noodle stall has its fair share of fans, and with good reason: the noodles are tasty, the ingredients are fresh, the soup is delicious, and it's affordable to boot!
Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area, although it's not very accessible, it's worth the trip",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101337983538091125134/reviews

MX K,5,"one of the BEST bak chor mee

at $4.5 you get an amazing bowl of noodles.

noodles springy and al dente, liver cooked to perfection, fishcake not too thin, generous braised mushrooms, minced pork and sliced pork no porky taste.

at $5 more, you get a whole braised mushroom that is cooked so well. the outside remains firm, yet the inside is juicy. the braise sauce is also not overpowering and overly seasoned.

the soup is very clean tasting, no pork taste and the right amount of sweetness.

tip: after finishing the noodles, ask the kind aunty or uncle to add soup into your bowl.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105691950501157573919/reviews
Wei Ming Yek,5,"Hereâ€™s a review for MacPherson Mined Pork Noodle:

Review: MacPherson Minced Pork Noodle

MacPherson Minced Pork Noodle is a hidden gem that captures the essence of classic Singaporean comfort food. This little eatery serves up bowls of hearty, flavorful noodles that have won over a loyal fan base. The minced pork noodles, the star of the menu, come perfectly cooked with a good bite and are drenched in a rich, savory sauce with just the right balance of vinegar and chili.

The minced pork itself is well-seasoned and tender, adding a deliciously meaty depth to each bite. The addition of crispy pork lard and a side of fragrant soup elevate the dish even further. The portions are generous, making it a great value-for-money option for a filling meal.

Service is efficient, and the no-frills atmosphere brings a homey feel that makes the experience all the more satisfying. If youâ€™re craving a bowl of comfort and authenticity, MacPherson Minced Pork Noodle is definitely worth a visit.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106811673339416103525/reviews
