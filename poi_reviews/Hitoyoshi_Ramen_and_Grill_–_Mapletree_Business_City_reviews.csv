Ember Shen,5,"Delicious ramen.

Flo Yeow,3,"Was here for after-work drinks, and it's honestly quite alright. The place itself is not fancy, but it works. Guinness draft running at 3 for 33 SGD, is a pretty fair value afterall. Lady serving us was nice and prompt. That said, there was also no one else in the restaurant given the holiday period that we visited, so I'm not too sure what happens when they're crowded.

Didn't try the food so I cannot comment, but it seems to me like any other food ramen spot as well.

This restaurant and bar is located amidst all the other food options, in the middle of Mapletree Business City. Landmarks include being right by Starbucks on the one side, and Subway on the other; if you see Paik Coffee, you're near enough.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
