WT,5,"The cafe was in an industrial area but there was a steady stream of customers, with table seating being fully occupied most of the time.

Had the Pistachio Croissant and Strawberry Milk Coffee. I loved that the pistachio filling was very generous, and the croissant was so flaky and crunchy!

The Strawberry Coffee was very refreshing and the flavours complemented each other very well. The made-in-house strawberry jam contained strawberry bits was just the right amount.

Was tempted by the mini croissants too, there are more flavours for those. Have to be back again to try them!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107242368215199408100/reviews
Jacquelyn Chew,5,"One of the best Croissants I have eaten. The plain one is buttery and flaky, the pistachio one is fragrant and not too sweet.

We tried the Brazil coffee and they are good too.

Reasonable priced.
Love it. We will be back.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110817156747476688529/reviews
WhereisMia,4,"A bit slow service but very sincere and earnest. Coffee is just strong enough as a white, with chocolatey notes. They served  mini croissant! So cute. It was delicious. I can imagine the real deal should be good as well. For another time.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103122389821700771719/reviews
A-Cute Hunger,5,"Luvall Coffee is a charming and cozy cafe with excellent coffee and bakes. The decor is unique, it seems like you set up camp around a barista counter! A cute teepee that greets you as you enter sets the mood!

The staff are super friendly and even specially baked me a croissant that had just got over!

The music is just right to allow you to work or talk, and the staff are generous with their smiles and thoughtful to rearrange the camping furniture that dots the cafe to make you comfortable.

Stop by everything about this cafe is “Luv-able”",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107871716736324850619/reviews
Jaygee Essem,5,Well made espresso-based coffee + interesting & delicious & not-too-sweet pastries. Place feels like it'll get unbearably noisy when crowded tho but it's super nice when it's empty. Yet another awesome coffee place in the Taiseng area.,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113482808442788940515/reviews
