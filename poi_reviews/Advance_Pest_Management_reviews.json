      "text": "We have a roach problem in our office in the past and engaged this company on a contract basis. The company is prompt in scheduling their visits (they don't just sit around and wait for you to request for a visit) and the staff are courteous when they come.\n\nIn the initial months of putting these yellow stuff in our office, we found many dead roaches in our office the next morning. This is our 3rd year renewing their services and we hardly ever find alive or dead roaches anymore.\n\nOverall very satisfied with their services!",

My place is really small and they were not able to catch to rodent or to put some real efficient traps.\nThey refused to resend a guy. They refused any refund, they said I need to pay an yearly contract which basically means promotting scummers and incompetent people.\n\nMy advice if you have a rodent problem DO NOT CALL these guys. Believe me.",
