      "text": "Came here on  Saturday evening and it was crowded. The tables can only fit 10 pax usually so it was extremely tight for 12 of us. Despite being there early and there are still empty tables, we waited a good 30-40 mins for our food to come! The food was good but nothing extraordinary so not too sure what the hype is about too? Almost every dish is cooked with pork which makes everything very oily\n\nIt was hard to get the staff attention and they can senior ones be quite rude and shouting at their top of their lungs. Tbh, there are better seafood places to go.\n\nWon’t be returning anytime soon",

The service is top notch as well. We booked the VIP room which has karaoke and it's suitable for family gathering as well.",
