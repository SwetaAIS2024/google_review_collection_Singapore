The room was comfortable and clean. The breakfast were good, every day there were different traditional food. The staffs were friendly and helpful, especially Mr. Joseph whom we met at 6th floor lounge. Although the swimming pool still under renovation,overall we enjoy staying in this hotel and hope we'll be back soon.",

You had the bustling arab street just across the road full of restaurants & shops. The room was spacious, the bathroom was large in size & it had the road views which was fine. The decor of the reception & the in-house restaurant was superb as well. Overall, it was a fantastic stay and I highly recommend it.",

The facilities were under renovation but they offered alternatives in the neighbouring hotel and other sister hotels further downtown.\n\nGood connectivity to tourist destinations but you still have to travel a little to get there.",

Very clean and smells well, not surprising for Asian high quality standard. Staff is very productive and were very quick checking me in after an intercontinental long flight. The breakfast is amazing for 4 stars hotel, they offer omelette station and excellent coffee machine. Well located and accessible for public transportation.",
