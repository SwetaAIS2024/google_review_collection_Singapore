      "text": "If only I could leave zero star here, i would seriously want to do so\nHave never been so upset and angry visiting a cafe. The staff not friendly at all when it’s suppose to be a family cafe with kids.\nNumber 1 - as some adults was sorting out the socks purchase, they refuse to show the table first so that at least those who wore already can move in first.\nNumber 2 - they dont allow adults to go in to acc smaller children around 1-2 years old. Why? because their playground was built with cheap material which may fall anytime. Saw cracks at the bottom of it. How dangerous?! Btw some parts of the playground seems not completely safe for children. Never have I experienced at a playground cafe to be told off not allowed to accompany my child at the playground.\nNumber 3 - Got 1 staff with specs wearing black tee yesterday night. Her attitude towards customers seriously rude and i saw how she tries to scold kids who may have slightly misbehaved\nNumber 4 - Food is terrible. Fish and chips so dry and seems overcook.",

      "text": "Booked the place to celebrate my child 1st birthday party. Generally the food seems to be less flavored and the portion for 40pax were surprisingly small portion compare to the other catering service we ordered before. The staff was a bit not friendly to those  children who are trying to get the toys up to sliding area ( was not mentioned anywhere or inform earlier in the restaurant). I recommend 1 staff to station at the food area there to look after to refill the juice and plate all without we keep looking them to ask to refill.\n\nOne of the air conditioner was malfunctioning on the day. Although their contingency plan is to prepare few portable air conditioners, but it doesnt seems to be working well as well. My guest were complaining regarding the stuffiness and heat in a supposed air-conditioned room.\n\nTo our surprise, the place is not equipped with a simple speaker for birthday songs either. Advised to bring own speakers if any keen to have any celebration over there.\n\nOverall the price is slightly overpriced with the service we got.",
