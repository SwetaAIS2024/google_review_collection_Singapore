Doctor Stanely Clinic Assistant Ms Yeong

I am writing to express my deep appreciation to Ms Yeong professional and amazing to assist by advising through the phone for the past few weeks and months for Patient Tay Poh Tin to visit Dr Stanley with what apps reminder. Her kind and patience to check for my mum past 2020 health history and arrange appointment on Saturday slot as well giving me the help in finding a solution for the blood test, CT scan slot as well make us convenient to visit Dr Stanley. I had never encountered such service oriental clinic assistant like Ms Yeong on the phone.

Thanks for her excellent work, which has contributed to my peace of mind and trust in Dr Stanley Clinic at Mount E. Orchard Medical Centre #17-08

brandon chia,5,Great place to get a honest unbiased opinion regarding your heart health. Everything is explained clearly to make sure you understand your options and potential treatment cost. Additionally the nurses go out of their way to help and care for the patients.

SouwHwe Choo,5,Dr Goh Ping Ping was my doctor when I was admitted to Mt. Elizabeth Orchard back in 2017. She attended to me in the wee hours and was so mild and gentle.  Recent consultation with her was to seek second opinion. Dr Goh patiently explained and give her professional advice about my condition. I feel that she's an understanding doctor with compassion.,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118212567309157656557/reviews
Sanjay Balachandran,2,"DR Chia is a capable doctor but I am not happy with the clinic practices. I did a scan on doctors advise and for review i was charged consultation fees. Moreover I had called before to confirm if there would be charges, i was told there will not be. But in the end i was charged. This is ridiculous and not fair on the patient. Pls note this when you consider this clinic",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113433048483709714274/reviews
