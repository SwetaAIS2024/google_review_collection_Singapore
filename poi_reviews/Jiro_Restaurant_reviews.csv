WT Wong,4,"Nice Cosy Japanese restaurant tuck in an industrial estate . Good place to unwind if you are working nearby .

Salad was well concocted with roasted pork belly and other vegetables/ greens .

Grilled hamachi collar was a little dry due to over grilling . Can be better .

Overall, great meal without breaking your bank !",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116204037022034321113/reviews

Vivian Lim,5,"We had a fantastic time at this humble Japanese restaurant that serves really fresh sashimi and seafood at prices that won't break the bank! Service was very good as well - the crew were polite, friendly and very attentive (our tea were refilled countless times without reminders needed). I really want to gatekeep this restaurant but I hope more people can enjoy their amazing food and hospitality!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116985715329213612919/reviews
Woan Ying Ong,5,"Authentic japanese food with affordable price . And I like their sashimi which is very fresh and it is flown from Japan . Aburi salmon mentaiko is a must try sushi. It taste delicious with the smoky flavor and melt in mouth texture.If you are bring along kids, Hot Udon is a must have item for them. The broth taste pair so well with the chewy udon. We truly enjoy the authentic Japanese cuisine with the great ambience .",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110403084670896424687/reviews
