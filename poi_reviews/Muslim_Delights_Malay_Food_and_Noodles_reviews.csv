M P,2,"$7 nasi padang which I don‚Äôt mind paying but I don think it‚Äôs worth it

The sayur was not bad at first but afterwards seem so so only.

The tauhu goreng is very hard and not much flavour.

The stingray meat is abit mushy and not seem fresh

This place hard to park so I don‚Äôt recommend worth a effort for just average Nasi Padang",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112908652574347918174/reviews
Lionel,3,"Ordered the asam fish, beef rendang, tempeh, and brinjal, plus a drink for around $11.

Loved the tempeh, but the stingray had a fishy, muddy smell that wasn‚Äôt great. Fortunately, the beef rendang and brinjal made up for it‚Äîrich, flavorful, and satisfying.

Please note that Parking is an issue here! Be prepared to walk",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114987248048361781546/reviews

Thaddeus Thomas,4,"Early lunch to beat the crowd, paid $24 for 3 similar plates. I would think the price didn't do Justice. You could see the portion of the rice is as big as my Begedel, it's somewhat outrageous. I missed to glance at the cute bowl used to scoop the rice. Parking is a hassle, I would think that their competitor .. PU3 is gonna give them a run for their buck. However I would need to taste the chicken curry at PU3 because the chicken curry here is simply out of this world.. it's a mix of Indian and Malay cuisine.. they've used Malay cooking leaves and Indian spices.. I will judge again after comparing with PU3.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116509898827860159579/reviews
BABY GERM,4,"Update:
Revisit them again recently (Oct 2024)
Ordered
1) Mee rebus SGD 3.50
2) Two plate of Nasi Padang
a) Fried egg, chicken wing, sambal goreng, slice potato/wedges SGD 6
B) Omelette, chicken wing, curry vegetable and mutton curry SGD 10
Note: Mutton is soft and easy to tear apart with folks and spoons üëçüèª

Highly recommend their fried chicken and begedil! Begedil is served hot and soft. Very tasty! However, the lady at the cashier wasn‚Äôt friendly at all.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112868994757778796482/reviews
