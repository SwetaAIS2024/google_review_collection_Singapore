The meat were overcooked, meatball was flavourful, squid ball taste bland and the fishball have a soft non chewy bite. The Kuay teow is also bland without much favour, maybe I requested for just a little chilli. Overall a average bowl of noodle that is not very value for $.",

The texture was so bouncy, springy, crunchy upon the first bite. The taste was very intense with a rich natural savoury squid taste, probably with some pork lard.  Their pork balls were very good too, made with minced pork exquisitely complemented with a profile of dried cuttlefish.",
