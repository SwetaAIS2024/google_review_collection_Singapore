A fee of $29 for evaluation of my PC, with a verbal assurance that it would take 2-3 hours. No updates from him since I've left the shop. Not expecting much from this place, probably a wasted trip coming here. Even though the location is convenient, you are much better off making the trip down to Sim Lim for professional assistance.",

Is this even legal?\n\nStoreowners were equally rude and impolite, and took my parcels (before it was counted) and shut their shutters on me. Doesn't incite trust at all and I will not be surprised if any of my parcels have missing contents.\n\nThey took 15 minutes to scan 9 parcels and couldn't even successfully scan in 3 of them. Big waste of time. NinjaVan should stop allowing this store to do dropoff service.\n\nTo my fellow sellers, I advise you go elsewhere to get your parcels dropped off. I'm sure it wouldn't be as negative and poor of an experience as this.",
