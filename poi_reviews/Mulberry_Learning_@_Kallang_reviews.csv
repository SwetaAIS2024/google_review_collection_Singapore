Shyam Kumar,5,"Our two kids went to Mulberry Learning @Kallang for the past two years and it was such a a wonderful experience. The school is located by the river and very close to two MRT stations (Stadium & Tanjong Rhu) with beautiful views and ample activities (outdoor play area, water fountain, beach volleyball area – for sand play, running area near stadium etc) all around the school which keeps them well engaged.

A special mention must go to the incredible Chinese teacher, Xie Laoshi, whose dedication and enthusiasm for teaching the language has been truly inspiring.

Similarly, Teacher Thivya, their English teacher, has been exceptional in fostering a love for reading and writing. Their innovative and creative teaching methods have made learning English an enjoyable and enriching experience for our kids.

We are so grateful to the entire staff at Mulberry Kindergarten @ Kallang for their hard work and commitment. We highly recommend this kindergarten to any parent looking for a warm, supportive, and stimulating environment for their kids.

Thank you, Mulberry @ Kallang, for two wonderful years!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117335304725080729875/reviews

Wendy Quek,5,"Mulberry Learning at Kallang is a lovely preschool. My child has been with them for the past three years, starting from her infant days, and the growth and development we've seen in her have been incredible. The care and dedication of the teachers are truly outstanding—they create a nurturing environment that fosters both learning and emotional growth.

The preschool’s location near Kallang River is a fantastic bonus. It provides wonderful opportunities for outdoor play and scenic walks, which enrich the children's experience and connect them with nature. Many caring teachers there who are well trained and experts in their fields too. Lots of activities and planned excursions too to encourage them to learn beyond the classroom.

rightangled,5,"We have been very happy with our experience at Mulberry Kallang! Our son started in infant care, and from day one, we have felt the love and care that the teachers provide. The infant care area is very spacious and conducive.

One of the standout features is the access to amazing outdoor facilities at the Singapore sports hub. The children regularly get to enjoy activities like playing in the sandpit, splashing in the kids’ pool, playing in the playground with nature or running on the track. We always feel very assured that he is in a safe, fun and loving environment.  Every day, our son goes to school with a smile which speaks volumes about how much he enjoys his time there.

We feel very fortunate to be part of this loving community and highly recommend it.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107666330651895140446/reviews
