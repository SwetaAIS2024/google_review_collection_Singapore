Tot2travel WP,4,"It has a wide variety of products from various countries like China,  Taiwan, Japan, local,Malaysia, Korea.

Happened to be in the shopping mall and went in to find if they sell the crunchy red dates (only 1 brand with big packet - see photo.)

Some long time Malaysian snacks can be bought here for nostalgic reason.  Some products slightly differ from the other China supermarket brand.

Self payment kiosks available. Plastic bag is not chargeable.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109058897885515300830/reviews
eddy khoo,3,"Love the variety and quantity of snacks, noodles and food items available. Pricing however tends to be slightly more expensive than your local neighbourhood TCM shop but makes up for it with it's extensive range.

Most of the staff are however monolingual and can be a challenge when asking for items etc.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100216526729811832950/reviews
Travel Writer,4,"想家吗？五样在YueHwa必须买的东西.

Five Items you should check out at Tue Hwa

1) Authentic Chinese Dumplings that are Made in Singapore
Haven't seen this brand at Fairprice, this  packet of dumplings are a good find. A little expensive cos it is made in Singapore unless most other brands.

2) Cod Stick Cheese for kids??
This is pricey but so darn interesting! See pic.

4) Chinese Beverages from Herbal Tea like Wang Lao Ji, Pear Juice and Apple Vinegar Juice

Top fave amongst the Chinese. The price can be quite competitive when they are doing promotion. Check out the expiry date.

5) Steamboat Little Fat Sheep 小肥羊 Instant Steamboat Packet
Before there was Hai Di Lao, there was the grandmaster Little Fat Sheep. This brand has lost some of its lustre and is not quite famous with people who are not familiar with China. They sell these steamboat packets at Sheng Siong too and it taste similar to Hai Di Lao.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106159730355123797244/reviews
