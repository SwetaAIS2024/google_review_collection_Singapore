We had the pork chop rice and fried spring rollsâ€” both were so good, well-charred and exactly like the ones we enjoyed in Vietnam! These were probably the best we had in Singapore, very authentic. Thank you :)",

After a good toss of the ingredients, I dug into the food.\n\nThe vermicelli was done perfectly right and it tasted good.\n\nThe pork chop was freshly grilled and it also tasted good, though it would have been even much better had it been more tender.\n\nThe accompanying fried spring roll was crunchy and the filling was awesome.\n\nThe stall provides you with more than sufficient condiments to suit your taste requirements.\n\nCan't wait to try out the other dishes the next time I am in the neighborhood.",
