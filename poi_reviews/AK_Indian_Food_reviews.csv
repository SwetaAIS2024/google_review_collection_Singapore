Jawn Chang,3,"🐬..🤔.. kaki bukit recreation centre, workers Dormitory- India's indian banana leaf rice n curry, less expensive n very delicious, the foods are always hot (""panas"" n not so spicy) friendly service lots of tables less crowded n plenty of beers .. my favourite indian food n i always use my hand to eat n hv never use fork n spoon - the joy of eating curry with rice  😋 open to public, plenty carpark lots - mostly workers' mini lorries but they are all disciplined drivers with quiet trouble free behaviours .. i like n respect them - they hv 🍻 beers too but very peaceful, even in groups they speaks u cant hear 👂. Imagine, my 3 ladies with me, my wife n 2 grown up baby girls .. imagine, having meals with foriegn workers n no complaints fr my 3 darlings OR .. not, they won't be with me. $6 or $7 a meal ..n at little india ?
