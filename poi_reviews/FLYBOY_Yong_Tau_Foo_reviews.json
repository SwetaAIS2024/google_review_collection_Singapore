      "text": "The food and service are good, the boss &  lady boss are very personable as well. Highly recommended to try the Yong Tau Foo with salted fish filling (worth the $1 add on for the sets). Had the Abacus seed which is rare these days to find and the mango sago both of which are good. The chilli dipping sauce that comes together is addictive ( good balance of spiciness and sourness). They have the sweet dipping sauce as well.\n\nPS: Just a suggestion maybe to have small jar of pepper on the side just in case customers want add some pepper into their soup",

      "text": "Flyboy Yong Tau Foo is an absolute MUST-TRY! The yong tau foo itself is incredibly delicious, offering a truly authentic Hakka taste that's both comforting and exciting. The fillings are generous and flavorful, and the textures are perfectly balanced.  I especially loved the crispy fried tofu puffs and the succulent fish cakes.  And don't even get me started on their amazing pomelo mango dessert â€“ it's a heavenly combination of sweet and tart, light and refreshing.  The boss and lady boss are super friendly, making the whole experience even more enjoyable. A true hidden gem in the West!",

      "text": "Opened by an ex Air Force pilot together with his wife about a year ago. This eatery l offers a few menu options to choose from and doesn't charge GST. Each set with its fixed combination of ingredients. Most of the YTF ingredients were thinly fried till crispy. Couple was super friendly. It got pretty packed from 1230pm. Great food and service! If you intend to try their abacus seeds, it'll only be available from Fri-Sun. Will be back to try other set meals. ðŸ˜Š",
