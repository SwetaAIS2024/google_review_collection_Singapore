The seats are so small that it feels like kids seat. There is no food at theatre. The bathrooms are pathetic beyond any complains. The location is remote. There is no public transport to this place. If you’re visiting this place with family, take grab or taxi.",

      "text": "I will not recommend this cinema hall to public. Its more for the workers who are staying in the dormitory.\n\n1. Price is not justifiable, however they have buy 3 tickets get 1 free offer.\n2. Toilets are like dorm toilets, dirty.\n3. Location hard to reach but I had ebike hence easier for me.\n4. Not a place for family as mostly area is workers oriented if you get what I mean. There are no ladies in the vicinity.\n5. No place to sit while waiting for cinema to start.\n6. Two big cinemas halls. Seats are new but there is a railing blocking view. Its abit hard to explain.\n7. Hall was geneally empty except for a few workers and myself.\n7. Overall, a one time experience.  Will not be coming here again..bye",

      "text": "One of the useless theatres I have seen. Except for the free car parking facility there is nothing more to mention about this theatre.\n\nAbsolutely there is no accoustics treatment for the auditorium. These days people are spending thousand of dollars on home theates for accoustics treatment. I wonder how a professional/ commercial theatre could miss this concept. As a result u can never enjoy the sound in the theatre.. echoes reverbing from every corner makes it hard to listen to the dialogues properly(forget about songs...all you can hear is a bang bang sound)\n\nThe theatre chairs are so uncomfortable..No recline and seat backs cushions are only upto your shoulders.. no head rest.\n\nOverall worst theatre experience...",
