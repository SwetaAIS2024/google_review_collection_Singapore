      "text": "Had our lunch on a weekday. Upon arrival, a few staffs assist and ask how many persons in Mandarin, and I answered 2 pax. I choose my seat near the aisle walkway cos its a better view. One staff, Chinese national lady came up to me to ask order but i said to wait cos im waiting for my friend from Japan. Once my friend arrive, we ordered our meals. We ask the drinks to be send 1st but it came 15 mins later. Service was unfriendly, and in fact its only 2 of us in the restaurant hahaha.\n\nI love the Butter Prawns as it is the best! None in Newton’s can do like this. Its cook to perfection. No burnt taste!\n\nToday’s chili crab taste below average and abit steep for their price ($100 fr 1 kg) i prefer their black pepper crab which taste much better.\n\nPrawn paste wings as usual, delicious and juicy. Hotplate beef was super soft and good to eat while its hot. Juicy and tender, well marinated.\n\nI hope the taste of chili crab will be improve abit in future and service staffs more FRIENDLIER and approachable .\n\nWe paid for the service and foods!",

First time trying garlic steamed crab and chilli crab as my guest wanted these flavours. I usually have black pepper. The taste for the crabs were pleasing. Chilli crab had more tomato flavours. The next best was the lala, power. Rice and the lala sauce was something I enjoy.",
