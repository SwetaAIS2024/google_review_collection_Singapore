Missing peas.\n2. laksa - separately packed meetaimak and soup. 3 taopok, some mushroom, one egg and a few strands of beans sprout.\n\nTasty, if not a little salty.\n\n17 july22\nOrdered via food panda at 1130am Sun received at 1210pm.\nBolo egg luncheon arrived warm in paper boxes. The sticker seals were hard to break. Tasted as good as ever. Found the portion very generous.\nThe yam cake with chili sauce slapped on the side, came steaming hot in a double deck paper bottom container with its sweet sauce in a plastic top container cover (regrettable packaging and no option to remove chilli).\n.\nPrevious post\nNow that grove is here in NE, we don’t have to go to singpost paya lebar. It’s got the same menus, and there’s ample carpark and seating in Aircon!\n\nThe old fave hainan curry chicken rice is welcomed here and tastes just as good. New dishes beef noodles and unagi noodles were surprisingly tasty. Also tried the delicious cheese/egg/luncheon bolo and sardine puff - happy with the menu variety.\nGood portion and decent pricing.",
