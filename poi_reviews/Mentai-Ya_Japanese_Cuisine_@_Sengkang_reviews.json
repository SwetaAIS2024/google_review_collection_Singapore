      "text": "If you're around Fernvale, the Salmon Mentai Don and Chicken Cutlet Mentai Don are absolute must-tries! The salmon is seared to perfection, topped with creamy, flavorful mentai sauce that adds the perfect kick to the tender fish. As for the chicken cutlet, it’s crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, with that same heavenly mentai sauce elevating the dish to the next level.\n\nDon’t forget to grab a side of Mentai Fries—they’re addictive! Crispy fries drenched in that signature mentai sauce—what’s not to love? And if you’re feeling like something lighter, the Tamago Mentai is the perfect bite-sized treat, with the fluffy tamago perfectly complementing the rich sauce.\n\nHighly recommend giving these a try if you're nearby!",

Quality has dropped pretty much since their first opening launch, hence it is expected that they might close soon…their standards were very high and excellent in the past. I think they may have change the chef or ingredient/supplier, hence the drop in quality. Customer service was also not the best. Overall a bad honest experience.",

      "text": "The shop is good for a hawkers place; a bit pricy compared to local food, but it’s also worth spending a bit for a Japanese food treat.\n\nThey give generous serving of sauce (mentai and teriyaki).  The chicken mentai don is very good, while the saba teriyaki don is also good (just be careful of few bones).\n\nWe felt the Mentaiya Fries is better than Genki Sushi (and we also got it for only $2, promo price until end of May 2024.  So grab it now!)\n\nOverall, a satisfying Japanese dinner.",

The Salmon Mentai Don ($8.80) is definitely worth the dollar more. The Mentai dressing is generous and the rice is Japanese rice. So overall, pretty good value.",
