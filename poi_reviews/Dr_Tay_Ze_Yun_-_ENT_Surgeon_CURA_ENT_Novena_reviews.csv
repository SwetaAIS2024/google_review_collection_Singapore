Leo Y,4,"I would like to share some feedback regarding my recent visit on Friday.

Dr. Tay was very patient in explaining the treatment plan, and I truly appreciate his professionalism throughout the process. The treatment was carried out with great care, and I experienced no pain or discomfort at all.

The only downside was the waiting timeâ€”I had an appointment scheduled for 4:00 PM but had to wait for about 30 minutes. I hope future scheduling can be managed more precisely, perhaps by allowing some buffer time between appointments.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to continued care with your team.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117835304336272132768/reviews
