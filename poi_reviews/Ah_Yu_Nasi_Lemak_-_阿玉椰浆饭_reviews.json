Black spots on the leaves.\n\nFirst and last time for me.\n\nSuggestion: skip this stall. Even the cai png stall within the same coffeeshop with 2 meats and 2 vegs with rice cost me $5.40 only",

The inflation in Singapore for 2022-2023 has been crazy, and with GST increasing at the same time, it‚Äôs pretty amazing to still be able to get a proper meal for $3 in 2024.\n\nPlease be appreciative and understanding of our hawkers, it‚Äôs a dying trade üòî",
