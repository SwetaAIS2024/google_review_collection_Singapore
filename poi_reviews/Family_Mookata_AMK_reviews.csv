Cynthia Phua,5,"This was my first visit, and it was definitely a great spot for a satisfying and enjoyable Mookata experience! I loved the wide variety of ingredients, from fresh meats and seafood to vegetables. The marinated meats were especially flavourful, and the dipping sauces added the perfect kick to every bite.

The service here is excellent—the staff is friendly, attentive, and always ready to assist. At just $14.90 for a protein buffet with generous portions and a great selection, it's definitely great value for money.

Whether you're a Mookata fan or trying it for the first time, this is a place worth visiting. Highly recommended!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116617912614861802601/reviews
Felicia Seet,5,"Most affordable Mookata I’ve ever tried in SG! Only $14.90 for unlimited food! Though cheap, quality is not compromised!

We were quite impressed by the variety of choices and the marination of meats here! There are quite a lot to select from but one of our favourites is the Mala and Tom Yum chicken! Tender, delicious and spicy! If you prefer, top up an additional $5 to enjoy free flow seafood too!! Totally value for money!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114471626032284546245/reviews

What really stood out to me was the 𝙝𝙤𝙢𝙚𝙢𝙖𝙙𝙚 𝙏𝙝𝙖𝙞 𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙡𝙡𝙞 𝙙𝙞𝙥— spicy, tangy, and incredibly 𝙨𝙝𝙞𝙤𝙠 with the BBQ meats. And the biggest surprise? 𝙏𝙝𝙚𝙮 𝙝𝙖𝙫𝙚 𝙤𝙮𝙨𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙨 𝙬𝙝𝙞𝙘𝙝 𝙖𝙧𝙚 𝙢𝙮 𝙛𝙖𝙫𝙤𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙩𝙚. That alone makes it superbly worth the price.
