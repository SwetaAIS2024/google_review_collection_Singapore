David Lee,4,"The Library is such a cultural gem, offering a rich collection on Chinese arts and heritage. I love it because it's more than just books, it's a community hub with dialect resources and engaging programs. The library is focused on preserving traditions makes it a unique and valuable space within Chinatown.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118189120962645425435/reviews
Yellow Bear,4,"Nice little sanctuary in busy Chinatown. One can have some peace and quiet here reading English, Chinese, Melayu or Tamil books. There’s a Children’s Section too. Enjoy.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489311735261065689/reviews

Cindy C Rahardjo,3,"It was my first time visiting Chinatown point and found this library in this the mall. This library has mainly books in Chinese, however, it is such a good place to enjoy reading. There is a childrens' book section, as well as a private bench to read on your own. This place is not a tourist destination, however, when you are in the area and loves to read, this place can be considered to visit.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109432050494826685983/reviews
Xoom Too,3,"For me the Chinatown library is just a library for me to go to and use my computer or have a book on my phone because majority of the books are in Mandarin Chinese and I don't read books in Mandarin Chinese. I do sometimes just like looking out the window (at a certain spot for seats) and just watching people and listening to my audiobook. So that's why the Chinatown Library isn't really in my top 5 libraries for reading. There is a children's section of books and a programme zone. When I was much younger I went into the programme zone and I think that specific day was for beads and creating and it was fun to create something. I don't remember what I exactly made but it was something with a girl and a Christmas tree. I also notice that there are more elderly people in the library rather than younger people. Or when there are younger people it's more to study on their computers rather than read. I think the Chinatown Library is a good library for people that like Chinese history and books in Mandarin Chinese. But also people that like just sitting for a couple of hours and listening to an audiobook or if you have a school project or homework, it would be a good place to go to.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105863133358477079886/reviews
