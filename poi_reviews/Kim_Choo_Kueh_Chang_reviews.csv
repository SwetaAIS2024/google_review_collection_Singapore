Lisa T,4,I love the Nonya dumplings and Nonya kuehs they offer here. You can get a nice snack here if you are feeling peckish. One advice: you have to eat them the same day. They donâ€™t taste as good the next day.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101998729191684176802/reviews

Alice Lim,5,"Duan Wu Jie is round the corner and my go to place is Kim Choo Kueh Chang in Joo Chiat Place. They sell traditional bak zhangs (bz). My family likes the nyonya bz. Their salted egg yoke bz are good too, yoke is not too salty. The rice is soft, which means it is soaked well before cooking, and the ingredients are well marinated. The ratio of rice to ingredients is well balanced. For me it means less rice & more ingredients :).  I also bought some mini nyonya bz for my grandkids and they are just as tasty. The cashier is courteous & patient with customers trying to decide what to buy.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105277272557459579361/reviews
MH Tham,4,"The stall front was pure nostalgia, from the old-school cookies, cakes, and desserts to the friendly counter lady who looked like she had been serving generations of customers.

We bought ten mini dumplings, and she kindly let us mix and match between the Nyonya and traditional versions.

At home, we reheated them as instructed, and the rice layer was bouncy and firm, infused with a fragrant pandan aroma, especially if you let it rest in its pandan wrapping for a minute after heating.

Would love for the meat filling to be a little sweeter and more generous, but overall, a fantastic dumpling worth revisiting.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112376174358198242550/reviews
Siah Hx,4,"First time trying and indeed it is one if the nicer Bak Chang (Rice Dumpling) in Singapore!! Yumny and Worth a try!

However location isn't convinient to visit and price of food items isn't cheap. Minus Star.

Do note at second floor of the store is a small simple peranakan museum, visitors just enter the store and proceed level 2.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103944670556353820143/reviews
