Ma tt,4,"The zi Char is situated within a coffee shop that is slightly away from the Le Quest mall and Tengah project. There are blocks of residential coming up, so I do expect the dining crowd to increase with time.

The salted egg calamari was nice- flavourful and fried to golden crisp. Stingray was alright, the sambal lacked a punch. Portion of rice was good.

Overall, if you live nearby, this would be an option for family meals.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102382313505418526836/reviews
Ghostguan Raoh,4,"Delightful dining at Siong BBQ Seafood. Their signature Hot Plate Stingray was delicious, with tender stingray cooked in a flavorful sambal sauce. I also enjoyed their fresh fried fish options, which were a great accompaniment to rice.

The classic Cai Po Beancurd and the flavorful Prawn Paste Fried Chicken were delicious additions to my meal.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104812295164703558163/reviews

Tilon Lee,1,"Ordered 红斑炉 from the Lady whom have China accent. We got served with some other fish which she don’t even know what fish is that when we asked.
Requested to change and she return our money and said that they won’t prepare our food.
Terrible service and attitude!
Do not try their food!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104805330721220041057/reviews
