John Tango,4,"Ordered one prawn yellow-mee / bee hoon noodle soup (6/10 rating) & one dry version (7/10 rating).

Strong point is value for money for 4 local bucks per small bowl. Large bowl is an additional dollar.

Soup is a tad too sweet.

Other than that I will repeat my visit if in need of my shrimp (prawn) noodles fix.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117082529878868496412/reviews
