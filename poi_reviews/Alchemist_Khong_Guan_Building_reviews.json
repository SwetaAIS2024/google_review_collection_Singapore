      "text": "Stepping into Alchemist Khong Guan Building felt like entering a time capsule—classic, vintage, and undeniably unique. There was something almost surreal about sitting in that quiet corner, sipping my coffee while gazing out the window. The view wasn’t breathtaking, but it carried a strange charm, like a glimpse into the past.\n\nThe coffee was amazing, rich and aromatic. The croissant, unfortunately, was just okay—nothing extraordinary, but decent enough. For a while, I truly enjoyed the peaceful solitude, though the arrival of a lively group later did disrupt the quiet ambiance.\n\nDespite that, the cafe’s distinctive character made the visit worthwhile. If you appreciate nostalgia and superb coffee, this place is worth experiencing—just maybe not during peak hours if you crave silence.",

Ordered a latte with the \"dark matter\" roast but was quite disappointed as it tasted very weak despite asking for a regular size. My friend ordered a flat white, which seemed better. Around 13 sgd for two. Try if the taste suits you but not so much for me.",
