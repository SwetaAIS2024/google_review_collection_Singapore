Blake Seal,5,"We came on a weekday afternoon and the park was really quiet and peaceful, which means this is the perfect timing for us as student to unwind from our studies. We hike and jog along the yellow path and it took us around an 1h 15 mins to complete the whole trail. Overall, it’s a perfect place to relax your mind and yap with your friends. Would definitely recommend coming here with your friends and loved ones!",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117556683258521118362/reviews
Harry F,5,An awesome way to spend a few hours feeling escaped from the busy city! We did a complete lap of the water and also went to the Treetop area and it took about 4 hours total. It is well signposted throughout and the boardwalk section was especially memorable. It was incredibly easy to reach via public transport - I’m glad I included this in my Singapore itinerary to mix it up from just tourist locations!,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117325430670311785360/reviews
VG Mesina,5,"We visited MacRitchie Reservoir on a Saturday afternoon, and it was pleasantly uncrowded. We had a great time exploring the boardwalk, dam, and the charming bandstand. It’s a fantastic spot for a leisurely stroll or simply to relax and enjoy nature. We saw plenty of monkeys along the way and were lucky enough to spot a Malayan Flying Lemur clinging to a tree! Highly recommended for nature lovers and anyone looking for a peaceful escape.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106391508481912683845/reviews
Kevin M,5,"Love hiking in MacRitchie...I come here on most weekends. Couple of different ways to enter and different routes you can take ranging from a couple km to like 14km. Lots of wildlife, cool jungle and water views. Definitely recommend.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106594784695526480551/reviews
Daydee Balandra,5,"Good place to get some hiking or walking in. Recommend to go early in the morning so you don't end up walking while the scorching noon sun beats down on you. Recommend as well to wear sunblock, bring water and snacks, and small towels to wipe your sweat off. I wish there were more toilet facilities.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111475029600293583326/reviews
