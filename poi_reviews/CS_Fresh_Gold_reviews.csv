Ashley Liew,5,"5 stars for this Cold Storage supermarket in the basement of Tanglin Mall. The best part is the staff that are so friendly, cheerful, and helpful. Yesterday 14/1/25 around 1815hrs the Malay male staff at the checkout counter deserves a good shoutout 😊 Lots of items here for purchase and even our toddler had a great time browsing the many options. Parking conveniently nearby too. Thank you 🙏🏻",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115333748318871707993/reviews

Renato Lima,5,"This supermarket should be closed as hypermarket. It is huge inside, with fresh produce, bakery, a great selection of wines and beers and almost everything you need. Easy access. There's a bridge on the 2nd floor to connect to Jen Hotel.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104221642875467385436/reviews

💜 The bread lady behind the roti counter, Madam Janice, she was so affable, helpful, kind, polite and nice. Really like her alot. ☺️Because of her great attitude, I bought many bagels and the Japanese fluffy cheesecake from Cold Storage.

🎂🍰 The SGD6.70 日本 Cheesecake is super good. It is soft, fluffy and so scrumptious.

LiV3 LiFe,4,"CS fresh gold at Tanglin Mall is huge and carries a lot of groceries, cooked meat, freshly made bread, cheeses, daily essentials. It is located at Basement 1 of Tanglin Mall. As this is the CS Fresh ""Gold"", be aware that the prices of goods would be more expensive than usual. Nonetheless, it pays to have this huge array of products or produce in one place.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112429413622143366667/reviews
