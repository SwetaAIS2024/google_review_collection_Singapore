      "text": "We enjoyed our stay here while in Singapore. I stayed at the mixed \"king size\" bed on the 4th floor. The bathroom was always clean and the bed/pillow/ sheets were SO comfy! We stayed on the top bunk- and i suggest you try to avoid the top bunk or the bunks near the entrance door.\n1) The top bunk does not have a \"roof\" over so you can hear everything very well throughout the night and also if someone turns the light on as well. It feels less private.\n\n2) The door also is pretty loud as you open and close- so if you are by the door... I can not imagine being able to sleep the whole night.\n\n3) It is very cool (temperature) in the room but they only give one blanket (it's a twin size). So we had to ask for another one.\n\n4) very close to all the food market, china town, metro!\n\nOverall it is a very nice hostel for the price and I won't kind staying here again if I visit.",

The beds are clean and comfy, and they have personal lockers in your cubicle itself. Best way to stay in Singapore if you're looking for an affordable stay without wasting your money on expensive hotel rooms.\n\nAnd I've been back here twice!",

Bathrooms were nice and the showers were hot. The coffee shop downstairs was perfect when we needed to get some work done. They even provided us with a free latte each day we stayed at the hostel which was great. The best part was the location. So close to the MRT made it a perfect hostel. Would 100% stay again.",

The shared toilet had privacy enough to feel comfy with your shower. The beddings are clean and crisp. The folks are nice and helpful, and you get to meet a good number of travellers and professionals. I look forwars to staying here again.",

It could really use some regular cleaning since many people are using them. Also, the the air conditioning isn't cold enough, especially if you close your blinds, since there isn't enough air coming in so it's gonna get pretty hot.",
