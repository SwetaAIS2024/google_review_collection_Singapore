Flo Yeow,5,"Clean, quiet, timely, and is wheelchair accessible. Has the basics of what you need out of a train station, what more could you possibly ask for?

Really like the Bartley area in how quiet it is, and the MRT station just connects everything and everyone in the area together. There's a church right outside the station exit, but more importantly is how this MRT station services the many condominiums surrounding Bartley. Makes the area so much more convenient.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews

This is unacceptable as she has embarrassed us in-front of people when we did nothing wrong. For SMRT staffs, please do advise her not to look down or judge people. Please be fair to all races.
