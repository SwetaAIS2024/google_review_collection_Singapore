Jeffrey Wong,1,"Nice egg, the yolk immediately breaks upon cracking so i dont need to durther break it down. The bread size is just noce so i can go and eat other things later. $6.70 for a traditional set. Received excellently bad attitude when I inform the staff worrying that the egg might not be fresh enough for soft boil.
Came to hospital for visit, dont wish to end up in the hospital myself. So, had to be more wary of the egg condition.
I might be wrong about the egg but thats what I was taught and whoever say can eat please go ahead.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103722734572680609864/reviews
DataDriven Foodie,4,"This place serves as a lunch spot for the hospital and nearby university staff.

The rate of service is surprisingly fast and efficient, with the staff working together closely very well. This is something which I rarely observe but good job to the team here.

Food wise, really just average at best (flavor and portion) for the price we're paying for.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101052801776476610063/reviews
sun moon,1,"I was shocked to see the size of my kaya toast.. More for toddlers to eat than for adult and yet charging us at $6.70.. Come on! Your other competitors are making bigger toast bread than yours! Not to mention about your $3.80 for a cup of large size take away coffee..

Everything overpriced now with toastbox.. No more my number 1 favourite coffee place..",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117267115747904769753/reviews
Jonathan Koh,5,"I was genuinely delighted by the quality of food at Toast Box. Upon ordering the Laksa, I was struck by the richness of the broth and the ample serving of dou pok, both of which left a strong impression. Additionally, I found the iced coffee to be quite enjoyable. Without a doubt, it's a dish I'll be sure to savor again when I return.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110322417305771163637/reviews
JagungKidd,4,Order a cake and coffee takeaway. Staffs are friendly and confirm the order clearly despite the long queue during lunch hour. The sponge cakes taste great and able to bite into cakes instead of just air. The coffee is very tasty! Coffee still good after left for 15 minutes. My friend who order the mee siam have to guess if the packed food is hers because the staff just continues to prepare the next order after putting the food on collection counter. Thankfully the foods are easy to recognize.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105277181532360487392/reviews
