Forest BK,5,"🏵️An interesting feature at the Therapeutic Garden at Bedok Reservoir is the Interactive Rock Garden.
🌷By carefully balancing rocks on top of each other, it promotes concentration, focus and patience.

🌿Other features in the Garden includes a grass covered Activity Lawn where one can meditate or do Yoga in a lush surrounding.
🌻There is a Physiotherapy Mound for some strength training for seniors to enhance their mobility, increase stamina and improve balance.
