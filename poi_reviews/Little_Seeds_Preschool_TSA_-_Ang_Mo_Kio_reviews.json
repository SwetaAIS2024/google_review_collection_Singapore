I like the way the school conduct lessons, they allow kids to learn through exploration, this is important since children at the age of 2-6 years learn fastest through hands on activities. I would also like to say a BIG thank you to all the teachers in LSP AMK for all the support in educating the next generation!",

It is crucial for a childâ€™s growth and development to have good teacher guidance and companionship since they spend most of their time in school. Kudos to the team!",
