TT Tay,1,"This is the first time I am giving a Rating of 0. Every time I need to speak with MP Town Council, there is no one there to answer call. Even with the option of O to speak to operator, the call just ended. The past few experiences caused a lot of frustrations. When asked to look into matter, Town Council simply redirected or rather push the blame to other Government Agencies?! Is this how Town Council is suppose to operate?! Appreciate someone look into the issue here ASAP.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107235535727978055211/reviews

Mohammed Salem bin Salomon fandee,1,"If I could give 0 stars, this is the place.

Horrifyingly bad service. Had a commercial unit that requires no objection back then, took us 30 over emails to get a single reply that is simply, would like to say, not complete.

Called the town council customer service desk, amazingly, nobody even replied after pushing responsibility to the officers in-charge who basically disappeared into thin fine air.

Officers in charge, are you not paid enough to reply? I think it is quite amazing that a simple email could take many, many months, no exaggeration.

Please train your in charge, especially the aging ones, to note that emails are very important, rather than being dismissive through calls and emailing is supposedly ""too much work"" and it looks really bad on them.

Yikes. Maybe replace them or pay them better?

This reflects a putrid stench that we cannot get rid of, dealing with such management or a managing body of an estate.

Even a primary school student can write better emails with frequency and decency to follow up.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116906586958357245009/reviews
