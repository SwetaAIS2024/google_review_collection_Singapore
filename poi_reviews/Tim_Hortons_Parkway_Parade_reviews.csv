L,3,"Staff are nice and place is nice deco. I like the maple leave üçÅ shape hanging light and the maple leave craft on each table.

Morning set has the croissant and hot brew coffee for $6. Low quality OEM croissant and  the sour diluted coffee - fail.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115891254688245762238/reviews
J L Goh,3,"Nice quiet corner which i enjoy. Apart from that, staff was just emotionless.
The drink is a real let-down. Ordered Belgian Chocolate Mocha ice-blend. A looknat the drink the color pale brown which seems like there is not enough chocolate is added and too much milk is added. Taste of the drink confirms that the enitre drink is tatseless.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108671781726377702279/reviews

Chris Oh,2,"We visited on a busy Saturday afternoon and were excited to try this spot.
Unfortunately, the service and ambiance 1 short.

Service (2/5)
No warm greetings from staff, including the cashier.
Unmotivated cashier seemed uninterested.
Food stickers left on plates at collection.
Diners had to clear trays from previous customers due to unclear signs if one should clear. Staff too busy to step out.

Ambiance (2/5)
Cramped dining area with narrow walkways.
Diners get bumped by passers-by.
Overall atmosphere lacks comfort and inviting feel.

Food (4/5)
Delicious donuts and autumn-themed drinks.

Overall (3/5)
Despite tasty treats, the lackluster service and ambiance disappointed.
Staff seemed detached, and attention to detail was missing.
Hopefully, management will address these issues to match the quality of their food.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108384726885953803316/reviews
