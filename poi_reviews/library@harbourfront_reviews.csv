Eve C,4,"Really love the library in the middle of a crowded mall. Very happy they have a security gantry to allow people to scan passes to enter. Divided session of young kids and other section is although a hassle but necessary because the children session can be a little noisy. Also love they have the self check out gantry which is cool.

Books selection may not have the widest variety but good enough for town. I find limited seatings among bookshelves area although proper table/seats are scattered all around. I find a lot of people occupied those seats for working, studying or leisure reading. I really don't like the people taking advantage to nap there but the librarian did go around stopping them. The other point that was not pleasant are the seats facing the waterfront. While it is definitely such a good experience reading and facing sentosa, the air was really stuffy and not ventilated. The heat from the glass was intense and the air con wasn't strong enough.

Beautifully furnished library.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109756518746414930822/reviews

Yellow Bear,5,"Thankful to have a library in this huge shopping mall. It‚Äôs great just to sit here quietly and wait for friends who are still busy spending money buying stuff in this mall.
This library is not as big as the regional libraries, but it still offers a great selection of English, Chinese, Melayu and Tamil books. It also offers charging stations for our gadgets and a beautiful view of Sentosa Island.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104489311735261065689/reviews
Flo G,4,"Such a beautiful public library with Sentosa sea- view. Nice selection of wellness books. Some work or study areas with tables outside and in room. Charging areas are central means not encouraging hoarding of space. Children section is cute. Conducive library is sometimes marred by noisy kids & adults talking loudly. Only happens in this library, possibly run by volunteers. Very crowded on weekends with long queue. With heightened alert requirements, book ahead on weekend with a click instead of wasting time in queue.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113094459489500763998/reviews
