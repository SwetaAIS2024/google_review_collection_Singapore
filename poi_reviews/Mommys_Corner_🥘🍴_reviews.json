      "text": "Food is great and delicious made by seasoned chef. repeat customer & will come back again.\n\nOwner is a retired head chef since Long beach restaurant in 1990s whose food delighted common people, dignitaries, and ministers alike. I have eaten multiple dishes cooked in innovative ways that they imagined to life (from Porridges -> curry noodle -> fish soup -> chicken rice -> Hokkien Mee) all within a span of a year. Everything tastes great and served with good utensils unlike other standard PVC plates and bowls.\n\nThis store is a great hidden gem in heart of Potong Pasir & fortunately not many are aware of it (hence not much queues 😉). Will keep visiting back this shop again.",

Presentation surprised me a lot with how beautiful the fried egg is.\n\nFor the price U pay, the meal was very worth it!",

They used fresh fish slices so there were a few tiny bones to be careful of; just bear in mind if buying for children or old folks who might need feeding care.",
