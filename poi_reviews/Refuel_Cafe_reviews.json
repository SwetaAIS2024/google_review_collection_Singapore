Staff at friendly too. Pretty well staffed I would say. Order through the QR code and pay online or pay at the counter.",

The cafe is small but well-maintained, and the staff are very helpful, especially when dealing with the strong sunset glare—be sure to request a table shift. It's a good idea to make a reservation in advance, as you may end up on a waiting list.\"",

There's not much space to move in the cafe once it's crowded.\nFelt the air con was weak, and the weather was already hot outside, so the place felt uncomfortable.\nWould recommend coming in small groups and try their miso salmon.",

The food is decent, and the service is okay—not particularly standout but acceptable.\n\nGiven its heartland location, this is probably the closest option you’ll find for a “fancy” breakfast and café vibes in the area. Their breakfast sets are enjoyable, but the pasta was just average.\n\nIt’s a decent choice if you’re nearby and craving a café experience without venturing too far out.",
