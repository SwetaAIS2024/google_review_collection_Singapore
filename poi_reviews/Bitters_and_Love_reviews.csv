Bianca Camille Co,5,"I loved their cocktails! Especially the Kaya Toast Cocktail. The only thing got disappointed was they didn’t tell us that the kitchen was closing at 10pm. We were seated at around 9:40pm, ordered cocktails and fish tacos. We were still hungry bc we didn’t had dinner so we tried to order more food, but they said kitchen is closed already. Though overall, the ambiance, food and cocktails are good. I would come back and would definitely reco this bar, especially that the bar is very near our hotel (The Clan)",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100310527376248915120/reviews
Erin Lin,4,"The mood in the bar is really good. The kaya toast is really interesting and fun to order. The bar has a interesting chart for the taste bud that sorts the drinks based on the preference of your palate. Overall, it's a nice place to hangout for the night and catch up with friends.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105119472362592456108/reviews

Kai Xin Tang,5,"A really chill speakeasy with fantastic cocktails and delectable food.

Must-have dishes are their fish tacos and beef cubes. They're so tasty that we still crave them!

It was easy to select the cocktails based on the flavour wheel they have on their menu, and the 4 cocktails we've tasted were delightful and aesthetic!

Definitely recommend this place and be sure to make a reservation to experience this enjoyable bar!",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111370840272342353560/reviews
