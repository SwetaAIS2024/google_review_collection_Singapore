Eddie Yeou,5,"Good place to have Nyonya food in Sunway City Iskandar . Food well done. Chicken is tender and big serving size. Flavourful but not salty. Ladies finger simple yet nice with sambal sauce. Kue Pie ti very nice as well. Worth a trip when you are here. Air-conditioned and clean, with plenty of free parking.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104643970770132746766/reviews
ronaldpung,5,"Nyonya curry fish head was the highlight! Not too spicy, fish was extremely fresh with a nice bite to it. Spice level was mild and our 5 year old son loved it too.
Pongteh chicken and cai poh omelette was fine too. Home cooked taste to the dishes in general. Long beans with prawns were nice and wiped clean by the kids. Kueh pie tee came quickly as an appetiser, kids liked it too.
Service was friendly and professional. Restaurant was almost always full in the hour plus we were there.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107194534868698118185/reviews
Boon Leong,4,"The Sambal Ladyfingers was a standout for meâ€”the sambal was flavorful, with a nice balance of spice and tanginess that complemented the tender ladyfingers perfectly. It was a dish Iâ€™d happily order again. I bought their ready made sambal

The Egg Omelette was simple yet satisfying. It was well-cooked, fluffy, and had a comforting homely feel to it.

The Rendang Beef meat was tender and the rich, aromatic rendang sauce was packed with depth and spice. Itâ€™s clear that the dish had been slow-cooked to perfection, making it a must-try for anyone visiting the restaurant.

To end the meal, I tried the Chendol which was a delightful dessert. The combination of coconut milk, palm sugar, and pandan jelly was refreshing and not overly sweet. It was a perfect way to round off the meal.

Overall, my experience at the Nonya restaurant was enjoyable.
Will come again",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118439101019407877742/reviews
