selma gomez,1,"29/1/20 Went to purchase surgical mask at Unity, the elderly lady staff was very unhelpful. She mentioned we dont have time to pack the surgical mask, ask to return about 45 mins later. But another staff involved and told us to back at 5pm.  We only have our lunch time to go about to purchase mask. At least  one the staff can be helpful by just start packing & sell to the customers in queue. By the time i leave the office today 6pm, the next they will tell us out of stock.â˜¹",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110493441846643853092/reviews
Ms Cheng,4,"I just have had a pleasant shopping experience at Unity by Fairprice at Plaza Singapura.
I went to Unity to browse and see whether there is any good offer.
When l entered, a very cheerful female staff approached  me and greeted me with a friendly smile. She is very proactive in her service and as a result l managed to get the good offer of Alcon eye drops and vitamins C which were on sales.
I understand her name is pronounced as Reginda.
Thanks for a wonderful shopping experience.",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117450438268302775247/reviews
