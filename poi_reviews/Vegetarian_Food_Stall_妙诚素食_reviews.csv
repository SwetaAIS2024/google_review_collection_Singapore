shining shining,1,"I don't want to give half a star, the food is getting worse and worse! I used to visit often! They all said that due to physical reasons, we should not take blood-activating herbs or medicinal herbs. The stall owner didn’t know whether there were any herbs in the food he cooked. He only said it contained angelica root when it was cooked. The customer couldn’t eat it, and the stall owner’s face immediately turned black. Fortunately, the next customer ordered the same thing as me. She paid the bill, and the stall owner laughed. I went back to order Yibao Hor Rice Noodles again. The soup actually had angelica in it. I didn’t know if the boss did it on purpose. I couldn’t eat the whole plate of noodles. I couldn’t eat more than a few bites. I was really angry! I won't patronize it next time. It’s really hard to find delicious vegetarian food",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112062108748123898710/reviews
