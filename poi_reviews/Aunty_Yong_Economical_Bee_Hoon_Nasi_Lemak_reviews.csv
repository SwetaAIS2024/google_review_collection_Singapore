Norman Leong,4,This stall is at a small coffee shop. Limited seats but still have enough if you share with others. But the smoking corner can be irritating for non smokers. Just endure. The chicken wing is a must order. The beehoon is not bad not too oily. Constant queue. But it moves along fast. We end up packed back another 10 chicken wings back.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114155620550128462356/reviews

I W,4,"Arrived at 6:45am on a weekday.  The stall was already fully operational by then.

With high food inflation, one has to wonder whether ""economical bee hoon"" is still economical?  Or would the hawker have to pass the rising costs to customers?

I ordered a plate of kway teow mixed with bee hoon containing two types of vegetables, and one fried chicken wing.  The total cost was $4.  It would have been cheaper if I had not ordered chicken wing, but gone for the fried egg instead.  So yes, the food here is reasonably priced.

However, I found the overall dish to be a little on the bland side, notwithstanding the nice chilli that was provided.  Whilst there was nothing to complain about, the overall dish wasn't particularly oustanding either.  Taste 3.5/5.

For me, the unexpected star of the show was the friend chicken wing.  It was delicious!   Tasted like Har Cheong Kai (Prawn Paste Chicken), but was much better than the usual offering by Zi Char stalls.  Truly finger-licking good.  Priced at $1.50 each, its batter was delightfully crunchy and did not taste too oily to me.

The fried chicken wing was so addictive that I ordered another 3 chicken wings to go.  Ate them at my office before starting work.  My stomach and taste buds were very satisfied.  Taste 5/5.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107686746966044708528/reviews
Isaac Ong,5,"Favourite Char Bee Hoon place in SG. Noodles are well cooked with the right level of flavours (not too sweet or rubbery like some stalls). Chilli is zesty and packs a punch (spicy!). Egg is usually runny which goes well with the noodles. Sides like Fish Fillet is crispy and yummy as a pairing.

A hearty meal usually costs $2+. Super cheap. My go to meal of noodles, fish fillet and egg is $2.90.

Other sides like Taiwanese sausage, Luncheon Meat, Chicken Wing (tasty!) and veggies. Stall is popular with the residents and usually has a long queue.

Tables are few but enough. Usually have to share. Noodles make for good breakfast but unfortunately the drinks stall coffee is bad (diluted, bitter and bad tasting) so you cannot pair with a nice hot cup of coffee.

Parking is sufficient around the HDB blocks. Short walk from Beauty World MRT Station (DTL).",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118029671066829871466/reviews
Pamela,5,"My pic does NOT do the chicken wings justice!!!! Really the BEST chicken wings I’ve ever tried, & am willing to break my diet for. Giving an absolute 5 stars for it. Very crunchy and flavourful outside, and juicy inside. The meat is also very fresh and tender. My fam and bf love it as well. I usually order it Ala-carte or with the dark beehoon + a really nice cup of Teh from its neighbouring store",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107581998935972871148/reviews
