Each set comes with a main dish that u can choose from, the braised pork rice is super yummy. The dumpling is huge portion and nice too!",

      "text": "Second time eating at City Hot Pot. We tried once at their outlet in Woodlands and it was good. As I recalled we were stuffed and we had to bring home the raw eggs which she cooked it with the hot pot soup.\n\nThis time round I visited the outlet at Guoco Towers with my GF. It was an unplanned dinner and we though just eat and head home since it's Monday.\n\nI went for the vegetable soup (clear) and my GF had the chicken mushroom soup. Both of us ordered the pork collar but I had the udon and she wanted to try their ramen.\n\nNothing much to talk about.. it's individual hot pot and they are not as fancy as Haidilao. For a quick dinner, they hit the spot and if you have about 3-4 pax and above you should try other dishes. We had their mantou (Chinese bun) at Woodlands and they are pretty good.\n\nGive it a try when you are there.. they have a good variety of soup base and you can mix your own dipping sauce.",

      "text": "Enjoyed my time over here with such pleasant customer service by the team. Was already greeted by the male Taiwanese staff before even entering the place, he was making me so at ease. Next came to serve us was Wei Wei, she was quick to attend to us when we tried to enquire something.\n\nWe had the 1 for 1 wagyu beef set meal which I thought it's super worth it. Furthermore it's individual pot means i could  enjoy both spicy bases by myself üòÇ The entire set up & presenting our hotpots were prompt. The set came with a selection of noodles to opt from. In addition we were also entitled to pick up the sides, pickles & fruits from condiment counter.\n\nWe chosen 4 different types of soup bases, 2 spicy & 2 non spicy. My fave base got to be Mala, appreciate Wei Wei for responding to my request. I thought the team's service at this outlet was expectional. We had a wonderful time there.",

The highlight was definitely these wagyu slices which are beautifully marbled and simoly just melt in your mouth.\nWhat's hotpot without a good soup base though? We had the teochew fish soup, big prawn soup, tom yam and mala, all of which were super flavorful and delicious.",
