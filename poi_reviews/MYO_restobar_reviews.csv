Patrick Poh,4,"Quite a nice Chinese restaurant. The variety might not be extensive but the food is quite nice. Highlights were the garoupa fish, clay pot chicken,friend prawn and the vegetables. It's in an interesting office building but the deco seems very simple",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107673184510491093624/reviews

Foong Yee Loh,4,"Surprise find. Hidden in the top floors of the building. Serves an assortment of dim sum, the beef roll was good and unique. Must order the cabbage chicken pot and The peach gum desert.  Both were tasty. Can skip the pork ribs though. However it felt a bit rushed through as staffs were trying to call it a day.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113711067697320214425/reviews
