I paid $15.80 for a good service and food because my love for acai is crazy but this kind of service and the way this female staff do my acai is so bad. First thing the yogurt is more than acai might as well go NTUC buy a whole tub of yogurt and eat and is cheaper. Next, I asked her could she redo and give me more acai and she said this is standard. So with this photo this is call ‚ÄòStandard‚Äô.",
