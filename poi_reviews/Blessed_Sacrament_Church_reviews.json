The Church is conveniently located just 2 bus stops away from Commonwealth mrt station. I love the beautiful and unique design of the building's architecture. The Church hall is also quite large with plenty of seats to support a large congregation.",

      "text": "A catholic church with very avant-garde exterior design. It is located along Queensway, facing Commonwealth Drive, right next to a Hindu temple(Sri Muneeswarar Temple) which is very interesting. This church was built in 1958 after the development of the new suburb Queenstown and the current fancy fancy exterior design was completed in the late 1970s, which was rumored to increase its popularity for fundraising at its early years. In 2005, the Urban Redevelopment Authority granted the church conservation status. One of its most distinguishing features is its iconic blue roof, constructed in folds to resemble the shape of a tent.",
