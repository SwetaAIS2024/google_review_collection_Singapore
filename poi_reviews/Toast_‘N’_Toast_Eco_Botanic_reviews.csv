Joyce Long,5,"Very welcoming service staffs and good food. Clean environment. Strongly recommend this place. But sad to know they are closing this outlet soon in March 2025. So I will continue to patronize them at their outlet in Taman Perling!
A cosy nostalgic cafe with good food and service not to be missed.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104751764578405343410/reviews
Xiao Xiao Chen,5,"Staff were so friendly! I personally saw the aunty greeted everyone nicely when they come in.

Eve C,4,"Updated review dec 2024
Went back again. Food still good. The staff was friendly and flexible to catering to some customisation.

Dec 2023
The place is unassuming and i was skeptical by the setup when i entered. Surprisingly, they serve pretty good food! I had the melaka fried rice which was deliciously made. I would love to try that again next time. Disappointing that they have no curry that day hence have to change to honey for the prata. We ordered Kaya Butter Toast 3 times and the spread was rather inconsistent. They have a good menu and would love to go back and try other food.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109756518746414930822/reviews

Hanis Aina,5,"I really recommend this Kopitiam! If you want to grab a nice meal for lunch or breakfast you guys have to come here and try their various types of toast. It serves a wide variety of kopitiam dishes, including the local cuisine, roti bakar and traditional coffee. ‚òïÔ∏è Not to worry that this kopitiam is muslim friendly üòç

Honestly their toast is the best in town because of the wide choice of unique toast to try out. Not to forget their menu that I ordered such as Seafood Tomyam that comes with super thick broth & spiciness in it comes with rice and tastes amazing. I also ordered their Chicken chop. Super duper delicious. The ambience is also very chill, nice and super clean. Not only that they also have robot waiters to serve the food for you! 10/10 recommended and definitely will come again soon ‚ú®",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105870311924669072223/reviews
