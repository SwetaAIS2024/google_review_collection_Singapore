CK Lin,1,"A living nightmare engaging with one of their executive agent in renting an apartment in Mandarin Gardens through this company, when taking over she was reluctant to fix the detects for the tenant, and got it done only when she was warned about the serious dangers of not rectifying the defects, some examples are corroded aluminum rivets fastening window frames and loud rattling noise when opening and closing of glass door in the bath room.  She is totally incompetent to be kind in words, example asking a tenant whether a washer can be placed on a fridge. When tenant take over an apartment, she would brushed away the defects as minor, however when returning over an apartment, she will want you to fix the same defects that you highlighted in the past. She is also more concern about the tone of a door color with some flatten broken screws than a broken door lock that was fixed by someone else other than her favorite contractor. And I wasn’t even granted access to rectify the door or chance to have another contractor do the job. She just deducted $250 from the security deposit to varnish a less that one square foot of the door. When handling the defects she will only use one contractor in Mandarin Garden that has the worst workmanship. And the same contractor accompanied her when I handed over the apartment, now you can visualize the list of defects you are going to get and the price to fix these soon called “defects.” The appearance of conflict of interest is so glaring.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115136577404058637386/reviews
