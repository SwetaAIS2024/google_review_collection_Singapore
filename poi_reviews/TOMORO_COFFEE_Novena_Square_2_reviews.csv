Wilson Chia,2,"Oat Shaken Espresso is pretty good. However, I can‚Äôt say anything positive about their hot drinks. The order was made and 20+ mins later, the milk is still boiling hot. This made the milk terrible and bitter. Stick to iced drinks unless you prefer a scalded tongue from the visit.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118411873542833862067/reviews
just me,3,"First visit using a voucher.
Presented the voucher and noticed the staff‚Äôs smile faded a little, which caught me off guard. I asked if I could choose any drink, and the reply was, ‚Äúit‚Äôs stated on the voucher.‚Äù I later realized the wording could be clearer ‚Äî it says $2 for any drink, any size, but it actually means $2 off rather than the drink costing $2. A small note or clearer phrasing would‚Äôve made things smoother.

Tried the matcha frappe, which was very diluted than I expected compared to other brands. I managed to finish about 40% of it, as the rest mostly tasted like ice. Hoping it was just an off day, as I was looking forward to trying their drinks.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111846897150785254211/reviews
Belle KK,1,"Ordered a hot latte and it's the first time I've tasted such a HOT cup of latte! Nearly burnt my tougue! Does the barista not know that this is not kopitiam coffee at 90-100 degrees?? The lady who took the order doesn't look & sound friendly at all too.

It comes with the most pathetic looking latte art too üòÇ

It's my first and last time trying out this brand.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106135024364949503121/reviews
EQ Xavier,5,"This coffee shop stands out from similar establishments, offering a superior coffee experience. I ordered a large iced caffe mocha, tailored to my taste with normal sweetness, whole milk, and no whipped cream. The drink arrived refreshingly cold, with no dilution or melted ice. The aroma was rich and inviting. While the price of $6.50 for a large cup may be slightly steep, the exceptional flavor makes it well worth the cost. There are about 8 seats available for those who want a quick rest",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105533019712721928126/reviews
Dolomite PAN,5,A very nice cafe. Low fat Matcha latte is a quite delicious and healthy choice. Fruit American coffee is very special and worth trying. The coffee opens at 7:30am every morning which is convenient for everyone who working around to have breakfast. The bakery is also excellent.  Cheese brezel is highly recommended with a nice taste and low price.,8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102591794289920144177/reviews
