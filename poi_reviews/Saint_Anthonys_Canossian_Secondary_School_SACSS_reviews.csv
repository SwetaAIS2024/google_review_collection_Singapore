superidolstar 69,1,"Tbh i was in this school, graduated last year but ive finally gotten the confidence to write this : The school is just bad , the teachers r very unresonable about your hair,if your fringe is still not touching your eyebrows they will still make u pin it up.A girl in my class had a breakdown from this , the teacher asked her if she wanted to have councelling,after she said no,the teacher said ""okay then i shouldn't hear anymore from u about your hair"" Blatently ignoring her tramua from primary because of being builled. The students as well, many of them will judge u based on your apperance quote "" I-mean, if they dont wanna take care of their apperance than why do they think they'll be treated well?"" As well as the CCA being VERY underfunded, so they skip classes as  the school cannot afford the teachers .

I was the girl in the first story , i cried all the way home during sec 1, I hope they understand how being in this school effected me emotionally . This school will never change.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114157839438069915108/reviews

NR Efa.z,1,"Good Day SCSS,

To be honest, I am really angry and disappointed with one of your teacher today.
Her name is MDM EFFEANA.

I don't really care what her intention was by using that word towards my daughter. There are a million ways to emphasize the importance of the word besides actually using it. We all know what it means, and we all know its significance, so saying it was completely unnecessary. How A TEACHER says to her student that, “can you don’t be STUPID or not??”
WOW!! Is this how you educate your student in your class, in front of her classmates?!!

To be perfectly frank, I lost a tremendous amount of respect for your teacher today!! AND I am pretty surprised by how easy it was for her to just spit it out in the middle of her sentence. And addressing my daug in front of the entire class directly!! Do you know how embarrassed is that MDM EFFEANA?? HOW DO YOU FEEL IF THAT HAPPEN TO YOUR CHILDREN?",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117604719477822961504/reviews
