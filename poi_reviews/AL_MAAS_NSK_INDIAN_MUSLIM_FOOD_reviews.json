I consistently bring my friends here and they too find the food to be decent. Last time, this kopi shop was not able to use Payton. The world has been engulfed and I'm happy to be able to use paynow. The only time the house is full is during dinner hour. Apart from that, there aren't many people. i recommend you the prata here. It may not be the best, but it's one of the best.",

      "text": "Tonight i ordered idly, vadai, and boneless chicken to go. Initially only wanted idly and vadai but uncle persuaded me to try the boneless chicken and I’m glad i did. It’s yummy; tastes like tandoori chicken, but it’s fried and meat is juicy (full disclosure- i heated it up in the airfryer when i got home). The dal went well with the idly; spices are well-proportioned and seasons the idly nicely. I can’t really comment on the vadai because my 3 year old daughter took it without permission and finished it but she only finishes food she likes so i guess it must have been pretty good. I include a photo of her theft. Will return when I’m in the area looking for food.",

Totally spoilt the taste and dish altogether.\n\nNot a stall that I would revisit given the poor curry..",
