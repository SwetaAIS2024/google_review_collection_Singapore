Che C,5,"Oooh I loved Ee
Leen Tay dentist! She’s the kindest, most polite and gentle being ever seen for dental works. Also the sweet front desk staff!

22/03/2025 Update: Oh my gosh, please don’t mix up this Smile Dental @ Blk 59 with Smile Central @ Blk 58! Totally different clinics with similar sounding names. There’s no Dentist “Jonathan” here so please call the right clinic for your dentures, implant problems or whatsoever.  Poor staff here have to endure all your call complaints wrongly directed to them because of your lack of care in checking.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115738721604283260527/reviews

Hizan Mohd,1,"Booked appt at 11am. I came 15 mins earlier and cleared all paperworks by 1055am. Was asked to wait. Waited until 1115am and asked Recep, how long more I have to wait. She replied, half an hour more! Why? Because the existing patient decided to do an implant. No one approached to inform me abt the expected delay and no apology. Time wasted.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117311076928349986941/reviews
