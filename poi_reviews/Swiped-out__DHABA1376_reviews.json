Went up and ordered a ayam bryani and aloo Gobi without any expectations. Both dishes are GOOD!! Not oily, not overcook and the chicken pieces are boneless and tender. The aloo Gobi is delicious. Finished up the last drop of gravy. Good much better than the big 2 indian-muslim eateries across the road. The pictures of the food are from their half eaten condition.",

      "text": "Really good authentic North Indian food. Has a nice homecooked taste so it’s not overly oily or salty. The chefs and service are so sincere. If you can’t decide what to get, try the mixed kebab for a sample of everything! The malai tikka is a chicken kebab that is incredibly tender. It is seasoned with yoghurt and BBQed with a nice charred flavor. The biryani portion is huge and the mint sauce is so so good.",

      "text": "Got the chicken briyanni and chicken Tikka briyanni $9each. Used the burpple app 1-for-1 quite worth it. The curry is a bit salty, basmati rice is a bit too soft and sticky as I would like for briyani. Taste for chicken Tikka is not bad. I brought my own container and they wanted to charge me $1 for takeaway still, managed to waive off, but didn't give me achar and papadum, only realised after I left. Overall, won't come again without burpple.",

It had good creaminess and flavour to it.\nThe naan really accompanied the began really well. It was soft and fluffy. It also had a delicious garlic spread on top of it which enhanced the pairing of the began bhartha.\nOverall, a good place to come for some good North Indian food.",
