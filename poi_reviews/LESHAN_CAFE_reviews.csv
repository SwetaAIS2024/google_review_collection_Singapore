Angee Xue,3,"Ordered some kuehs, curry chicken and laksa!
Kueh was good, 4/5
Curry chicken was good, but the rice was not cooked properly leyyy it wasnâ€™t fluffy throughout. Some parts hard hard one.. for that imma have to give it a 2.9/5..
the laksa was good and flavourful 3.8/5

Overall price was on steeper end. Like $32 for both dishes in total.

Located in temple so itâ€™s quite a cool place.

Would I come back? Probably not on my own choice. But I guess itâ€™s a cool place for foreigners who are coming to Singapore for the first time! ðŸ™‚",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105662084479095201784/reviews
Teoh Louis,5,"Tasty and affordable traditional Singaporean cuisine, with plenty of traditional peranakan decorations in an old historical heritage building. Seats in blue school style building are air conditioned, if you're afraid of the cold or resistant to the warm climate, you may choose seats at the corridor for a tea break for two, or take a seat in the pagoda at the centre.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102355023855809404850/reviews
Vin W,2,"Visited during lunch and service was rather slow.
Chicken rendang was watery and lacked flavor, more like a curry. However, generous serving of chicken.
Overall, below-average dining experience.
Preferred the taste and quality when the establishment was under previous name or management.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109263427873687540100/reviews
Helena Wu,2,"To be fair, we cannot describe the food as tasty, or any words similar. It could be tell that the Siew Mai were frozen ones instead of fresh hand made one. Please avoid this kind of expectations before going. The soup tasted ok but only the taste was too weak.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107031871671049203749/reviews
