Buren,3,"Yah, as much as it's not a bad scenery, I'd suggest that you pass this. Go to nearby Upper Seletar Reservoir instead.

Why?
- Nothing much to see
- Bus access very minimal
- Slippery path because of moss growing on part of it.

I don't recommend to bring elderly here, for those who wants to include this in their long walk/jog, it's okay.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103975090698079167241/reviews
Justin Tan,4,"This scenic lookout has a picturesque view. However, be mindful that there's a troop of macaques living near there. They will check out any passers-by.  When you are taking photos of the scenery,  please be watchful of these macaques. Make sure there are none at the trees above you. They will also creep up on you to seize any chances of snatching your bags.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115739474329491912284/reviews
Universe Infinite,5,"This is the real scenic lookout along this stretch of the park connector, without any building when you snap photos. If the sky is clear with just sufficient amount of scattered cloud, thatâ€™s when the perfect photo are captured! Try going at different time of the day, there will be a different perspective!",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108896893300731369390/reviews
