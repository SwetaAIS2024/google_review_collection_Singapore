      "text": "My son was previously from a renowned childcare preschool. We pulled him out after 3 months, as he kept falling sick.\nI was searching for a Christian Montessori pre school and came across CVK. He graduated last year and my daughter is now N2 with CVK.\nTheir Chinese immersion program is fantastic. We don’t speak mandarin at home, but yet my son can read and speak better than I do. They have optional Art and craft, speech and drama programs which my both children love attending. The school’s curriculum fosters creativity, curiosity and social skills development.\nBoth school director Ms Judy and principal, Ms Veron is so passionate in teaching and patient with the children. They impart not just education. Life skills and also create a nurturing environment to instill values and good character for the children to learn and grow.\nMy son was a competitive and an active child since young. Was playful and cheeky in class. As a first time mum, I was so grateful for all the advice, support and encouragement both Ms Judy and Ms Veron had given me.\nThe teachers  are extremely attentive to the students. Even the tiniest scratch/bites/rash they will inform and notify the parents.\nThe safety measures and cleanliness is at the highest standards. During Covid outbreak, my surrounding friends’ children school had multiple and rapid cases.\nI was so impressed that CKV only had their first case at a much later period.\nI appreciate that the school has small students to teacher ratio. The children have more attention and focus on.\nMy overall experience with CVK had left a lasting impression of satisfaction and confidence that I had already  recommended 2 friends whose children are enrolled there now.",

      "text": "The greatest gift I can ever gift to my child was to send her to Children Vineyard. My child had graduated from Children Vineyard last year and honestly it is the best school ever! Where do i even begin?\n\nIn 2018, I was very keen to send my 18 month old for school exposure and I found dear daughter a full day preschool (yes tired mum). However that was a mistake. My child was always sick and having accidents in school. She did not enjoy school at all because she was crying every school day for 4 months.\n\nAnd so, we moved on from that not so good preschool and found Children Vineyard. Ever since then, i never looked back. I had a happy child returning to me every single day after school. Everything was what we wanted and looked for.. even with the shorter hours (7.15 to 330pm). The teachers were great- dedicated, kind and approachable. Bonus point- hygiene standard superb! Most importantly, I see consistency in honest open communication where we get to work together and help the little one nurture and grow for both in school and at home for the past 5 years. My little one has now blossomed into a fine young lady. Thank you Ms Judy, Ms Veron and all the teachers in Vineyard! Please keep up the awesome work!",

      "text": "i am forever grateful for Ms Judy who pointed out my child is rather difference and need more medical attention.\n\nMy girl was 2 when she first enrolled into Children vineyard.\nAt 3 YO, Ms judy suggested either to retain my child in N1 instead of promoting to N2. I was upset when I heard this from Ms judy but  She noticed and explained my child needs physical support in class because she can't sit without resting her hands on floor to support her. She also suggested we go for Occupational therapy to see if there's any improvement.\n\nWe were on denial that my child is diff from others cos she's still so young. But everything Ms Judy had observed and advised us was right.\n\nWent to KKH and psychologist and found out my child is GDD.\nHer development delays had caused her unable to speak throughout her times in childrevinyard  yet Ms Judy was still very nice and gave my child 1-1 during her free time to shadow her when she could.\n\nWe eventually left Childvineyard and placed her in my lil gem normal childcare while waiting for a place in an inclusive school which I regretted badly. Cos beside the class being big, my child wasn't learning anything. Anyway we eventually got a place in an inclusive school shortly after 6 mths.\n\nCut the story short, my child has successfully graduated from pre sch and now in CHIJ primary school despite her needs in a many of aspects. But that's cos we accepted Ms Judy's advised and suggestion. I wished I had done something for my child sooner.\nBecause the sooner a special needs child gets treatment , the rate of them improving to be like their peers is faster.",
