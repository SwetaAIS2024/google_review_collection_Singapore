      "text": "I am so so thankful for this church; especially the Hokkien service!\n\nPastor Jeffrey and sister Grace are really God-sent; to bring comfort and love to my mum during this season of her life.\n\nMy mum is 89 years old this year; and not a regular church attendee...due to her health and also challenges in getting to places in a wheelchair.\n\nYet when I approached Ps Jeffrey and Church of Singapore with concerns for my mum ... Ps Jeffrey responded immediately with a home visit with other staff members.\n\nMy mum was thrilled to have fellow Christians visit her; singing worship hokkien song 'jin jia ho, wo eh ya saw, jin jia ho...'! The visit made her so so happy.\n\nMum is warded in SGH since Wed, waiting for a minor op, while I typed this. Guess what? Ps Jeffrey visited her the very night she was 1st awarded with another brother; and today before her surgery, Ps Jeffrey came with sister Grace to pray and sing with her. This visit brought so much joy and comfort to her. I am so so comforted to see video of my mum praising God and full of joy, before her surgery!\n\nThank you Lord, for bringing Ps Jeffrey and the staff of Hokkien Service from Church of Singapore into my mum's life at this most needed time of her life!\n\n(A side note: I am not physically in Singapore all the time as I had emigrated)\n\n* having another spiritual family who loves and cares for my mum in my absence is such a blessing *",
