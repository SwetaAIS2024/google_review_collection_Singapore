CNT,5,"My boys are having music classes at Gail's Piano Studio. The studio may look plain and humble from the outside, but the teachers there have such wonderful hearts and sincerity to help children be connected with music and discover their own gift. My sons enjoy their music classes a lot! They talk about their teachers, both Teacher Gail and Teacher Suri, at home too, how kind and talented they are.
Another thing I love is, teachers also organize music parties for the kids quite regularly. During the parties, we did craft like making Bach's hair and every child could wear the paper wig on their heads (so fun!) and performing, and even eating food that Bach ate in the long past. The teachers went an extra mile to connect the kids to music from all areas and I was truly touched! Highly recommend Gail's Piano Studio!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117480972620690857317/reviews
Jason Han,5,"Both my daughters, aged 5 and 6, have been learning piano at Gail’s Piano Studio, learning on the Orffie keyboard program. Teacher Gail is lively and energetic, creating a fun and engaging atmosphere, while Teacher Jia Min is supportive and patient, assisting the kids. They always invite us parents to join at the end of each lesson, which helps us know how to practice with the kids—a big help since we don’t know piano ourselves. Overall, my girls have lots of fun and are happily learning!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113228344417831721259/reviews

Doris LK,5,"I started my daughter with Teacher Gail and her team of super friendly and passionate teachers on Orffie Keyboard Program last year. It’s been 6 months and my daughter has looked forward to going to classes almost every week. The passion , enthusiasm and love for music is evident from the teachers on how they conduct their lessons and interact with the children. They also put in the  extra effort and go the extra mile to have special workshops allowing the students to explore more than just what is taught in class but in the world of music. I especially like the Parent Time where my daughter put up a performance showing what she have learnt so far. I really count myself lucky to be able to find Gail’s Piano Studio and have no hesitation to give them my strongest recommendation.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114022727360579087886/reviews
Lien Le,5,"My 2 kids (6 and 7yo) have been with teacher Gail for 3 months and how glad I am that I made that decision to take kids to a trial lesson with her! It's my kids' eagerness about their weekly class and their daily practice without me asking for it that tells me that we are on the right track. I personally don't believe in coercion and/or strategies to motivate kids, especially in learning/playing piano. The music and the piano alone are exciting enough. You just need an instructor with professional skills and especially the heart to keep on that excitement. And that's exactly what we have been grateful for with teacher Gail. I believe with her teaching approach and her heart for teaching music, teacher Gail is able to reach adult learners, too. Writing this review, I hope to share my experience with other parents, who want to give their kids great (first) moments with the piano and to expose them to the excitement and beauty of music!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102765748594761465762/reviews
