      "text": "My first time here, after seeing it on social media so often. The idea is not new but still impressive enough when seeing it with your own eyes.\nI was there during the long weekend holiday, but still feel very spacious and not over crowded. There are probably more books for the young readers and children but I also saw a wide range of books for adults & topics.\nInside that impressive lighted bookshelf is a hidden \"book room\" for children. Even more impressive, it is 2 levels of hidden \"book room\". There's also a cafe (wolf cafe) in the corner and a piano by the window, surely anyone, young or old, can find their interest in this store, whether you like books or not.",
