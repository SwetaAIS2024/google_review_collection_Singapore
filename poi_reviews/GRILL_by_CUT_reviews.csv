edtayjb,5,"I am BIG fan of this Japanese restaurant that's in Bukit Timah Plaza, and just next door to its sister butchery/""fishery"" - and especially, its $12++ weekday lunch sets, for which the mains of your choice from a fairly wide selection, come with a salad and miso soup. Today, my wife ordered a Yonshu Sashimi Don, whereas I opted for a Classic Tonkotsu Don. Both were very good - and my wife has ordered her choice before. What I also love about this place is its generous cuts of whether sashimi or meats.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107467079327459015215/reviews

Rick Koh,5,"Butchery - restaurant type of price. Good selection of food choices. I had the sukiyaki with snow pork. Presented with other accompanying dishes such as chawamushi, udon, miso soup and 2 slices of watermelon. Nice tasting although the broth is on the sweeter side .... Kind of expected from a sukiyaki hotpot. We had the signature beef bowl too. It was cooked to perfection. Overall a hearty meal for lunch.

2nd time here. This time we ordered from the CUT butchery. We had the Kanachi Fish Head grilled to perfection, excellent to say the least. The hirame sashimi was fresh and very good. Garlic fried rice was as expected of Japanese standard. The cold soba set with grilled ribeye was its usual goodness. A very enjoyable lunch.

3rd time
Ordered whole fish sashimi from the Cut Butchery. The remaining fish carcass and head were used to boil an excellent miso soup. Excellent and awesome. The prime ribeye was a tat disappointing. The meat was good but the fat layer was too rubblery and chewy. Garlic fried rice was it's usual goodness. Upgrading this place to a 5 stars.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106510842319180067826/reviews
