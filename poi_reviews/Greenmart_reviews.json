      "text": "I recently picked up my parcel at Bedok North (Green Mart) and was disappointed by the service I received. The Chinese woman working there, who appeared to be in her late 40s to early 50s, had a poor attitude. When I arrived to collect my item within the collection timing, she gave me a disapproving look. Today, as I stood quietly waiting for her to assist me, she angrily sorted parcels into a trash bag. When she finally addressed me, she did so with hostility, slapping the trash bag and demanding my pin number. Despite her rude behavior, I remained composed, provided my pin number, retrieved my parcel, thanked her, and left without receiving any acknowledgment in return. Buyers like us do not deserve this.",
