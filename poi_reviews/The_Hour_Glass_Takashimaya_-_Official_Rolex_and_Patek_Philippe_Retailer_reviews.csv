From start to finish, Fancy, who had been assisting me for weeks leading up to the collection, demonstrated unparalleled professionalism. She was incredibly accommodating to my schedule, courteous, and maintained excellent follow-through throughout the process.

During the collection, her attention to detail stood out as she thoroughly explained the care instructions for my watch and guided me on my watch journey, even sparking my interest in exploring other pieces. Her friendly and affirming demeanor made the experience even more memorable.

I also noticed the seamless teamwork and collaboration among the staff, who supported each other to ensure the purchasing process was smooth for every client.

The newly renovated space added to the overall experience with its aesthetically pleasing ambiance, making the visit even more enjoyable.

Lillian Mui,5,Wow we had an unforgettable experience at the Hour Glass at Taka. We contacted Thomas through the recommendation of a relative to help source a submariner date Rolex watch as a wedding gift for my son. Thomas was very helpful and professional. He asked us to first register interest first and invited us to the shop to view other watches. Couple of days later he shared good news. Rest is history. We are happy customers üòäüôè,2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113041957135149268084/reviews
