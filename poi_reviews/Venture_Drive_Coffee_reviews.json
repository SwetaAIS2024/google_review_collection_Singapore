Queue will be a little long during lunch hours, around 10-20 mins wait as there is only 1 staff taking the order and making the coffee. If you have a high paying job and are willing to spend more to get a good quality coffee then sure. If you are a peasant student then kopi from Koufu or instant coffee from prime will do the job just as well.",

It’s worth here to try different beans - great choice.\n\nNot a lover of an ice coffee here tbh, but I think it’s more personal)\n\nStudent discount is a great addition ➕\n\nMatcha I took once - wasn't fully mixed - because it was whipped right in the cup (so for that - I’m going to Starbucks)",
