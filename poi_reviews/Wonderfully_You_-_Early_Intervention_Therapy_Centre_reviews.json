      "text": "Wonderfully You is really awesome! I could see my son's growth pretty fast after i enrolled him in Dec last year. Principal Therapist, Geraldine has been consistently doing a great job and has been updating me promptly on the work she has been doing with my son on a weekly basis. My son is just very comfortable with her and has been showing progress day by day. She also  gives parents some tips on how things can be done differently to motivate children in doing certain things that they have not been wanting to do. All thanks to Geraldine!üôè",

Within that time, we have seen significant improvements in him.\n\nWhereas previously he hardly said a word or noticed others around him, he's more communicative and sociable since. He is also more well-behaved and has a better attention span as well.\n\nWe are deeply impressed with Geraldine and Joey for their obvious passion, professionalism and dedication in this field - we are definitely glad that we have put faith in them. We look forward to even more development in our boy to become a well-rounded individual with their help!",

Joey has not only offered professional support for my child but has also acted as an advisor to me and my husband, providing invaluable guidance on managing him effectively, especially during meltdowns, and addressing various issues as they arise. Initially, we began with school shadowing, and this year, I made the decision to enrol my son at the Wonderfully You Centre for five days a week. I have witnessed significant improvements in my son, and I attribute this to the team's efforts in making him feel loved, encouraged, and engaged in numerous activities. What I appreciate most is the continuous updates I receive throughout the day!",
