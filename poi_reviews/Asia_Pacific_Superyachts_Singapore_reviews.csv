John van der Straaten,5,"A Big Thank you to Scott, Joan and their team for being our indispensable interface with the outside world while we were confined to the dock under
“Not To Land” orders for 7 months in Singapore during the Covid-19 lockdown. They navigated the ever-changing restrictions and regulations for crew changes, organised supplies, shipments and contractors, our visit to the shipyard, bunkering and negotiated the all important occasional Day Passes for the crew. Always a pleasure to work with, I have no hesitation in recommending them to my fellow captains.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104887789238156956125/reviews
