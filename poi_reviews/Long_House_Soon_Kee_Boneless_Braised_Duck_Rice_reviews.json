It is unlike those salty & oily braised duck rice with a lot msg but not this. The duck rice, sauce and soup here are not very salty, yet still can deliver a good flavour. Duck meats not dry and very tender. Portion given is also generous $4.50",

      "text": "A decent plate of duck rice, but honestly quite overrated. The rice was mostly clumped up, but goes pretty well with the braised sauce. The duck was quite dry - nothing fantastic. The upside is that it is boneless. The innards though are braised pretty well and provide an additional texture to the duck rice. The soup is good too - not like the typical bland soup that is full of MSG. The chilli was meh too, not spicy nor fragrant at all. Overall, I wouldnâ€™t mind eating it if I am nearby and craving for duck rice, but definitely not worth a queue.",

The duck and the gizzard tasted ok but the portion was quite pathetic. The chilli had an overpowering spice taste that didn't gel with the taste of the braised duck. Overall, I was quite disappointed with this meal.",
