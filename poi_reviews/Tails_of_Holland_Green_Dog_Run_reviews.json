Parking is also limited to a small corner along the side of the road (park at own risk) as itâ€™s not an official parking area.",

Pretty clean. been there 3x so far all 3 times could find dog poo and some other rubbish (an old sharp rusty nail!). guess there will always be owners who don't clean up. ;o( but on the whole still a very nice space for the doggies to run around and play. unshaded so do come at a time when its not so hot. no water points so pls bring your own water.",
