      "text": "Long queue, but moves pretty fast due to fast service staff. I am not a fan of prata stalls over-preparing the prata and leaving it in the tray, but for stalls with mass orders like theirs, I think it is okay. The prata that is mass-made still taste hot, crispy. Fish curry has a very bright orange hue, unlike regular stalls with seemingly diluted curry. Though fish taste not that strong, leaned towards more good-tasting vegetable curry instead.\n\nThe idiyappam came straight out of a packet, for 2.40$, and the coconut flakes did not have a slight crunch to it, tasted bland. Props to the swift business and good pre-making bulk.",
