      "text": "This place is so underrated!! We unintentionally passed by this stall because we grew incredibly hungry after shopping for 5 hours. Ended up ordering a combo roast duck and roast pork plate that comes with duck soup. YUM. The roast pork skin has a nice crisp to it and the duck was not super dry. The rice was such a nice complement to the roast meats, and the soup was tasty. I love me a good soup, even if it does come free with an entree.\n\nHighly recommend if you’re in the area.",

Felt they were not interested in the quality of the food and the servings.\n\nRead more positive and decided to give it another try.\n\nCertainly did not disappoint with the poor quality of the roast duck, char siew and roast pork.  Bony, chewy and texture felt as they have been left for long time with the oil already coagulating in the meat.  It tasted very gamey too.\n\nWon't recommend this to anyone.",

The noodle is thinner than usual but very well cooked and tasteful for the dry version, the char siew are hk style which was thick cut and tender even though lacking char. Would have been a 5 stars bowl of noodle if not for their run of the mill wontons.",
