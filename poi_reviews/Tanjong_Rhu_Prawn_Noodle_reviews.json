      "text": "Ordered $5 pork rib noodle.\n\nNoodle : average\nSoup : good\nPrawn : good\nPork rib : mixed\n\nNoodle texture isn't particularly outstanding. But with all the sauce mixed it taste great.\n\nSoup is well flavored goes well if you dip the noodle in.\n\nPrawn was fresh and devein. Reasonable size. But only 2.\n\nPork rib is a mix. Generally very tough but some with fats are delightful.\n\nOverall it feels very home cooked. Like what your ah ma will cook for you. Personally I feel it is okay maybe a bit tame in umami. Definitely on the lighter taste side.",

      "text": "Favourite Prawn Noodles in Singapore! Even nicer than the famous ones I‚Äôve eaten. Or at least I like it more than the famous ones.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è Personal favourite is Á±≥Á≤âÈù¢Âπ≤ (Bee Hoon and Yellow Noodles, Dry). Some of my family members prefer the Mee Kia, dry. When you order your noodles dry, it will come with a bowl of soup that is refillable if you dine-in.\n\nThe prawns and noodles are cooked just nice. üíØ Uncle ever saw my brother move the prawns from the noodles to the bowl of hot soup so he could mix the noodles up and uncle came over to tell my brother that he cooked the prawns just nice so try not to soak it in the soup for too long or the prawns might get overcooked. Some hawkers can‚Äôt be bothered about the food served once they have already received payment but seems like uncle here has standards! üëçüèº\n\nStall is in the same coffeeshop as the famous Tanjong Rhu Pau and looking at the lack of crowd when the Pau shop is not opened, this prawn noodle stall is still a hidden gem and underrated.\n\nStall is closed on Wednesday and because of the lack of crowd, they are closing the stall on Tuesdays too it seems and maybe even Mondays in future if the lack of customers continues.\n\nCoffee shop has limited seats so if you want to dine-in you might want to go around 11-11.30am. Soup would be even tastier by this time.",
