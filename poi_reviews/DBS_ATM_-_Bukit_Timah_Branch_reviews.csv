Flo Yeow,5,"ATM is located on the 1st floor of Bukit Timah Plaza. Right by the pick up and drop off point, and the taxi stand, or Popular bookstore if you know where those landmarks are. It gets the job done if you need some extra cash. There's also a coin deposit machine here if you looking to get rid of some coins (there are costs involved though).",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
