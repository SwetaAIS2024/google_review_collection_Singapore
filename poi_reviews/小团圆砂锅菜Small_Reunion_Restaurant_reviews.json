      "text": "Affordable Prices, Mixed Feelings on the Food\nThe prices here are definitely budget-friendly, and the portions were just right for two people.\n\nHere‚Äôs what we tried:\n-Spicy & Sour Shredded Potatoes\nUnfortunately, it lacked both the sourness and the spiciness you‚Äôd expect from this dish. However, the shredded potatoes were crisp and refreshing, which was a plus.\n\n-Country-Style Stir-Fried Pork\nThis dish had a nice wok aroma and tender pork, but it was very oily. The green peppers were soaked in oil, making it a bit heavy. That said, it paired well with rice.\n\n-Boiled Sliced Pork in Spicy Soup\nThe soup and meat were both quite salty. While the portion was generous and the pork tender, the overpowering saltiness made it hard to enjoy fully. It included bean sprouts, black ear mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, and pork slices.\n\n-Garlic Pork Slices\nAt this price, I wasn‚Äôt expecting a lot of meat, but the presentation was a bit misleading. Only 7‚Äì8 thin slices of pork were laid over a bed of cucumber, giving the illusion of a full bowl. The cucumber had absorbed a lot of chili oil, which made it less refreshing than expected.\n\n-Grilled Sausage\nThis was decent. It was juicy and flavorful, though be careful when biting into it‚Äîas it can be quite hot inside.\n\n-White Rice\nSurprisingly, this was my favorite. The rice was sticky and had a nice texture. We saw others helping themselves to refills the rice and were told it was free, we even double confirm with the staff is the rice for free refill and the staff replied us Ya/Yes. But we were charged in the end. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal, but a bit confusing.\n\nOverall for me, I think that If you‚Äôre curious to try something new or looking for Chinese food on a budget, this place is okay.\nBut for me, it‚Äôs a one-time visit. The food didn‚Äôt quite meet my expectations, but the price point may make it worthwhile for others.",

      "text": "Nestled in Eco botanic, Small Reunion Restaurant is a delightful surprise for lovers of regional Chinese cuisine. Specializing in Dong Bei, Sichuan, and Hunan dishes, this week-old gem already shines with its comforting ‚Äúhome-cooked‚Äù ethos and warm, attentive service.\n\nThe menu is a flavorful tour of China‚Äôs diverse culinary regions. The claypot presentation isn‚Äôt just aesthetic; it locks in heat and aroma, making every bite feel like it‚Äôs straight from a family kitchen. True to their promise, flavors are rustic, hearty, and unmistakably authentic‚Äîno fussy twists, just honest, satisfying cooking.\n\nWhat elevates the meal is the genuinely friendly service. The staff (and possibly the owners) greet diners with enthusiasm, happily explaining dishes or recommending personal favorites. Their pride in the food is palpable, and the welcoming vibe makes you feel like a guest at a lively family gathering.\n\nPrice-wise, it‚Äôs a win. For a restaurant barely a week old, Small Reunion already feels like a neighborhood staple. If you‚Äôre craving regional Chinese flavors served with warmth and authenticity, this spot is worth seeking out. A delicious reminder that sometimes, the best meals do taste like home. ü•¢üç≤",
