Had the heavenly yuzu crab in a set with lemongrass tea & potato salad sides.\n\nHad lil bites of pomegranate in the yuzu crab fillings which caught me by surprise. Interesting!\n\nHotdog 3.5/5\nLemongrass tea can omit. Sweet. Get other drink.\nPotato salad- 3/5\n\nWould love to try other hot dogs and pair it with other sides. Saw a table with some colorful tortilla/vege chips‚Ä¶ Looks good!\n\nOh ya! Friendly cashier who recommends well!",
