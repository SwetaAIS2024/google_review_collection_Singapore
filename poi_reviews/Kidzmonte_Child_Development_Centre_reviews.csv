Peian Tan,5,"From the moment we walked through the doors, we felt welcomed and assured that our child was in a safe, nurturing environment. The staff is incredibly warm, attentive, and professional, always going above and beyond to ensure each child receives individualized care.

I appreciate how they focus on both educational development and social skills, offering a well-rounded curriculum that includes arts and crafts, music, and early literacy activities.

Communication is excellent ‚Äì I receive regular updates, photos, and progress reports, which provide peace of mind throughout the day. It‚Äôs clear the team genuinely cares about the children, fostering a supportive atmosphere where kids can thrive.

Ray Wang,5,"My son was diagnosed with moderate autism in 2022. During that time, he changed kindergartens twice, but neither experience yielded satisfactory results. Eventually, we found Kidzmonte. After having a conversation with the principal, Ms. Pechi, I felt a great sense of confidence and hope. We decided to transfer our son to Kidzmonte.

Over nearly two years, I have witnessed tremendous changes in him. Previously, he hardly spoke at all; now, he enjoys talking. He used to be very afraid of strangers, but now he can greet neighbors proactively when he sees them in the elevator. His self-care skills have also improved significantly.

I feel truly fortunate that my son and I found Kidzmonte, along with Ms. Pechi, Teacher Meera, Teacher Radha, and all the other kind and dedicated teachers. Originally, my son was scheduled to start Primary 1 in 2025, but I have decided to let him spend another year at Kidzmonte. I believe that with one more year of learning and growth, he will be ready to transition smoothly into Primary 1.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108069717164389355299/reviews
