      "text": "The pizzas themselves are great. We always love their flavours.\n\nThe staff at this outlet? Not so great. In fact, bad. When it came to our family's turn, the staff took our order, and when we said we didn't want the offer, just punched in the order with a frown. Staff continued punching in other orders, making us wait for a while before she prepared our order and just dumped it on the counter top without a word.\n\nHope you can train your staff better. Yes, F&B is not easy and full salutes to them- but neither is it easy seeing your staff make customers wait for no good reason. We are not asking for a red carpet, just basic courtesy - yet that's not there.",
