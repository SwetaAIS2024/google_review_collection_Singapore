Nurafifa Razak,1,"I am vendor here at Centropod for many years and we were given access to the swimming pool & the gym. However, the gym equipments were frequently not working. And I approached the building manager to inform him that the equipments were down due to a power trip (all power sockets could not be used). However, he was not helpful.
