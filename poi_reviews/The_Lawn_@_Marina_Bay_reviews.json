That said, while it’s perfectly serviceable for a relaxed break, don’t expect anything extraordinary beyond that.",

But If you can and have the patience to get to these locations early for a good spot - I would recommend visit Esplanade theatres, the Raffles bridge or Marina Bay Sands mall Promenade for the best viewing points.\n\nBut the quality and scale of the fireworks this was still a memorable experience to bring in the 2020s.\n\nOn the flip side it is one of the easier places to access given the train lines - easiest Blue line with Downtown station just below the lawns, not that far away is the Red line and circle with Marina Bay MRT. If by taxi or car coming in and out from the MCE is a great way to beat most road blocks or traffic bottle necks.",

It’s sizeable for a nice outdoor festival, it was shockingly not hot (though, it had rained pretty hard earlier on), and it’s in a beautiful location!\n\nRelatively easy access, though going into the CBD (and leaving) has its own issues. Located in the CDB, you have choices of food and drinks in walking distance as well - just in case what you were there for wasn’t as well promised as you thought.\n\nWouldn’t recommend visiting it unless there is an activity there, but if you’re walking by, stand in the middle and take 360 shot, the buildings around are amazing - you’ll get a pretty decent bottom up skyline shot!",
