      "text": "Food was amazing, though portions are very small and I was hungry at 12 midnight after the dinner...\n\nWe ordered quite a few starters and 2 mains, and must say that the Octopus dish and Prawn Risotto stood out the most. Very interesting flavours and mix of sauces for the Octopus dish! The Prawn Risotto was very flavourful without being too overpowering. However they only served 2 prawns on the risotto which was extremely sad and seemed to be overpriced....\n\nWould come again only if I win lottery + feeling extremely happy because of the price point.",

It was a lovely experience.\n\nFriendly staff/servers made good recommendations on the menu.\n\nEach time a dish was brought to us Chef Wei Tse personally introduced the dish himself and made sure we know what we are eating. Every single dish was exquisite and delicious. Uploaded some photos for reference.\n\nHighly recommended!",

      "text": "This is gonna be my go to place for Spanish food after today…!\n\nWe came as a group of 5 and we loved every single dish we ordered!!!\n\nWhat I love most and will recommend others has got to be their garlic carabinero prawns, their Hokkaido Paella (which genius decides to add Japanese elements in Spanish cooking!? It can only be Chef Carlos) & lastly the Spanish suckling pig.\n\nThe prawns were sweet, plump, succulent, and most importantly super fresh. That head butter from the prawn’s head was also a highlight.\n\nAs for the Paella, I just love the creativity of it. To make it look so aesthetically pleasing and to add in Japanese ingredients in it like Hokkaido Uni & Cuttlefish is just brilliant. On top of everything that was mentioned, the paella also has a very rich umami claypot kinda rice & prawns in it too.\n\nAnother plus point, I super love it that the suckling pig is based on grams and not sold as just “whole” or “half” where it can easily be $200~$400 & too much to eat.\nOver here, it is sold as $15 per 100grams and you can tell the chef how much you wanna eat or for how many pax.\n\nSpecial mention to their cabbage & cauliflower dish too. Man, it was so delicious, paired so well that I’m sure the vegetarians will be very happy dining here too.\n\nWe will definitely come back more often at Esquina!",
