Hello Chester,3,"Most items were gone by 9pm. Closes at 10pm but there were still customers. Good that they didnt chase them out when we left almost 10pm.

Donuts were normal jco taste. Drinks i has avocado frappe. Didnt taste much avocado at all.

Irish latte was ok. Nice and sweet.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104505356083031578026/reviews
Tee,5,"Attention coffee and donut lovers! The donuts were a perfect blend of soft, fluffy, and indulgent, with a wide variety of flavors to choose from. The coffee was equally impressive—bold, aromatic, and a perfect complement to the sweetness of the donuts.

The cozy atmosphere made the experience even better. Whether you’re stopping by in the morning to get going, mid-day pick-me-up, or an evening sweet treat. This is the perfect spot. I’ll definitely come back to try more things.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109282762148804362066/reviews
BH,4,Got half dozen donuts and a Hazelnut Hot Choc. The Hazelnut Hot Choc is superb! The donuts were nice but a bit stale/cold. Nevertheless these are the tastiest donuts in the market right now.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103525834037477960680/reviews
CP,5,"When it comes to comforting donut, somehow I prefer J.CO. When I come to the Bugis area, this will normally be my place of refuge to have a quick bite into their delicious donuts and enjoy a decent fruity long back while checking out some emails.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861923464679544218/reviews
otto bubak,1,Coffee and the atmosphere was alright but the workers were really rude and rushed us to order even tho we hadnt decided what to get + there was nobody in line so no need to rush. You can only stay for 1 hour so not good if u wanna study or sit longer periods.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110016570224504824993/reviews
