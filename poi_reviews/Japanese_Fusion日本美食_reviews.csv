Kim Jun Hong,5,"I recently got takeout and ordered the Chicken Karaage Udon with Chawamushi, all for just $8.50.

The staff were friendly, the waiting time was quick, and everything was well-packed.

The Karaage chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It would have been perfect with some dipping sauce, though.

The udon was exceptionally tasty, but the portion was a bit small.

The Chawamushi was flavorful, although it felt a bit dry compared to those at Japanese restaurants. Considering it costs only $1.50, it’s still a great deal.

I’ll definitely be visiting again to try more dishes!l",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115322490341831324881/reviews
