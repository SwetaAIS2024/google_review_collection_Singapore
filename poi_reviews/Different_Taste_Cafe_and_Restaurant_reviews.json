We also ordered the garlic paste chicken, and it was quite good as well. The home-made barley was equally good. And we had a good lunch. We will come back for more.",

      "text": "Was searching a place to take my elderly mother for a Sunday lunch. She says her arthritis is acting up and the doctor suggests she add some spice to her diet. Came across this place. Not too excited about the locale because the parking is quite the challenge. And true enough the lane with parking available was near impossible to navigate, but nevertheless, parking was found. Ok, so they’re predominantly a Peranakan joint, but with a melange of various dishes also made available. Since there were only 2 of us, we picked a Penang char kway teow, a ayam buah keluak, sambal okra with prawn, and then a tahu goreng. The okra could have been a little spicier, but the ayam buah keluak was really sesap (yummy!), I had to get a bowl of rice. The tahu goreng was fried quite crispily, and the peanut dressing was rich. The Penang kway teow was flavorful, but could probably do with a little more accoutrements like lup cheong. Overall, the food was great, and the staff attentive. I would recommend this place. On a Sunday morning, they had many takeaway orders, so, you may want to consider coming a little earlier to avoid the crowd. And btw, they don’t charge for service nor gst.",

Taste wise, only the sauce from the lemon chicken  tasted the same. The rest of it brought back no nostalgic memories.\n\nNow, food wise, it was decent. Tastes good. Nothing spectacular or mindblowingly good. It was just decent. There were no memorable dishes of the night.\n\nNext, the price is exorbitantly high for the portions. The \"large\" yam ring, at $42, is even smaller than outside tze char regular sized ones. The hae cho prawn rolls costs $20.\n\nFrankly, I was a little shocked at the price point.",
