AVT sisters,1,"Not the first time I came to this clinic, but it's always the same. No matter how early you are, Doctor will always be late when clinic has already open. Consultation always is so fast too. Nowadays hard to find real Doctors who care for patient. Honestly the surrounding clinics are the same too, therefore it's more of coming to see Doctor jus to take medicines.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100985218376880959916/reviews
Charity Eshia,1,"Queued up early at 5.40pm before clinic opened so I can be attended to first. Clinic opens at 6pm. Everybody has been sitting and waiting for 40mins and the doctor is not in yet!! When asked the counter, they just say “doctor is on the way, not sure what time”. Not even apologetic for wasting many people’s time. I purposely came early so I can make my dinner appointment at 6.30pm

Terrible service. It’s better to go to Minmed at Wisteria. I will never come back to Royal Care Clinic anymore even though it’s a few steps closer from home.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106326258699033695308/reviews

Jonathan Joel Sng,1,"called the clinic which was ""open"" but couldn't get a queue number. went down to the clinic to o get a number but doctor wasn't even there! waited for 30mins and doctor hasn't arrive. what's the point of opening when the doctor is not around? clinic attendant was also not apologetic or even helpful when i asked when the doctor is coming ..",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116594006551862215359/reviews
