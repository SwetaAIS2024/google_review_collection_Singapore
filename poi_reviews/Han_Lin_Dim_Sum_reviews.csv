CK C,3,"Auntie was very lovely. Unfortunately, the peng kueh and soon kueh were rather unpalatable. E-payment available.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114345555265183607362/reviews
C Irene,5,"Chai Poh on Chwee Kueh (4 for $1.60) is generous with good chilli. Chwee Kueh is slightly harder (old school) which I like (due to less water in the dough) giving it more substance.
Chee Cheong Fun has enough sauce and by the time I unpack it to eat, Chee Cheong Fun is well soaked in sauce making it flavourful.
Big Pao at $1.60 comes with quail egg üëç, instead of the usual chicken egg bits.
