DNA K,5,"SD$28 for large suitcase and $26 for small (i think) they took our luggage from the port to the airport, same day delivery. We had a great time looking around Singapore on our last day without worries and luggage free! They arrived on time, all luggage on a trolley,  they send and email throughout the service and WhatsApp communication as well. What a great service! Highly recommend ðŸ‘Œ",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109484911534118944854/reviews
