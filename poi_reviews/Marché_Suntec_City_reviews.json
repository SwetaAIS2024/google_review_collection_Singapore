I had to keep going back to the station to check if the drink and food are ready as it is really taking too long. The resturant is understaff as our table is full of finished dishes and piling up but no one came to clear it and there hardly any space for us. However the food especially the crepe wrap is very nice. Love there variety of food to choose from but will be better if there are pictures to show what do the dishes looks.",

      "text": "Aircon, mall. Comfortable and fancy looking, but definitely quality has dropped drastically. 1 star because food is the main, and is severely bad. Ordered beef steak. Took a long time before my order was called. My first bite was the beef is not even remotely warm. As if they had it done long ago, and forgot to inform. The meat is cooked to medium which is what I asked for. However the cut is poor and 1/4 of the entire steak is unchewable fats and nerves. If I had to swallow those, I choke. Mashed potato is dry and stiff, and inedible without the sauce. At this point, the 4 cherry tomatoes are tastiest on the plate. Never again am I going to Marche, not for this price, not for my calories. I would even think twice paying $12.90 rather than the actual $32.90 for this crap. If not for my proteins requirements for the day, I would not even finish the beef steak. Terrible",
