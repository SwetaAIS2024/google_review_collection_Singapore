LP Pua,5,"The ice lemon tea is prepared with lemon juice (maybe syrup), cold tea, ice and 2 slices of lemon. Overall, a very good cup of ice lemon tea.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Cheng Xiang Yuan,3,"Granted the food is good, but the stall owners attitude needs to improve.

Both the owners are not so old, but I'm shocked that they don't even have decent courtesy to treat their customers nicely.

Would suggest not to order just because the queue is long, there are probably other coffee stalls that are better in this market. Else, get ready for your mornings to be ruined.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104041411295472063050/reviews
