Decent toast.\nTheir breakfast set @ $5.70 comes with Large kopi/teh, 4 toast, and 2 eggs, which I think could be too much for a person to consume in the morning.\n\nThis morning, the kopi/egg guy was working hard to clear the orders, which was nonstop for at least 30min while I was sipping away my large kopi.\nHe was doing his best, the roadblocks is where  there is an egg order, so that will slow him down from his kopi/teh momentum.\n\nAs he needs to make kopi, pack and serve, that slows down the service (or maybe that's how they wanted to pace the order, to avoid queue# piling up)\n\nPlus a lot of diner kept standing at the drinks counter, thus causing the queue to standstill, instead of waiting aside since we all have our numbers.\n\nBecause of that, those rushing for takeaway will felt that the queue doesn't move.\n\nNo issue with toast orders, it was fast and prompt.",
