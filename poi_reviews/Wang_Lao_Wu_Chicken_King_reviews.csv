Steveo 88,4,"Not my favorite, but definitely my go-to chicken rice spot in this neighborhood. It's a no-frills, above-average plate of chicken rice—good enough to bring your foreign friends for a taste our Singapore Chicken Rice standard. Be prepared for a regular stream of customers and a bit of a wait.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103809758512388590124/reviews
Caden Wan,1,"ATTENTION. AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!

Scamer.
We order half chicken which appear to be a portion for 2. Confronted them but they insist it’s half chicken.

Chicken is very normal. If you have a choice try the opposite side roast duck which is much better.

All in all. Order if you are desperate.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110684189014888444327/reviews

Bear Teo,4,"Their chicken rice and the soups are quite nice. Service ok. They have a variety of soups, tried a few such as watercress, old cucumber, lotus roots, all quite flavourful. Noodles are usually sold out by dinner time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117235546024454663649/reviews
Jay Wong,3,"Only the soup is good. Ordered roast chicken rice set. The chicken rice is super below average. Not sure if I'm unlucky or what. One of the worst chicken rice. Rice is dry and hard. Chicken is tasteless, vegetables are  over steamed.

You have been warned.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115778576071343654104/reviews
