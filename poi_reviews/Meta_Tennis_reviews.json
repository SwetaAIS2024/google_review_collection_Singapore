Coach Anthony is super patient and encouraging - he breaks down the basics in a way that’s easy to understand, which really helped me build a good foundation.\n\nOver time, I’ve improved my basic tennis skills like my swing, footwork and overall coordination. The sessions are well-paced and I always leave feeling like I’ve learned something new.\n\nBooking is also super convenient and fuss-free, which makes it easy to stay consistent. Highly recommend Meta Tennis to anyone looking to pick up tennis in a fun and supportive environment!",
