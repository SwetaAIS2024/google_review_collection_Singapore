Yvonne Poon,5,"Cute place in Chinatown on the Blue and Purple MRT lines. Deluxe King room could fit 2 open large suitcases (and open our carry on - if we weren't using the doorway). Room was quiet despite the doors/doorways not being soundproof and the nearby shopping centre's giant advertising screen. Air conditioning only stays on if you leave a room card in the room - so be prepared for a hot room when you get back from sightseeing. Chinatown Point shopping centre across the road has all you need including 7/11, Supermarket, Daiso, many restaurants and the nearby Hong Lim hawker food centre (2 levels). Laundry worked well - need to drop in before / around 8am to get it the next day. Service was great, except once they knocked on our door whilst we had Do Not Disturb on to return the washing. 2 USB ports and 3 AC ports (table and bedsides). Showering wets the bathroom area (common in this region) but dries really quickly. Provided: shower cap, slippers, safe, toothbrush/paste, 2 small water bottles. No wardrobe but 2 wall hooks and 5 hangers (no clips) worked fine.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109168521982080844515/reviews

Neve Corbett,4,"Room is basic but very clean and tidy, has everything you need. Large comfortable bed, spot to hang clothes, kettle with tea/coffee, a desk area, clean bathroom, and great location. Staff are very friendly. Definitely would stay again.
Walls can be a bit thin but I had no issues with noise beyond usual city noise.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108021766623475035930/reviews
Michael's World,5,"Stayed here for 4 nights, and I loved it. The only downfall about the room was the air-conditioning was facing my bed. Otherwise, I couldn't have asked for a better hotel. The staff were friendly,and the rooms were recently updated. My kids loved the candies at the front desk. It made everyday special for them. Also, even though my room faced conner of a main intersection, I couldn't really hear the traffic.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112416865131247914629/reviews
Zak D,1,The hotel room size was  very small. The bed was too soft and not comfortable at all. This hotel needs a 3 star rating. It was also very noisy at night. Location was great as we were able to walk to Chinatown.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109004560531061511471/reviews
