Sushiliah Devi,5,"The coffee shop below Blk 59 sells sumptuous food. Although it’s noisy, the food is prepared hot and served. Price is reasonable. It’s a bit noisy because it is crowded with people.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109788552494394660918/reviews

Do check out also, the Hokkien mee which uncle has been whipping up for years with all the right flavours that hits the spot.

Don't miss out on the spicy sambal too!

There are 2 coffeeshops at Blk 69, one on each end. This is nearer to Hao Mart.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103612292163029585536/reviews
Desiree Rachel Lee,5,"My usual place for zi char, the zi char stall's fish head curry is cheap and taste good. Creamy and good to eat with rice and bread. The price of the fish head curry is 18-22 depending on the size of the fish head. The size of dishes are big enough for my family of 5. It will get crowded during the dinner peak hours so be there early or the wait will be around 30mins. I have seen other diners have the fish steamboat too although I have yet to try it myself. Recommend this for simple zi char dinner with family and friends. Price is reasonable. My usual dinner selections consists of fried omelette, spare ribs and hotplaye tofu. Total damage is 28.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100107371846495622563/reviews
Kavisara Tiranasar,5,I rak Thai food is beyond my expectations. It's very cheap but tasty and good quality ingredients also. We order 4dishes for $19 only. Tomyam seafood is a must,4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106780079950491594300/reviews
BeholdHim,3,"The Ding Gua Gua pork chop fried rice $6.8 is mediocre. The other main player’s offering is more palatable. I find the food rather bland but good for those who prefer low salt. The pork chop is somewhat chewy. Even the fried dumpling ($4 for 8 pcs) is more wanton size rather than dumpling size.

Here has other food stalls including lor Mee, Korean army beef stew etc. will try the army stew next time. Hope it doesn’t disappoint.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107790882829972143902/reviews
