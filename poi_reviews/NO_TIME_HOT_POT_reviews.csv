NomNomFables,5,"Love the concept, hotpot in a cup that‚Äôs perfect for takeaway. Ordering is super fuss-free with the QR code and prices start from just $7.80. The collagen broth is rich and comforting and you can customise your bowl with your favourite ingredients. Mala lovers will enjoy being able to adjust the spice level too! Noodles and rice are packed separately so they won‚Äôt turn soggy. Don‚Äôt miss the fried sides, crispy and so good when dipped into the Mala broth. Great option for a quick, satisfying meal!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116604684195918553212/reviews
Woan Ying Ong,5,"Such a cool concept!
No Time Hot Pot is perfect for busy days when you still crave something hearty and satisfying.
Love that we can customise our cup ‚Äî from choosing the broth (Mala, Tomato, or Collagen) to picking from 22 ingredients, including vegan options!

The smart packaging keeps everything fresh ‚Äî noodles stay springy, and the fried items stay crispy.
Plus, dipping the fried food into the broth for extra flavour is genius!

Quick, tasty, and convenient. Definitely coming back for more",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110403084670896424687/reviews
luto ni kuya levi,5,"If you‚Äôre looking for a next-level hot pot experience, No Time Hot Pot is an absolute must-visit. From the moment you walk in, the aroma of rich broths and fresh ingredients hits you. Their signature broths ‚Äî whether the spicy Sichuan or the nourishing herbal ‚Äî are layered with flavor and depth.

The ingredient selection is outstanding: incredibly fresh seafood, perfectly marbled beef slices, tender lamb, and a wide array of vibrant vegetables. Each bite feels luxurious, thanks to the careful sourcing and preparation. Highly recommend ‚ù§Ô∏è",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103699968630757743225/reviews
Pat,5,"My first time trying as grab had 20% for pick-up orders and I absolutely enjoyed it! I ordered less spicy mala dry but it was still quite spicy for me but at the same time still shiok hahaha. I also topped up fried potato slices which was fragrant and nice. I want to comment on their thoughtful packing of all the ingredients,separating dry from wet, e.g. beancurd roll separate from other wetter ingredients so that it wouldn't be soggy and noodles separated from the ingredients also. greatly appreciate this awesome food and service. Will be back next time to try the collagen soup or tomato soup. Can't wait üòª",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116612441308980864130/reviews
Audrey Tan,5,"I am impressed with this whole concept of no time hotpot. Broths are so flavourful. My daughter had the tomato version and is all praise for it as it is as good as the hotpot restaurant we always frequent plus this is really friendly to the wallet. The dry mala is also so so so delicious as the QQ noodles absorb the spice and flavors beautifully, creating that perfect balance of heat and taste.  Fried foods remain crispy as they are packed separately. Will definitely go back for more soon! And prices start from only $9.80. Oh yes, please go early for their super popular cold Pidan Tofu. Must try!!!",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102924098630705971213/reviews
