H Mir,5,"Excellent restaurant and very efficient, thoughtful service! We ate here on our last day in Singapore on our honeymoon. I had the spicy chicken burger, an oatmilk hazelnut iced latte, and the sticky date pudding. Our server Wayne was very accommodating and helpful. He made good suggestions for us and was clear about adjustments we could make even if it wasnâ€™t listed on the menu. The lattes here are so good (frothy), the best Iâ€™ve had in Singapore and the sticky data pudding is a must try! Warm with delicious vanilla ice cream, and the strawberries are so yum. Hotel guests get a 15% discount so make sure you take advantage of this if you are staying at the Oasia. We didnâ€™t know about that until Wayne told us.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114043854777191893990/reviews

Mico Lim,5,"Enjoy the food quality and cosy atmosphere! Service is attentive especially from Salma. She helped to check my membership vouchers for discounts, take group pictures upon our request and even observant enough to fulfill our needs.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106708729029806069053/reviews
Red Fox,5,"We must compliment Shu Hui as she is really attentive and friendly. This is our first time visiting The Marmalade Pantry @ TP. Great atmosphere as we enjoyed a peaceful evening here.

Shu Hui is very accommodating and we do not need to raise our hands to ask for what we need. She approaches us at the right timing without barging in. She is not aggressive like other service staff who may makes you feeling too much and interrupted our conversation.

(Some checking on our dining experience incessantly and pull out a QR code at the end just to fish for Google compliment is a bit of a turn off, as you realised the courtesy were all pretentious.)

For Shu Hui, she is different and excellent. Thank you so much.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116261123709223030117/reviews
