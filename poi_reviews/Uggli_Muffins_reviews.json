The muffin is flavorable and not too sweet. Bought various flavours to try out. All their flavours are pretty delicious and fluffy. Worth to come back again if nearby.",

Queue moves fast because he's getting people to keep it moving so others aren't left waiting.",

      "text": "4 May 25: Incredibly fresh and delicious muffins - literally straight out of the oven! Each muffin ($1.70) has a perfectly crispy top, the size is just right - not too big, not too small. Was there on a Sunday and there's a short queue and a bit of a wait as the muffins are baked fresh, but good things are worth waiting for! The stall owner is friendly and even offers one whole muffin as sample so you can try before you buy. Iâ€™ve tried the chocolate, Oreo, walnut, and cinnamon & raisin - every single flavour was absolutely amazing.",

      "text": "Not a muffin person but this stall truly amazed me. I arrived honestly telling the owner that im first time here, i dont know how to order and what to order. Owner kindly gave me a muffin in my hand to try, fresh from oven! Owh it tasted A-Ma-Zing! I ended up buying the chocolate, the ferrero roche, the cranberry, the orange and the raisin.\nThe chocolate and ferero are on the sweet side, but the crunch of the muffin top is to die for, i dont regret the calories ðŸ˜‚\nThe cranberry is my personal favourite, bcos of the crunchy cranberry bits and the sour balanced off the sweet perfectly.\nThe raisin is also the not too sweet type, suitable for old age or people like me who doesnt like sweet stuff.\nOrange smells good, light and simple straight forward. Good with coffee.\nOfficially the best muffin in my life!\n\nNote: if u r NOT buying a dozen, recommend to bring tupperware, otherwise the muffin is pack in plastic bags which the heat will create steam that will cause the muffin to be soft instead of crunchy.\n\nNote 2: highly recommended to buy a dozen, you wont regret! ðŸ˜›",
