jacqueline chiang,5,"Am here the first time, impressed by the stall staff Ajib, always puts on a smile, Plesant, Friendly when he serves, v kind too, helped change my white rice to nasi lemak without additional cost; he also asked if I need soup, is definitely a wow service here 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I give 10 thumbs up to this Ayam Penyet stall for the delicious Bakar Ayam with fresh veggie n cherry tomatoe & soup, at reasonable price of S$5.50 for a big chicken 🍗 drum stick.
The sambal is not too hot, the sauce for chicken is not salty (excellent 😃).

For atmosphere, I give 4 stars because the electricity frequently trip, make the ambient little warm; however here many seats, floor is cleaned n people here also friendly; feels like at home in kampong 😃❤️",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101714256729653827991/reviews
