      "text": "Upper Cross Street Exchange (formerly China Square Central) is my go-to spot for quick errands or a relaxed break in Singapore’s CBD. The blend of modern shops and preserved Chinese architectural details gives it a unique charm – a refreshing contrast to the glass towers nearby.\n\nWhat I love:\n- % Arabica fuels my mornings with reliably excellent coffee (open early on weekdays!).\n- Folks Collective is perfect for picking up quirky gifts or home decor – their curation feels thoughtful.\n- Affordable parking ($3 flat rate after 6 PM!) makes evening visits stress-free.\n- The customer lounge (B1) is a lifesaver for directions or parking help.\n\nFood & Vibe:\nCHAGEE’s bubble tea hits the spot, and the open layout avoids the cramped feel of bigger malls. It’s not a food paradise, but 7-Eleven snacks or a coffee break work well between meetings.\n\nPro tips:\nVisit weekday afternoons – quieter and easier to explore.\nPair your trip with nearby murals or Sri Mariamman Temple for a cultural pit-stop.\n\nDownside: Smaller than mega-malls, so don’t expect endless shopping.\n\nPerfect for: Office workers needing a quick caffeine fix, tourists exploring Chinatown/Telok Ayer, or anyone seeking a laid-back CBD stop with character.",

Lots of vintage stuff antiques knick knacks toys whimsical stuff that will bring a smile on your face. Most stalls began setting up around 10 am and packs up around 4 pm. There's great food too from coffee to noodles to freshly made pizzas. I will post more pics in the future but usually ended up busy shopping.",

The welcoming service did not prompt me to think otherwise. He recommended 2 signatures meals. The photos posted were the recommended one on my table.  On the delicacy. I gave a 5 stars, the salmon, the egg, the side dish and the miso are excellent. On the ambient. I alluded myself on the corner table and it is comfortable too. I think I had a good meal today. Worth trying indeed.",
