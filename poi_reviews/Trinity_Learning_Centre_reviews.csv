Timothy,5,"Mr Low is a kind and understanding teacher. He teaches us how to do difficult questions and helps us when we do not know how to do them. He gives us small tests every week to help us improve. He not only teaches us how to deal with the questions in the exam, but also how to manage our time well in the exam. -TIMOTHY",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103942570086586283057/reviews
