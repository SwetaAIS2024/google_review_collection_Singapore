      "text": "I ordered on Grab at 20:33. Left instruction for driver (Dominoes do not use Grab drivers, they use their own fleet) to text/call when he was outside, so we could meet them, as we were in a hotel. Got a WhatsApp from the store at 21:04 the driver was on the way. Got no correspondence from the driver AT ALL, wrote to the store WhatsApp multiple times to receive very little communication back. Also called the number attached to Google about 10 times which just kept saying “call failed”. At 21:52, I eventually received a response from the store, a photo of our food hanging on the outside door of the hotel. The driver just left it there and never told me!! It was only barely warm, so must have been there at least 30 minutes if not more. Driver should hand the food to the person who ordered, not leave food hanging on a door in the street and not even tell the person that it is there!! Food was tasty but almost cold so not as nice as it could have been.",
