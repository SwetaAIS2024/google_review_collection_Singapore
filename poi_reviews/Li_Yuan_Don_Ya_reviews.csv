Lee Chengjie,5,Had the pork cutlet curry don for breakfast. Cutlet was fried to order with perfect ratio of crunchy breading to tender pork. Curry serving was generous and none of that watered-down glop you tend to find in other coffee shop Japanese stalls. A gem of an accidental find as I had intended to eat at the sister mee pok stall.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106053612843631985054/reviews
