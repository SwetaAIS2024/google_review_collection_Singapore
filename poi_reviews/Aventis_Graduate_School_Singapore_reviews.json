Huge thanks to Joel and Nat ‚Äî both of them helped me on different occasions and made the whole process super smooth and easy.\n\nThe lecturer was fantastic ‚Äî explained everything clearly and made the sessions really engaging. The campus environment was great too, very comfortable and professional, and even the food and vibes during the breaks were spot on!\n\nI left the course feeling way more confident in making investment decisions. Already looking forward to signing up for their Negotiation course next. Big thanks to the Government subsidies for making it affordable ‚Äî and even bigger thanks to Aventis for making it possible. Highly recommend!\n\nTheir TikTok videos made me laugh. So natural ü§£",
