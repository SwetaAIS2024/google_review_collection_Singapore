"Yong Hui, Ronny Tan",4,"+ The stall seems to also own the entire coffeeshop previously.

+ Located in quiet hidden corner of the estate. Less hot and expensive compared to the other nearby coffeeshop at 209B Clementi Ave 6.

+ Ample sheltered MSCP parking next door.

- Few other stall options in this coffeeshop if your companions want to try something else.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112103854866816776797/reviews
