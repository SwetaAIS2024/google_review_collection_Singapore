Josephina,5,"Extremely excellent experience at this clinic! Even though there was a bit of a queue, the service was incredibly efficient and fast. The staff was friendly, and everything seemed to run smoothly. But the highlight of my visit was definitely the doctor. He was very sweet, gentle, and made me feel comfortable. It’s rare to find a doctor who genuinely cares and takes the time to explain everything in such a kind and calm manner. Thank you for such a positive experience!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110441621199896334892/reviews
Jianchao Ang,5,"I have just visited this clinic at Towner the first time on a Friday afternoon and was apprehensive at the review ratings. However, my experience is better than the averaged rating. I visited slightly after 2pm and left before 2.30pm; meaning my registration, doctor consult and medicine collection was all done in less than half an hour. Doctor and receptionist staffs are friendly and professional.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101162755043457684391/reviews
Desmond Chong,5,"Before coming to Healthway, I already visited a couple of clinics nearby but the medicines were not good. Dr Tan manage to diagnose me accurately and gave me medicines which were very effective for me. He manages to put a smile to all the patient that sees him.

Nadia Jamaludin,5,"I can see why this place got so many good reviews. I want to tell about my visit to Healthway. I went here after another clinic turned me away cause they mess up my blood test. Even though there was a lot of people, I didn’t have to wait long. Dr Tan took my blood in one try and it didn’t hurt at all. He is very kind and nice, and I can feel he really care for me. I will come here for me and my family from now on.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105044072982729740934/reviews
