Came down for breakfast. Was queuing in another cafe but saw the pricing, got a shock. Then I saw this cafe. Visited the chain at Eco world area.

Ordered a simple egg muffin breakfast with a cup of tea. Taste ok, no surprise.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104234572596322175340/reviews

Came back here again last week but we didn’t order food , as we have appointment. I ordered Teh C kosong and it’s reallyyyyy good.

Honestly I m looking forward to have the food again when I know I have an appointment. Boss, if you see the review, I truly thank you so much for preparing nice food. We always have a good time in your place ❤️

The food is a very delicious, and must try scrambled eggs. OMG I have never thought I had the best scrambled eggs in town !! We even ordered second time.

Boss is very nice and being patient when I request some changes on the food for my father. I always come to here when I visit Gleneagle Hospital, will keep coming back again  in the future 💪🏻💪🏻",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108471899630319219984/reviews
