Edward Wong,3,"Paid $13.80 for a medium-rare sirloin steak with 2 sides (takeaway). The beef steak was thick but size seemed small. Taste was ok but the black pepper sauce was too mild, more like mushroom sauce. Fries were average. Service staff did not sound welcoming üòê",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110173188680901424865/reviews
k,1,"Food
- Ordered spicy cheese chicken cutlet, the chicken skin somehow is dark brown coloured, lots of cheese given but the mashed potato and mac and cheese are tasteless, better leave it untouched. The chicken was not bad but the skin smells burnt and dry.
Portion wise still acceptable as it is not cheap.

Service
-Terrible service from counter, speak angrily to customer when his pronounciation is not clear. Besides, counter service person looks pissed when he is the one in the wrong. Worst experience ever. If not willing to work, please dont work. Totally banning this restaurant.

Atmosphere
-clean and bright hawker center, nothing special.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117883623491706339742/reviews
Angelin,5,Huge chicken parmigiana for $9.50! But I really enjoyed the pork chop with black pepper sauce. The pork was so soft and well-seasoned. Very very filling portion,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105417076759937799330/reviews

Jeff Wang,5,"Much better than Chargrill. I am glad for the change.

Ps: went back for nz steak a few times. The consistency of food quality is there.

Ps2: went again for promotion NZ steak. Grew to like the onion rings.

Those who gym nearby this is the place for your protein ( and cheat days).

Last pics from visit today, I decide to flip the streak over. You can see Both Sides Now like Joni Mitchell.

* went back but changed the 2 toppings. The potato croquette is damn nice.

Consider the steak has been consistently good, and attractive price offered during time of high inflation, i up the stars to 5.

I ordered different sides, I recommend potato croquettes.

They are paylah fav partner. So get your further cashback.

10 dec 23 - went again. Today the serloin is tough though, not the usual quality. Lets observe who the chef is.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118053916504088534479/reviews
