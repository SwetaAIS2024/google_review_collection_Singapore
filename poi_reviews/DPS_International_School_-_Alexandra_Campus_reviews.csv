Charu Shankar,5,"As a proud parent, I'm delighted to share my exceptional experience with DPS International School Singapore. The school has successfully struck a balance between affordability and quality education, making it an excellent value proposition.

The institution's commitment to modern teaching methods is evident in its incorporation of cutting-edge technology and innovative teaching aids. This has significantly enhanced my child's learning experience.

Beyond academics, the school offers a diverse range of Extra-Curricular Activities (ECAs), catering to various interests and talents. This has helped my child develop important life skills, such as teamwork, leadership, and time management.

I'm particularly impressed with the school's 'no gadget policy' for students. In today's digital age, this is a refreshing and responsible approach that promotes healthy habits and minimizes distractions.

Lastly, the teachers at DPS International School Singapore are not only well-trained and qualified but also passionate about their work. Their dedication to nurturing young minds is evident in the supportive and inclusive learning environment they create.

Overall, I'm grateful to have found a school that shares my values and priorities. I highly recommend DPS International School Singapore to parents seeking a holistic education for their children.""",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118383552666012022297/reviews
