T Tan,5,"Top notch Mutton Briyani $6.50 is a must and worth a drive from any part of Singapore.

Shopfront looks unassuming but the taste is super.

Available from 11am Mon-Fri only.

Tasty wet style rice even without adding on the gravy. But yet it's just very slightly oily only. Very balanced 5/5

Very flavourful and tender mutton ribs 5/5. Surprised at the excellent quality and generous portion!

Friendly and cheerful Indian couple running the show...

Hygienic no flies 5/5. Good quality non greasy cutlery with no sharp edges.

Ample outdoor parking directly infront of the stall. Slightly remote but pleasant breezy location on a hilltop in Mandai. Just follow Google maps...

So tasty I have to come again next week! Better than all the famous stalls in Singapore, JB and Batu Pahat Johore....",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105342097727930447553/reviews
Mahadevan Krishnan,5,"Classic and delicious dum briyani , had it with my staff and colleagues and they all enjoyed it fully as well.
Very tasty, perfectly cooked tasty meat, adequate quantity and appropriate dhalicha curry and cucumber side dishes to add value to the briyani.
Usually briyani shop you would see more Indians buying, but here more funnest queueing up, which shows the food is not much oily and spicy and just nice for all.
