Aerin Camburn,5,"Eureka School house is the first school our daughter attended in Singapore. Our daughter was diagnosed with ASD, the teachers and principal doesn’t even bat an eyelid during the intake, she also had just recently became verbal when she joined. She’d come home humming Chinese song which is surprising to us, considering it is a new language to her.

We have since transferred to another preschool due moving. The teacher in her new preschool commented on how our child is able to read certain Chinese characters and check with us did she attend any external enrichment class, which we didn’t.

There are so many times, we debated whether to enrol her back to Eureka, due to her behaviour issues in her new school, she’d have meltdown and unable to join the class which was unheard of in Eureka.

Eureka school teachers also would provide a short verbal update every time when certain issue occurs so we can quickly rectify that at home which is something lacking with her new school.

My daughter still speak fondly of Eureka school house on a monthly basis, at times even choose to wear the uniform at home.

Update: Feb 2025
Since we dropped the review, Eureka’s principal got into contact with us to check in with my daughter. We went over for a visit to catch up.

Principal Jessie offered a placement for my daughter in the K2 class and offered solution (school bus) to our logistic problem.

My daughter is now back at Eureka.
Her behaviour at home has improved tremendously. She is also very fond of the bus driver Uncle Patrick and would tell us how he always go through traffic rules with them and verbally giving the kids a tour of our neighbourhood.

We get constant personal updates from teachers, timely class dojo updates. My daughter is actually now afraid of missing school because she wants to learn so bad!!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108963050418888433300/reviews
Paulina Oh,5,"We started our first child at Eureka about 3 years ago, and even though he's no longer at that school, he still talks about it fondly. From the teachers, to the friends, and even the toys. It's small but that's what makes it personal and makes it feel like a family. Now my younger one goes there too, and happily walks in to school everyday. I'm also very impressed with the curriculum as it seems more advanced than the current one my elder son is in. Even though there seems to be some turnover in the teachers (I'm sure that's the case for most childcare centres) the transition has been smooth and there is no impact on the kids. I can tell the teachers really do care about the children, which is the most important for a parent. Thank you teacher Jessie and all the teachers for setting a good foundation for their future learning!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108641161616189841423/reviews
Tarun Vohra,5,"We really like Eureka and would recommend anyone looking for a safe and homely environment for their kid in their formidable years.
The teachers and staff are very friendly but imbibe discipline and focus on academics as well. The kids are groomed well and are prepared for primary schooling.
One area of improvement could be a more well rounded meals program for kids.

Overall, a big thumps up to this school and the management.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102409016170605485669/reviews
Saamiya S,5,"Eureka Schoolhouse provides a homely and caring environment for kids. As a working mom, I feel at peace knowing my two kids are in the company of very caring and passionate teachers who are setting right foundations for academic learning and life skills.
I am impressed with the concepts my 5 year old has learnt in last 2 years. Recently my 20 month old also started attending Eureka Schoolhouse. Within a couple of weeks he has become comfortable and loves going to school, thanks to the very loving staff!",12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113300980954327093615/reviews
Daryl Yap,5,"Transferred our daughter from Kids Campus to Eureka as the teachers there did not take good care of her, resulting in her having bad diaper rash and crying everyday when we picked her from Kids Campus for more than a month.

Things are completely different at Eureka. The principal and teachers are very caring and take pride in ensuring that all kids are well taken care of. Having been with the school for more than a year, our daughter still cries occasionally when parting with us in the morning (due to separation anxiety), but she leaves school a happy girl everyday and sometimes even reluctant to go home as she was too comfortable doing activities such as colouring with her friends! This shows that the teachers have done a fantastic job in grooming her. Thank you very much to all teachers in Eureka for your hard work!

Although the price can be a little steep compared to those govt childcare, I believe it is totally worth it if you can afford it. The experiences that your kid will receive at Eureka are priceless. Some might complain that this school does not have air-conditioner, it can be a blessing in disguise as the kids tend to fall sick less regularly there. Trust me, you will not regret choosing Eureka.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114223231654731483567/reviews
