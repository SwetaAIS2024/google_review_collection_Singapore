Flo Yeow,5,"Was super surprised to finding an art gallery here near the port, in the midst of all the industrial set up. But I'd dare say that Gajah has done a very good job in making the best use of the space. Many good south east asian artists that they represent, and many good people that they have in managing the events. Had a super good chat with Rachel the evening that I was there, and definitely loved the artworks that she was walking me through.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews

larry yeo,5,"It is a good spread of art work around and love how it embraces regional asian artists.

For those who give this gallery a low score should remember that this is an art gallery. Not a third tier museum. (As to the below person Sara Y said)
Things move and artwork get sold. sculptures don’t stay there for you to frolick with",5 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100687633005112991727/reviews
