Vineesh Kandy,1,"Extremely disappointed with the rude staff at this outlet.
Went to collect my online order and asked the counter staff about collection counter. All he could do was to shout the word ‚ÄúWAIT‚Äù rudely at me.
I was made to wait for 15 minutes to let the 2 clueless groups to discuss and decide on their food and make payment.
When it was my turn at the counter, all he wanted was my name and few seconds to bag the pizzas kept on a shelf behind him.
I chose the pizzas I wanted and made payment online to get the food without having to queue up long and yet this is the experience.
I‚Äôm not getting any more pizzas from Le Quest. This outlet and the staff really suck big time.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110847298921491756312/reviews
Nura Omar,5,"Whenever I ordered PizzaHut it will always comes from this outlet. Pizza always arrive hot. Pizza dough is very soft to my liking. Delivery always on time, but there's 1 time when my order got delayed due to peak period (I think it was on National Day) store manager has the courtesy to inform me that my orders will arrive slighty late. Kudos to all staff in this outlet! Keep up your good work!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102080076724153526579/reviews

Duck Duck,1,Rude staff cutting pizza and throwing pans loudly to express her unhappiness in working in this restaurant. My takeaway order was delayed by several minutes. Having to wait there and listen to the loud noises of pans clashing and banging is just unbearable,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104352100482208522564/reviews
SG Lee,4,"The food is nice and staff is also polite. Just that they often mess up my order, as in that when I order through the Pizza Hut App, Hawaiian Supreme, they give me a beef pizza or something which is not what I ordered. And another incident was that I ordered a pizza, but I cancelled off the beef from the Pizza Hut App, but when it came, there were still beef inside the pizza and had to go back to the store to change, disappointed with how careless they are. Other than that, no more problems.
The nugget is like this‚Ä¶.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105383580714233931233/reviews
