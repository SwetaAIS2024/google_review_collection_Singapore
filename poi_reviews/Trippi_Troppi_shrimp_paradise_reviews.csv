Wee Shao Yang Hayden (Temasekjc),5,"the lava shrimp is tasty as hell!
i saw a guy called mamacita ringing a bell.
He was loudly reading poetry, and he said:
""the snacks are so crispy
so decadent and juicy,
and yet its so spicy,
its akin to a lava attack.""",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108925042575356152914/reviews
Tivon Roy,5,"Shrimp is good food. Very bouncy very decadent. Very elegant very beautiful. Very sweet. They have shrimps of all kinds. They have prawns and lobsters. They have many types of crabs and langoustines. The types of species they serve are endless. If you're looking for a good seafood, lunch, dinner or breakfast, come to tripi tropi shrimp paradise",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100192063308787149484/reviews
