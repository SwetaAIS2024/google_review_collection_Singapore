Rochelle (OchieBon),5,"Tried the new Texas Seoul Chicken at Texas Chicken Century Square and WOW—crispy, juicy, and that sweet-spicy Korean glaze is seriously addictive!
Perfectly paired it with their cheesy fries—creamy, golden, and the ultimate comfort snack.
If you’re craving a flavour bomb, this one’s a must-try! Special thanks to Elen she was super nice and attentive to our needs. You can see that she loves her work so much.

vik k,1,"First time dining at texas chicken. Tried their Golden Cereal Popcorn chicken combo and was utterly disappointed. It was cold and stale. The chicken was so hard to bite, not crunchy at all. The biscuit was cold too. Only the mashed potato was hot. Popeyes was crowded so i gave texas a go... big mistake. Never dining here again lol.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106395206929079787447/reviews
Icey _,5,"Had a really good experience at Texas Chicken! The food was hot, crispy, and super tasty — exactly what I was craving. The biscuits were fresh and soft too.

Big shoutout to Meng Qing who was super helpful and friendly. They made sure my order was spot on and even gave some great recommendations. Really appreciated the extra effort and great service. Definitely coming back!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111661521893639508020/reviews
nicnicxun,2,"Service is terrible. Ordered 3 pieces came only with 2. Checked with the staff, given 1 with no apologies. Face blank and just drop the chicken. Youngsters are hired. Maybe difficult to get staff so just simply hire whoever want to work?",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105369917600002020050/reviews
jinyuan choo,2,"Ate here a few times already, the only thing that is consistently good is the biscuits.

Service staff on the other hand was not very good. The people at the counter always seems annoyed at something, the manager doesn't do anything about, or she doesn't care enough to. There was even one time she kept asking if i was rachel... i am a guy btw. It was also clearly a different order, but she didnt realise for some reason.

The chicken is usually ok, but today my partner and i experienced a foul smelling chicken. When presented to the manager, she just told us the chicken is fresh everyday instead of actually dealing with the problem, i.e. the foul smelling chicken at hand.

Also, the handwash area smells really bad for the longest time already.

Very disappointed",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105186769309432883430/reviews
