They mentioned nothing can be changed as the texture is determined by the supplier. Not recommended to order mee siam or any bee hoon related product.\n\nAtmosphere and decor was nice. Hopefully other menu item is not as bad. The bright side is that the price point is very low for airport.",

The queue at Heavenly Wang next door was too long so we came here not expecting too much... but the dry laksa goreng was great as was the nasi lemak with dry curry chicken. Usually the rice in the nasi lemak nowadays is not fragrant with coconut but this one was really good. Would definitely eat here again!",

Yet this spin off cafe is just plain bad.\n\nThe you tiao was cold and soggy (but you have deep fryers and warmers in the OVK side) and the mee siam was… a poor excuse for mee siam.\n\nOCK, just kill off Curry Times before it kills your off.",
