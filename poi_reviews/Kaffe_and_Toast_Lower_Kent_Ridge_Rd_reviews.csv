FFROSTYY,4,"Thai beef boat noodle deluxe is definitely the best choice. The kaya butter toast is just simply meh. It‚Äôs too thick, and not crispy at all. I can‚Äôt taste the buttery feeling too. Boat noodle on the other hand is a wee spicy as default, sharp sense through the nose and definitely flavorful soup. The beef is quite thick and I wonder why they don‚Äôt just cut them up a little bit more. Tendons are plentiful too. The portion is definitely feeling for the price point of 10.90 and you don‚Äôt need a drink cos the soup is all you need. Food preparation took less than 10 mins and today was surprisingly not so crowded during lunch time.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116438099716975631225/reviews
Yuwang Cai,4,"The taste is overall great, but the price is higher than expected. The same breakfast set costs ~$6 here but only half in UTown. Leksa Grilled Chicken tastes great and is sufficient for one adult man's dinner. Nothing special, it's a good place to eat some regular food.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106604561832474406151/reviews
G Y,5,"A frequent lunch place for those in the Kent Ridge area - there can be quite a queue during weekday lunch period!

The great thing about this outlet is that it offers brown rice (unlike other outlets which offer only white rice).

Not sure about other dishes, but for the beef deluxe that I normally order, you have to tell the cashier staff when placing your order that you do not want any chilli (if you don‚Äôt take spicy food). Else, it‚Äôs automatically added interestingly.

Staff are quite friendly - both the cashier and those serving at the take-away sections.

Great option overall!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111376056027123649376/reviews
SeungJun Kim,5,"Personally, this restaurant has one of the best (affordable) beef noodle soup near this area. Their Thai boat beef/chicken noodle soup is a bit of soya sauce base, and is just very rich and nice in flavour. I'll crave for their soup once every while, and in fact I have not tried other restaurants elsewhere that has this soup taste yet. Recommended!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100958975977925692266/reviews
Fadhilah Muhamad,5,"It's a must to have our meal here whenever we have NUH appointments.
We have tried most of the dishes. Super love the variation of noodles. They have all-time comfort local favourite like mee rebus, mee siam & laksa. All are flavoursome, and you wouldn't regret it. Everytime i had their mee rebus it reminisce my old day at my school canteen. The taste awesomely syiok! The next must try is their signature Beef boat noodle that come with wonderfully tender beef &  beefball, and compliment with the light & tasty broth.There's chili flakes  & fish sauce available to give additional kick to the taste!
Price range btw Sgd$5 plus to $10 plus. The huge portion is definitely worth the price!
Highly recommended!

The cafe is situated near MRT Station and NUH, so do expect it to be crowded during lunchtime/ peak hours:) But their service are fast thou üëç",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110625970072686667075/reviews
