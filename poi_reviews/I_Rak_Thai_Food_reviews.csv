Jacob TAN,4,"Update 1/9/2023
The coffeeshop has been renovated. I looks modern and clean
Ordered the prawn omelette today and or is so good. Crispy on the outside but nicely done on the inside with fresh crunchy prawns

Wonderful Thai food in a small coffeeshop at Block 69 Bedok South.
We had Thai fish cake, mango salad, chicken green curry, pork omelette,  pad Thai and moo ping. Food was delicious and the total cost was only $36.50 for 6 dishes.

Definitely can eat!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
EPT,4,"The food is nice. Tried many times. Fish cake, moo ping, spring roll, pandan chicken, tom yam, omelette, basil chicken, mixed veg, boat noodles, etc. price is reasonable similar to Nakon. However, the owner doesn’t recognize customers and is not friendly. They have recently relocated to a bigger stall after the coffee shop renovated.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110923826368280804306/reviews
Pearlynn,5,"Yummy Thai food in the neighbourhood.
Definitely value for money. Love the Thai Tom yum soup, has a lot of ingredients and gave a spicy kick. The appetiser was great too. Recommended to give it a try!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104832449412622253498/reviews

L Y,4,"Just discovered this and gave their Thai boat noodles a try. Stallholder was extremely friendly and offered to send noodles to my table.

I asked for less noodles and my bowl came with a lot of green veggies and bean sprouts (I like!). Thai food usually have a lot of MSG but I don’t have an MSG aftertaste unlike Nakhon and Nangfa. It maybe a tad less tasty but it’s definitely healthier. Best ever Thai boat noodles? Not really.

Will I be back again? Yes. To try the non-carbs dishes.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116804450051508415316/reviews
