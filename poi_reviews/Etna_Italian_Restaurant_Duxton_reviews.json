      "text": "We walked in around 745pm on Friday night. The vongole is a MUST ORDER. It was so good that we had a second order.\n\nThe 4 cheese pizza and truffle ham pizza were also very nice. Mushroom soup was gone in seconds.\n\nWhat is amazing is the hospitality. The Manager, Alessandro chatted with us and shared that almost everything in the restaurant is from Italy. From the flour to the sauces and also the chef! Chef Andre (hope I got the spelling right) even came by to say hi.\n\nAlessandro also gave us Italian Liqueur to try. It tasted nice, sweet almond taste.\n\nWill definitely come again!",

Especially enjoyed the Lamb Tagliatelle, and the salt crusted Mediterranean sea bass. Pizza was also on point. Topped off with a birthday ice cream!",

Can’t wait to come back!",

This might be common in some of the restaurants in the area but a bottle of water costs $8 so wish they indicated the price if it's not from the menu.",
