Granted it’s flavoured rice but still ….the server did apologise for running out of tartare sauce and substituted mayonnaise for it. Won’t be back unless all the Western food stalls nearby are closed.",

      "text": "Thought that the menu is rather extensive for a coffeeshop western food. Decided to give the salted egg chicken cutlet a try. I like that the cutlet is piping hot, but perhaps too much batter and the crust falls out too easily. The portion is rather generous and goes well with the salted egg sauce. The sides comes with fries, baked beans and coleslaw are pretty average. Overall it's good value but food can certainly improve. Perhaps better to just focus on a few good items instead of such an extensive menu.",
