      "text": "Nice to place dine-in before entering Singapore Science Centre! Pizza was awesome and freshly made though slightly soggy. Prices here are considered on the premium side, but as expected since this place is a tourist attraction. Service is decent but the restaurant itself is on the warmer side perhaps due to the hot weather today. Great pizza spot! üçï",

The manager helped honour the Tabsquare voucher I had even though he said actually it's a system glitch shouldn't apply to kids meal but he gave a goodwill anyway. Awesome! Feel valued as a customer",

The mushroom bacon pasta was good but can be more spicy. Spam fries were addictive and the pizzas were good too! We enjoyed our lunch here!",

Definitely come back here to try other dishes if i visit Science Centre in near future. üëçüèª",

      "text": "We got the calamari, beef bolognese, and fish & chips!\n\nCalamari was really good, crispy, hot, batter had decent spices and paired well with the dip.\n\nBeef bolognese was a creamy tomato sauce that was surprisingly delicious! However felt that portion size did not really match the price point. & location does not really justify the prices here.\n\nFish & chips! We upgraded $2 to get truffle fries, & we were disappointed to have received room temperature fries that weren‚Äôt crispy (tasted good tho!) Fish was overcooked as it completely flaked with a touch of the fork. Veggies were alright.\n\nOverall, a good hearty meal. Due to the prices that are not justified by portion nor location, we are unlikely to return. Thx for the meal!\n\nP.S. we didn‚Äôt get to try the pizza at all (it has a lot of good reviews) so that might be a reason to return :)",
