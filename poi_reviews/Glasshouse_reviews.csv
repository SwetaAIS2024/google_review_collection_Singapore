Angela Y,5,"Both the food and service were great. The batter of the deep fried baby octopus was light and crispy but the ratio of the batter to octopus was like 2:1.
We like the sourdough but a bit pricey, 2 pc of thin sourdough cost $7 and wasn‚Äôt served with butter, it was an item on the menu.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104638910393993915883/reviews
M N,5,"Build your own Bagel option allows you to mix and match your favourite brunch choices ‚ò∫Ô∏è

The Bagel was slightly crisp on the exterior and chewy on the inside, it was served warm and it melted and absorbed the butter perfectly. ü•Ø The french butter was so fragrant I could eat the whole bagel with butter alone. üßà

Eggs En Cocotte‚Äôs sauce was a tad bit salty, but it worked well with the plain bagel. üç≥

Their coffee is well brewed too, especially good for those who like it more on the acidic side. ‚òïÔ∏è

Staff are friendly, which always makes the experience so much better!",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110500952760610427966/reviews
Happy Fatty,3,"The space is beautifully designed ‚Äî modern, airy, and thoughtfully curated. It‚Äôs a lovely environment to sit in, and the presentation of the food was also visually appealing. You can tell there‚Äôs attention to aesthetics, both in the interior and the way dishes are served.

However, the food itself didn‚Äôt quite meet expectations. While the display was beautiful, the taste was average. The bagel, in particular, was a letdown ‚Äî lacking in texture and flavour. For a caf√© that puts so much effort into style, I had hoped the quality of the food would match.

Service was also a weak point. One female staff member was noticeably unfriendly and came across as disrespectful to certain customers, which made the experience uncomfortable. Other staff were more neutral, though they tended to gather and chat when not busy.

Overall, it‚Äôs a visually impressive caf√© with potential, but both the service and food need improvement to make it worth a return visit.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109258886875391584548/reviews
Shin L,5,"I was here 3 days ago for lunch. Ordered the Smoked Salmon Tartine - though price was on the high side, the portion was generous and much to my satisfaction. Also ordered a black coffee after consulting with the crew on the bean profile.

The crew were pleasant and attentive as they would ensure my cup of water gets refilled. The atmosphere was also comfortable - not too noisy on a weekday.

Special shoutout to JD and Ashley whom kindly recommended/explained about the different type of beans the cafe has, so that I was able to decide and bring a bag of beans home to enjoy. Will visit again!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116384131372631114169/reviews
Yee Ting,5,"OMG I WANNA SCREAM BECAUSE THE SERVICE IS JUST TOO GOOD!!!ü§©ü§©
The food, desserts, and drinks are all top-notch, with great flavors and beautiful presentation. The overall vibe is super cozy and relaxing, making it a perfect spot whether you‚Äôre hanging out with friends or enjoying some alone time. Definitely a place I‚Äôll keep coming back to!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113093031214791885354/reviews
