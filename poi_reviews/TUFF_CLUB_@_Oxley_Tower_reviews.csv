TK,5,"I was really hesitant to go due to the mixed reviews but it was amazing. The lift to the club is inside an office building entrance. Dj was great, it got busy at ~ 1 am but not cramped, drinks were reasonable and made quite strong so I’d say value for money. One big minus is the only ladies toilet but otherwise nothing negative",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116537673602058459024/reviews
Yunn,1,"Came here for the Neon Lights festival afterparty. It was empty at 12.30AM, but I'm not sure if there's a crowd later. That's what the door lady said, but we didn't stay. The service was really bad - it was as if we owed the both of them money, and they talked to us really rudely which put us off. The main reason for the 1 star review.
The music inside was sort of electro, dance floor was big and I can imagine that it'd be nice if there was a crowd and the music was more danceable to, but it just wasn't my type of music, nor my friends'. Drinks were priced average at $15.
However once again, what really put us off from this club was the way we were talked to.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106684114461666590026/reviews
Mr Garda,5,Easy to miss if you don’t know where to look. Just take any of the elevators to the 19th floor and you’re grand. Surprisingly well air conditioned even at full occupancy unlike a lot of similar spaces. Make sure you get here a tad big earlier to beat the 11:30pm queues.,a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114531264683924855476/reviews
rthx,4,"Was a rather packed crowd when we got there at 11ish. Bottles were averaging $250-290++ each which is the standard. 9 of us were showed to a low circular table. Most the tables were low sort- furnitures from the Chinese restaurant that operations during the day.

On a whole it was just meh. Dj seemed to have played more dark techno instead of house techno which could have brought about a better and more uplifting experience.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112413678169554268104/reviews
Dmytro,5,One of the best places to enjoy good techno in Singapore. Good to follow instagram and RA to keep track the events.,12 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106006951728157391052/reviews
