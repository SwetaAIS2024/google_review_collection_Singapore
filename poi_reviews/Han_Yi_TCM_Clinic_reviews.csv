Xie Ruifeng,5,"I injured my shoulder and knee while sliding down a long slide with my kids. My right shoulder was so swollen that I had difficulty lifting it up. Went to this TCM doctor hidden in a Chinese medical hall. The TCM Doctor was very friendly and even offered me a pot tea as I waited outside for my turn.

I did acupuncture for my knee and the doctor did a cupping to release blood from my swollen shoulder. After the treatment I can actually lift up my right arm! Total treatment time is about 1hr.

As per the TCM doctor it is due to internal bruising.

Tip: Do make appointment before going as there is usually a small crowd of elderly.",7 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118137865897384104106/reviews
