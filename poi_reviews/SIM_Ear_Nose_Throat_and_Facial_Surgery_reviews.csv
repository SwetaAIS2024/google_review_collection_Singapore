See Pan Chia,5,"Wonderful and warm experience with “Sim Ear Nose Throat & Facial Surgery” clinic in diagnosing and treating my sinus problem from start to finish.

Dr. Roland Sim was an excellent surgeon who perform the Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) to remove multiples large nasal polyps successfully in both my nostrils at Mt Alvernia Hospital recently.
Dr Roland Sim was always helpful and kind. He and his staff ensured that I had a smooth prep, surgery, and follow-up.  Every appointment with him at his clinic is always on time. He listens, is up to date on the latest treatment approaches, and always has an open mind.
I am so glad I chose “Sim Ear Nose Throat & Facial Surgery “clinic and would highly recommend it to anyone who would like to seek professional services in his areas of expertise.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106306159845199168785/reviews
Anthony Tan,5,"To say I’m pleased that I had my ear looked into by Dr. Sim, is an understatement. In fact, I’m very happy and thankful for the way he cleared my ear canal. No pain, no fuss. Simply brilliant!
Very easy to talk to, he’s a doctor with ‘both feet on the ground’; practical & sensible. Hence, gives sound advice on maintaining good ear canal health.
And Madam Tang, staff at this clinic, made us feel relaxed, and as if we’ve been friends a long time, eventhough it was my first visit to the clinic. Most helpful and patient to my enquiries.
Thank you both for a very pleasant experience at Sim ENT.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110717236260713317143/reviews
Ahn Yoona,1,"Saw Dr Sim last year because Mt A A&E gave his name card and helped me make appointment within the day. I was having blocked ear but I was able to hear weird vibrating or ringing sound, after checking the ear, he just said nothing wrong, nothing he can do.  Will not recommend him, he is so not empathy.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113943348669154793323/reviews
