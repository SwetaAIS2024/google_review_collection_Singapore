Yun Yi Thiam,5,"Had the $18 Chicken Claypot Rice and was pleasantly surprised. The rice was fragrant with a nice smoky char at the base, and it came generously topped with tender chicken chunks, flavourful lupcheong and yuencheong. I loved the addition of crispy pork lard which added an extra layer of texture. The portion was hearty and definitely great for sharing among 3 pax.

We also ordered the pork omelette and potato leaves and both were delicious & ‰∏ãÈ•≠!

The service uncles were friendly and welcoming, and the rest of the staff were equally helpful.

Definitely a value for money claypot rice cooked with love and patience. IMO, it‚Äôs one of the best authentic claypot rice spots in SG!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117032018297036757369/reviews
Hao Jun Chua,5,"Claypot rice here is absolutely fantastic.
Good wok hei, solid charred rice bits at the bottom.
Chicken was well marinated and succulent.
Lupcheong was plentiful and good quality.
Few pieces of salted fish elevated the whole dish to the next level.

Portion was big for the price. Definitely coming back again.

Do note they get busy but you can always call in advance to make your order first.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104663638936153648995/reviews
Jacob TAN,5,"Wanted claypot rice and we loved the food when ate it before their move here. Called to pre-book the claypot rice as it usually takes 20 minutes to cook. When we arrived, there were a couple of empty tables. The claypot rice came 10 minutes later. The server mixed the rice for us.
First taste of the rice confirms that the standard has been kept. The boneless chicken pieces were tender, juicy and flavourful. The rice was properly cooked. Crispy pork lard was added into the pot of rice for extra flavour. This claypot rise is at least one level above the rest. The only thing is that it doesn't have much vegetables.
The stall also serve zhi char dishes.
Service is friendly and efficient.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114080558508206655685/reviews
Jack Ang,5,"2nd time trying their claypot rice. Standard of food pretty consistent.

Order a mid size for 3 ppl. Would say not big, can fill about 5 bowl of rice.

Ingredients is really a lot for $18. Many chicken given and they are very tender and well marinated. I added extra lapchong ($3) which is pretty decent. It gives the rice more favour. Too little salted fish. Can‚Äôt taste much. One very interesting thing about this claypot rice is they add in pork lard, which is very crispy and gives the rice another favour which is unique. üëç but can gets a bit overkill if too much.

Homemade claypot toufu is too eggy for my likeing. They replace roast meat with slice meat. Which tones down the favour.
Decent taste.

Prawn roll is very nice. Highly recommended to order. But would hope to have more prawn than meat haha. But still very nice.

Sweet sour pork is more lean type. Sauce is just nice. Not too sweet.
But would be better if it‚Äôs more crispy.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101469377958165040868/reviews
June Lee,5,"I had the pleasure of dining at Ah Ching Claypot Delights (ÈòøÊ∏ÖÁ†ÇÁÖ≤Â∞èÂé®) this evening. The claypot rice (L$26)was exceptionally fragrant, with tender chicken and a perfectly crisped crust (ÈîÖÂ∑¥) at the base. Notable mentions include the claypot tofu($10), crispy prawn roll(L$12), the full of wok hey fried horfan (L$12)and vegetable( Naibai L$12)of the day.
