Teck Chong Law,4,"This stall only opens till 11 am.

Both prawn noodles and lor mee are really good.  Their chilli is quite spicy.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103886416957126587915/reviews
Kwong Fei Yee,5,"Tried both their prawn noodle and the loh mee. The prawn noodle is good but nothing to rave about. The loh mee on the other hand is definitely awesome!

First of all the sauce is heavenly. It is not too thick and incredibly tasty. With such a wonderful sauce, it is very for the dish to do well. However, on top of the wonderful sauce, they have added abundance of wonderfully fried stuff. The fried meat is infused with a big spectrum of flavor. There are alot of other stuff but floating on top are 3 big pieces of super crispy fried wanton. This heavenly bowl will only set you back by $3.5! Wow! What a deal.

The next time I try this place, I will add extra those wonderful ingredients!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118030178376808365901/reviews
Christine Chua,1,Crazy old auntie with bad attitude and poor hygiene. Taking order as if we are beggars. Shouted like a mad dog. Cannot just say that no option for separate chilli? Must shout like a mad dog? Good thing we walked away.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111474488256781968039/reviews
Mark Teo,4,Flavourful gravy and just enough ingredients.  Recommended.  Had it with chilli.  Would probably also recommend adding an extra ingredient to enjoy it even more.,3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102854444664112792164/reviews
