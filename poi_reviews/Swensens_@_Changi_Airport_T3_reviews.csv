Jordan “0verlord”,5,Family oriented. The fish chips is very delicious and fresh. Do not have fishy smell and cooked perfectly. The steaks are great. I love the pizzas too. The main highlights are the ice creams.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108918869077536907154/reviews
Lorrain Loh,5,"All Your Service staff & kitchen staff are working very hard. Especially the ice cream boy. Scooping hard ice cream from the tub is no joke, so tiring.
And when the staff sat down infront of me having their meals, they only took 10mins and quickly go back to work.
I really think your restaurant is under staff & they are definitely over work.
Please reward them accordingly.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115080333556511879559/reviews
S Elan,5,"Given the amount of turnover and the volume of food on offer, they did a great job of keeping things fresh. Pasta is cooked on request and pizza is continuously made. Everything tasted good and you get a good mix of western, asian and seafood. The ice cream was fantastic, huge number of flavours. Overall a really fun experience, did not disappoint!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103544649935674572451/reviews
Chia Jeslyn,4,"We are lucky to able to make reservations 3 hours before the actual time. We are there 30mins before booked time and was allowed to start early. Friday lunch, $35 each and after 10% service charge and 9% GST, it came out to be $83.93. The buffet spread was great! Recommend the pasta station and dessert station. Baked rice (fish) tasted bland, Butter chicken was good. Buffet is only given 90mins. The staffs were fast to clear the empty plates which allowed us to take more foods.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101596580973975070530/reviews
