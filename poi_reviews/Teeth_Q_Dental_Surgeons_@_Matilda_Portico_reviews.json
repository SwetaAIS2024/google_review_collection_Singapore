She was professional and managed to extract my modular tooth through regular extraction instead of the complication surgery process. The front desk lady (Alexis) was also approachable, friendly and kind. Overall, I had an wonderful and pleasurable experience with Teeth Q. I had decided to switch over to consult Teeth Q instead of my previous dental who had charged me double of the price with painful extraction.\nHappy Customer.",
