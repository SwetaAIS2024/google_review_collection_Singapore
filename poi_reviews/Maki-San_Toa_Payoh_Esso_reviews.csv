Timothy Teo,5,"Located inside Esso Toa Payoh Fairprice Xpress, they have also have rice bowl meals and salads aside from the obvious maki. Staff is helpful and do their best but it's no fast food, so expect to wait a bit if there is someone ahead.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109273027791328273356/reviews
Xinfang Leong,2,"I ordered mega san but they miss out on my turkey bacon bits. This is not the first time they mess up my order, previously they when i ordered mega san, they almost miss out on my smoked duck, it was after my reminder, then they open up the sushi and added it. What disappointed me this time is that i think they do realise they miss out my turkey bacon bits as the worker was looking to see if i notice their mistake but they just went ahead and cut the sushi. I hope they will check their order carefully before rolling the sushi next time.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118171525788645102638/reviews
Jewel Tan,3,Iâ€™ve always been a loyal fan of Makisan and I always get their mega San. Redeemed the promo they had in collaboration with Esso and I was initially quite impressed by the service cause it was readily made and I could just grab and go without having to hog the station my car was at butâ€¦ to my horror the rice is not fully cooked??? I was genuinely confused how can an established sushi store make such a rookie mistake ðŸ¤¯ isit because free thatâ€™s why like that :((((,9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108272560817343323867/reviews
