Popeye The baby,1,This is the 2nd time that I've ordered. But I paid $3 for add cockles for nothing. I guess that's the bad thing about delivery or take away. Utterly disappointed. Will probably not order again ðŸ˜”,6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100946084676459140433/reviews

Sarrean Raj Ganasan,1,"Please employ someone who can communicate basic English.. the worker does not even understand what the customer wants. When the customer orders for no pork..it means no pork..its simple as that. If he can't understand basic English, then find a way to get around so that the customers get what they ordered for instead of wasting money on your food.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112372971867893621340/reviews
Sean Lim,2,"Came on a Sunday with my folks.
Ordered a CKT and a carrot cake.
Attendent seems so blur even when taking order and I am speaking mandarin.
CKT came out 1st. Heard from my dad, it's ok.
They missed cooking the carrot cake and only realised when we chased for it
They end up cooking it in a small pan...
Already have a bad feeling on the taste Liao ... And yes CMI... Pls avoid their carrot cake... Disastrous get together Sunday meal.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107119293010688969753/reviews
