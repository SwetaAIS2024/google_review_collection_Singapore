      "text": "This is a very niche photography museum—so niche that it’s not even mentioned in Singapore travel guides, and you might walk right past it without noticing.\n\nThe exhibitions inside are free, but they mainly consist of a few framed photographs and a selfie corner. The displayed artworks and decorations change from time to time. The second floor houses photography-related books, though it’s unclear whether any visitors actually sit down to read them.\n\nThe air conditioning inside is quite strong, making it a good place to take a break if you're tired from walking. However, since very few people visit—locals included—the second floor is usually unlit. If you want to go up, the front desk will ask why.\n\nThen, someone will escort you upstairs, turn on the lights, and switch on the air con-definitely a unique experience compared to other museums.\n\nIf you're lucky, you might spot a cat outside gazing at the sky at a 45-degree angle. But if you miss this place, there’s no need for regret—it doesn’t even rank as a must-visit check-in spot.",

      "text": "Apart from the building which is an interesting one, considering that this was once a very small church, I think it's worth the time visiting a gallery focused on works of quality photographers.\n\nThere were three exhibits. One in the old church and 2 in the building next to it. All the exhibits were well curated with interesting and artistic photographs exhibited.\n\nThere were very few visitors as it was around 5pm on a weekday. I would say 30 mins to see all but a little longer if you are one who truly shows interest in such exhibits. It's a small gallery but I would highly recommend a short stop over if you are in the area.",
