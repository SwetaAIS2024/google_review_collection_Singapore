      "text": "I ordered six coin prata with standard chicken curry (without the chicken) for $3.50. The curry was thick, which I liked, slightly spicy but not overpowering, and paired well with the prata. The prata was beautifully presentedâ€”crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside, making it quite enjoyable. However, the kopi-o gao kosong was disappointing as it tasted diluted and lacked punch.",

The menu is impressively diverse, consisting of Chinese Zi Char, Western food and Indian cuisine. Staff was friendly. I only had a teh halia, which was not bad. Overall, a cosy (and interesting because it is beside a swimming pool) environment to have a meal.",
