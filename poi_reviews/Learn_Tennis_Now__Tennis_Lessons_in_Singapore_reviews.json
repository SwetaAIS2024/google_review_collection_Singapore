Jereme is able to book courts at his place or near by which is very convenient.\n\nLessons are very chill, easy to attend while always being focused on key skills/stroke to make you a better tennis player.\n\nAfter the few lessons with Jereme, we managed to pick up tennis as beginners and can now play it socially. Thank you!",
