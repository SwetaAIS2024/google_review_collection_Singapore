Located in a quiet part of the neighbourhood, Reached there just after 2pm and there were no crowds and sitting was not a problem.  We could choose our own sitting.\n\nCafe was quiet and tables were either studying or having group chats. place is very instragamable. It become more crowded after 3 plus.\n\nMinimum staff interaction which was ordering at counter and being served the food only.\n\nOrdered honey glazed wings, Hawaiian pizza and smoked salmon waffles. Drinks called are latte and hot chocolate. Food was prepared very quickly. Food tasted great and for the portion ordered is just nice. Latte could have done with more milk in my view.\n\nI didn't experience any bad food or service and will revisit again. A last feedback is perhaps to look to change the cushions as some are very stained. Recommended.",
