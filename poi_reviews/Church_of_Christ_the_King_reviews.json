      "text": "I was baptized and confirmed in this church, and it holds a special place in my heart. In the past, it was a vibrant and welcoming community, especially for the youth. We spent countless hours hanging out there, feeling a genuine sense of belonging. However, in recent years, the church seems to have lost some of that warmth. The modern renovations covering up the lovely marble with boring carpets and railings everywhere,  have made it feel more formal and less inviting. There also seems to be a disconnect between the church and its congregation, with fewer efforts to engage the community. To add to this, my experience with one of the administrative staff, Agatha, was particularly disappointing due to her rudeness. I sincerely hope the church can rediscover its former spirit of openness and community, bringing back the welcoming atmosphere that once made it so special.",
