      "text": "Got pomfret + lala and stingray + sotong set for $8.50 each. The portion is really generous and the price is reasonable. The stingray and sotong are perfectly cooked and are smothered with sambal. The sour onion is a really great palette cleanser and taste amazing together with the rice. The sunny side up was also done perfectly. The lala is fresh and had no sand in it at all. However, the fried pomfret was a bit hard and overcooked, but it was still very fragrant.",

      "text": "I hadn't been here in a while, and now it's renovated with the stalls moved behind the coffee counter. Prices have gone up, but for $8.50, you still get a set with rice, egg, and two proteins.\n\nWe chose a set with stingray and squid to share and ordered more dishes from other stalls. It took about 15 minutes before our beeper rang, and we quickly got our food.\n\nThe standout is their Sambal Chilli. They're so generous with it that every bite is coated with tasty heat. It's more savory than overly spicyâ€”really satisfying!\n\nThe squid was cooked just right, with a good texture that wasn't too chewy. Unfortunately, the stingray was a bit dry, maybe because it's a value set with more soft bones.\n\nOverall, the star here is definitely the SAMBAL CHILLI! They give plenty of it for free, unlike other places. It makes the dining experience even better.",

Food was good and loved the sides (the runny and crispy base of the egg and the pink onion thing). Potion wise might have shrinked a little since I manage to finish everything alone (?) but this is subjective since it might be my appetite. Just wanted to share the nice food photo. =D",

      "text": "Ate at a off peak timing so might taste different during peak hours.\nStingray itself is actually quite good. Bbq slight toasty taste.\n\nThe chilli is okay, I would prefer it maybe slightly more sweeter and salty too not sure if that's possible. The shrimp fragrant of the chilli is good too. Would prefer more. I have to scrap and spread the chili well otherwise there's some without chilli.\n\nThink on the pricy side, but not much price to compare with so I might be wrong. 28 for the picture I sent.\n\nThe side chili/appetizer is actually really good. Sweet and sour, goes really well when the salt of the stingray gets to you.",
