Food was not too bad for the price.\n\nGood place to have a nice dinner, although tables are quite close to each other which means there is a lack of privacy when having dinner - you can easily hear the conversation from the next table.\n\nOverall still a good place for dinner.",

The fries were nicely salted,unlike a lot of places where they put so little salt and it's like eating plain fried potato. The fish batter was crispy and deep fried to a nice golden brown.\n\nThe apple crumble was 1 of the best I've ever eaten, the crumbs were so crunchy and you can tell everything is all handmade and not commercial type of food",
