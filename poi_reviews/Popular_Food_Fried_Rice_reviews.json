      "text": "Food was slightly below average, though for the price it’s still not bad la. Do avoid the XO scallop fried rice as nothing special was added, couldn’t taste the XO or the scallops lol. Good thing is that their ton yum fried rice at least got tom yum taste. Rice portion is big egg portion is a tad small, the meat given like chicken and pork cutlet is decent.\n\nLastly the service is pretty bad, as I came back to return the buzzer and pick up my food. Only to be told to leave it in a rude manner. I know F&B isn’t easy, but I feel that it’s basic to just teach or tell customers to return back in a nicer tone and manner. Good luck!",

      "text": "Another clone of King of Fried Rice, and I'll say it's quite a decent clone for the rice itself so that's nice. The chili is different but complements quite well too.\n\nHowever, the cutlet is extremely disappointing in taste, size and texture. It's just a small dry piece of pork that's deep fried instead of the generous and tender pork cutlet we expect with such fried rice. Hopefully they can improve.\n\nEdit: Good luck to them with a legit KoF just down the street",

I tucked into their chicken chop fried rice, and let me tell you, it was a satisfying meal.\n\nBut what really stole the show was that sambal chili - super shiok, I tell you! It added so much flavor to the dish that made every bite a pleasant experience. Ho Jiak",
