Gum Gum,1,Their hokkien mee is nothing to shout about anymore. Used to be amazing. Changed owners and now its really expensive. The $7 portion is the minimum and is tiny. And only comes with this one tiny chilli packet. The aunty refused to give more when I asked. Was also really rude about it. Generally did not have a good feeling after buying from this store. Would NOT recommend. Theres a much better store run by a really nice uncle just a bit further down.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113781379495384407176/reviews
Keng Cheong Tan,4,Ordered a $10 Hokkien Mee. Generally flavorful with a bit of wok hey. The prawns were quite tasteless though but generally satisfying. Will have to wait for around 15 mins on a weekend night after making your order. The $10 serving is just nice for one person. Comes in other sizes from $7 to $25.,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102762619432424724330/reviews
Flo G,3,"Came here to take away dinner right after flight landing and was so glad to see this stall.

Expectations for a good HKM are high given the stall’s name & charcoal fried!

Ordered a $10 portion and being a big sucker for tradition taste, paid extra $1 for the betel leaf packing.

Was given a number after ordering and told 10min wait. Definitely waited 15min or more.

Too hungry to stop and take a picture of the noodles.

Verdict:
no wok hey
Taste is ok not life changing
A little dry for my liking
fresh cut chillies, v little sambal chilli given
Prawns are fresh and crunchy

Didn’t live up to its reputation.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113094459489500763998/reviews
Gabriel Seah,2,Hokkien mee was only alright despite the awards. The chili was very spicy. There were some lard cubes but they weren't crispy. Prices start at $7 which is above average,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107859662951742168090/reviews
YEO WEN JUN ROY,5,"Order the $20 portion, which is enough for sharing with four people.

One of the best Fried Hokkien Mee in Singapore. The noodles are moist, soaking up with aroma from the prawns. The chilli is spicy and fragrant as well. Well worth the wait.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110368122443353685000/reviews
