Tan Lai Heng,3,"Hokkien mee $8
2 prawn non existent squid
No taste at all.
Should have known as I saw them cooking the mee. Non existent frying, throw all noodles in, throw in stock and cover for almost 10 min.
Before packaging, throw in the pitful seafood and mix 2-3 stroke.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115105198050931743786/reviews
XY Lim,3,"This stall is located inside the Kopitiam on the 2nd floor of Yew Tee place, right opposite the drinks stall.
First off I was expecting really horrible inedible food considering the abysmal 1 star reviews - so having tasted their Hokkien Mee I can say it's honestly quite OK. Yes prices are quite high considering the portion and location, and yes the guy working there looks like he hates his job and can't be bothered when cooking, but the taste is actually quite decent and in line with other Old Hup Kees.
From the other reviewers it seems like the quality depends on who is working that day, so for reference this was based on an order at Saturday lunchtime.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109785791498103122701/reviews
C K,3,Had the Hokkien Mee twice so far and I thought the flavour is pretty good (the chilli is fab) and this is with a different staff cooking each time. Service is acceptable too. My only gripe would be the inconsistent portion size in my experience.,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115641428838282582471/reviews
Miguel Esesjay,4,"Their FRIED KWAY TEOW is nicely cooked and flavored. Balanced sweetness and spiciness. Less cockles but I noticed that there is a considerable amount of thinly sliced lap cheong (Chinese sausage) and thin slices of fish cake. I liked it that there is generous amount of mung bean sprouts which definitely adds crunch and texture to the dish. There is a help yourself different types sambal chilies and a tub of lime (calamansi) should you fancy adding more to suit your taste.

FRIED OYSTER is cooked according to my liking. The oysters are well-cooked yet retain their juiciness.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105215085834173868326/reviews
V 09,1,"Very bad hokkien mee.
It came with charred taste & smell (not wok hey but burnt). Complaint to the staff, he apologised and served up a new plate.
The new plate came charred too...... $6 for a bad hokkien mee, not worth.
Management needs to do something about this.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103898222177162139498/reviews
