Orla,5,"The teachers here are pioneers in the early childhood industry, bringing a wealth of experience and continuously refining their teaching materials to meet the evolving needs of children. Having been part of Singapore’s early childhood education since its inception, they offer valuable insights into how the industry has grown and transformed over the years. Attending their classes feels like witnessing the evolution of early childhood education firsthand, allowing me to learn from their expertise and innovative approaches. This experience has been incredibly beneficial to me, not only as a newcomer to the industry but also as a mother, providing me with practical knowledge and a deeper understanding of how to support children’s growth and development both in the classroom and at home.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100793047415504287130/reviews
