Esther Kee,5,"Had a fantastic time at Margie The Market Bar! The atmosphere is vibrant and welcoming, making it a great spot to unwind with friends. There are plenty of food options and the taste did not disappoint! Paired perfectly with drinks!

The service was top-notch! The staff was friendly, attentive, and made sure we had a great experience. Special shoutout to Acky—such a fun and great guy to chat with!

Additionally, they have a fantastic karaoke system, making it a great spot for hosting events and celebrations. Definitely a must-visit place for anyone looking for a fun and chill night out. Can’t wait to come back again!!!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111053912165228963252/reviews
sy lee,4,"Tried the Pork Jowl bowl and my friends tried the other dishes. We shared a chicken platter too.

The pork jowl was tasty: plenty of chicken rice topped with fragrant and fatty pork and Char Siew sauce, like the kind you get in actual hawker char siew rice stalls. However, if you don’t like the strong taste of pork, this may not be for you.

The rice bowls are also very filling. Do share if you are a small eater. Or if you have a bowl to yourself, avoid ordering sides.

We had the Hot Chicks platter. The best was the Mala Karaage. There was also a honey/bbq wing and a deep fried batter wing, with a hint of lemon but it was quite muted.

Price wise it was acceptable. The cheapest rice bowl is the roasted chicken at 9.90. Then the rest around around 11.90-13.90.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115188176141568201622/reviews
Huiyun Lin,3,"Charred Char Siew Pork Jowl Rice Bowl: smells good and taste decent. But too many fatty parts and only 2 pieces of meat with actual meat.
Grilled 'Chomp Chomp' Chicken Rice Bowl: smells good too. But meat was quite small and slightly tough. Sauce taste is not bad.
Truffle fries: fries came hot. Truffle taste not strong.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101440015597524509284/reviews
Alvin Teo,3,"Tried the chicken bowl at Margaret Market.
They have a bubble tea set you can get with the mains.
Portions are adequate, egg was well done. My favourite part was actually the oil rice which was flavourful but not overwhelming.
Bubble tea was average.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115674843686641379996/reviews
DK SG,1,"while those that are freely singing in this location may be decent singers, but can we take care of the other patrons whom are here to enjoy a peaceful dinning experience? I don’t come here because these is a KTV joint or Live Band on other days than Thursday?? Live Band is fine, but keep it this way. Thanks",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116431140976885412529/reviews
