Ibrahim Mahudhy,5,"I recently stayed at PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay and had a pleasant experience. The hotel has a lively atmosphere and can get quite busy, but the service remains efficient.

The breakfast was delicious, with a good variety of options. The rooms are spacious and comfortable, offering a relaxing stay. The location is excellent—just a short walk to Marina Bay, shopping malls, and plenty of dining options.

What I loved most was the hotel’s stunning greenery and nature-inspired design, creating a serene urban oasis. Overall, a great stay in a prime location! Would recommend.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111714884463551709306/reviews
Khalil Robinson,5,"Great experience at this property. Professional and friendly service. Relaxing ambiance, rooftop pool, comfortable club lounge, and marina views. Room was good size and well maintained. I had the opportunity to book a full body massage shortly after check in. Rosa was amazing! Super relaxing and the perfect pressure. I highly recommend this property and Rosa for spa services.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101242729576490519772/reviews
Charlotte Cowley,5,My husband said this was the best hotel he's ever stayed in and he travels a lot! It really was amazing to stay here and the view of Marina Bay was much better than I was expecting. We loved pulling the curtains back in the morning and watching the thunderstorm over marina bay. The food was brilliant too with an  excellent selection at breakfast. All the staff were exceptionally friendly and we couldn't fault our stay at all. The environment credentials are what sold it to me initially and it delivered on this and so much more!,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107869782162090535841/reviews
Karen Pierce,5,"Wrapped in comfort, elegance, and a view that takes your breath away—Park Royal Collection Singapore isn’t just a hotel, it’s an experience. Sharing this serene escape with the one I love makes every sunset sweeter, every morning more magical. This is what romance and luxury truly feel like.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117217522394611499246/reviews
sn assyikin,4,"I was a bit frustrated with the cleanliness of the hotel. The toilet was not properly cleaned — there was visible mold on the walls and the sink was also not clean. I noticed a water filter was provided, but I chose not to use it due to the overall condition of the toilet.

The breakfast buffet was also disappointing, with limited variety and not many options available. I hope this can be improved.

On a positive note, the staff were helpful and friendly. Overall, the service was okay, but there is room for improvement, especially in terms of cleanliness and food selection.

One bonus point worth mentioning is that the hotel/restaurant has a halal certificate, which is a great advantage for Muslim customers. Well done!",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117210199113250823929/reviews
