It heartens me to see how the elderly enjoyed our show and actively participated in our forum theatre. Mr Isaiah Christopher Lee is our coach and he enabled us to put us a very good show.",

      "text": "RE:ACT 2024 was truly a once in a lifetime experience, one for the ages. It was a melting pot of different emotions - anguish, sadness, empathy, and lots of giggles to top it all off. Inwardbound outdid themselves on this production, weaving all the different performances and segments into a harmonious symphony, leaving attendees in awe. The lessons learnt from RE:ACT are enlightening, presented in a dramatic yet entertaining medium. The forum part was exceptionally scintillating, as it was a different take on a traditional drama, a bold move by Inwardbound. I would definitely recommend my friends and family members to attend this play, and I feel that it is marketed at an affordable cost as well. The performance by Kent Ridge Secondary School particularly blew my socks off with their one of a kind acting and universally tip top crew work.",
