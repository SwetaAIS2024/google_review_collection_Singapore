Hazel Tan,5,"My LO has been with BT - Kensington since Infant care. It has been 3 years now. Although there has been some staff movement here and there, I will still (highly) recommend this school to the others. Quiet location that is conveniently located near Serangoon / Tai Seng / Bartley area.

Other than the already low teacher / child ratio. We like that the school has a smaller pool of students than other schools. Hence, the teachers are able to focus more on the learning and growing of individual child. Also, fewer viruses spread around with fewer students. The teachers will communicate and post child updates / learning photos through the app. They have a friendly and dynamic Vice-Principal on the ground too!

My LO enjoys attending school every day. Do check the school out if you are considering IFC / Preschool for your LO.

June Tan,5,"My son has been attending the infant class since March this year. As first time parents, we were really anxious and not sure if we were making the right decision but we have not looked back since. We are super thankful to Ms Caitlin and her team of teachers. Since March, I donâ€™t recall any turn over of staff. And my son havenâ€™t cried even once at drop off. This is the confidence I have in sending him to school each day!

The facilities are very comprehensive, clean and safe for babies. Each infant gets a drawer of their own to keep things like diapers, creams, wipes, etc. Other stuff like clothes, towels, bibs, socks have to be brought and replenished daily when you bring your baby. Things are well-organized and I get daily updates on feeding/napping/diaper through a notebook so itâ€™s fuss free.

Whenever my son gets a diaper rash, teachers will clean him with water instead of wet wipes to help with his pain. Really super thankful to them for taking care of him so well!

This center is also the only one I know that has salmon as part of their menu for the children!

Although this isnâ€™t my priority, I feel that since joining infant care, my son has progressed to hit his milestones earlier than his peers. And this is truly thanks to efforts of the teachers as I watch them help him - now learning walking!

Extra perk of sending him to this childcare is the 1 hour free parking! Security guards in the building are also so kind and friendly to my baby!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117523082480325608678/reviews
Cheryl Tan,5,"My little girl attended infant care at Brilliant Tots Kensington Square. It was the most convenient for us as we were staying nearby.

The staff were absolutely amazing. There were high turnover when my child was there, but it was managed well. There were no lapses in quality. The teachers were very caring and always up to date with my childâ€™s situation and needs. The low child-teacher ratio was a blessing.

There is also very seamless parent-teacher interaction. I absolutely miss this centre - the family move to the east side and baby change centres for playgroup, otherwise we wouldâ€™ve continued all the way.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100708621407461723853/reviews
Doreen Tay,5,"My kids really enjoy their time at the school and sometimes pickups are also hard because they want to spend more time there! ðŸ¤­ This demonstrates the great impact and devotion of their principal and teachers have on them.

I would like to personally acknowledge Miss Jing Wen, who has been here since the start of the year to manage the school. She is a great listener and a good partner to work with to ensuring the best outcomes for the kids be it socially or academically.

I would recommend the school to anyone who will appreciate a school that has a low student teacher ratio, and with the kidsâ€™ best interests at heart.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102671788289218502889/reviews
Kelly Shia,5,"I will definitely recommend Brilliant Tots IFC to any parent looking for quality care for their babies. Teachers are very reliable and pay great attention to my babyâ€™s needs (eg washing with water for diaper rash, teaching him to drink water, learning to nap longer). Low teacher to child ratio. Consistent quality across all staff members. Every teacher + teacher assistant I met here are all very approachable and accommodating.

Communication with parents is regularly done via the app. Teachers take initiative to share pics of activities more frequently than I expect. Iâ€™m also impressed by the variety of activities for infants designed by the teachers (eg baby basketball, pulling ribbons, painting, picking balls). They never seem to run out of ideas! My baby looks forward to being dropped off at IFC every single day!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116466535143599147661/reviews
