Men and women prayer rooms are separated, and there is built-in place for wudu'.\n\nIt's located at Garden Tower section of Marina One at B2.\n\nIf you go down this particular escalator as in the photo, it will lead you straight to the musolla. Hope I've helped you do your solat on time!",

Also got a few wakaf al quran, perfumes, tissue and soap to wash your hands.\n\nI think this is nearest surau within Garden by the Bay. If you are planning to come here, can alight at Downtown MRT and walk to Marina One at B2 East Tower side.\n\nThis Marina One is quite famous with stunning art of its architecture design.",

There are racks providing various necessities, including masks, hand sanitizer, tissues, and more.",
