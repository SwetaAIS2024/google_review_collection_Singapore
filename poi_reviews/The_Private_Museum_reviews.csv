Liz,5,"Although it was pretty far away from public transport and I had to hike a bit to get there, it was totally worth it. The artworks are very thought provoking and I would highly recommend for you to go there. There was no wait time and no need to book.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113808445422101811619/reviews
M,5,"The current exhibition at this venue didn't quite appeal to me, but the history of the house, spanning from the 1800s to the present, was fascinating. The toilets were also notably impressive. However, the location is a bit of a drawback, as it's quite a distance from any public transport and requires a hike up a small hill to reach this otherwise gorgeous house.

Additionally, there aren't any amenities around, so be sure to bring some water to keep yourself hydrated. Though the museum does offer some light refreshments in exchange for a donation.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102704131576745758312/reviews
Michelle Belle,4,"Lovely historical house atop a 'hill'
Seasonal art works, a 10min-1h experience depending on how artsy you are and whether you take time to soak in the architecture/ atmosphere...",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106367549077726051943/reviews
ET Ang,5,"This is like a special art club. Instead of a big, crowded museum, it's cozy and intimate.

Art collectors get to show their treasures here, from paintings to sculptures. Artists also experiment and create mind-bending installations. The museum connects private art enthusiasts with curious visitors.

It is worth a visit when you are around the area.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112541858640367889228/reviews
