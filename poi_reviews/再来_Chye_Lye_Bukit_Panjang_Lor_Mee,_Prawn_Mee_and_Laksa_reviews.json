      "text": "Been eating this since young (more than 30 years). One of the best around. Laksa, Lor Mee, Prawn Noodles. Go for the top tier options. Laksa is rich and creamy. The chilli paste adds a savory kick to it. Lor Mee is thick and fragrant. Topping it up with garlic, chilli and black vinegar adds a whole new dimension to the dish. The fried battered fish is heavenly. Hot, fresh, crispy, flakey. Can't stop at one. The clear prawn broth of the Prawn Noodles is full of Umami. Goes well with the sliced chilli in soy sauce. Good portions. My favorite would be the Laksa. Service is relatively quick but expect to queue for some time. Environment is the standard modern food centre style. But quite cooling with high ceilings and big fans. Price is affordable. Parking can be scarce and not suitable for low cars.\nHawker dishes that require a lot of preparation work like these are slowly disappearing. Do enjoy them while we can.",
