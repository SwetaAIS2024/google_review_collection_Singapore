My plate was cleared before I had finished eating, and they didn’t even ask first. Additionally, there were quite a few mosquitoes around. We informed the staff and asked if they could turn on the cooler, but they just replied that it was broken and didn’t offer any further assistance. It’s worth noting that there was more than one cooler in the area",

Seems like all same bosses.\n\nThe western food pump platter is average. The beef is too tough, wings really good. Nachos is short of guacamole though. Calamari is huge and juicy. Thai food is great esp the fried vegetables and fresh coconut. The pork is abit too dry though.\n\nWinner is actually the 串! Very tasty and well spiced. Drinks are decently priced too - $50/bottle of wine.\n\nService is good and attentive.",

Drinks and food orders were missed out, I don't mind waitress not writing down orders but have a concern when they are missed out. Hope this part is improved. Other wise was a pleasant family dining",
