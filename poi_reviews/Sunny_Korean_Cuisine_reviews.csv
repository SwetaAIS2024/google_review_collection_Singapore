AC Chan,4,"I’m uncertain about the Korean flavour of this dish but it sure has the essential element of local zi char [a.k.a. stir-fry] cooking — tender and flavourful beef slices with onions on a sizzling cast iron hot plate with the distinctive ‘wok hei’ [a.k.a. smoky flavour].
P.S. Did I mention that this set that comes in generous portion and free-flow of barley tea cost below SGD8?!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
Louis Chua,5,"Very nice place to go to. The lady at the counter is very efficient and friendly. She is always cheerful and bubbly when we order.
Food is generally cooked fast and need to collect at the counter. I would say the quality and quantum are reasonably good for the price.
Price has increased after the renovation but probably due to the higher rental for the new contract. But it is still reasonable.
Atmosphere is ok and has improved after the renovation.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117782437474545961841/reviews
Jenny Ang,4,Ordered rather standard bento set which you can find in many food court. Saw a few tables with actual Korean eating. So they must be doing something right.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100550457217121448146/reviews
Clement Loh,3,"Had lunch with family, 1st time trying. Portion is quite generous and big. Taste is so-so only. But due to the big portion, I shall say is worth it. Has free self service hot tea just like dining in korea. Their cold noodles are my favorite, opens up your appetite and very nice chewy noodles. Beef bulgogi porridge is normal, porridge not sweet or flavorful enough, but with the beef is alright. Potato pancakes are korea sweet pancakes. It's a small Cafe restaurant dinning outlet, I think the price is ok and worth visiting again.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102419857399310335575/reviews
yamuna mohanram,5,"Delicious food but is it authentic, I'm not sure.

This was my first try of Korean food here in Singapore and I rate and review this based on taste and not authenticity.

Honestly, I loved their food. Ginseng chicken was subtle in flavors while the chicken steamboat was bursting with flavors. Similarly kimchi rice rice with egg was equally good. All at an affordable pricing.

For the food, portion size, flavors and affordable pricing, this place is packed. Definitely worth trying for all the above reasons. Highly recommend.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102396677643961543131/reviews
