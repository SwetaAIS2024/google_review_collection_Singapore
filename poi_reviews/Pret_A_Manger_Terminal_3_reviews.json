      "text": "$9.20 for a 12oz flat white! These prices are just getting out of hand. Feel like we're being robbed each time we get a coffee from this or any cafe in the airport for that matter. Will likely be the last time, can't continue like this. It's no wonder tourists are avoiding visiting Singapore. Who wouldn't avoid a country where a 12oz cup of coffee costs close to $10 or where a sandwich costs $16.",

The coffee is quite good ($5.40 for an Americano) and cheaper than Starbucks or Coffee Bean.\nThey have healthy options and breakfast options like salad, chia pudding, etc. it’s just expensive.",
