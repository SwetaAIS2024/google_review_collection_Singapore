Valerie Tan,5,"This is a seriously good piece of banana cake. Taste and texture is seriously on point. Oh my. To me, this is the perfect banana cake. Wow üëçperfection. Totally worth it. Glad I got it... had a sense it was good from the looks of it at their shop even tho I just had lunch.

I tried without heating up and the texture is soft and on point. I would recommend without heating up so that it's soft? Will try heated up next time just to compare.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115383788125604801660/reviews
