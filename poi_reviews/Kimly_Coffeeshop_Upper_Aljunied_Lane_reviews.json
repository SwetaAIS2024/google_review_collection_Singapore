Their mobile data signal is weak, even when I showed them I paid and transaction is successful on my app. They refuse to make my food cause their app has no signal and thus, did not receive the payments. They made me wait for 10 min, without telling me that they are not going to give me my food. Complete waste of time, extremely terrible service.\n\nAsk me to come back next day to check and take my food if the transaction is successful at their end. I don’t even stay in this area! Terrible service.",
