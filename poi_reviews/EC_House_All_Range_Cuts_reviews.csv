Wei Wei,1,"I brought my son to have haircut because they have the “baby car chair”. However it’s useless to calm down the baby, and the stylist is not patient, quick cut scratched my son. Won’t recommend.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111579206566898199872/reviews
Ling Ling,5,Brought my 4year old daughter here for her first hair cut. The hairstylist named Ngoi did a great job. My daughter did not cry and was enjoying her first hair cut throughout as the stylist's haircut was swift and accurate. Requested for almost 2inch trim for her long hair and fringe was cut according to request. At $14 the cut was well worth it. We left the EC house as satisfied customer. Highly recommended for parents out there who is unsure of where to bring their kids for their first haircut.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107081769570346038597/reviews
