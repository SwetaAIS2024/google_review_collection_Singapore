He listens patiently to your concerns and is totally non-judgemental. He kindly said he doesn't want us to spend so he won't order unnecessary tests. He actually asked if I have time and said he likes to spend a full 30 minutes with his patients before dishing out medical advice to allay my worries. I feel so much better now! Highly recommend this doctor.\nAppearance: The clinic is very clean and modern in design.\nFront counter: A Chinese lady and an Indian lady. Both kind and friendly.",

Paid $62 for the initial consultation, and Dr. Ezlyn insisted I take a test costing an additional $269. When the results came back negative, my symptoms persisted. I informed the doctor, but she dismissed my concerns. Furthermore, despite my stating I have no sexual partners, she assumed I had a sexually transmitted disease and didn't believe me. I'm deeply disappointed to have paid close to $300 to receive zero professional advice from this clinic. It was a complete waste of time and money, and I 100% would not recommend visiting.",
