Jackie Ter,1,Food was expensive and took so long to come yet it was cold and oily. Tables were also not cleaned and staff were constantly using their phones not doing their job. Will not come back and recommend to anyone,a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111041551554794232071/reviews

Asher Kang,5,"Amazing matcha worth the 12$, I came with my friends and we all ordered different drinks that delivered the same amount of BUSS and delight. We are extremely happy with the service and our choice in selecting this cafe to go to after school. If there was an award for best cafe, I would nominate this place without hesitation.
