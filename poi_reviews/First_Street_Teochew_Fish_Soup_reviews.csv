Jay Sng,5,"Absolutely soul for the tummy and mind. The fish soup (I ordered pomfret and mackerel) was out of this world. So simple yet so flavorful! Awesomeness to the max. I had to add that the additional fish maw adds power to the meal! Couple the fish slices either the fermented soy bean dip, you get a wonderful mouthful of fish cooked to perfection swimming in your mouth! Boss is young and dynamic, and really humble. The queue can be long though but no complains! Worth every penny. It can be considered expensive for coffee shop fare but kid you not, it’s really the premium ingredients used for the soup that makes it worthwhile! Don’t take my word for it, go try it!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107218241116967128027/reviews
David Wong,3,"The taste of my seafood soup is slightly ok at almost $9 with rice.  Went there at almost one on Thursday n I am the only one customer in the Q.  Accepted paylah payment.

Found a quiet table just outside the shop fronting upper serangoon road.

My first sight of my seafood soup didn't give me a good vibe although the soup was tasty.

But at this price, I expected seafood.  Sad to know at this price point, there were more fatty minced pork, few slices of fish n fishcakes slices in this seafood soup.

Only one small prawn, 2 very tiny n short slices of cuttlefish tentacles with tiny veg slices.

This ratio of fat minced pork n veg slices overwhelmed the other seafood n is ridiculous.  This soup should be renamed as pork n not seafood soup.

DISAPPOINTED EXPERIENCE COMPARED TO ANOTHER STALL I ATE YESTERDAY AT $6.  WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE THAT IS PRICY BUT THE FOOD QUANTITY RATIO SERVED IS SO DISPROPORTIONATE.

Edwin Sim,5,The fish is very fresh and the sliced portion is thick and big. The soup is very tasty and no MSG as not thirsty after drinking. The more expensive fish are the grouper and promfet but I find the Batang (mackerel) tasty and tender.,2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101573409211772718775/reviews
paulin phang,5,"We had  dinner at First Street Teochew Fish Soup. The fish was cooked perfectly and the soup had a nice balance of flavors. The minced meat added a nice texture to the dish, and the bitter gourd added a nice touch of bitterness to cut through the richness of the soup. Overall, we were very satisfied with our meal and would definitely recommend trying their Teochew fish soup.",10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117115006801951626028/reviews
