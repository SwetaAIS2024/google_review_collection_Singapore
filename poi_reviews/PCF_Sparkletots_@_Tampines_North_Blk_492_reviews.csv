Zhen Yi He,5,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
We couldn’t be happier with our experience at PCF Sparkletots @ 492 Tampines! The teachers and staff are incredibly attentive, caring, and committed to nurturing each child’s development. It’s clear that they go above and beyond to create a safe, loving, and stimulating environment for the children.

The school is well-organized, and the activities are thoughtfully designed to engage the kids while fostering their curiosity and creativity. Communication with parents is excellent—they keep us well-informed about our child’s progress and daily experiences.

If you’re looking for a preschool where your child will feel supported and excited to learn, PCF Sparkletots @ 492 Tampines is an outstanding choice. Highly recommend it!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108824295860764124211/reviews
Salinah “EnaB” B. Sani,5,"Was doing a flexi job in a new hdb flat and was quite late for the appointment. Taking bus, raining without umbrella and was confuse of the blocks which have lots of alphabet. But thankfully, 1 of the nursery teacher coincidencely alighting the bus with me to send items to 492a before going for her vacation. I was looking for 492E . She invites me to walk together as we are going to the same area.Both without umbrella, walking in a fast pace but the nice thing was that she really did led me on until we really find the block , and pointed out 492E right in front of us. It’s a fulfilling thoughts now to be sure that whoever child whom were send to this nursery, rest assure that child is in good hand and being well taken care of. Keep up the good work Teachers!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111699585034946741288/reviews
