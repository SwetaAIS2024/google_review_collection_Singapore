Lai Heng Chong,1,"I went on Wednesday morning regarding not getting OTP in my email to activate paylah.  I need to reactivate paylah apps becos I just change my handphone.
The counter staff checked and explained that the paylah system did not issue the OTP, and that their IT will get back to me.
The IT called on a Saturday 2.13pm.  Because it was an unknown number, I did not answer the call.  Then at 2.21pm, I received SMS ""With regards to your Paylah email OTP issue, kindly terminate & re-apply Paylah again. Would you like us to terminate it at our end so you can apply straight away after termination? Kindly advise. Thank you and have a great weekend!""
I replied to the SMS at 2.30pm.  But there is no reply.  Probably she has gone home, after a half day in office on a Saturday.
Wonder why the IT called near knock off time, and left before solving the issue? In so doing, the ticket would be recorded as action taken within 3 days and KPI satisfied?
It certainly wont be a great weekend for me.  I would have to bear with hopefully only another 2 days of inconveniences of no paylah, before the issue can be resolved hopefully on Monday.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111494164193464357803/reviews
Mohanrajan Rameshkumar,5,"Went in at 11am on a Thursday, and was waiting for 30 mins ( but that's fine because of the crowd and you also get to sit till you are called). Met Serene Goh who was super kind enough to solve my queries and get me sorted. She was patient and kind and helped me with all my queries. Thanks team.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101638614661670747536/reviews
Adam Faidzal,5,Went there today at around 10.45am on 28th Oct to change my card which is already spoilt. I was served by a very helpful woman namely Emily. She helped me through with the process without any delay. DBS has a ‚Äúgem‚Äù within their staff. Wonderful and great service. Thank you Ms Emily. üòäI was told not to take any photos within the bank so I just got to do with the photos from outside the bank.,3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110031926877469711332/reviews
