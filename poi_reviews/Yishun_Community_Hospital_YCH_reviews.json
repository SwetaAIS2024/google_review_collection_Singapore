Assuring that we will be very discreet. It was ok but it was only on an adhoc basis. The senior nurse SF decided to put a stop on the 2nd day and I asked if I can appeal and  was told i cannot appeal but can only feedback.\nI observed the ward was mostly empty and there were beds with more than the usual 2 visitor quota.\nIs the decision based on SOP or a deterrent . I could understand if the ward are full and we had disturb the other patients.\nWhere is the compassion where an appeal was disallowed and stopped at the sister level.",

Got to do reflection and soul-searching for this.. or health ministry can answer for this??",
