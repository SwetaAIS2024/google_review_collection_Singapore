      "text": "The new bird park is a significant upgrade from the old Jurong location—larger and better!  I especially loved the huge black ventilation fans behind the theatre. We chose top-row seats near the fans for a fantastic bird's-eye view, though be warned:  the three large bird entrances in this area mean eagles and vultures might fly very close during the shows (there are signs warning about this).  It's an incredible, up-close experience, perfect for photos and videos, but potentially startling.  There are two shows daily, one morning and one afternoon, each featuring different bird performances; I highly recommend seeing both!",

      "text": "Really amazing shows! I watched the 10:30 wings of the world show and the 2:30 predators on wings show.\nWings of the world: My favorite part of this show was the parrots. There were two parrots, and they could talk! The first one said “Welcome to parrot paradise” and then copied the sounds of the cat, turkey, and lots of other birds. Then, it sang a song about Singapore! It was a bit confused at first, but then it did it. The second one said “Hello” and “How are you?” and sang a happy birthday song!\nPredators on wings: This show has lots of vultures, but nothing very special or interesting. It was just watching the people give food to the big birds.\nOverall, I think wings of the world is  much better than the predators on wings, but I learnt a lot from these presentations, so both of them are great!",
