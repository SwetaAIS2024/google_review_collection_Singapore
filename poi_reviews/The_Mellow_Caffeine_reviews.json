      "text": "I was actually just driving through the area and craving a coffee. Spotted this place from the road and decided to get a takeaway coffee. But in the end decided to sit down after all because the lady owner was really friendly and welcoming, and invited me inside warmly. She was very chatty and had the most lovely personality. The cafe is very open and breezy. I ordered an iced long black. A simple order that cannot go wrong hahaha... and I love their special textured glasses. They serve food and cakes too but today I was just in need of a pick-me-up coffee. Also, they are pet friendly! Some people came in with their two dogs. It is so lovely to see more pet friendly cafes in the neighbourhood. Good job, I wish you success in your business.",

      "text": "Fairly new place. Love the open concept and industrial look of this cafe. Lady owner offered wifi the moment we sat as the mobile network is not good. A good service touchpoint. Menu has good options. Was informed by the owner that though there‚Äôs pork in the menu, they are in the midst of phasing it out and making the cafe Muslim friendly.\nLatte was just ok. Iced lemon tea is made in-house and is refillable. Overall a nice place to chill",

I have fear in dogs with my past childhood experience. Luckily the dogs well behave and the owner take good control of them. The lady boss is friendly. And the shop decoration is comfortable and relaxing",
