Hochi,4,"Umami Pastrami & Hot Honey Chicken

Pastrami is good. For someone who don't fancy smoked salmon, this is a good alternative. I really enjoyed it. Scallion Cream Cheese goes really well together.

As for Hot Honey Chicken, I had my reservation. It was quite a messy bagel to eat and I can't really decide if I like it or not. It was just okay.

Sesame Bagels were really tough. But still okay la. Quite happy to have bagels option in this area. Perhaps the only downside was the wait. I had to wait quite a while because it was only manned by one person. However, I would go back to try the other stuff.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117825843990199250172/reviews
kevin jung,5,"Ordered ""the lox"" and hot chocolate.

The bagel on ""the lox"" was fresh, crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside.Complimented with the salmon,scallion cream cheese, crisp lettuce and tomatoes.

Hot chocolate was at just the right temperature to bring the smooth, rich and creamy flavor.

The staff are super friendly, receptive and gives outstanding service. With the accessible location right by the escalator this shop is a must visit.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112139875821101312597/reviews
Mok Shen Ting,5,"Satisfying ðŸ’¯ Highly recommend the 'All In Bagel, hot honey chicken' and oat white coffee! Ft the ideal combination of ingredients and fluffy dough, the bubbly crust also still remained chewy and crispy. Will be back!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116829125121980342820/reviews
Liang Jie,5,"Having myself tried to make a smoked salmon bagel I can safely say I should leave it to the experts at Another Bean to make a better one. The lox is some sort of a masterpiece. Get the all in bagel option to have a sophisticated mix of flavours harmonising right in your mouth. I was for a moment ratatouille tasting fireworks (YouTube ""ratatouille tasting fireworks strawberry and cheese"").

The big problem here is when paired with the iced white peach jasmine tea, the whole experience feels so good, so relaxing that going back to work after becomes even more dreadful. But perhaps one could find solace that the next experience doesn't need to be so far away.

5/5 for taste, value and service! Will be back for more life disrupting bagels soon!",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102233350351362834010/reviews
Ian Tan,5,"Great quality coffee here and perfect amount of milk - has become my go-to spot to grab coffee! Tried a bunch of the bagels as well, all of them really hit the spot. The lox and umami salami (loved the scallion cream cheese) were my favourites. As u can see, they donâ€™t skimp on the cream cheese.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112811498541748978850/reviews
