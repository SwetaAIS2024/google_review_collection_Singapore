Ryza Jake,5,"The Mee Siam had a great balance of savory, tangy, and creamy flavors with a nice zesty kick. The Lontong was packed with ingredients like soft rice cakes, tender cabbage, and crispy tahu goreng. The gravy was lighter on coconut but still flavorful, offering a healthier twist while remaining satisfying. The portion sizes were generous, making it very value for money. Looking forward to trying the Mee Rebus next time (available on Thursday iirc), which I've heard great things about.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112894342097953979837/reviews
Juwin Ho ERA,5,"Very tasty vegetarian foods.
The curry noodles was just right, not to spicy yet full of fresh veggies.
The bean curd is very fresh too.
