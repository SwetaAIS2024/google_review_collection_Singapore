Sadly, it means it loses the rawness, tussle and craziness which makes eating uniquely different in my opinion.\nFood and quality still maintain but cannot remember if there is a price increment ?!?\nFood were served hot and well flavoured.\nWe had several fried items and as my mom cannot take chilli (mild or spicy), I asked for a small dish of mayo to go with the food ordered for her…\nTo my surprise, I was told that I would have to pay for it????? Since when do I have to pay for condiments (not even in 5stars restaurants)\nI was greatly disappointed by such service… what’s next?!?\nSad that our lunch were dampen but such a petty issue…\nNot the best Tim sum and definitely not the cheapest, should I return when there are more option elsewhere?\nBoils down to details…..",
