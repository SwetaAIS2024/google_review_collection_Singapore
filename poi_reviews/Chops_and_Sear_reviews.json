Butter rice taste like chicken rice, savoury and flavourful.\n\nOne star less for the waiting time. I guess they made the order one by one, so take longer time to serve our order.",

To add insult to injury, they left my bowl on their counter & didn’t ring the buzzer\n\nIn all I waited 30 mins for a bowl of cold food. Wow, did they graduate from Gordon Ramsay’s school of Bangladesh cooking?",

Food is of very good quality, and very importantly, looks exactly like what you see in the photos. Same aesthetics, same size portions so you are not shortchanged at all unlike some other nearby western food stalls claiming to be the BEST (ahem!). Highly recommend!",
