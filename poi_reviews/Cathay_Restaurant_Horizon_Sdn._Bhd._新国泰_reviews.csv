xaxxolonch,3,"The food here was average . The price was too high for this kind of food in my opinion the noodles were great but a bit too salty. Their duck was normal nothing special, the egg wrap was too dry and the duck doesn‚Äôt taste any special. The pumpkin tofu was normal too, don‚Äôt got the taste of pumpkin just feel like plain fried tofu with sauces. Their wine lala dont got the wine taste which isn‚Äôt that good. Love their fried oat squid tho, crispy good to pair with rice. Their cod fish wasn‚Äôt that good too, the texture wasn‚Äôt great and the sauce was normal but the good side is their food wasn‚Äôt too oily. Love their eggplants too not too oily and flavourful enough.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112943480526851653374/reviews
Jacey Chin,1,"Worst cny dinner package ever.
The 1488++ cny package is probably worth only 1/3rd of the price. The presentation and taste of the dishes doesn‚Äôt match the price, and there are many repetitions of the same dish.

Non-existent service, almost cut my hand on the broken glass that they didn‚Äôt even bother to return to the kitchen. Terrible experience and is definitely not recommended!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101103339843654023857/reviews

Vincent Khoo,4,"Restaurant is open on 2nd day of CNY. There is a limited set of ala carte menu to choose from but it is good enough. Quiet and not many people so it is good for family gathering. Ordered yam ring with sweet sour pork, nyonya cuttle fish, roast skin chicken, pumpkin tofu and salt egg soft shell crab. All the dishes are quite good. Service is fast too. Good to come by occasionally for meal here.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109845981260181580873/reviews
