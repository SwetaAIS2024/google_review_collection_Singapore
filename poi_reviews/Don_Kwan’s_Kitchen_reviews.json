We even get them to cook for our family’s gathering and everyone love their cooking!\n\nI’m really surprised that the Chef is really young and able to cook such authentic dishes. His Ayam Merah reminds me of those I’ve eaten more than 30 years ago during a Malay Wedding. Really love it!\n\nTheir friendliness and service is beyond words.\n\nJust do take note that by 2pm, they are almost sold out! If you want to try their food, do drop by before 1230pm.",
