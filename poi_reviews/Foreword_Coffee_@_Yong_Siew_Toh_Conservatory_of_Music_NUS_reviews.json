That being said, the muffins taste great. The croissant was nice and crispy, but the sandwich was small and the meat was a bit tough. I can't really recommend going out of your way to get the food here, but it's a convenient, tasty, albeit pricey option if you go to YST and are in a pinch.",

Bakery is fluffy and quite to standard . And they offer rice bowl during lunch hour too !\n\nThe staff has hearing impairment however ordering made easy through a simple menu . I find the effort to customise the cafe setup to accommodate the staff is very commendable .\n\nWould definitely visit again !",

The service staff at the counter was very impatient.\n\nFood wise, the croissants were good. We ordered specialty Yuan Yang but it was so so.",
