      "text": "I am extremely happy with my decision to enroll my two daughters at Elfa School in Tampines. The principal, teachers, and staff have consistently demonstrated professionalism, understanding, and genuine care, providing unwavering support and assurance to both students and parents. This trust allows parents like us to work with peace of mind, knowing that our children‚Äôs well-being and safety are in excellent hands.\n\nElfa also stands out for its strong academic foundation, particularly in Chinese language education, which my children have grown to love. Beyond academics, the school offers a well-rounded curriculum that includes engaging activities like speech and drama, gym classes, and various enriching external courses. My kids have thoroughly enjoyed their time at Elfa, learning, growing, and creating wonderful memories.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend Elfa School to any parents seeking a nurturing and enriching preschool experience for their children.üëç",

The team of teachers there are very caring and attentive to each child and we especially appreciate the Mandarin lessons at ELFA which is very highly recommended. Also they make learning enjoyable for our kids and they get to experience different senses and even have some robotics and outdoor activities to create a wholesome learning process for children.\n\nOverall, it is the best school our older boy has been, as we changed 2 other schools to finally find this school which is best suited for him.",
