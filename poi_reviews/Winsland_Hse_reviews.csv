Flo Yeow,4,"It's an alright bus stop, but not a great bus stop. It's along Penang road, right in front of Winsland House and around some nice heritage buildings. If you're heading to, or leaving KPO, then this bus stop will be convenient for you. Otherwise, there's no reason why you'll be alighting here when Somerset is the next stop, while Dhoby Ghaut is the stop prior. No connected shelters. It works, as a bus stop though.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101597484841229205770/reviews
