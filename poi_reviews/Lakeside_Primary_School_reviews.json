However when\nmy \"friend\" accused me of something terrible and victim blamed me, the principal took the other person's side and never bothered to even ask me about my side of the story. The only person who truly cared and asked me about my story is the counselor. She made me feel that atleast someone would hear me out and that they cared about me even the tiniest bit. I truly hope this school will take their time to listen to both sides of peoples storys and handle situations like mine professionally.",
