Rymond Lim,4,"This station is a little different compared to the other LRT stations due to it splits lines for the clockwise route and anti clockwise route. You got to take which direction you are heading. If you tolls the wrong direction, not to worry as it will return you to the other side of the track once it goes a big round.",6 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112593778790688716485/reviews
"Kok Wai , Sin",5,"Nice and quiet estate with Sengkang Park, Swimming Pool at one end, Seletar Mall, hawker center and 3 different food courts around.
A few more steps land you at Jalan Kayu. But I heard one of the best prata is at Kupang Lrt, at 473 Coffee Shop. (Yes better than Jalan Kayu.)
Do note, coffeeshop closes by 9pm+",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111749165083442677661/reviews
