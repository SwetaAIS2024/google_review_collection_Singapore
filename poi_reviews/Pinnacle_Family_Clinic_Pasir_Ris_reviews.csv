Joshua Quek,5,"Good doctor, friendly staff, but damn long waiting times, at least 45mins. Clinic opened at 9am and there were already 10 people queueing. Better to
Wait outside because there are a lot of people coughing and sneezing inside.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113332133567054806611/reviews

K Jacelyn,5,First time visiting this clinic. Pleasant experience. Opens promptly at 8am and the doctor is already in the clinic when I reached at 805am. Most doctors don't arrive on time when clinic opens so I am just happy that I didn't have to spend extra time just to wait for doctor to arrive after getting a queue number. Registration was quick and smooth. My boy was seen by Dr Nicholas Yong. Very pleasant experience and he was quite detailed in checking. Will come back to this clinic again when I have to.,7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115558505114010013086/reviews
