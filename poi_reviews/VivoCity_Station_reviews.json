      "text": "Exploring the beauty of Sentosa Island via the Vivocity Monorail was a highlight of my trip to Singapore. While the queues for the monorail could be lengthy at times, the anticipation of embarking on a new adventure made the wait worthwhile. As the monorail glided across the water towards Sentosa Island, I was treated to breathtaking views of the Singapore skyline and the sparkling sea below. The journey was not just a means of transportation, but an experience in itselfâ€”a chance to marvel at the city's architectural wonders and natural beauty from a unique vantage poi, though be prepared for potentially long queues. Alternatively, consider taking the affordable SGD 1 bus from the Vivocity bus stop to Sentosa Resorts World parking area for a smoother journey.",
