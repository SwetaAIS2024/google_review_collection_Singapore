Matthew Chia,5,"Went there 2 times. Place is like very nice inside. The mall length is very long while the breath is short. When I went to find a michelin stall in the mall, I enter from the main entrance and had to walk a very long way in. The place have many shops such as restaurants. There is also a alot of unusual starcase here and there. I just feel that it was very odd. Maybe it is because of the land plot uneven ground from the beginning. I guess there are quite a lot of people who go there since it is a cbd area. Overall great place to go but a bit out of the way",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105744172257980026913/reviews
