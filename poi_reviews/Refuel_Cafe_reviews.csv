Ming Wei Lee,5,Great food with great prices that are easy on the pocket. Came on a Sunday early afternoon and they were pretty pack. Surrounding environment is quiet. Interior design is bright. Staff at friendly too. Pretty well staffed I would say. Order through the QR code and pay online or pay at the counter.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107724540457866476907/reviews
CT liaw,3,"The miso-baked salmon is a standout dish with a unique flavor. The cafe is small but well-maintained, and the staff are very helpful, especially when dealing with the strong sunset glare—be sure to request a table shift. It's a good idea to make a reservation in advance, as you may end up on a waiting list.""",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115843697549679461073/reviews
Gerry,4,"Food was delicious, ordered strawberry matcha and miso salmon.
Came in as a group of 9, but the cafe is quite small, so we had to squeeze on one of the bench seats. There's not much space to move in the cafe once it's crowded.
Felt the air con was weak, and the weather was already hot outside, so the place felt uncomfortable.
Would recommend coming in small groups and try their miso salmon.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102252147657607331047/reviews
MsOmNom,4,"Refuel Cafe in Bedok Reservoir is a small, cozy spot that feels a bit like stepping into an air conditioned container. The food is decent, and the service is okay—not particularly standout but acceptable.

Given its heartland location, this is probably the closest option you’ll find for a “fancy” breakfast and café vibes in the area. Their breakfast sets are enjoyable, but the pasta was just average.

It’s a decent choice if you’re nearby and craving a café experience without venturing too far out.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112478801214182052307/reviews
Katherine Happiest,4,"Coffee was good
Cake was not bad
Pricing is a little steep for a neighbourhood cafe

Service was ok. New staff I think. She doesn’t seem to know a lot of things but was helpful

Atmosphere wise. Tables are placed very near each other
It can get too noisy if it’s busy",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103056298337699105255/reviews
