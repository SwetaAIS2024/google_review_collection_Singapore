      "text": "I recently tried this pancake place, and I have to say, the pancakes were absolutely amazing! They were incredibly soft, fluffy, and just the way a pancake should be. Every bite was perfect, and it really lived up to my expectations.\n\nThe service was fine overall, but there was one thing that left me questioning. We were informed beforehand that the pancake preparation would take some time, which was totally understandable. However, we ended up waiting about 40 to 45 minutes, and what confused me was that a table that arrived 20 minutes after us received their pancakes first, even though we had been waiting much longer. I understand that orders might be processed differently, but I feel like first come, first served should apply. Overall just a small hiccup.\n\nDespite the wait, the pancakes were totally worth it, and the staff were polite and accommodating. I would definitely return for the delicious pancakes. Overall, it was a great experience, and I’m excited to try it again!",

We tried the Caramel Apple Pancake and the Mixed Berry French Toast, and both dishes were packed with bursting flavors. The pancakes were light and fluffy, while the caramel apple topping added the perfect amount of sweetness. The French toast, loaded with fresh berries, was absolutely delicious. The cozy ambiance and friendly staff made it even better. Definitely bringing my kids here!",

And there are wet tissues, besides paper napkins, on the table free for us to use! How delightful! We felt comfortable right away. The prices of their dishes are reasonable as they are presented beautifully as well as delicious and adequate in servings. We will definitely be back to try others.",
