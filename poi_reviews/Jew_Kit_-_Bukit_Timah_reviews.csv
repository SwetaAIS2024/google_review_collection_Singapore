jayden,4,"Chicken rice in a old school nostalgic taste and decorations. Bring you back to the olden days.
The chicken is slimy and soft, however a little bony. The chicken gizzard is chunky and nice to bite, the rice isn't that fragrance however will be perfect when you put a good decent amount of their homemade chilli and ginger on the rice.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105743541374316989018/reviews
AC Chan,5,"An unexpected discovery of this delightful fried Hokkien noodles infused with rich and sweet prawn stock as well as ample wok hei [a.k.a. breath of wok] @ a Hainanese chicken rice eatery! ü´∂üèª
We also ordered plates of their signature steamed chicken. The chicken meat was tender and moist, however the jiggly gelatin-like texture layer under the skin was lacking.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112914663109983612841/reviews
Alan Wong,5,"Visited their Rail Mall outlet which opened in Dec 2024.  Nice decor and friendly staff.  Steamed chicken is soft and tender.  Thai spicy toufu stimulates our taste buds.  Veggie dish is tasty too and not salty with the sauce all over it.

Will return again with all family members in full force to sample more dishes.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113029167219221735832/reviews
Michael TAN,2,"Famous for chicken rice. But they had other stuff to order. So tried the Beef Hor Fun with special sauce and Bee Hoon with seafood. I think next time I come here, I will stick to their chicken rice.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106408988733162382676/reviews
Dennis Yang,5,"A Hidden Gem That Deserves a Michelin Star

At first glance, I thought this was just another chicken rice joint‚Äîhumble, unassuming, and like countless others I‚Äôve visited. But the moment I took my first bite, I knew I was wrong. Completely, utterly wrong.

This isn‚Äôt just chicken rice. This is chicken rice redefined. The steamed chicken was so tender and flavorful that it felt like my taste buds were giving a standing ovation. Who knew something as simple as steamed chicken could taste this divine?

Now, let me make a confession. I don‚Äôt eat chicken feet. Ever. In fact, I have a phobia of them. But their chicken feet? Game-changing. Life-altering. Paired with the sweet and sour sauce, it was an unexpected masterpiece‚Äîone I never thought I‚Äôd find myself raving about.

Coming from a chicken rice culture, I can confidently say this is the best steamed chicken rice I‚Äôve ever had. And the sides? Impeccable. Every dish was thoughtfully prepared, down to the smallest detail.

But what really blew me away was the atmosphere‚Äîmodest, down-to-earth, and yet serving food worthy of the Michelin Guide. Honestly, if this place doesn‚Äôt get a star soon, I might just start my own food awards and crown it myself.

And just when I thought the experience couldn‚Äôt get any better, they handed out Christmas gifts. Gifts! Talk about going the extra mile. I sat there, stunned, taking a deep breath of amazement‚Äîand maybe even a moment of silence out of respect.

If you don‚Äôt make your way here, you‚Äôre robbing yourself of one of the most satisfying meals you‚Äôll ever have. Seriously. Don‚Äôt miss out.

This isn‚Äôt just a restaurant. It‚Äôs an experience.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105814866785930802352/reviews
