Forest BK,5,"🌿🌳Forest Trail is among one of the three Trails at Tampines Eco Green.
🌳🌲An easy trail that bring visitors to sample secondary forest terrain.
🌴🌿🐦‍⬛Visitors will come across swades, snags, and grasslands.
🍂🚊A tranquil hike, except for the occasional passing train.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116448453673911455728/reviews
PL Koh,5,"Good for those looking for a short light trail and jog. No cycling allowed inside this trail. There's a pond with small tortoises inside and another one further into the trail near the eco toilet. There's also a bird watching deck. Many interesting birds, chickens and lizards to see. Not advisable to come after 7pm or the sky is dark as there are no lightings inside. Took about 1 hour for a casual walk around the outer trail. It is a very casual and easy trail to walk. The unpleasant part is when the MRT train passes by which spoils the quiet ambience.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111397894233282260838/reviews
Kean Gwee,5,"The park connector is an amazing place to run. Starting from the train tracks to the overhead bridge at TPE, one loop is about 2km. Relatively safe area with many people exercising, even at 10pm. Would recommend anyone looking for a place to exercise, be it run or take a leisure walk. Tampines eco-green could get really dark at night due to the lack of street lights, so do be careful if you are planning to come at night",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114817618203831928544/reviews
