karen ho,5,"Hidden gem; My go-to Rojak place! Love the thick prawn sauce and the lightly toasted you-tiaos! Highly recommended. PS: I've already started eating halfway thus the pic, couldn't wait ;)",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105408639950163627237/reviews
Matthew Lee,4,"Popular stall, thus took awhile for my rojak to be ready. Liked that my fritters and beancurd puffs were warm, toasted and still had a slight crunch.

Good quality shrimp paste. But would prefer my shrimp paste sauce to be gooey and less diluted.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102172941439658597090/reviews
Freddy Kua,4,"The portion is big for a $5 pack. They still sell smaller portions for $3 and $4. The you tiao is quite crunchy, the way I like it. Perhaps can improve with more generous crushed peanuts.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112928888531363475275/reviews
HM Choo,5,"Oct 2022
Reasonably priced. At $3, able to get a decent plate. Can smell the aroma of the charcoal grilled cuttlefish. Not many places offers grilled fish. Moreover, it's only an addition dollar.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105253344514999420082/reviews
