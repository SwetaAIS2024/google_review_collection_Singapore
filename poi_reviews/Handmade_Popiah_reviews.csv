William Lu,5,"The popiah was fantastic—so tasty that one portion wasn’t enough! I initially ordered just one to share since there were so many other dishes I wanted to try nearby, but I instantly regretted not getting my own. The flavors were so good that I’ll definitely order more serving next time.

I also tried the Rojak, and it did not disappoint! Both dishes were flavorful and satisfying.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews
Exe Cell,4,"Short review.
Do not let the slightly higher price fool you. It is worth the cost. The chilli one is nicer if you can take abit of spicy. The rojak is good too. The yutao was heated up before mixing so its nice and warm. they also add fruits in so its worth it!",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103398833745149368830/reviews
Jiayan Xie,2,"Popiah standard has dropped a lot. Skin is thick and chewy. Fillings are loose and taste meh. The whole roll is smaller now. On the expensive side for hawker centre - 1 roll for $2.50, 2 for $4.50. I've had better at coffee shops for cheaper.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110776496018875454319/reviews
Brenda Yeong,3,"Came down to try because I saw all the good reviews but I thought this was quite average!

Crispiness is there, but the turnip is not that flavourful, and I couldn't taste the other ingredients. Same with the kueh pie tee - they also use a very fine scrambled egg here, which I think gives less texture compared to chopped hard boil egg. They also don't use prawn (as far as I could tell).",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117356602800017202835/reviews
K T,1,Had it for dinner. Skin is thick and dry. Fillings are average only.  Not nice and can give a miss.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108216393212508235795/reviews
