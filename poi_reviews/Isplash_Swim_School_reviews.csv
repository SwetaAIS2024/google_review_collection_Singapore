Hazlan 82,5,"We are incredibly grateful to iSplash Swim School for their exceptional dedication and care in coaching children with autism. Coach Alfred, the head coach, brings a wealth of experience in handling children with ASD, and his team is nothing short of amazing.

Our child, Adiy Zafran, has been under the guidance of Coach Imran, who has shown tremendous patience, understanding, and skill in building Adiyâ€™s confidence in the water. When we started, Adiy was afraid to even step into the pool. But thanks to the nurturing environment and tailored coaching, he is now a confident swimmer who genuinely enjoys his time in the water.

iSplash Swim school not only teaches swimming but also helps build self-assurance and resilience in children with special needs. Their approach is thoughtful, inclusive, and inspiring. Thank you for the remarkable experienceâ€”we couldnâ€™t have asked for a better team to support Adiyâ€™s journey.

Highly recommended!ðŸŒ¹âœ¨",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113719602864537162992/reviews
