Vernon Sim,5,"The Perfect Crispy Delight

You Tiao a.k.a Chinese Cruller or Fried Dough Stick.
A cultural significance of the Chinese cuisine which symbolizes Prosperity & Togetherness.

I was delighted by the exquisite yet nostalgic flavour of the golden-brown You Tiao from this super friendly owners.

The satisfying crunch as you bite into its exterior with an enticing texture that gives way to a fluffy and airy middle with soft doughy center that practically melts in your mouth.

This is a must-try delicacy that promises to leave a lasting impression.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101645422264755934526/reviews
