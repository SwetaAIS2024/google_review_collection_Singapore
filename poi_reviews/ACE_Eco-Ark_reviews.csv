Jonavan Lee,5,"Bought several sea bass from them & it was really fresh. Though a lil bit more expensive, their organic, healthy way of rearing the fish is worth the extra few dollars. They have shop front at Changi Sailing Club & an online store. So do support local! Did a tour of this high-tech, sustainable fish farm with the founders and it was really educational. The key green aspect of this farm is that they treat the wastewater before releasing it into the sea. So the treated wastewater that goes back into the sea is actually cleaner than the seawater! This is the first prototype & there are more of these Eco-Arks in the pipeline. They have government support & I believe their best years are yet to come!",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102582766424036554780/reviews

Emily See,5,"Visited Eco Ark last Saturday, it was an awesome experience! It will help Singapore to farm our own fish instead of being overly dependent on other countries supplies entirely.
