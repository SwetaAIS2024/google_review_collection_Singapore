      "text": "First time I am trying Kaffe & Toast anywhere in Singapore, on my wife's recommendation.  They have a nice standalone cafe at Alexandra Hospital.\n\nThe food here was surprisingly good!  Certainly nowhere near as bad as other reviews and overall rating would suggest.\n\nTheir Mee Rebus Beef Brisket & Tendon ($7.80), Singapore Laksa ($6.80), and Laksa with Grilled Chicken ($8.80) were all very flavourful.  The gravy/broth was thick too.  Grilled chicken was juicy.  I can tell that they put in a lot of effort into creating their dishes.  Portions were generous too.\n\nI would have given this place 5 stars, but deducted one star because the Laksa broth and Mee Rebus gravy were a tad too sweet for my liking.  It is a matter of personal preference.  I can imagine a person who likes sweet Laksa broth to fall in love with their dish.\n\nOverall, the entire family was pleased with this stall.",

I wonder does the staff on duty check and taste them before they sell it. Chwee Kueh also cannot make it. Shall avoid this brand in future.",

Paired with a delicious spread and a cup of expertly brewed coffee, it made for a lovely breakfast. The cozy atmosphere and friendly service were added bonuses. Highly recommend at kaffe & toast(Alexandra hospital) for a tasty and satisfying breakfast treat!",
