They use the traditional mani vegetables in the soup.\n\nNoodle bowls come in three sizes which is a great system for people with varying appetites. Also recommend getting the meal option, very good value for money.",

      "text": "Nice place to have a meal.  Plenty of options for types of noodles,  the soup base,  the dry or soup version.\n\nThere's side dishes which are nice\n\nOverall,  reasonable place to visit for meal.  Price is reasonable. However,  salt level to me is a little too high.  The branch needs to bring down the salt level in the dishes that's why I am giving 3 stars.\n\nService,  they were prompt. However I see the servers are very busy as there's no Trays or trolley for them and so they have to take the dishes or drinks one by one.",
