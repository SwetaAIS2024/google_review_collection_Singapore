D C,5,"I frequently eat here, ~3-4x per month, as the price, value, taste is all just nice. Sesame chicken, bak kut teh, and braised pork are the frequent orders. An older couple run the stall and they are quick to take orders and prepare the food, uncle is friendly. The food, and rice is always nicely consistently done. The location is in a canteen which can get hot but sitting under a fan will do the trick.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106865905860068589724/reviews
CP,5,"I think this has to one of the better if not best herbal styled Bak Kut Teh I have tried. The soup is so herbalicious and rich, and for $14 for the claypot version, there are quite a few pieces of pork ribs which is enough for 2 pax.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113861923464679544218/reviews

Valentina KYL,5,"Soup mee hoon kueh ($4.50) with clean tasting soup. Hand torn mee hoon kueh is hard to find nowadays! Plus points for tasting like homecooked food. Swapped pork for more fishballs.

Will be back to try their other noodle dishes + claypot sesame oil chicken.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110211616123519119360/reviews
