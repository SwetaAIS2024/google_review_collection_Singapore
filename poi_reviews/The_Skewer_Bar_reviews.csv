Willdy Cheng,5,"Interesting take on singaporean-ised izakaya. I recommend the skewers (lychee pork and meatball), homemade spam, ngo hiang maki.

Service was ok, but i hope the young lady server can be friendlier. Price was ok, paid $69 for 2, but ordered no alcohol.

Overall, I will come back! This place is a hidden gem.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101422661758229609520/reviews
Chris,4,"Nice place for BBQ skewers and Beer. Located in Geyland Lorong 25, parking maybe challenging during peak hours. The place is cozy and the food is nice too. Staff are also friendlyâ€¦ depending on how much food you ordered, you can spend about $30-$60 per person.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110193342752842235843/reviews
Pei Jiin Ling,5,"Heard about this place and decided to give it a try. We ordered some skewers and they're so very delicious! The look, taste and texture of the food have scored high marks! It's definitely best if paired with beer or any alcoholic drinks, just that I don't drink but even the orange juice is good to go with the skewers. Surely I will bring other friends to come!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116396967160023881762/reviews
Wendy Tey,5,"We found this place by accident. The ambient is good for hanging out with friends and loved one. Skewers are fresh and served in big portion as compared to other izakaya place. Their homemade luncheon tastes really good too. We also ordered stingray with homemade chili, we enjoyed it a lot. It was really fresh and juicy. Would definitely go back again.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108154000113957468251/reviews
