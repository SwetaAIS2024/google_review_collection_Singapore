Ruii,5,"I ordered the Chicken Bak (R1) and it was pretty good! The sauce was sourly (slightly) sweet like ketchup. I got the student meal, making the rice + chicken + mineral water (you can choose) + french fries were 7.50 dollars in total. I would say its quite worth it!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108827284964776366569/reviews
Andrew Yap,5,"Super duper Korean fried chicken! I know how frozen chickens taste like after thawing and frying. Jinjja ones uses fresh chickens hence don’t carry that distinctive “frozen” aftertaste. The pulut hitam nasi lemak is an absolute gem of a creation! Got to try, heard it’s limited time on the menu.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100245784205226858865/reviews
Keanu Lim,5,"My man, Bernard, helped us start to finish. Advised us on the best meals according to how we liked our food, helped us with our merch. And was just a generally nice person. The other staff there were great as well. The food was so nice, it came with a glove so it didn't get too messy. I wish I lived closer so I could come all the time",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108492468516839998098/reviews
Botak,4,"The bulgogi beef rice rolls were pretty tasty, but I found the chicken salad with yuzu sauce had pretty salty chicken pieces. Thank goodness for the sauce, which helped to cushion away the salt taste.

There were ample seats when I went there at 5pm on a Saturday evening, though i did a takeaway, and the male counter staff was very helpful by recommending what to eat.

I think it was a good fast food joint but not somewhere I would eat daily.

If it is any importance, they accept ""shopback"" payment, that was another reason why I ate there",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100060791396189603978/reviews
