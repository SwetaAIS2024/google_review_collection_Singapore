      "text": "Dr Pan is very patient, professional and caring. During the first visit , he did a detailed check up for me, and requested for a full spine MRI. My second visit was one week later, he reviewed the MRI result with me with great detail, and showed me the photos one by one. He took the time to explain the problems till I understood fully. It took almost 30 minutes. To my surprise, he didn’t charge a consultation fee for the review. He is really a role model to many private doctors. His staffs are also all very helpful and efficient. Strongly recommended!",

He is very patient & attentive to go through all my past medical history to ensure he did not miss out anything.\n\nHe will try his best to explain my condition & as I am suffering from SLE, there are a lot of medication for him to review.\n\nHe will listen very patiently & try to resolve my issues to avoid further medical cost I have to bear as I am seeing several doctors currently.\n\nI am very thankful to Dr Pan for his care  & kindness. He is one of the very few doctor who is genuine & all out to give his best to help me. Another side note to add on, Dr Pan is a very humorous doctor, he will try to make my consultation less stressful & relax.\n\nOnce again, thank you very much Dr Pan.",

Throughout my consultation with him (in February 2021), he very patiently listened to my concerns and very carefully and thoroughly diagnosed my headache symptoms, explained the possible causes and suggested various treatment options (including very patiently explaining the pros and cons). At the end of the consultation, I felt fully assured and at ease.\n\nHe comes across as very up-to-date, knowledgeable, humble and kind and is a brilliant example of a passionate doctor who upholds the core values of the medical profession to the highest standards. I would definitely recommend Dr Pan to my friends and family. If I could give a higher than 5-star rating, I definitely would!",
