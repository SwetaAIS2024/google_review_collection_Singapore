Sangmi Park,5,"I recently had my air conditioner cleaned, and the results were amazing! Before the cleaning, the unit was filled with dust and dirt, making it less efficient and even affecting the air quality in my home. The technician carefully opened the unit, thoroughly cleaned the filters, coils, and other internal parts, and ensured that everything was in top condition.

After the cleaning, the air conditioner looks almost new, and the airflow has improved significantly. The cooling is now much more effective, and there’s no musty smell when it’s running. I highly recommend getting your air conditioner cleaned regularly—it makes a huge difference!

If you’re looking for professional AC cleaning, this service is definitely worth it. My home feels fresher, and I can already notice the improved air quality.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103769400853908300850/reviews
