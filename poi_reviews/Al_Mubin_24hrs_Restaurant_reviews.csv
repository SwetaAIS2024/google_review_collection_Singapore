Muhammad Hafiq,4,"I always go for the Maggi goreng combo whenever I eat here. The taste is consistently good, and the portion size is satisfying for the priceâ€”always leaves me feeling full.

The fries sometimes come in different cuts (which I actually like), but I often have to wait a long time for my food, occasionally getting it only after my friends have finished theirs ðŸ¥².

The place is quite accessible, 24hrs, with nearby parking and a bus stop close by.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107992483335064360795/reviews
Vincent 17,1,"Sloppy service by the staff. Order two cups of teh and it takes quite a long while to serve. Appearing they forgot the order when there are only a few customers. Mee goreng tastes lousy, one of the worse I had...

Don't recommend people if they intend to have a good meal to come here.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105567224148110110984/reviews
Timothy Lim,5,"Friend drove down here to try their food.

Teh Tarik was sweet enough, if youâ€™re someone who does not like it too sweet, you can ask for less sugar.

Plain Uttapam came with many dips to try. I preferred the dip on the most right on the plate.

Plain Roti Prata came warm with a lightly crisp texture. Love that it came with 2 sauces to dip on.

Fried Kothu Prata was a little too much in terms of portion. I guess if youâ€™re very hungry, you can order that.

Overall, pretty solid supper spot around the area. Will come back to try other items",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109413754251040088519/reviews
Austin Seck,5,"I have been a regular of Al Mubin's for the past couple of years. They were my go-to for supper after burning midnight oil at my previous job, and I once came here for 2 months consecutively every night, until the point they had memorised and processed my order before I had even sat down. I admire their work ethic for working throughout the Ramadan months, and I commend the place for its 24/7 hours. I love the Maggi Goreng and the Bandung.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115920170132566827833/reviews
Isabelle Tay,4,"Came here for a late dinner and i ordered the maggie goreng + lamb. Taste was good and food came piping hot. Also tried their teh tarik which was not too sweet. Added the paper prata which was guilty but good & crispy! I prefer it without any sauce though.

Giving 4 stars for now and will review again once i try their prata & indian rojak!",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104140455507701408773/reviews
