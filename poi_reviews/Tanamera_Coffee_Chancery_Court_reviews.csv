Sylvia Muljadi,5,"The shop officially opens at 7:30 AM, but Teresa consistently goes above and beyond, often starting to serve customers even earlier. Her coffee is always delicious and reliably consistent. I truly appreciate her exceptional service and dedication to crafting a great cup every time. The charming outdoor seating, with its quaint tables and chairs, creates a perfect spot to relax. Grabbing coffee from here has become an essential and cherished part of my morning routine.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106812268634308978208/reviews
Evangelin Tay,5,"Coffee here is very aromatic, delicious. If you buy a value card it's a really good deal too. I have breakfast at this outlet twice a week (they sell pastries too) and always enjoy talking to Teresa, the very friendly and cheerful barista! She makes an awesome cup of mocha :) It's a great start to the morning.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113731717169195155558/reviews
