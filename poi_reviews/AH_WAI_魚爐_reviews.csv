lil tweet,5,"The chef is from Malaysia so it's a real selling point.
Block 61 hawker center on 2n floor is where you need to head to, for Ah Wai's. Every dish was delicious even though we did not order the signature fish soup in hotpot.
Go for the sambal potato leaf. It's amazing.

Note: Chef ah Wai previously operated at Clementi Block 308. Their menu now focuses on the hotpot fish soup.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100948223081899240401/reviews

Charmaine Pooh,5,"Came without much expectations but the dishes were pretty good. The curry fish was not the usual curry fish head type but it was nice with the chewy type of 青鱼. The cereal prawns balls, prawn paste chicken and garlic potato leaves were delicious as well. I like that the dishes were not overly salty or thirsty after eating. Only managed to take pictures at the end cos busy eating initially. Will go back and try other dishes !",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118212634551115746321/reviews
Patrick Lau,4,"This stall specialises in fish hotpot and we especially like the 东星斑！portions were generous and we were full without any space of the curry 青衣。Guests who take liver enjoyed this dish a lot.  Will definitely visit again the next time in this area

Note: the coffee shop is longish in shape so your table is likely to be in the corridor.  We were there at night but it was very humid and warm.  So bring your own fans and dress down to enjoy the food!",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106881591692184457438/reviews
Eleanor Lim,5,"The food was great and delicious. The price is value for money. Did CNY reunion dinner here, did not order the set meal but did ala carte dishes. Impressed with the food and presentation.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114706901538216539031/reviews
