However, the experience was way below our expectations. The atmosphere was too dark and furnishings seemed cheap looking. Storage of beer barrels was everywhere. Staff was playing darts. They couldnt really communicate well and customer service was sub par at most. After all this, we were putting all our hopes and dreams into their food. Alas, it was all such a great letdown, to the point where my my kids were also \"pushing\" me to give a rating for this place. Maybe we were too excited.....but i won't patronize this place again. If i do (i won't), probably for a jug Tiger after a hard day's work.",

The alcoholic drinks are at a great bargain (29.90 for yakult soju, or 1 pint of beer at 7.90), and the food is amazing. I visited 3 times and all these times did not disappoint. On my most recent visit, ordered the bbq food and sat outside enjoying the 90s chinese ktv songs. The best is that this place is not crowded over the weekends, so you can really sit and relax over the whole evening and comfortably chat over a few drinks. The staffs are friendly and attentive, which i must say it is a real pleasure and delight dining there! Must try!",
