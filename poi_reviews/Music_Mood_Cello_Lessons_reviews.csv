Anna Lin,5,"So happy I found Music Mood and the teacher, Jayden to start my cello journey with.

Jayden is great and resourceful. He knows the pain points for an adult picking up a new instrument and he makes this process painless and much easier than we could imagine.

For example, he offers the complementary cello rental for beginner lessons. And his curriculum is designed in a way that allows students to enjoy music and process first.

I truly enjoyed every lessons and with right amount of challenges, I can see my progression along the way.

If youâ€™re thinking about learning cello for a while, I would highly recommend Music Mood and Jayden:)",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111414847638715964298/reviews
