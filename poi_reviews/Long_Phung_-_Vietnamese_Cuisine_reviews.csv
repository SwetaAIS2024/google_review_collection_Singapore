V O,5,"Went w my sister & we ordered chicken banh mi, rare beef pho, fried spring rolls, garlic cockles & ice black coffee. Total was around $48 including 2 takeaway boxes as we couldnt finish some food, had to takeaway. Every thing was very good, even the coffee was so fragrant w notes of pandan leaves. Perhaps can skip garlic cockles to be really picky..a tad too oily & shells were hard to open, I tabao home to fry w char kway teow ðŸ˜‚",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109037678173594259988/reviews
Sarah,5,"We had the rare beef pho and the deep fried spring rolls.

Make sure to squeeze some lime juice into your soup. It brings out the flavour.

And the deep fried spring rolls. YES PLS! You wonâ€™t regret it!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112317241939798037218/reviews
WK Chew,1,"Banh Minh is average. Pho is below average, soup lack flavor. Spring roll is bland and prawn is dry and doesnâ€™t have the fresh texture.
Service is poor, food is served slow. Drinks are served slower, and that is unimaginable.

Not coming back for sure.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101522209257240586110/reviews
viking T,5,"Been here many times. They survive the covid. Anyway. There's a few Vietnamese restaurants at joo chiat Road, but this is obvious cox I can see the crowd during meal times. No way u can miss it. Parking is very convenient coz a public carpark is just beside it. The food is at affordable price & taste, very authentic. Am here to takeaway today. Just randomly take some picts from the menu for sharing. Trust me, a no regrets place for a true Vietnamese crusine.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117279516290197236406/reviews
Potato Head,5,"One of the best Pho in Singapore.
Very juice and tender beef , noodle seems slightly overcooked but still acceptable.
Soup was well balanced and not too salty.
Chicken pho was also nicely done with many juicy chicken thigh meat.
Very simple but comfortable place for casual lunch or dinner.
Staff was very friendly for customers.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113658781384736931614/reviews
