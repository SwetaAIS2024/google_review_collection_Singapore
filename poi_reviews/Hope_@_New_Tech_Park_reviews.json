      "text": "I arrived late for the congregation today, about 15 minutes after it had started. I searched for a seat in the front rows, but couldn't find one until a young lady reluctantly removed her bag to make space for me, after I had walked to the front row twice. Later, I realized she had been occupying two empty seats unnecessarily, not for her friends, but for her own bag. She even continued to put her hand on the empty seat next to me. When the pastor said, 'Turn to your neighbor to welcome them to church,' this young woman in her early 20s ignored me and treated me as if I didn't exist, turning her back on me along with those in my front and back rows who are also her friends. Unfortunately, this is not the first time I've encountered such a negative experience. Similar encounters with most of these young people in the congregation suggest they only greet and welcome those they know, not someone they don't. They don't seem open-minded or friendly, and I donâ€™t feel welcomed at all. When my young kids and I first joined this church, no one bothered to check or follow up with us on how we were doing. Extremely bad experience. :(",

      "text": "The church is exclusive. Once you have moved on to another life station, for example from students to adults, the student group leaders would not allow you to join them back for service or lifegroup cos they say this will affect their walk with Christ which is illogical. Being in a church is all about inclusivity. Did you ever see Christ excluding people just because they were tax collectors, drunkards or slaves? Christ does not exclude people. He is with them always. When I tried joining them back on one of the service day, the NYP campus leader stopped me from joining them stating that because most of the members there felt awkward bc I have already moved on and had my own lifegroup to join and that by joining them I am separating the community apart. This is very discouraging to hear and I would not recommend joining this church if you want a community that is inclusive and loving.",
