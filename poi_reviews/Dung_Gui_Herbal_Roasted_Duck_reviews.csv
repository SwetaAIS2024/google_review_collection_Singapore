Constal,5,"I think this might just be the best duck noodles (or any noodles of this kind) in SGâ€¦

Duck and sauce is similar to the kind at Dian Xiao Er, flavourful with its strong herbal taste

Main thing that stands out is the phenomenal noodle quality, extremely springy and sturdy ðŸ«¡ðŸ«¡ðŸ«¡

(+ also comes with some herbal duck soup which at least tastes better than the bland default soup at most other stores, if they even give soup)",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106579422075967413669/reviews
Jay Tham,5,"Absolutely loved the Herbal Roasted Duck Rice here! The duck was perfectly roasted with a crispy skin, and the herbal flavors were spot-on, not too overpowering but very aromatic. The rice was fluffy and absorbed the savory juices beautifully. Definitely a must-try for anyone craving a hearty and flavorful meal. Great value for money too! Will be back for more soon.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113944202748525312595/reviews
Gen Narciso,4,Hidden gem along Neil Rd. I usually get the roasted duck and char siew rice. The herbal flavour is just nice - not too overpowering. The char siew was crispy on the outside yet yet tender on the inside. The serving is generous too.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117559495147316736933/reviews
Lauren,5,"Friendly uncle and incredible herbal duck! $28 for half ðŸ¦†Char siew is also nice and caramelised.

Some other reviewers said the uncle isn't very friendly but that might be because he doesn't speak much English.  Point to what you want on the menu if you don't speak Chinese.  If you do, he didn't seem to mind us chatting to him about the history of his stall :)",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101325812420360618891/reviews
