Gerald Ang,5,"Lunch at T3 on New Year‚Äôs Day

Wasn‚Äôt crowded at time of dining.

Ordered the dishes via a paper food order chit. Whilst waiting for the dishes to be cooked and served, the drinks were served first.
Soon after the dishes were out. The hot plate black pepper beef was pretty good. I personally prefer the basil chicken and it‚Äôs a bit more spicy to my taste. The mix vegetables with mushrooms was good too. Ordered another toufu with minced chicken soup (boiling hot) to complete the meal. The soup was a pleasant surprise and even drank it to the last drop ü§ó
For dessert, the ice cream coconut was the perfect choice

Overall, an excellent place for lunch at the airport terminal 3 üëçüèº",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110313005174905579133/reviews

Yohanes Jusuf,5,"Halal. Not crowded. Most of the food has 2 serving size: small and regular. Delicious, fresh. Size of the pandan chicken is big, so make sure before order 2pcs / 6pcs.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118172856984575636982/reviews
Avani Pawar,5,"The food was absolutely delicious. I love the atmosphere and the service was pretty spot on. The sambal seafood fried rice is tasty. We ordered the Mongolian chicken too and it impressed me by how strong the pepper flavour was as the chicken was coated in a spicy peppery sauce. The seafood hotplate was also good.
Overall , it is a good restaurant to dine in. Would definitely revisit!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100568680284646570735/reviews
Simona Rawal,5,"Excellent food and wonderful service! We ordered 5 regular sized dishes: Vegetarian Pad Thai, Thai Basil Chicken, Fried Rice with Prawn and Hotplate Tofu with Eggplant and Thai Mango Salad. Portion sizes were huge so I recommend to not order multiple dishes at one go. Unlimited Lukewarm and Cold water is offered which is great!

Also a special shout out to the team for preparing our food fast as we had a flight to catch",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107644703587165318252/reviews
