Pak Soon Lau,5,A very nice garden and park for a stroll or some exercises. Great place to spend time with your family. Lots of spots for picnics and games. Many playgrounds with good facilities. There are also broadwalks that take you right over the water.,2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107524637554500568527/reviews
A V,5,"Love this place !

Ideal place for kids to play, spend their energy and sleep fast and well in the evening. After going there once, my daughter wants to go there every Sunday ðŸ˜€

We didn't do picnic in the park but we would love to for our next time here.

Then a full afternoon of play at the playground: trampoline, slide, monkey net, balancing on a wooden trunk...
There is a place at the entrance of the playground to park your bike or scooter.
There are toilets with drinking machine, a good shelter when it rains also.",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116768699501663000789/reviews
Jason Ng (FatSnowMan),5,"Beautiful place to stroll, rest, hangout and get some fresh air.  With many play grounds, activity areas and hangout spots. A few areas are quite scenic.

It's a bit big ( but not huge) so you should cycle or scoot about to enjoy it fully.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103589442545090376071/reviews
Chinthin Ng,5,"Nicer than I expected with all the displays! Feels like mid autumn festival all over again.

Can't travel overseas nevermind, can come here visit the small small world to bask in some iconic scenes from overseas!

Nice place to spend 30-60min stroll. Nicer than botanic gardens due to the spaciousness in my opinion.",4 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100535360433693499405/reviews
