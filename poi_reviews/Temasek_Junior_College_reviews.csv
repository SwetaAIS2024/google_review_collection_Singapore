ionically ironic,1,"BEFORE CONSIDERING TO APPLY FOR THIS SCHOOL PLEASE THINK TWICE.
At least for the IP side of the school, there is just mediocrity in the school system.
Firstly, most teachers in the science departments can’t teach, they just read off the notes and expect you to self learn everything, ok we get it we are IP students we are “independent learners” but we need guidance too right? If not what’s the point of being a teacher when you can’t guide and help your students understand? In all honesty the other departments are fine in teaching.
Secondly, the schools management is just horrid. Everything is done so last minute and so sudden as if there is no foresight with regards to the planning. Even for the EOY exams this year, the school has not even crafted out a proper timetable yet and are still in the midst of confirming it. (Our EOYs are in less than 2 weeks btw). Another example includes broken toilet doors (they can’t lock), general high food prices 1 small bowl of noodles is around $4 and lastly, the timetable at which where the school gives no consideration at all to students’ well being. You end literally at 5 almost everyday except on Tuesdays (on a normal weekday with CCAs).
Thirdly, the school does not care about your well being or much about your holistic growth. They literally act like they care and everything but honestly they just “help” and offer solutions and advice just for the sake of doing so where deep inside they don’t truly care.
If you treasure your sanity, please reconsider before applying for this school. Don’t make the same mistake we had made before :)",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/107806324830779951014/reviews
