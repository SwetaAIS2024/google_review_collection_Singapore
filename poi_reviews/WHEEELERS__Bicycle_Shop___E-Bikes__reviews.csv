ZephyrZepReaper,5,"Best shop ever. The prices are great, service is the best 10/10. They even gave me feedback about what happened and gave me better reviews. It was a really great experience. Those wanting to fix bicycle or come here to servicing, this is a great shop to do so. Their fixing skills are way above average and they are fuss free transaction and so as well as fast servicing. This bikeshop is a 10/10 experience at Punggol Northshore Country Club. Thanks for the best experience ever! Love ya boss ðŸ”¥",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101701081211783182947/reviews
Jason TAN,5,"To the Wheeelers Team,

Iâ€™d like to thank you for the fantastic job you did servicing our bicycles! These bikes were bought during the pandemic and had never had a proper full service until now. Your workâ€”degreasing, changing cables, and everything elseâ€”has made a noticeable difference.

The price for this service was extremely reasonable, which I really appreciate. For anyone looking for quality and affordable bicycle servicing, especially if you're in Punggol/Northshore area, I highly recommend Wheeelers

Thanks again for your great work.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104838063812826315747/reviews

Rocky Ng,5,"Surely to recommend if u need to get your bicycle fixed and detailed. Initially came for just chain replacement. however the owner, suggested for me to try on their servicing, which includes cleaning up the bicycle, tuning up the gears and ensuring brakes grips.

The bicycle came out more then what I requested for Which was very good.",3 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105406521980450272536/reviews
