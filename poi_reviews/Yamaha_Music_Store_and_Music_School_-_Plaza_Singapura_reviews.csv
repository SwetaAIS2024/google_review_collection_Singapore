Reuel Poh,5,"I recently visited Beatspot Plaza Singapura, and I couldn't be more impressed with the level of service. The staff were incredibly knowledgeable and patient, helping me choose the perfect guitar for my needs. They took the time to explain the different models and even gave me some great tips on playing and maintenance. The shop has a great selection of instruments and accessories, and the atmosphere is welcoming and friendly. I left feeling confident in my purchase and truly valued as a customer. Highly recommend this place for any musician, whether you're a beginner or a pro

Mr John service is especially impeccable, making sure I considered all factors and not just pushing for a sale. Thanks for letting me know that AC3R is the right choice.

The other staff are quick and on their feet when I have other questions as well.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117002722724199250113/reviews
Riv Friedman,1,"Horrible response, I have never seen such a bad service before.
I bought a guitar with two items and only one item arrived. We chose at the store and they were supposed to deliver it at my place.
Asked for help, they kept dragging me and didn’t do anything about it. Every time I call for help they say they will call me back and it never happens, I need to keep chasing the store calling asking to please deliver the item I have already paid for.
They chatted with me by WhatsApp and stopped answering when I said I would go back to the store to solver this.
It has been weeks and they haven’t taken care of it, I paid and didn’t receive it.
I will never buy again at Yamaha at Plaza Singapura and don’t recommend it to anyone.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106516307509864311257/reviews
Chqmpqgne Supernovq,5,"I sent my Yamaha bass guitar for its complimentary setup today. The guitar technician, Mus Malek, with his pleasant disposition, straightened my guitar’s neck, lowered the strings’ action and checked its intonation.

Although he had three other guitars that were waiting to be given attention, he kept his composure and meticulously worked on my guitar while sharing with me some useful tips on proper guitar care and  how the alternative rock genre had shaped his formative years in playing the guitar.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110425069955754884927/reviews
Maya Sarmiento,5,Muz helped me pick out my first electric guitar and recommended the THR10ii amp. I ended up getting the PAC112V Old Violin Sunburst—it looks majestic and sounds awesome with the amp. Practicing with them has been a lot of fun so far!,5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108357435855507113821/reviews
