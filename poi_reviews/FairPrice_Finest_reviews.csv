Jean,1,"Food quality is so bad. I just bought watermelon and chicken, both have gone bad!!! This is not the first time it happened. I threw away at least 5 watermelons that I bought from FP Katong V before. You need to check and improve on your storage on fresh food. This is not acceptable!",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114546799771107334165/reviews

John Tango,5,"Oh wow this visit impressed us. Haven’t been back here in ages. The layout display is so eye candy. Much nicer display than all previous years.
