Muhammad Muawiz,5,"For the the taste and location, this shop is quite reasonably priced. Used to eat here every morning eating rice+fish curry+vegetables, they served quite early but also closed quite early, they specialise in breakfast and lunch. Quite surprise got people complaining about the food, probably not people from around here maybe. Anyways keep it up guys!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109614946268667457214/reviews
Ben Yap,3,"Read the great reviews and had to try it. Parking was ample but in this rainy season can be a quite wet affair. The food is openly displayed and self-service so you pick everything yourself including the famous nasi lemak. The portion is up to you. The guy before took almost two plates worth on one plate and I was left with whatever remaining in the plastic barrel. I can imagine the health inspector screaming ""not hygienic"" as nobody washed their hands before scooping the rice or dishes. The nasi lemak was normal even with mutton cubes which were hard and dry. Maybe the deep fried chicken would be better. I had to order roti canai as I was left hanging half-full but regretted it. The roti was doughy and the dhall was bland. Even the curry sauce was tasteless. I was left wondering what I missed that was so good in the reviews. The price was reasonable and you may wish to try it for yourself. I have tasted better for the same price.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116637326438850957101/reviews
