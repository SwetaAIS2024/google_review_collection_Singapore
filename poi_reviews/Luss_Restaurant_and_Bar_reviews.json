      "text": "Had an amazing dinner with my friend at LUSS! We ordered the Hainanese chicken pasta, one of the founder‚Äôs innovative dishes. It was so good! The dish itself and the chili goes well together, and the flavors were on point too. We also had the truffle fries. It was very crispy and addictive! We kept reaching out for more and wished the portion was bigger ü§§ The last dish was muah Chee. I like that it‚Äôs not too sweet, and the texture was slightly softer, maybe because it was served hot. If you like to drink and are looking for a chill and cozy place to vibe with your friends, LUSS is the place to go. They have an extensive range of alcoholic drinks; you will definitely be spoiled for choices. The staff were friendly, attentive, and approachable. We met the lady boss as well, and she‚Äôs very friendly and pretty. Overall, we had an amazing night there and hope to be back again!",

      "text": "We went there thinking it's a cafe restaurant, based on the past reviews, but we were surprised when we arrived there on a Saturday evening. Fortunately, the menu had very good light bites and carb items. Take a look at the posted photos of the food and menu.\n\nThe interior decor is great, newly renovated to a bar restaurant, spacious. The entrance walkway is a nicely light path at night. We have to search for the entrance as the entry point to the walkway up the slope (Luss  sits at the top of a little hill slope).\n\nOverall, the food is great and the service staff are very friendly and helpful. I will come back again with my friends to have both drinks and food next time.",
