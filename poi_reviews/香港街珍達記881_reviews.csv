E diot,3,"The wok hei was evident in the fried rice that I ordered, but taste-wise a bit flat.
Would have preferred the sambal flavour to be stronger in the fried rice (since itâ€™s sambal fried rice ðŸ˜…) & real char-siu I believe would make the dish more enjoyable.
Nonetheless, would come back & try other dishes if I am in the vicinity.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117741839812159789392/reviews
Jonathan Chew,4,"The individual dishes are excellent with generous portions at a good price. We generally get horfun and fried rice for dine-in, and these are consistently good. However, the sharing portions of meat and vegetables felt rather small when we ordered for takeaway. It may be the case that they inadvertently became smaller for takeaway, but in this case the individual portions would provide better value.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106144108752002112533/reviews

Edmund Ho,5,"Surprisingly better received by family compared to other more established zichar in the area, due the less salt and oil. All else being equal, i.e. everywhere was at least a 30-minute wait on a Sunday evening, the taste and price were a good value.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110400657629395024917/reviews
