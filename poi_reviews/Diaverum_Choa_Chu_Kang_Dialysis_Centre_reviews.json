They are always attentive , calm and communicate clearly and going the extra mile to ensure patient comfort and well being.\nTheir kindness made a real difference and truly a great advocate to the patients.\nAlthough there is certain nurse that is crude and lack of awareness of noise level, E.g closing toilet door loudly",
