Yang,4,"Golden Prawn Pancake ($5.90) – Crispy, golden-brown, and served piping hot, with just the right amount of greasiness. The umami, savoury flavours complemented its crispy yet bouncy texture, making it a superb dish.

Bai Nian Yong Tau Foo ($5.90) – A hearty bowl of silky bee hoon, homemade prawn paste balls, egg tofu, white stick, gold stick, and bitter gourd in a rich, savoury soup topped with spring onions. The ingredients were bouncy and juicy, though the soup was slightly salty and high in MSG. Still, a comforting and affordable meal.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103078870952547064508/reviews

KKT,4,"Generally tasty Yong tau fu. $5.90 for basic bowl.
All ingredients tasted well. Just the prawn ball getting smaller and less prawn flesh compared to last time. Finished all the soup, a little bit thirsty after that.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110399770588752359508/reviews
L T,4,"Standard single configuration yong tau foo beehoon soup main. Makes a hearty meal. Find this particular foodcourt to be dim and mildly uncomfortable for its unusually high humidity. A little out of the way to get to, but this is a commercial building afterall and serves a regular lunch crowd. Give it a try.",9 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110349421360032776951/reviews
