CS Lee,4,"Food 3.8/5. Chicken tasted a bit bland but curry was decent. Food portion was generous for the price.
Cleanliness 3.8/5. Place is generally clean and comfortable. There is an air conditioned area.
Service 3.8/5. Staff were friendly and attentive. Ordering system needs to be updated.
Price 3/5. Breakfast promo is a good deal. Ala carte is a bit pricey as expected for restaurants.",4 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113277346120305948804/reviews
Sonya,4,"Went there on a Sunday afternoon, ordered the food at 2pm, no crowd with one-third of the place occupied. Cozy eatery with wide range of foods & drinks selection. However, food preparation was slow. My chicken murtabak was only served at 2.40pm. Took photo of all the food menu while waiting for the food. Need some patience if want to dine in here. Overall the food is nice.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108479841520073048628/reviews
Emily Tan,1,"I am a regular here since I stayed nearby but this is probably the last time I m dining here.

Ordered cheese mushroom prata and plain prata here but they give me cheese prata only. Asked them to redo for me...they do mushroom prata only so funny. Then the new auntie staff still say she asked if they can redo mushroom prata only. Mushroom prata without cheese is disgusting. She even tried to convince me that mushrooms prata itself is yummy that she likes too. Omg until I spat out and left me with no appetite. Paid 9.40 and left the place without eating much. Boss not in that's why. Not the first time they screw up orders but definitely the most disappointing experience.",8 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113255259078428851956/reviews
LP Pua,4,"A good prata place serving good prata and a lot of other food too. Today, I decided to try something new other than the usual prata order. Ordered Briyani, and it came with a huge ""mountain"" of rice, and instead of chicken on the rice,  the chicken was served in a separate bowl and was soaked with curry to the brim of the bowl. It is heavenly for curry lovers. Recommended.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113241051085659633004/reviews
Sitha Waqar,1,The chicken murtabak costs $8. However don't be shocked. Inside it has no visible pieces of chicken.Rather shredded chicken lightly thrown over the egg prata like murtabak. Service staff also angry with each other. Rather choose another place to eat. Their chapati wasn't heated up hot. Channa was nice.,10 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100418276815777062101/reviews
