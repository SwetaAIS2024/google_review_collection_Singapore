Been to many clinic, this is the first time, I'm encountering Doctor who is uncompassionate and has non-chalanant attitude. Even Tele-Doctor is better and patient to find solution and advise accordingly. Despite unable to provide me medication, he still charges me consultation fee(half price).\nDo not recommend to come here if you are sick.",
