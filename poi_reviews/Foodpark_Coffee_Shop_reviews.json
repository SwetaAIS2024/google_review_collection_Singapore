This is nearer to Hao Mart.",

The price of the fish head curry is 18-22 depending on the size of the fish head. The size of dishes are big enough for my family of 5. It will get crowded during the dinner peak hours so be there early or the wait will be around 30mins. I have seen other diners have the fish steamboat too although I have yet to try it myself. Recommend this for simple zi char dinner with family and friends. Price is reasonable. My usual dinner selections consists of fried omelette, spare ribs and hotplaye tofu. Total damage is 28.",

The pork chop is somewhat chewy. Even the fried dumpling ($4 for 8 pcs) is more wanton size rather than dumpling size.\n\nHere has other food stalls including lor Mee, Korean army beef stew etc. will try the army stew next time. Hope it doesn’t disappoint.",
