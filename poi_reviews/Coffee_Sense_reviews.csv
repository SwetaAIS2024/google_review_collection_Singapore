EL Ng,2,"Second-hand smoke pervades almost the entire place!! We were breathing smoke most of the time, despite sitting as far away as possible. When we first sat down in the non-smoking area, one of the stall attendants even sat down beside us with a lit cigarette. Fortunately, he was decent enough to move away when I requested him not to smoke there. The place indeed looks clean otherwise. Food wise, we had the economical rice and it was very normal. I’m sure the other stalls might have more interesting offerings.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109944640139439596985/reviews

Nothing is a weak link. Portions are generous at most of the stalls too. Eat everything !",3 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110339518871784486246/reviews
