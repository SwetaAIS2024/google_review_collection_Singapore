William Lu,5,"Ordered through phone for hazelnut cake and came to outlet and saw design of the week as dinosaur design and bought it. The taste was also hazelnut inside, it was good. The cake was good. Bought few others from here like bread, pastry, and other cake. All of them were good as well.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115969486686664081306/reviews

Lis Oh,2,"Extremely disappointed with this cake.
Ordered reduced sugar as my Mom is diabetic but this cake was very awful.
The sponge was dry, there was hardly any red bean and there was too much cream. Gosh. This will be my last time ordering from your bakery. 2 or 3 years back, the nutty misu cake was decent hence the 2 stars.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103346203413248325706/reviews
Jyy Jyy,5,Might be my fav pandan chiffon in Sg due to the colour and moist fluffy texture. Slightly pricey at $5.2 for small and $14 for large size. Kaya is like the ones in kaya puff.,a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105036094348602076531/reviews
Angela Lam,2,Used to like their cake but recent visit shows how dry the cake is and also the service is bad. They do have more than 3 people in the counter but they were not friendly. The cake fridge looks old with the condensation inside so not sure whether it would affect the cake and also heard someone saying why is there a fly inside the fridge so it may have flew in.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114471758313820850775/reviews
