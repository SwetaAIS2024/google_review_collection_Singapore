Not to mention the excellent service from the staff and cashier, the food was all super delicious. I even recommended it to my family members from Kulai and Mersing, and they were all impressed and will come again too. The roti canai, murtabak, tosai, and goreng-goreng were all delicious. The prices are also very reasonable. May Allah Bless this restaurant and all the staff who work there.",

Need to avoid during peak hours as waiting time is long due if you order ala carte as to o many orders by many customers. Dont matter as you just need to order your white/briyani and whack all the other food for you to take self service and eat so you dont need to wait if you dont order ala carte.. reasonable priced. Got fresh coconut, fruit juice, halal mojiito. Can tng or card payment.",
