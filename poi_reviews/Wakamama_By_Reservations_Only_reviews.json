The way each course was introduced with such passion made us feel genuinely welcomed and taken care of throughout the meal.\n\nI would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for something unique, wholesome, and meaningful. A perfect reminder that healthy food can be both exciting and absolutely delicious. Can‚Äôt wait to be back again!",

The chef‚Äôs ability to combine various vegan ingredients to create dishes with harmonious flavour is simply impressive. The ‚Äúroselle ginger apple lemon tea‚Äù is the most delicious lemon tea i have ever tried. I would highly recommend that you try their vemakase regardless of whether you are a vegan or not.",

Very enjoyable meal.\n\nThere‚Äôs only omakase menu, no a la carte. The drinks were great too - I had the black goji tea and topped up hot water a few times. The kombucha mocktail was refreshing and delicious.",
