Sparkley,1,"Review is about Mc Donald condiment change. Ever since they change the butter packaging, the quality and recipe seems to deteriorated. I won't even think of paying 50 cents extra for such poor quality tasting whipped butter.  The taste of butter is artificial and fat content reduced tremendously,  feels like ingesting synthetic butter. The look of the butter also feels weird. Overall experience affected if the butter quality do not improve.  Cost cutting is essential but not to the extend of affecting the quality so much. I doubt Mc Donald will take out reviews seriously given so many people still patronise them despite drop in standard.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111010751556455412093/reviews
J,3,"Newly renovated in Q3 2022, this McDonald’s seems understaffed. Luckily dinner service was not too crowded.

Ordered the Smoky BBQ Chicken set and the potato pops are scattered everywhere. We were also given only 2 napkins / serviettes. Wonder why they are so stingy with it.

The fries are also only lukewarm at best. Might be slow moving due to the low traffic hence they didn’t make fresh fries.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/113966954151240288230/reviews
Joshua Chew,5,"Nice and quiet Mc Donald's during off peak hours. The best place to chill and avoid the afternoon sun, can improve the quality of the fries, it's a bit soggy. Breakfast food is decent but buns could have been hotter. Table service is very quick. Cleanliness can be better tho. Also Ezlink at self ordering kiosk not working",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100928805220966571942/reviews
Gary Ng,5,"The service at Limbang outlet has improved.
It is been a while since I was last served with nicely aligned Filet-O-Fish burger. WELL DONE!

Update (28Dec2024)
Picture 2 and 3. Ugly looking burgers.  The crew needs re-training.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116808522673592406877/reviews
Paul Young,3,"Ordered at 1230. Table service. Finally collected instead at 110pm. Food really takes a bit of time. But maybe it's new and not as efficient yet. Food is the same as all other McDonald's. Seems like a bit of a power trip issue here. It happened while we were waiting for food so we were worried that our food would be overlooked. Reminded the counter staff. If in a rush, not a place to go to until they sort things out.
Beautifully designed and nice place if service can keep up.",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109729405213634414664/reviews
