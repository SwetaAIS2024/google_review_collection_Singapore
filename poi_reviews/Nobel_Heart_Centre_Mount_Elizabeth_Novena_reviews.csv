Alsony Khoo,5,"Dr Leow is one of the most exceptional doctors. His bedside manner is unbelievably warm and respectful — he listens attentively, is always patient, and exudes a calm, comforting presence. What sets him apart is not just his gentleness but also his willingness to listen patiently, and share technical insights clearly and thoroughly, without ever making you feel rushed or overwhelmed. He’s the epitome of what a great doctor should be: compassionate, competent, and genuinely kind. A true gentleman.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102277089084011813084/reviews
Koh Junelle,5,"Best doctor ever. Dr Leow is very warm, genuine and sincere. Always explain things to us patiently. He does not do unnecessary test or prescribe very strong medicine which has side effect. Both my parents see him and are extremely comfortable with him. He is like an old friend to them.

Also, kudos to the nurses who always provide excellent service and make every visit a pleasure. Thank you Dr Leow and team.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102862374484112676003/reviews
