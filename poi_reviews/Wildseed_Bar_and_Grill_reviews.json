      "text": "The place is lovely, and the atmosphere with the musicians is really enjoyable. However, it’s unfortunate that my companion’s dish was served 20 minutes before mine, which created a timing issue during the meal. Regarding the food, the pizza toppings were tasty, but the dough seemed industrial, which was disappointing. On the other hand, the meat was excellent—tender and well-cooked. Lastly, the presentation of the cocktails could be improved to enhance the overall experience.",

      "text": "My wife and I had a pleasant dining experience at Wildseed Bar & Grill. The food was delicious, and the portions were generous. We ordered the wagyu steak, wagyu burger, buffalo wings, and mushroom soup, all of which were satisfying. A nice bonus was the Sentosa Food Discovery Pass, which got us two refreshing mocktails for free.\n\nHowever, the service could be improved. It took about 30 minutes for our first dish, the mushroom soup, to arrive, which seemed quite long. When it was time to settle the bill, it was also difficult to find a waiter as most of them were busy clearing tables in the outdoor dining area.\n\nThat said, the restaurant's ambiance was beautiful, and my wife and I enjoyed taking several wefies there. Despite the minor service hiccups, we still had an enjoyable time and would consider returning.",
