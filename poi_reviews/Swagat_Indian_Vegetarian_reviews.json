      "text": "The food is scrumptious and mouth watering. They have exclusive deals such as their buffets and discounts. Their food is authentic Karnataka cuisine especially coastal Karnataka. They change their menus every Saturday and their food is fresh and hot.It is also a pure vegetarian restaurant.\nI recommend the methi parata and paneer.\nThey also do deliveries.\n\nI recommend the amazing rava masala dosa. It was heavenly and I absolutely enjoyed its pairing with madhur vada which is a flat vada that is filled with flavour. So decadent and rich absolutely divine. The vada Pav is beautifully prepared with chutney of various flavours and a melody of the potatoes as it melts into your mouth- just like in Mumbai!!\nOverall, an amazing place which I definitely recommend.",
