Service was patchy, as some of the older crew were a little tentative, but the supervisor was really good at sorting out our billing issues. Nice cafe, and would like to come back again.",

      "text": "We usually just get our bread from Cedele since it is within walking distance from where we live. The breads appear to be made more healthy and not sweet which are pluses for us. This time we had a late breakfast. The coffee was good enough. The eggs were cooked really well, the sausages were tasty, and the bread served with the meal was fantastic. The lady behind the counter was also the one who served us. While she was unsmiling and looked tired, she responded well each time we thanked her for serving our food and coffee. We definitely will go back there for our bread and for the occasional breakfast or brunch.",
