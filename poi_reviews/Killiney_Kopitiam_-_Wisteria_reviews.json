      "text": "Writing the review as a regular customer.\n\nMy 2nd worse experience here. my first bad experience is not so bad as i found staple bullet in my food. i told the kitchen to be careful as child is having that meal and they were apologetic. which i gladly accepted it as sometimes, \"accident\" happened and they apologised.\n\nHowever, my worst experience is on 14 Dec 2024. There are 3 lady crew and they cannot manage the small crowd. number system were not used and they kept shouting the number which is not clearly heard due to the noise from Kuofu, there's some loud music being played by one of the shop. what made it worse is my half boil egg is only like 10% cooked. when i show the crew, they change once for me. Upon cracking another egg, it is another 10% cooked egg but this time it was mixed with another soft boil egg. i show the crew and they ask me if it is not acceptable. the egg is clearly uncooked, as in it is not watery white but translucent. they then pass me two cracked egg which i dont know how it was handled and insist i take that when i asked for two uncracked egg. Isnt food hygiene the priority for FnB then the kitchen crew said \"actually can eat one\". i m completely stunned. Service getting worse and worse. i didnt take photo initially because i felt that it is a small issue and by letting them know, i can get an exchange and maybe they can boil that batch of eggs again to ensure it is cook more for the rest of the customers who go after me. But the attitude of two back end auntie, not the cashier, totally pissed me off and i decided to pen down this review.\n\nThe best crew there, sad to say, is the China guy who is much more capable in management.",

      "text": "Don‚Äôt ever come here to think you will have the well devised Killiney food. Even the standard menu ingredients have been replaced. The new menu which the management choose to provide is totally different in looks from the displayed menu and taste horrible for the price we paired higher than in Republic foodcourt. Simply cannot understand why you bought a franchise and you don‚Äôt even use the number system to call your customers to self-collect but choose to call my order name, expecting me to know I am the only one who ordered Assam Fish with rice (do you manage to recognise which is the dish?).   I have never seen a more shriveled string bean nor veg in a dish so-called cook fresh on the spot upon order. Totally a scam and fraudulent outlet.",

Paid for the dish but the kitchen keeps dragging and upon asking the chef did not start cooking yet (this is around 10 mins after ordering time). Got the refund with a hungry stomach. Worst service, worst place. Just pls don't go.",

      "text": "Took 7 mins to deliver 1 ice milo. Which tasted diluted and not up to the usual standards. The handle was also sticky.\nA lot of sedimentation at the bottom of the milo.\n\nFrench toast looked like it had a chunk of it missing.\n\nLuncheon meat and egg toast was underdone and still soft in some areas. Not to mention the ridiculous thinness of the luncheon meat.\n\nDisappointing considering how much was paid for the meal, and how it had been better on previous visits.\n\nStaff was also mean, having shouted things like ‚Äúhow many times i call already still never come‚Äù on multiple occasions, as well as scolding and shouting at my friend when she took the wrkng drink (which was the same drink that she had ordered, but apparently not hers), when they had never issued her a queue number to begin with, so how was she meant to know.\n\nWon‚Äôt be returning for the forseeable future.",
