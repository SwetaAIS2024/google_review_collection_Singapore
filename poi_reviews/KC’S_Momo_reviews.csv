Yanger Walling,3,"Review date: 08 June 2024
Ordered chicken and pork momo, along with Gobi Manchurian and chicken chowmein yesterday. For some reason, the Momo was sour and it had a masala flavour, something very different from what I had tasted in India among the Tibetan community. A bit disappointing though with the Momo.

Chicken chowmein and Gobi Manchurian was good and the quantity of chicken chowmein was quite large.",11 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109080997493312232833/reviews
Vishal kumar singh,1,"I ordered Chicken Lollipop, which was clearly mentioned as having 6 pieces, but upon delivery, I only received  order with 4 pieces.
I attempted to contact the restaurant via phone to address the issue, but no one responded to my calls",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117514489226099520709/reviews
