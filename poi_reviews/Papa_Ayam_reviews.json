So horrible that I have to threw away the rice. Fortunately the chicken is good to eat. Please use better quality coconut milk.",

Many variations, even up to 15 or more.. the best part of it lal, it is Halal!.... Let's dive in!\n\nFood:\nYummy is one that cant avoid.. hahaha.. it's nice meal to have, although there are no seating area dedicated for this shop.\n\nService:\nRather fast and steady flow. Staff seems to be friendly but we guess they are still adapting to the needs of the new venue.\n\nAtmosphere:\nSince OTH is already a vibrant place, it builds up on this. The whole area looks funky and bright. Hip and trendy as well yeah\n\nOverall, the place looks like a fastfood place to be at. It would be best if it was a seated restaurant type.. but it works too.",
