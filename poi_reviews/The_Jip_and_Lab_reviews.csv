Valerie Shelly,5,"When I asked May why she opened a cafe she said, ""I just want to keep doing something I love for as long as I can."" May's makes the most heart-warming, flavorful, hit-the-spot food you have ever tasted. Her kimchi fried rice and gimbap are unmatched. She also has a special dish each week so please follow her on Instagram! You can even place large orders through social media or WhatsApp.

The location is green, comfortable, and quiet. You can grab a coffee around the corner after you are done. May's smile is just as warm as her food! This is a most welcome spot in this neighborhood, please try for yourself!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110520044875094929234/reviews
