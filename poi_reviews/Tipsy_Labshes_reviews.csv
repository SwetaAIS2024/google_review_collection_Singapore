Carin Pang,5,Did my lashes with Tipsy Labshes with the new UV lash in 3D. I would say this is by far the best lashes extension I did as compared to others. There were no pain or irritation to my eyes. Lashes felt light weighted and comfortable. I feel this lash should be able to last quite long.,3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/104574583529565218052/reviews

Jasmine Lim,5,"Did my lashes before CNY and it was a good experience! Steph was very patient in answering my queries and also advising what kind of lashes would be good for me as I was not sure since it is only my third time doing lashes. Overall, nice experience and her lashes lasted even up till now, still quite full! The glue she used is also good and does not have that pricky feeling which I had from my previous lash. Definitely recommend her service!",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115469443558118494147/reviews
Valerie Tan,5,My first time at Steph's place doing my eyelash extensions. She is very meticulous and take time to understand her clients concern. Her lashes are customised to my eye shape which really open up my eyes even more. Really love how my eyes look like after her work and definitely I will go back to her again! Her place is really comfortable and I even fall asleep during the process. Highly recommended!,4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112163887993140487407/reviews
Natalie Chiok,5,"honestly, my lashes have never lasted as long as they did when i did my lashes here! she was so gentle when placing the extensions that i fell asleep TWICE üòß retention is super good and everyone has been complimenting my lashes cus she rly takes into account the way your lashes grow and how your eye looks before she decides what to do! she will even follow up with you a few weeks after your appointment so that she can change how she does your lashes to suit the way they grow etc. ü´∂üèª
