Lance Tan,4,"Quite a big variety of ingredients to choose from. I tried the laksa base and it’s not too thick or bland for pairing with the ingredients.

There are a few soup bases you can choose from like Mala, Tomyum and laksa. You can also choose your carbohydrate that include noodles, beehoon  and rice. A hearty and filling meal.",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103171518127946119222/reviews

MQ Lee,5,"One of the best yongtaufoo around. Probably the best 24-hour ytf I’ve ever had. Laksa gravy is tasty and gao. Soup is also moreish and they prepare every serving properly, packing gravy/fried items separately. Ingredients are good too.

Special shout out to the service staff (especially the one on the night shift!) they have amazing memory and are always super nice and helpful.

Great place, always happy to be back.",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106654926047879667965/reviews
