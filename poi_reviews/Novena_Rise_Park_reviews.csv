Wesley Cheong,3,"A small park definitely built more for calisthenic enthusiasts with the prominent central fitness corner and some stationary cycling equipment, and a narrow jogging path that gingerly winds itself sharply around the equipment and u-turns at the edge of the slope overlooking Balestier Hill Estate.
