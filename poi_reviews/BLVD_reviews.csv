H H,4,"Food was good enough for some bites along with drinks.
Drinks are decent. The beer has enough foam, which is good enough for a beginner level drinker like me.
Cocktail was nicely presented as well. Flavour is balanced.
The services standard is not always consistent though. Sometimes good. Sometimes the waiter or waitress just couldnâ€™t notice the hands raised at different tables.",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106121302267158407790/reviews
