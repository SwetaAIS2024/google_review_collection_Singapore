Mark Edson Gonzales,4,"The hotel was decent and the service was pretty good—staff were very polite and quick to assist with requests specially Ms. MJ. The room was clean and cozy, and the location made it easy to get around. One small downside: the bathroom didn’t have a bidet, which was kind of a letdown since I’m used to having one when checking in a hotel. It’s not a deal breaker but definitely something to consider. Other than that, everything went smoothly and it was a comfortable stay overall.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109148105234961300626/reviews
Krissy,5,"Second time here but first since the new renovations. The resort is charming and beautiful as usual. All staff are helpful and friendly. Jennifer at the Tea Room did a great job attending to us! She helped us find comfortable seats and was generous with preparing the cocktails too thank you!

Room is value for money and very comfortable. Unfortunately sky pool is under renovation during our stay this time which is a bit inconvenient since the other available pool is a few minutes walk away from our room. Overall a great place to stay at Sentosa!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111955611841968900352/reviews
Alexiaa,3,"My one-night stay at this hotel was a bit of a rollercoaster. On the one hand, the staff were genuinely friendly and helpful, which I appreciated. However, when my one-year-old child eagerly explored the room, I was horrified when she picked up an opened safety pin from the carpet. To my disbelief, we then spotted another two! It was an incredibly unsafe situation, and I was so relieved that she wasn't hurt.

We immediately went down to reception to report this, and the housekeeping team promptly went to the room. Even they were surprised by what they found – not only the safety pins but also a collection of rocks at the window area, clearly left behind by previous guests.

Honestly, I was shocked that a hotel with such a prestigious reputation could have such a significant failing in their housekeeping services.

The hotel team did offer us some snacks and apologized for the safety pins, which was a kind gesture. However, it doesn't quite erase the initial shock and concern I felt for my daughter's safety. I guess this hotel isn't very child friendly after all.

I really hope the team takes this feedback seriously and to implement stricter cleaning protocols to prevent such incidents from happening again to other guests.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115440636337733415727/reviews
Virginia Lam,5,"We had a great stay at Amara! The couple suite with direct access to the pool is spacious! Loved it! Special thanks must go to thoughtful Duty Manager Shiaz and her very welcoming team, including the friendly restaurant staff! Thanks for all your recommendations about transport etc! We couldn’t have a better time there!",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100298824831242097555/reviews
Pam Raj,5,"I recently had a wonderful staycation at Amara Sanctuary Hotel, and I must say it was one of the best experiences I've had. Out of the five hotels I've stayed in Sentosa, Amara stood out for its exceptional hospitality. The staff went above and beyond to make our stay special.

Some standout team members included Nina, who made our check-in process smooth and pleasant, even accommodating my breastfeeding needs by helping to freeze my milk. Shafiq, who consistently greeted us with a smile and provided excellent service, was also impressive. MJ from the restaurant team remembered our room number and my son's drink preference, which was a lovely touch.

The night duty manager, Shaz, was particularly impressive, handling everything from driving the buggy to addressing our concerns and even stepping in as security when needed.

Overall, the Amara team demonstrated great hospitality and professionalism. My only suggestions for improvement would be to speed up food service in the restaurant and enhance room service.

Despite these minor areas for improvement, I highly recommend Amara Hotel for a staycation. The staff truly made our stay memorable, and we're grateful for their hard work and dedication.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115102446873371069811/reviews
