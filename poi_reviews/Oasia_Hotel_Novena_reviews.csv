AoCheng Su,4,"I decided to book a room for a last-minute staycation and I’m so glad to be lucky enough to get a good room facing the city. The views are very good in the room.

I’m not a very fussy traveler so I’m quite pleased with everything.

The bed was comfortable and the temperature of the room can be set to my liking.

Tap water is also drinkable as well. So that’s convenient.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111195681381094349938/reviews
King Deepak Avinash,5,Excellent Hotel with a very hospitable staff. Location is also very convenient. There is an MRT running right from level B3. Food courts & shopping mall also 3 minutes away. We had a very blessed time. Thank U Oasis Hotel Novena looking forward for our next visit. (Special thanks to Sis.

Pratibha Alagh,4,"Had a pleasant stay at this Far East Property.

Pros: Very accessible and convenient location. The Novena MRT Station is just below the hotel; there are two malls, a food court, and a 7-Eleven (which is open 24 hours) right next to the hotel for quick needs; the hotel has good amenities, loved the club pool and hot tubs.

Cons: The room needed fixes and it overall seemed worn down. There were no blackout curtains.",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103384429648727544770/reviews
Nurliyana BMS,5,"I had a wonderful stay. The facilities were clean, comfortable, and well-maintained, and the ambiance made the experience even more relaxing.

A special mention goes to Faith, who went above and beyond to ensure I felt welcomed and well-cared for. Their attention to detail, friendliness, and professionalism truly stood out and made my stay memorable. The beautiful birthday decoration, delicious birthday cake, complimentary snacks, fruits and mini bar goodies were such thoughtful touches that made the occasion feel extra special.

I’ll definitely return and recommend this hotel to others. Thank you to the team!",4 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102250736268867103531/reviews
Vanessa,2,"The hotel itself is fine - next time I would not book a club room or breakfast.

- Breakfast is too small and hardly offers anything
- the Club Lounge only offers cocktails in the evening from 6-8 pm... where everyone is normally at dinner, the food in the evening is not sufficient
- the staff was partly unfriendly, at check in they said the room was not ready yet we had to wait and were allowed to go to the Club Lounge, after asking again the room was still not ready, since we came from the airport we were pretty knocked out.
After our eyes fell closed we were allowed to check in at once and they couldn't get rid of us fast enough - I didn't find it very friendly...
- for a club room with extra charge I expected more in the room
- we didn't want to have our room cleaned, after two days the cleaner talked us into having our room cleaned because she really wanted to get into our room, was ok but unnecessary work for her
- the room on floor 25 is very noisy
- The staff in the entire house is only busy on their mobile phones before taking care of the guests

+ MRT is directly accessible
+ soft drinks available all day in the club lounge - but usually as a tourist you are out and about all day anyway
+ shopping center within walking distance",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110213501052583716911/reviews
