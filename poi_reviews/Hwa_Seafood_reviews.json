And the fried rice with roasted pork was superb. Overall the taste of this restaurant was great and different from other stir fried regularly elsewhere.",

The two of us ordered Curry Fish Head ($32), Sambal Kangkong ($9.80), and two plates of rice ($1 each). Despite their names, the dishes were not spicy. The taste was good, and the fish was fresh. The service was quick and friendly. We enjoyed the meal and plan to return with family to try their other dishes.",
