We encountered some tough spots in the past so I ask for backup plans with backup equipment, and he was able to reassure me that he will be prepared and he knows what to do - and he delivered. Sorry if it was a bit demanding, but thanks Stevie!\nThe photos were nice, great framing and lighting; plus photobooth was nice with a lot of fun props neatly laid out. The print quality was fantastic and everyone looked so happy. And lastly, the whole team's attitude was great! üëçüèª",
