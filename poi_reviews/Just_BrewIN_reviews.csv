Jonathan A,3,"Inedible.

Social enterprise, they tried with a friendly approach, the eggs were ok, the salad was replaced without dressing as requested. The prices are reasonable like food court. But I have to score it on whether I return or recommend.

It's probably a good place to come for a coffee which are affordable.

The score is meant to represent a chance to improve and it is judged on just one dish.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116009669210022150774/reviews

Danny TJ,5,"Great ambience, friendly service and savoury food options, located at a nice quiet spot! Sampled today the prawn ü¶ê aglio olio , jbi lemon üçã brew (ice lemon tea) and milo ice cream üç® üòã Would strongly recommend it as an idyllic spot to have conversations with family and friends at a calming caf√© setup to remind us we all deserve that second chance in life. Was a treat to have a tour of ISCOS‚Äô placemaking setup in the adjoining office and community space upstairs where there were artistic paintings and beautiful clay artefacts made by ex-offenders.",7 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106548610657828421975/reviews
