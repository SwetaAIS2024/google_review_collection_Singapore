Zuriel Mamba,4,"A small place with cosy setting. Staffs were welcoming & service was prompt.

Ordered their beef hor fun which was highly praised by many. I like how the dish was loaded with wok hei. Beef slices were tender, could taste the usage of baking soda though. Hor fun was tender & blanketed with a layer of thick savoury beefy gravy. The fermented beans were infused intensely into the dish making it more aromatic. Every mouthful was such a delight.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100097027827819745483/reviews
Pete Klimek,5,"Having tried beef noodles across the island, we saw this place from the bus window and simply had to try it. What a great decision! The service was excellent, with smiling and friendly and efficient staff, while the chef was working his/her magic in the kitchen.  The seating is cozy, the ‘outdoor’ feel is cooled by ceiling fans. There is even a washroom/toilet. The food was super tasty with help-yourself chili to compliment the already fantastic tastes even further! 3 thumbs up to this establishment. We will be back…, you must visit! You WILL become a regular here! Note: this place is closed on Mondays! Always delicious, always friendly on every visit!

It’s not often that a restaurant manages to maintain its magic after relocating—but this beloved spot has not only carried its charm to its new home near Springleaf MRT, it’s elevated the experience altogether.

From the moment you step into the new closed premises, the cool embrace of air conditioning is an instant win—especially welcome after a long day or a warm walk. But it’s the familiar warmth of the staff, ever-smiling and attentive, that truly makes the difference. Service here hasn’t skipped a beat; it remains friendly, efficient, and full of heart.

And then, of course, there’s the food. Oh, the food. Still absolutely top-notch—authentic, generous, and packed with flavour in every bite. Whether you’re a returning regular or a curious first-timer, each dish delivers that same consistent excellence that earned it such loyal fans in the first place. Portions are hearty, the ingredients fresh, and every meal leaves you full and deeply satisfied.

The move has brought nothing but positives: more comfort, better accessibility, and the same unbeatable taste. If you haven’t visited the new location yet, do yourself a favour—go. It’s every bit as worth it as it ever was, if not more.",in the last week,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115651891130079828399/reviews
Na Na,1,"We visited a few times this year for the famous beef hor fan, which is pricey but tasty. Today I ordered the lotus root soup to try and found out it is ridiculously pricey. It costs $6.8 per serving with soup+two pieces of lotus root+two chicken feet+a few red dates and peanuts as showed in the plate. As the menu only indicates ‘Lotus root soup’, I decided not to ask the staff why there is no pork rib or why there are only two chicken feet, but WILL NEVER order their soup again.",6 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112783046009930673751/reviews
munchwithvienna,5,"Chance upon this restaurant. Can be quite crowded during peak period.

All the dishes were really delicious. Highly recommend trying the Beef hor fun & frog leg with porridge. They are really good!

Price is afforable! Worth trying!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/111493889212305743241/reviews
Al Lim,5,"An absolute gem discovered by accident! For the record, didn't even order their signature beef hor fun. The frog legs served in a claypot was definitely above average. The porridge of generous proportion was served in a claypot too. Both can't go without the you tiao which was slightly crispy and not too oily. And the dish that impressed us the most? The Yee fu noodles! This was 100% restaurant standard that you can hardly find in coffee shops or even zi char stalls. Love this place and will be back! Definitely trying their signature dishes the next time!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117873443534609635327/reviews
