Michael Pereira,5,"Have attended services here back when it was still at ground floor and renovation where planned for. This church that has been on the same plot of land transformed to what it is today, a beautiful modern church!

This wonderful transformation was only possible due to the tight knitted congregation that have stayed on for generations and their involvements of any kind to make this possible! Above all, God was the leader and biggest contributor working behind closed doors!üôåüèΩ",2 years ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100616420026144212895/reviews
