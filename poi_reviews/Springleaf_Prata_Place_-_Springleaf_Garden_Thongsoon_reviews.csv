Salman Al-Farisi,5,"Located just a stone's throw away from the MRT station, Springleaf Prata Place @ Springleaf is a hidden gem thatâ€™s definitely worth checking out. This was my first time dining here, and I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was. The prata was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside â€” very satisfying and fulfilling.

The variety of dishes available was impressive, and everything was served hot and fresh. The curry was decent too â€” not overly spicy, with a good balance of flavors that complemented the prata well.

The staff were friendly and the service was fast, even though the place was quite busy. Itâ€™s clear why this spot is popular with both locals and visitors.

Definitely coming back again â€” canâ€™t wait to try more items from their menu next time!",a month ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110906762679032409348/reviews
Collin Ng,3,"Honestly,  quality dropped, I think.
The gravy, nasi bryani, chicken all dropped quality since I last visited 5 years ago.
The pratas are still worth coming. So are the tariks.",a week ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100358502333657729087/reviews
Lim CY,3,"The egg prata was average, it is not very flavourful, and the dough lacked richness. The egg thosai and plain thosai were also just average. The teh tarik didnâ€™t have a strong tea flavour. The banana lassi was okay, but lacking in richness.",2 weeks ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/118412589181125876460/reviews
Arya Dhara Qi Xuan,4,"We get to dish our own curry. Take what we need. The kosong prata look really puffy and nice while my egg mozzarella was oooooo ooooo oooo yummy! With egg literally oozing out of the prata and the mozzarella cheese was a good amount of satisfaction for me... a cheese fan

Price was reasonable, the usual prata reataurant pricing (my husband was the one paying ðŸ˜… so I don't remember)

We went on Sunday 11ish... brunch time... house was full

Definitely worth considering if you are passing near... this quiet and peaceful neighbourhood",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/108787847036249094946/reviews
Travis Lim,4,"Came here for many years already, always love their crispy egg prata. a different vibe from the usual pratas. now even more convenient with the mrt station. price is average, wouldnâ€™t say cheap. now they provide self service curry and other condiments.",3 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116998621785766253627/reviews
