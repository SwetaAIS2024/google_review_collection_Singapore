Nelson Wu,1,"Tastes like frozen pizza from ntuc, cold and hard to eat. Service is problematic, lady looked like she didn't want to be there. Unpaid or what? Customers don't pay for your salary, your boss does. Please change your attitude towards everyone judging from all the newer comments here.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109664863067687777617/reviews
Chun Xiang Hao,1,"Bad experience with the lady serving who has a sulky attitude who does not open her mouth at all when I placed my order for pizza. She just type on the cashier n without saying a single thing I hv to look at the total price on the counter screen. Then after collecting the payment she just leave the receipt n the beeping counter without any words. On collecting my item again she doesn't even say thank you n when I wanted to ask for utensils, she has oredi turned away. I'm entirely confused if tis lady is the boss or a staff cos her behaviour is totally not acceptable in selling service line. The pizza I ordered is hawaian twister n it's cold inside like it's not fully baked. Pineapple is cold is ok cos it's freshly placed on top but not the pizza. Will definitely not return to GoPizza at all.",2 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100387424579532129483/reviews

Chee Siong Cheng (CS),5,"Tasty pizza and koream chicken wings.

Auntie was so nice enough to throw me a free pasta as she had my order wrong.

She is a really friendly lady and although she is working alone she is fast in preparing my order too.

Will definitely visit again to support!",a year ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101228365350322114973/reviews
