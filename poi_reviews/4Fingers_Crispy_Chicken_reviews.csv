samlivestoeat,4,"Visited this newly reopened outlet recently and tried quite a few new items that I had never tried before!
They launched the all-new Tater Tots range in Plain/ Kimchi/ Seaweed flavours, as well as Cheesy Loaded Tots just for this outlet! So addictive that I wanted to keep on munching even though I was very full!
And I didnâ€™t know they had maki! So delicious!
Also stoked to try their new Banana Choco Balls, such an indulgent treat!
Of course their wings and drumlets were as tasty as I remembered!

Effilqir Effendy,1,"I waited for my food for like 45 mins. The order screen is quite confusing. The shop is crowded because of some weird event. I donâ€™t get it why the event food must come first and not prioritise other customers???? Photographers and staff are standing so close to me, not giving me any personal space. The photographers hogging the tables too when itâ€™s peak hour. And for what? They donâ€™t even care, just want to take their photos. I feel so claustrophobic. Some of the food didnâ€™t appear on the QR code but the event got the food. Is this how you treat your customers fairly???",5 months ago,,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/106106596596369589472/reviews
