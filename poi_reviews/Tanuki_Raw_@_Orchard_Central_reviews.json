      "text": "We were looking for a place to have lunch for my wife’s birthday and wanted to try something different. While in the Orchard area, we decided on Tanuki Raw.\n\nI ordered the famous Beef & Beef Tongue Tanuki Bowl set, while my wife had the curry set. Both sets came with miso soup and salad. The beef was flavorful, though I found the slices a bit on the thin side.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere was nice, and the food was solid comfort Japanese cuisine. Free-flow tap water was available, but we also ordered a passion fruit tea, which was refreshing. A good spot for a casual meal!",

We ordered the beef don, salmon don, and curry chicken katsu, and everything was really, really good. The flavors were spot on, and each dish had its own unique appeal.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is minimalistic, yet stylish. I especially liked the bar area situated near the dining space but away from the kitchen—gave the place a nice, relaxed vibe. The staff were really friendly, which added to the pleasant experience. Plus, the restaurant has a great view, making it even more enjoyable to dine in.\n\nOne downside is that the prices are a little on the pricier side, but overall, it’s definitely worth it for the quality of food and the overall experience.",

      "text": "We walked in on a Friday evening without any reservations and the staff got us a table quickly without hesitation. The service is excellent, no complaints at all. They were very attentive, polite and thoughtful. They also engaged in some banter which was a refreshing thing to experience in local customer service.\n\nWe gave feedback that the burgers need a bit more seasoning, and this feedback they gladly took with humility and gratitude, without sounding defensive. Other than the burgers lacking some extra salt, everything else tasted very good. We also ordered burger tacos and mentaiko fries, and cocktails.\n\nThe place is cozy with enough tables and acoustics seemed ok. The restaurant is close to the mall’s public washrooms which was quite convenient.",
