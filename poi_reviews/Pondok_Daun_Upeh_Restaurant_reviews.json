Price is on the higher side so it's truly upsetting\n\nEdit: The spoilt gravy was poured on the rice making the rice inedible too",

However, the texture of the kway teow itself was a bit too mushy for my taste might be okay for some, but I prefer it with a bit more bite. The serving size was just right, so no complaints there.\nService was decent and efficient, but the coffeeshop could use some better ventilation; it was pretty warm, which might make dining in less comfortable on a hot day. Overall, decent but could be improved on texture!",
