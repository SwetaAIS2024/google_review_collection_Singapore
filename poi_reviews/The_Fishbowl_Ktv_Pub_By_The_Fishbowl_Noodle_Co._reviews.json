(i can‚Äôt do it)\n\nsecondly, take away costs you additional $0.50. bring your own takeaway lunch boxes if you want. a bowl of noodles cost $5.00 ok.\n\nthirdly, do not ever order black sauce as it is EXTREMELY SALTY. try if you dare. fishballs no taste. noodles texture okok.\n\noverall, won‚Äôt be back for this overpriced bowl of noodles.",
